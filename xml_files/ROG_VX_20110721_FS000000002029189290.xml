        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to our briefing on the half year results. As you have seen this morning, we have increased our earnings outlook for the full year to around 10%. The key driver for that is really the ongoing implementation of the operational excellence program which is proceeding faster than we originally planned. Over the next minute, I'd like to lead you through the key figures of the half year results and then focus a bit on the question of R&amp;D productivity before I hand over to my colleagues.</p>
          <p>We have seen sales, excluding Tamiflu, up by 2% in local currencies, fully on track for the full year guidance we gave you at the beginning of this year. If you correct for Tamiflu then, yeah, flat in terms of sales, Pharmaceuticals Division down 1%, excluding Tamiflu up 1%, Diagnostics up 5%. What you have seen is an enormous impact of the Swiss franc in terms of our reported results.</p>
          <p>Alan will cover currencies in much more detail. Let me just emphasize one element here very clearly and that is the vast majority of our operating cost base is outside of Switzerland, number one. And number two, our financing cost related to the Genentech acquisition in 2009 are in U.S. dollars. So, from that perspective, we have a natural hedge both on an operating level and on a non-operating level. If you combine that with the improvements in productivity from operational excellence, you see core operating profit margin up for the Group at 38% relative to sales and you see this also reflected in the cash flow which is now up at 32% relative to sales, actually also up in Swiss francs in spite of the headwinds we have in Swiss francs in reported results.</p>
          <p>And also look how this has developed over the last three years. In 2008, we were still at 22%. And as you have seen, earnings per share up by 10% for the half year and we expect the same momentum to continue for the second half, that is why we have increased our outlook for the full year to around 10%.</p>
          <p>Now let me just comment on R&amp;D. As you know, relative to our peers, we spend more in absolute terms but also relative to sales, into research and development. And this really reflects our strategy. This reflects our focus on our two core businesses, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. And we also want to maintain a leading position on the research and development side. At the same time, you can see that our marketing and distribution expenses, our administration expenses are at the very low end of the industry and if you combine the various factors, we have healthy core operating profit margins.</p>
          <p>Now, based on our strategy for innovation, based on an over-proportional investment into R&amp;D, of course we also want to have an over-proportional outcome of R&amp;D and that brings us right into the question of R&amp;D productivity and I'd just like to very high level focus on two aspects. The first one and there is no doubt in my mind and I think this is generally accepted, really the key driver for R&amp;D productivity of course is excellence in science and it's the ability to reduce attrition rates. Typically, in the industry you have attrition rates of 90%. Only four products out of hundred make it through the pipeline from phase zero to the market. These are independent outside data from 2005 to 2009 and you see historically we had an attrition rate which was twice as good as the industry. And you can immediately see one percentage point in attrition has a huge impact. Actually 1% improvement in attrition means a 10% improvement in your R&amp;D productivity. If you come from 9% to 10%, that is a 10% improvement. So, there's no doubt attrition by the nature of our industry, by the nature of the complexity of the human body at the end is the key lever to drive R&amp;D productivity and that has a lot to do with the understanding of the disease biology. We think that we are well positioned to drive R&amp;D productivity with the combination of Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics which allows us to stratify patient groups in a much more targeted way. And it has a lot to do with a rigorous decision making when you transition your projects from the early stages to the late stages along the pipeline.</p>
          <p>As you know, in 2010 we had setbacks in the late-stage pipeline and actually in 2010, we were falling back to industry average. If you look at the results in the first half year, we had seven late-stage trials reading out and seven out of the seven late-stage trials delivered positive results, and Pascal will comment on that in more detail. So that is one very important lever for R&amp;D productivity. I think this will continue to be the most important lever, excellence in science.</p>
          <p>At the very same time, efficiency is not only important in marketing or in administration or in manufacturing, it is also very important in research and development. And we have set ourselves as a management, the target to keep R&amp;D expenses at the same absolute level in spite of the expanding late-stage pipeline we enjoy as a company. And that means we have to do more with a better resource allocation. And actually we have delivered on that.</p>
          <p>If you look back into 2010, we slightly decreased our R&amp;D spend in particular in Pharma and also if you look into the half year figures, we kept R&amp;D stable, slightly decreased it for Pharma again, in spite of the ramp-up of projects which we have in the late-stage pipeline. I remind you in 2007, we had two new molecular entities in the late-stage pipeline. Now we have 12 new molecular entities in the late-stage pipeline.</p>
          <p>Here I'd like to focus on one point and that's about innovative trial design. What we want to do is we want to run our trials better, faster and cheaper. To give you an example, for a trial I think which we have set up in an innovative and better way, that's aleglitazar. When we looked at aleglitazar data in early development, we have seen that we reduced both glucose levels and lipid levels. Now traditionally, such a drug would have been established or developed as a diabetes drug. We said, no, we are positioning aleglitazar as a cardiovascular drug. We go for a clinically endpoint mortality and morbidity because we saw that not only the glucose level was going down, we also saw that all the lipid markets were going down like LDL, HDL going up, triglycerides, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And if you look now, what has happened over the recent past, I think this was a very wise decision. Just seeing how the regulatory landscape has evolved in diabetes, I'm really glad that we have positioned this drug, not as a diabetes drug, but as a cardiovascular drug, with clinically out points along mortality and morbidity. An example for &#x2013; and that will make a huge difference, that's a question of having a drug or not having a drug eventually. I'd also like to give you an example for faster drug development and I think it's a very timely one. You have seen the data for pertuzumab, which we presented last or rather the top line results, which we communicated last week with the positive results of our late-stage Phase III trials in pertuzumab in breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Now traditionally, you would develop a drug and we did this with Herceptin in the metastatic setting and then if you have positive data in the metastatic setting, that's what we did in Herceptin, then we would start moving it on into earlier lines of treatment and eventually into adjuvant treatment. Now, when we looked at pertuzumab, we said, this is just not fast enough. How can we do this in a better, more innovative way? And what we embarked on very early on was the NeoSphere trial and that was a setting in the neoadjuvant setting. That you have very short trials before you do the surgery of the tumor. And because we did this neoadjuvant trial which was a very small compared to adjuvant trials, a very small trial, our confidence level was raised so much that we said we immediately start to initiate adjuvant trials for pertuzumab.</p>
          <p>Now there are scientists that unlike with the more traditional trial design in the past where we would have developed Herceptin first in a metastatic breast cancer setting and then move it forward into adjuvant setting, now we could, in parallel, because we had increased our confidence level with this innovative neoadjuvant trial, in parallel, we could start preparing the adjuvant trial and of course, now that is a big, big advantage because now on top of it we have positive trial results from metastatic setting. And we are already underway in the adjuvant setting and that can make the difference of years actually, if you compare pertuzumab to Herceptin and of course, increases the value you will get out of those franchises without investing more money. And of course, we will work very hard to reduce the trial complexity to make really sure how many data do we really need for a late-stage trial, are there also data which we actually don't need for filing to reduce the complexity wherever we can and we also see potential doing that.</p>
          <p>And lastly, of course, there is the more traditional efficiency improvement which we have triggered very much with operational excellence in the fourth quarter last year, where we have looked very carefully, are we doing the right work at the right site? Or can we transition certain functions to cheaper places as we did, we consolidated certain trial sites, et cetera, procurement savings and so on.</p>
          <p>So, if I look forward what I'd like to emphasize that it's really this balance on the one hand of working on the productivity and at the same time of course, advancing our pipeline. And I hope that you agree that what we have done over the first half of this year is testimony exactly to this approach. We have improved our productivity. We have increased our earnings outlook for the full year and we are seeing the fruits of an expanding pipeline, namely with three filings of new molecular entities this year and Pascal will cover this in more detail.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'd like to hand over to Pascal. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Severin. Good afternoon, everybody. Really a pleasure to be here to present our half year Pharma results. This &#x2013; my presentation is relatively simple. Actually there's really two things I'd like you to remember today. One is, we are very much on track to deliver our financial goals for this year. In fact if anything, we're probably a little bit ahead which explains why we adjusted our guidance for the year. Our operational excellence plans in particular, are progressing very well. In fact we are ahead of schedule. So from a financial viewpoint, we are very much on track with what we told you we would achieve this year.</p>
          <p>The second point and it's almost the most important one, is that the pipeline is actually gaining strength very rapidly now. A year ago, standing here and trying to tell you that the future would be sunny when it was raining everywhere and we were regularly facing setbacks, was very difficult to convince you. Hopefully, we now have a little bit more data to give you more confidence that what we told you is going to happen. Over the last few months, we haven't had a single study that has read out negatively. In fact, you could go and start from late last year to this day, every single study has read out positively. So, I don't want to become too optimistic either. This is a high risk business we are in and of course, we have to expect that we have more setbacks but certainly so far so good. And some of the data that you will see later at various conferences between now and the end of the year, I'm sure will impress you quite a lot and confirm what I'm telling you now.</p>
          <p>So if I start with sales, essentially as Severin told you, we grew for the first six months by 1%, excluding Tamiflu, 2% in the U.S., minus 4% in Europe and I'd come back to this in a second, Japan minus 1% and 6% in the international region. And this was 1% for quarter one and the same for quarter two. Now if I look at it by region, first of all in the United States we grew by 2%. Before actually going to regional numbers, let me just say that this 1% compares with a market growth of about 0.7% as reported by EvaluatePharma. Decision Resources report 0.4%, EvaluatePharma 0.7% growth, IMS as you know, reports higher growth rate but IMS totally underestimates the amount of rebates that are paid out in the United States. So clearly, we are with 1% very much in line with the market growth on a global basis.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our Actemra and Lucentis are doing quite well. Of course, we were impacted negatively by Avastin in metastatic breast cancer. And as was expected, Pegasys is also negatively impacted with the warehousing of patients. This is from the United States but it's actually true in every region around the world. The good news though for Pegasys is that our market share keeps increasing. In most of the critical markets around the world, we're now above 80% market share, in some countries we are at 85% market share. And the other good news is, we have in the United States since the launch of the two PIs we have seen an uptake in &#x2013; a very rapid increase in prescriptions for Pegasys. So this is going to turn around in the next six months for sure.</p>
          <p>Europe. Europe is a difficult region right now. We've been experiencing substantial price reductions as a result of the healthcare reforms that have taken place throughout the region. We have a price reduction, a price effect of about 4% in Europe alone, so that is a pretty substantial impact. The second negative factor is of course Avastin. Even though the impact in Europe is much less than in the U.S., we still were affected to some extent. And finally, we also are facing the effect of losing patent protection on CellCept. So the combination of those effects is suddenly having a negative impact on our top line, even though several of our products like Herceptin, Mircera and very importantly, Actemra are growing very nicely.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we experienced a minus 1% decline. Avastin, Herceptin, Actemra are doing well. Having said this, we are still facing or feeling the impact of the price reductions that we experienced last year. And importantly, starting in April 2010 and importantly in the quarter too, we also had the impact of the earthquake that delayed some of the supplies to wholesalers, also impacted our ability to supply the market and we could &#x2013; it was difficult for us to drive prescriptions knowing that we could hardly supply the market.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the emerging region, the so-called international region, we grew by 6% which is a very reasonable growth rate but it is actually hiding variations around the world. But with core international here in our case is made of three sub-regions. In Asia-Pacific, we're growing very, very well. In fact, China for the first six months grew by 33%. We're also growing very well in Latin America by 13%, 14% and the issue we've been facing is more what we call Middle East, Africa and Eastern region markets. Middle East for obvious regions, you read the papers and listen, watch the TV every day, this region is certainly facing challenges and this has impacted our sales. And in the Eastern part of Europe, in particular in Russia, we've had delayed tenders and delayed supplies for some of our products. So certainly a fragmented view, fragmented results in this region. But the good news is Asia-Pacific is doing extremely well, China in particular, Latin America is doing well and in the rest of the international region, we will catch up in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>If you look at it by product, the products that are driving our goals are those that you've been used to seeing, the Herceptin, Lucentis, et cetera, and of course, the one that you don't see driving growth is Avastin. It had a pretty substantial negative impact on our top line but it is very much in line with what we told you would happen. You see growth in Japan and the international region and you see a substantial decline in the U.S. and Europe, essentially driven by breast cancer.</p>
          <p>Most of the decline here is a price reduction in Europe or alternatively, volume impacts for the breast cancer issue in particular in the United States. But we are very much on track. If you look at it here at the midpoint for the year, we are declining by $250 million. We are on track with what we told you for the full year. The second half of the year should see an improvement for Avastin. You see also here what I was mentioning a few minutes ago, Pegasys, the effect of the warehousing. Market share increasing, where the market is really decreasing rapidly so it's impacting our sales. The patent clause for CellCept. The biosimilars impact on our EPO franchise and so those are negative factors for us in the first six months.</p>
          <p>So as Severin told you a minute ago, we have certainly been very active focusing on managing our costs and I can tell you that I've spend a fair amount of time myself making sure that our operational excellence plans were implemented on time. And in fact, we were faster than we originally thought. And you see the effect of all this hard work on the P&amp;L. M&amp;D spend, commercial investment reduced by 9%, R&amp;D by 2% and the G&amp;A spend actually reduced by 11%. What you see here is an increase of 8% because the excise tax that we're paying in the United States, which really is a tax on turnover, is actually from an accounting viewpoint charged to the G&amp;A line. But essentially, a lot of work managing this cost base over the last six months which led us to a 5% increase in our operating profit.</p>
          <p>A few words on oncology products. MabThera is certainly benefiting a lot from our MetMAb's indication. I think there is certainly a lot of potential in that indication, in particular in the non-U.S. part of the world and we are certainly focusing a lot on this. Avastin, I have talked about already. And Herceptin, as you can see here, growing by 10%, single-digit growth rate in Europe and in the U.S. and high growth rate in the emerging countries and all of this is essentially due to increased HER2 testing. We have, in many countries, strong partnerships now in between the Diagnostics Division and the Pharma Division, driving the Ventana HER2 testing and this has had tremendous impact, even in developed countries like European market, where we have been able to increase the HER2 positivity rate through the introduction of the better superior Ventana test. Was it good enough for you, Dan, the superior test? Yeah, good. Okay.</p>
          <p>And Xeloda and Tarceva also growing in the first six months. Lucentis grew by 32%. So the good news here is that our patient share in our view is increasing and as you know, our biggest competitor in this segment is Avastin. So Avastin is declining and Lucentis is growing 24%. In AMD, we've seen some impact and from Avastin due to the CATT study and I would expect further impact for the rest of the year. Having said that, the one tool that you haven't been able to use yet is this John Hopkins study because it hasn't been published. It is a very powerful study but it needs to be published so we can actually leverage it fully. And certainly, it will help us manage the impact of Avastin in the AMD indication over the next few months. But certainly, a challenging indication to manage.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have DME. We'll be filing in the second half of this year and certainly, this is going to be an opportunity for Lucentis to grow over the next 12 to 18 months. Of course, we would be facing the competition of VEGF trial. Actemra, almost a 100% growth in the first half of this year. Important message for you as far as Actemra today is the rich, the wealth of data that we will actually be able to leverage over the next two years, let's say.</p>
          <p>First of all, we've launched the JIA indication. This is a small indication, very important to patients. Those kids are really in need of new solutions and Actemra is very effective there. But importantly, when a physician knows that you can give a little hug to a child, it sends them a signal of safety. And so there's a strong message here of safety because we give it to children and there's also a strong message of efficacy of Actemra because JIA is a very difficult indication.</p>
          <p>We have the ACT RAY study and when you see at the ACEA the results, the ACT RAY results, you will be impressed. We will be filing next year for DMARD IR in the United States. We will be getting the results of the head-to-head trial with &#x2013; against Humira. And finally, we'll be also filing the subcu formulation of Actemra. So a lot of news that should help us drive further growth for Actemra.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are starting to, we are preparing to launch three NMEs. Zelboraf to start with and we should certainly hear from the FDA pretty soon for this agent. Our discussions with the FDA are proceeding very well so far. So we are very hopeful that we should be able to get approval relatively soon and we are planning to get approval in Europe by the end of this year. So everybody's in full swing for the launch. Vismodegib, also we will We will file very soon and everything is proceeding very well.</p>
          <p>In fact, the discussions we've had with the European authorities have been very positive, even though, as you'll remember, this is only a Phase II study, and typically in Europe you could not file with this kind of data.  We haven't got the certainty it will be possible, but we're very hopeful we can file not only in the U.S. but also in Europe.</p>
          <p>And finally, pertuzumab and those are also data that when you see them later this year in San Antonio I'm sure you'll be impressed with.  We believe those data would enable us to file, as we were planning to, in 2011.</p>
          <p>The pipeline, I won't go through all these projects, but essentially this is supporting what I told you a bit earlier: every single study that has read out so far has been positive, and as you can see, we've had lots of studies with lots of different products, so very strong, very rich pipeline with Zelboraf, Lucentis, Avastin, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And finally in term of the news flow for the rest of this year, you will see the data, precise data for T-DM1 in comparison with Herceptin, taxane at the ESMO.  At the European Society of Respiratory Medicine, you will see the MILLY and MOLLY Phase II data for lebrikizumab.  Dalcetrapib, we had the second interim, the first, sorry, interim analysis last week, and essentially we were given the green light.  We can continue with this study.  There's no safety signal of any sort.</p>
          <p>And so this is good news, even though that was our expectation, of course.  This is certainly good news.  The next critical milestone now is the interim analysis II early 2012, which is this one, an efficacy of utility analysis.  And you will see the results of dal-VESSEL and dal-PLAQUE at the ESC in Paris in August.</p>
          <p>GA101, you will see our Phase II data at ASH in comparison to MabThera/Rituxan; the CLEOPATRA pertuzumab data I've talked about, San Antonio, and finally, the subcu data in the HANNAH study you should see the top line data next year.</p>
          <p>So net-net, as I told you in introduction, we are on track.  I think really the important message for you today is the pipeline is gaining strength constantly, and we are now getting ready to launch three NMEs in the next few months.</p>
          <p>Thank you so much, and I think, Dan, it is for you now.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Good afternoon, everybody, and well thank you, Pascal, for recognizing that it is a very exciting time at Roche right now for actually for our two divisions to be working together.</p>
          <p>We're very excited about the launch of the BRAF compound.  And of the 12 late-stage compounds that Pascal spoke about, six have companion diagnostics in all six within Roche Diagnostics.  So it's a great chance for us to collaborate, and I'm glad to see you speaking about Diagnostics. That's very good.  We need to get you more on that too. That's good.</p>
          <p>But to review the results for the first half of the year on Diagnostics. It's the world leading company in Diagnostics.  We continue to drive strong growth.  We launched 25 major new tests in the first half of this year, and seven new or significant upgraded platforms.  And you can see this is driven, to a large degree, in the first half of the year by our professional diagnostics group, and also our tissue diagnostics group, but an overall growth of 5% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Regionally we grew in all of the regions, and in particular in the first half of this year, we had good growth in North America and also in Asia Pacific.  I'm particularly happy about the North American growth because it is an area that I have spoken to you about before that we've been concentrating on now for the past couple of years to fill our portfolio gap between Europe and North America, and also really work on our commercial execution.</p>
          <p>And in fact, if you take out diabetes care, which I'll speak at the next slide about which has a decline in the United States and I'll explain the reasons why, if you looked at the rest of our businesses in North America, we're growing by 9% in the first half of this year in the largest diagnostics market in the world.  So a very strong growth in North America and also Asia Pacific with 17% growth, the E7 markets in general growing very strong for Diagnostics, and continued good growth in China as well.</p>
          <p>Breaking that down by our businesses, and I'm going to speak about some of these in more detail in future slides, professional diagnostics growing by 9%. In fact, a 14% growth in the immunoassay business.  In diabetes care, we have a 1% growth.  As I explained in the past, this is a market that is more affected by the current economic environment, and in particular, where we've launched our new products, they're doing well.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific, Japan saw very strong growth for these new products, and due to the increased regulatory hurdles in the United States, we are still awaiting our product approval in the United States which is affecting the top line growth on the global basis.  As soon as we get that approval, we'll able to take those competitive products and get them into that number one market in the United States as well.</p>
          <p>Molecular diagnostics had some very good news in the late-stage development and beginning of launches, which I'll speak about, with good growth in the molecular diagnostics business particularly in North America. In the applied science business, we had really our Tamiflu effect, which is the H1N1 virus that occurred in 2010 that is not occurring in 2011, and that really explains the 4% decline.  In the absence of the H1N1 effect, we have a flat growth there, and we're in the process now of launching some new products into our PCR-based applied science research business for the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>And then finally, tissue diagnostics, really strong growth, 16% is the market leader in tissue diagnostics continuing to drive both growth in the United States, the home market for our tissue diagnostics business, but even faster growth outside the United States as we penetrate the cancer pathology market.</p>
          <p>So on the P&amp;L line, the 5% local currency sales growth translated to a 5% overall core operating profit growth on the bottom line. We continue to be focusing on efficiencies in Diagnostics, and as I've spoken to you about in the past, we have a keen focus on our cost of sales line. And here again, we have that in check relative to our sales growth and continue to have efficiency programs to make sure that we're constantly improving efficiency in terms of product mix and in terms of our operational effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Now we have had some increased investment because of opportunities in the M&amp;D and R&amp;D side for the first half of this year.  M&amp;D, and I'll speak about why that is, we've invested significantly in launching into the HPV market in the Unites States for the approval of that product.  And in R&amp;D, we have some significant investments in our Roche tissue diagnostics as we go to the next generation of instrumentation there that will help us drive that 16% growth.</p>
          <p>I would expect as we move into the second half of the year for the M&amp;D and R&amp;D line to moderate a bit more because we had heavier investments in the first half of the year than I expect in the second half of the year.  And I expect them to become more in line with sales as we go into the second half of this year so we can continue to drive our core operating profit.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take four different key events from our businesses just to explain how our Roche strategy of testing efficiency and medical value is playing out in the marketplace.  And this is our number one business, professional diagnostics, and it's the major portion of that business, which is the serum work area business. And the reason I want to emphasize this is because Pascal always gets to show slides with 1 billion or more products on it, and I think it's important to note that if you take just the immunoassay business here, it's made up, yes, of almost 90 different assays, more than 20,000 to 30,000 instrument placements, but it is in fact 1 billion Swiss franc business that has been growing at double digit CAGR for the past ten years, just to give you an idea of the robustness and the competitive barriers of entry in this business.</p>
          <p>And you can see once again with both the introduction of our new platform, our cobas 8000 now everywhere in the world, five new immunoassays to add to those almost 100, very innovative. We've launched now our vitamin, total vitamin D assay in Europe. We launched our HPV assay on this platform, which works hand in hand with Pegasys, particularly in the emerging market to drive both our HPV assay and also the Pegasys's product in those marketplaces in the future, and several new assays that deal with oncology.</p>
          <p>And finally, if you remember in the previous results reporting, we announced the acquisition of PVT, which is another pre-analytic instrument software program to further drive our business in this area.  So a very robust business, a business that we continue to add to quarter-by-quarter, and it's one that we're quite confident with the innovation going on in immunoassay that we're in a very good position to be able to continue to have a leadership position in this business.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased to say that actually earlier than expected we received approval for our HPV assay in the United States.  In fact, it was only after eight months of review by the FDA where we expect PMAs in principle to take 18 months in the U.S. marketplace, which means we were able to launch this product early. We launched it now in May of this year when we expected to launch it more towards the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>And the ATHENA trial that supports this assay is one of the largest, in fact, the largest clinical trial ever done in Diagnostics, and it gives us a differentiating ability to penetrate what is now the largest single assay in Diagnostics in the world.  It's more than Swiss franc 250 million opportunity in the United States.</p>
          <p>And we have differentiated data.  We have similar aspects to the competition in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but what we do here is specifically identify out of the more than 100 genotypes that could potentially be present in identifying cervical cancer.  There are two HPV genotype of 16 and 18 that account for more than 70% of cervical cancer in females, which is the second leading cause of death in females, cancer death in females. And we know that if we catch it early we can prevent it.</p>
          <p>What we demonstrated with our assays and in fact we can identify one out of 10 women that have a normal Pap smear anomaly that in fact could go on to develop pre-cancer in a prospective way, and because we have the strength of this data now, we intend to take this beyond just to our lab customers. We've installed and it explains also some of the expense we've occurred in the M&amp;D line, we've installed a physician sales force in Diagnostics, which we will go to OB-GYNs in the United States with this very convincing data to drive prescription of 16 and 18 genotyping into the labs as well.</p>
          <p>So we're just beginning to roll this out now.  The sales force started calling on physicians in June, and we've gotten some very good qualitative response and we expect towards the second half of this year to see uptake of this product in the United States marketplace.</p>
          <p>We also announced actually just Tuesday of this week the signing of the intent to acquire a company called mtm, which is a company in Heidelberg, Germany.  And this is, I think, an important part of our strategy and the strength of Roche to combine two very different technologies for the benefit of one particular disease state.  Here we're talking still about cervical cancer, and we're talking about different aspects of testing for cervical cancer.</p>
          <p>So first just to explain mtm and what the value in mtm is.  It's about a 100 person company that came out of the German Red Cross that identified a particular biomarker, and has robust patent around this biomarker called p16.  And what p16 is, it's a biomarker that in the presence of persistent HPV infection in women it's over expressed in women that have then that HPV infection turn the cell to a cancerous cell.  So the identification of over expression of p16 allows us to identify those women specifically with cancer, and those that need to be referred on to additional treatment.</p>
          <p>So these two technologies work very well together.  The HPV genotyping on the one hand, a high volume, highly sensitive screening assay, which identifies those women at highest risk of developing cervical cancer, combined with now what will be a tissue diagnostic test on our Ventana Roche tissue diagnostic large installed base of instrument to take those women at risk, and identify the presence of carcinogenic cervical cancer in women in both cytology, and eventually in histology, which allows us essentially from end-to-end from cervical cancer to have a complete product offering.</p>
          <p>And I would say it's pretty impressive data that we've seen with this p16 where we see a very significant increase in the level of specificity in comparison to the Pap smear for this test, which will allow us to essentially to have end-to-end DNA testing, p16 testing in the field of cervical cancer screening and make a big difference to women around the world.</p>
          <p>So we're very excited about this.  Look for the closure of this deal and look for the ability to leverage our tissue diagnostics and molecular diagnostics business together against one cancer.</p>
          <p>Pascal already mentioned this, very exciting news as well.  In June we got FDA approval for HER2 FISH assay within the United States.  This is a product we've launched ex-U.S., and within 12 months ex-U.S. have achieved market leadership position to show you the strength of this assay. But the advantage of this assay for identifying HER2 related cancers is twofold.</p>
          <p>One from a testing efficiency standpoint it does in one day what was done in three days with the current FISH assay in the marketplace, and it can be done in a better workflow for pathologists.  Pathologists don't have to go into a dark room. They can use a bright field light microscope, and they can see these two DNA markers in the presence of morphology, which is different than what we have in our test today.</p>
          <p>But I think the most important medical value aspect of this test is that we've been able to identify HER2 patients that were missed with the test that's available today.  So it has 96% concordance to FISH, but what we've seen is in those equivocal results that by an independent group of pathologists, they've been able to identify HER2 in patients that were missed by the current standard of therapy.</p>
          <p>So very exciting because, as Pascal mentioned, it allows us to make sure that no woman is missed with breast cancer for Herceptin treatment and for some of the other HER2 treatments that we have in our pipeline as we move forward.</p>
          <p>With that, I just want to reemphasize our guidance for the year in terms of continuing to grow faster than the market, and also would like to say we're on target in terms of our major products that we intended to deliver to the marketplace so far in the half year. And very importantly, I'd like to invite you all back here to an event on September 21. It will be an event that's specifically targeted, Roche event, for diagnostic PHC, and we'll be able to have a chance to really get into our technologies in much more detail, the benefit we provide to patients and the uniqueness that Roche has in terms of being able to drive the in-vitro diagnostic marketplace.  So I hope you can all make it back here for that as well.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you very much, and it's a great pleasure to introduce, well for the first time here, Alan Hippe to the stage to present the finance results.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the handover.  And it's not the first time here. It's the first time here for Roche admittedly, and so a great pleasure.  Welcome.</p>
          <p>Great opportunity to be with Roche, and I think the results and what we have achieved and what this team has achieved is really outstanding, at least in my perception.  I have also to thank the team because really they supported me over the last three months, bringing me more into detail.  I still have issues with FISH and dish and different associations when it comes to this, and I also want to thank this team sitting here, tired faces I'm seeing, yeah because they are all bored and I kept them awake with all my questions, but okay.</p>
          <p>When I talk about achievements, here are the highlights: core EPS growth at plus 10%, and it came from both sides. On one hand from the operating profit, and you have seen that already from Severin, and the other point is the financial result and the taxes.</p>
          <p>That helped us really to provide that acceleration of core EPS growth. We have a strong operating free cash flow, 27% growth in local currency, plus 7% in Swiss francs.  So even in Swiss francs our cash flow has risen, and we have done on basis of the good cash generation early buyback of our 2013 euro bond. We bought &#x20AC;962 million back, gave us a hit of about 90 million Swiss francs, 89 million Swiss francs to be very precise here in the P&amp;L, but we realize the positive NPV, so we thought this is a good action to do.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence and productivity improvements, actions implemented and on-track and everybody knows.  I have seen quite something in my career, and I think I'm impressed.  I'm really impressed with the execution capabilities at Roche, and how this program is really realized.  So very impressive, and as said, program is well on-track and doing good.</p>
          <p>Kind of a summary. Of all the figures you have seen, and now brings that together on the group level, and Severin has talked about sales already, so I'm skipping that. Our core operating profit going up by 5% in local currency, and then you see really what happens to core net income with a plus 11%. And these are the drivers that I've mentioned already, and I will dig you a little bit into this.  And then core EPS growth that I have mentioned and to make the picture complete, the IFRS net income also growing by 10% in local currency.</p>
          <p>Where does it come from? This is kind of a summary for what has been said, especially coming from the cost side.  And you see really good things here. I think the royalties and the other operational income here is not really a major deviation that we have seen, number is roughly 800 million Swiss francs.  I think cost of sales is important to mention, especially when you look at the manufacturing costs.</p>
          <p>They were down by 2% in Pharma, went up by 5%, so in line with sales growth on the Diagnostics side.  And here certainly, operational excellence showed the first impact.</p>
          <p>M&amp;D, I think quite was an achievement, and certainly this is driven by Pharma and here the cost went down by 9%, and relatively massive head count reduction, whereby in Dia we had an increase of about 7%, and Dan elaborated about this one.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, pretty much stable, as you can see, but as said, Pharma went down by 2%, Diagnostics went up by 11%, so net we are pretty much stable and intend to keep that stable over the year.  And you see G&amp;A, well a little bit diluted by excise tax, but on purpose we brought that in here.  The G&amp;A excluding the excise tax at a minus 6%, which gave us overall the ability to drive core operating profit up by 5% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>When you look at the margins, margin at the Roche group for the group core operating profit went up to 38.1%; would have been even higher with local currencies, so I think a good achievement.  On the other hand, what you can see certainly is in our reported numbers, yeah, what the hit really is and I will show you in a second what the number would have been with a constant exchange rate based on 2010.</p>
          <p>But I think very clear for our reported numbers is a hit, but I will dig into that what the currency impact really means to us in case of cash flow in a second.  Pharma division goes up to 43.9%. Also here quite a momentum, and Diagnostics pretty much flat and we will see what the year brings.</p>
          <p>This is a chart you have seen in the past.  This is operational excellence, and in fact what's going to happen with the company and what operational excellence is all about.</p>
          <p>We took this original chart just to remind you on what was said, and look here, here is really the operational excellence savings figure. And now I would like to show you where the company stands in case of operational excellence.</p>
          <p>Because what has happened, and I start on the right-hand side, if you don't mind, because on the right-hand side you see the core operating profit for half year 2011 at a constant currency rate of 2010. And then you see the number jumps to 9.3 in comparison to the 8.3 you've seen before.  So this is let's say the starting point, and you compare that with the core operating profit at half year 2010, roughly 8.8.</p>
          <p>And we add the impact of all the austerity measures, U.S. healthcare, European measures, the Japanese price cut with a minus 400 roughly, then you see all the impact from Tamiflu, but also let's say from expiring patents, et cetera, which gave us a negative impact of a minus 724. And we have admit that in your printout it's a minus 720, so we had a slight typo in here.  That's the right number with a minus 724, and then you see the profit growth of the underlying business here with a plus 584, which I think is definitely driven, and Pascal has described that from Herceptin, Actemra, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And here comes operational excellence and the Genentech integration with a plus 950, and I think that underlines the importance of that program and how well it was executed. I think I'm not shy to say we're well on track here getting to the 1.8 in the course of this year. We have a plus 950. Operational excellence is 850, yeah, so I think we're really on track in this case.</p>
          <p>Currency, and now a little bit of an <mark type="ph" /> exclusion (50:34) concerning currency.  First of all, translation exposure, so the natural hedge through the cost base Severin has elaborated about this. I would dig a little bit more into this by giving you really by region sales and the operating costs and transaction exposures are hedged, so we have a natural hedge. And we're not going to hedge really translational risks, but transaction exposures, mainly response and receivables we do.</p>
          <p>And as you remember from the Genentech transaction, pretty much the debt was hedged into U.S. dollars, which I think was a very, very reasonable action to do because, well, it's obviously an asset which generates U.S. dollars, and you want to pay back the debt with U.S. dollars, so wisely done.</p>
          <p>Greece, well we had quite some receivables in Greece, and we converted them into a bond I think it also was a good thing to do and we sold them.  And we had a discount of 26%, but we have now the cash, so I think that's also a good thing and, well, I think I come really from a cash background. I cannot hide it.  And cash is what counts.</p>
          <p>So 36 million left here from this exposure, which I think is also quite a good achievement.  We are well aware of the fact that in Europe at least the financial crisis is not over and you could even argue about U.S. and the rest of the world.  But what we're doing really here is we are monitoring our exposure, especially in Southern Europe very, very diligently, and I think that's really one of the things on top of our list and we go through this, and I think we have the right measures in place here to do the right things.</p>
          <p>Currency exposure, and here you see, and this is what Severin has referred to at the beginning, really on one hand the sales and on the other side is the operating cost in the respective regions, in the currency that we have in these regions.  And what you see certainly is that the Swiss franc is not playing a dominating role in our business.  So it is about 2% of sales, and 17% of the total operating costs.  I think much more significant are the exposures that we're having in euro and in others.</p>
          <p>In U.S. dollar I can say, and I referred to the debt which came with Genentech to the company already, we have roughly U.S. $930 million expenses in U.S. dollar for let's say financial expenses coming basically from the debt we are having in U.S. dollar.  So even this exposure is reduced quite significantly by these costs.</p>
          <p>So in fact it's euro and it is others, and look here how others look like, so there is quite an exposure.  So volatility coming from currency is definitely something we have to live with.</p>
          <p>I think the major point for us here from a cash flow point of view, we think we're well hedged.  I think when you compare that to other companies I think that is, and I can say that I think really a good exposure to have.</p>
          <p>When we go to, here we go, how we see the impact, then you see at half year coming really from the Swiss franc an impact in sales everybody talked about it this morning of minus 12%. In the core operating profit it's a minus 15%, and in core EPS it's also a minus 14%, so quite significant.</p>
          <p>So we thought and gave it a thought should we give really clear guidance for year end, and we think that's reasonable to do and here it is.  For the full year we think when the currency rates that we have had at half year 2011 remains until year end, we will pretty much have the same impact as we have had at half year.</p>
          <p>With that, I will go to the financial results because evidently, as I said, a driver of our EPS growth at half year 2010 at 1.2 billion Swiss francs, and these are reported numbers, and now at roughly a minus 800 million Swiss francs, and you see where it comes from the reduction.</p>
          <p>It comes from the interest expenses, and certainly all the transactions which were done with the bond repurchase helped here.  You see the currency impact here net was a plus 107, and here certainly it's also disclosed in our financial statement of an impact from Venezuela where we had a huge devaluation in Venezuela and then for our business we had an appreciation of the Venezuelan currency, which accounts roughly 64 million in that number.</p>
          <p>And then you see the early bond redemptions.  And the early bond redemptions account here positively with a 55, so how is that going?  We have done another bond buyback in the first half of 2010, and that had an impact of negatively minus 144 million Swiss francs.  The transaction we have done in the first half 2011 had an impact of minus 89 million Swiss francs, and then the difference is plus 55.</p>
          <p>I think the other effects are definitely minor, and with that, let's go to the balance sheet. And well here it is, the balance sheet and what you see is the currency impact. You cannot really read a lot from our balance sheet. One thing is perhaps remarkable. When you look really here at the equity, it goes from 12% to about 20% now the equity ratio, which underlines really the capabilities and the profitability of Roche.</p>
          <p>I think what I think is we should outline is the cash generation, also cover the cash margin and well we are pretty much in the middle of the pack. You see Gilead, you see Biogen; perhaps not the best peers to compare us with because they have a lot of royalties, and by the way, also coming from Roche. So we are really here in the middle with our roughly 30%.</p>
          <p>When you look at the average, it's at 27%, excluding Biogen and Gilead, and you see the progress that we have made already and the progress was driven, and a little bit surprising at least in my opinion, from networking capital that helped us and lower investments and CapEx we have had. So let see how that works. We want to drive that further, and I think cash is really what counts at the end and that gives us a lot of financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>With that, I come to my last slide and you see the increasing profitability that we have had. The operating profit margin increased quite significantly. We deliver on the productivity improvements from a head count point of view. The head count is reduced here by 3,000 people, further 800 are notified and going to leave the company, in line with operational excellence.</p>
          <p>When you look at sites, we have done closures or divestitures, Boulder, which gave us a negative impact on kind of impairments of 117 million Swiss francs. in the first half. You have Burgdorf, you have Kulmbach, Graz and Palo Alto. Palo Alto gave us a positive gain of 64 million Swiss francs, and proceeds of roughly 200 million Swiss francs. So this really contributed also to the cash flow.</p>
          <p>The cash generation I have mentioned already, and we are committed to an attractive dividend policy, and what we brought in and I think Severin mentioned that, that we maintain at least last year's dividend in Swiss francs to share. That's what we have in our mind, so to give kind of a floor to the current currency fluctuations.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm through with my presentation. Thanks a lot for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Alan. When I listen to you, I start to forget that you're only with Roche for a couple of weeks. That's really great to see. Alan had a really good start.</p>
          <p>Before we move into the Q&amp;A session, I'd just like to share some logistics notes with you. So for the next 45 minutes or so, relax, relax. For the next 45 minutes we'll have Q&amp;A here in the primary session, and afterwards, as usual, we have two breakout sessions, one which is headed by Pascal for Pharma, the other one which is headed by Dan for Diagnostics that will then be switched in between and Alan and myself will stay here in this room.</p>
          <p>And I would also like to remind that afterwards at 4:30 we'll have an informal reception with some drinks and canap&#xE9;s so that you also have the opportunity for those who have a bit of time to meet us, the management, for some further discussions. So before we split out into the breakout rooms, let's get into the questions here for the plenum, and I see a number of hands going up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. First on your increased guidance, I'm still a bit confused but really is better because on the one side you're saying you're ahead of operational excellence, on the other side you're reiterating your 1.8 billion Swiss francs target for operational excellence. So I'm wondering whether it's something else altogether, such as strengthened R&amp;D was very low. Is that just a phasing because a lot of the Phase IIIs, the new ones, GA101, the adjuvant, pertuzumab only starting now and so maybe you pushed some cost into 2012 which is really why you're ahead. It's not that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, as far as R&amp;D is concerned, if I may just interrupt on that one. This is a firm commitment that we keep R&amp;D stable, slightly declining for Pharma for 2011 and this has nothing to do with shifting, of course. That is really the result of increasing productivity.</p>
          <p>That is really coming back to what I showed you in the very beginning in terms of how we are driving productivity. R&amp;D remains a matter of excellence in science, as I said, but it's not an area where you can't drive productivity. So this is not a simple phasing. That is true, genuine savings which we want to realize in this area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that goal of keeping it stable extends beyond 2011?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From what I can see now in the portfolio and from the development I can see, I expect this to continue. As you know, we don't give precise guidances for longer term periods, but let me answer this in qualitative terms. From all I see, and how our portfolio develops, I would expect a similar trend as we go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then since you mentioned the excellence in science, I mean I have no doubt that you probably have a lower attrition rate in oncology than anyone in the world, but I'm not &#x2013; how confident are you that you can transfer this excellence in science into the other areas outside oncology? And then I have another question on oncology specifically. It's obviously very good news to hear that you have proof of concept for GA101 versus Rituxan. Can you give us a little bit more color now that you have that now how that life cycle management is going to plan out? You have these two Phase III studies which are starting in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but they're probably not going to read out until 2015, and in order for us to get an idea when they're going to read out, can you show how much improvement you're expecting on the three year PFS you're getting with Rituxan alone?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's a tough question actually, and it's an obvious one. I think the message here for GA101 is that it remains one of our most risky projects in the portfolio. I mean the topic is a risky project, GA101 is a risky project. This is very clear. Having said that, what we saw in Phase II was sufficient to justify moving into Phase III with those two Phase III studies you mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now the team, the lifecycle team is preparing a plan what we call a lifecycle plan internally that they will then present to LSBC, a strategy portfolio committee, to actually expand this program. I can't tell you exactly how, when and what studies we will &#x2013; how we proceed here, but we will expand the program. The question is that remains a risky project I think you should...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. The first question is for Mr. Hippe. What are your initial thoughts regarding the pharma industry, especially regarding the challenges the industry is facing currently in terms of patent expiries are in productivity, and more generally, what can be improved in your view? The second question is regarding the Operational Excellence program. You say that you think you are ahead of the schedule. What is really ahead of the schedule? And what is maybe tougher than initially anticipated? And the last question is on Avastin in breast cancer in Europe. Are there any relief in your view due to thanks to the labeling with Xeloda? And what can we expect here and is there any impact from the U.S. situation?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Alan you want to start off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Fine. No problem. I think my initial thought about the pharma industry. First of all, it was a very conscious decision to come to the pharma industry, so I asked myself beforehand, how is that going? And certainly I see the challenges in the pharma industry with the price pressure coming up. On the other hand, I think Severin talked about it, productivity is something we have to look into and where perhaps the industry can make progress. So I think the great opportunity is to combine innovation, and clearly an innovation-focused strategy with some kind of productivity. And I think that is something which I think is very interesting. Furthermore, I think an industry which has a high degree of regulation and has a relatively consolidated structure then we can't discuss what consolidated then really means, but I think all the businesses that I've seen so far have been very, very robust businesses to my experience. And I think that was something which definitely is and will be intriguing for me.</p>
          <p>And let me say one thing very clear: I think that Roche is very well positioned here because when you mentioned patent expiries. I think compare ourselves with other companies. I think we are here in a very, very comfortable situation, and we will see how that biosimilar thing plays out, but I think really I have a very positive impression, especially when it comes to Roche because there will be winners and losers in this industry. Improvements, I have to say, well, it is not like that I think there is, how should I say. I got the question this morning. Is this a restructuring case? Not at all. I think this company is a world-class company, and operates on a world-class level and there are always things we can improve, no doubt about that, and we work on this. But is it like that this is something which is easily done, very low hanging fruit? I think it is quite a challenge for us and we will face it together, and we had good discussions about productivity and we will go on and we will find things and we'll get better. But it is not like something disruptive comes to my mind. I think it's an evolutionary process that we face.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alan. On operational excellence, Pascal, you want to comment on that why we are ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How it is going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we had actually on many fronts, essentially the restructuring of the commercial organization went faster. It very quickly in the United States, but you would expect that. But it went also fast in Europe. Of course, in Europe we tend to be slower because we have to negotiate with unions country-by-country, and we of course had in some cases challenging discussions because people always challenge the need to restructure when you have the kind of profitability that we showed you. But we moved actually relatively quickly. So the reorganization of the commercial organization we did quickly.</p>
          <p>I think in development we've made a tremendous progress also. There's still an enormous amount of work to do that we plan to do over the next two years, sort of reinventing the way we do clinical trials and the way we do development. We have made enormous progress already. The dal-OUTCOMES 2 study, dalcetrapib, the second study, the dal-OUTCOMES 2 study, we spent, believe me, a lot of time looking at how can we do it cheaper than the first one. And our cost per patient is reduced by more than 50% compared to dal-OUTCOMES 1. So don't try <mark type="ph" /> to done (1:08:35) assume we can reduce our development cost by 50%, but it's an example of where we suddenly have been able to reduce cost substantially.</p>
          <p>In other cases, the cost is still pretty high, but we're also managing the portfolio, prioritizing. Development we've done well. In manufacturing we've done well. We've had a couple of hiccups. You probably read that the Florence site on the East Coast that we plan, we are planning to divest, to sell. We're not able to do this because the market is not very supportive to divest manufacturing, small molecule manufacturing plants. So the offers we got were really not sustainable. We thought that on top of it we thought we need to give ourselves a little bit more time to plan on manufacturing requirements for the next two to three years, especially knowing what we will need for dalcetrapib.</p>
          <p>So we gave ourselves another few months to know more about dalcetrapib, and therefore what we need. So manufacturing we had a couple of hiccups, but I would say overall we've done quite well, and maybe I can probably Avastin one since the Avastin Europe breast cancer. We lost, as you know, we lost the Taxotere part of the label and in some countries like France, for instance, the switch to paclitaxel, Taxol was very, very fast. In other countries it takes a little bit more time. So we are in the process of shifting the core prescription of Avastin to Taxol, and then we now have <mark type="ph" /> zero (1:10:18) on top of the label, which is a recent event, and of course will drive growth. So I have to say I think with Avastin we've kind of hit the bottom, and we are kind of starting to level off and we start growing, we should start growing again over the next few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just an additional comment on Avastin. You know that the really sharp decline of Avastin happened in the fourth quarter last year. So what we expect to see is a continued decline into the third quarter, but this should then level off substantially into the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Good. We had another question. Sachin, yes. Can we have the mic here in the second row?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. A few questions. Firstly, just to follow up on GA101. I wondered if you can provide some color on what efficacy benefit relative to Rituxan you think, A, would be clinically relevant from a physician feedback perspective? And, B, necessary to protect you against cheaper priced potential buy similar to Rituxan? Secondly on dalcetrapib, wondered if you're willing to give some color on the next efficacy interim analysis, just some color on both from a positive and negative perspective what would drive that stop relative to the 15% relative <mark type="ph" /> risk (1:11:41) reduction and the primary endpoint I think is power of 4. A follow-on on dalcetrapib.  You talked about pertuzumab progressing in broader indications very quickly. I appreciate that dalcetrapib is very high risk, but at what stage do you get comfortable to move beyond the existing high risk and potentially narrower ACS patient pool? When would you start thinking about a broader patient pool in your existing trial? And then just very quickly on the tax rate, how sustainable is the first half tax rate? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pascal, GA101?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. GA101, essentially what we are looking for is a 30% improvement; very, very minimum, but we &#x2013; that's our target, let's say, but if you achieve let's say 15%, you would still have a viable product. The problem is reimbursement. The question is you have two stages. One is to get approval; two is to get reimbursement in an environment where we'll be dealing with biosimilars.</p>
          <p>So if you look at it from a regulatory point of view, I would say 10% to 15%, I mean 10% would be at the low end, but 15% would still &#x2013; would be okay. But if we really want to replace MabThera, we need more than that. There's no question from a payer viewpoint. And then the answer would depend country by country. In the United States as the market is today, we can certainly &#x2013; we would do very well with a 15% improvement. In some markets in Europe it would be much more challenging from a reimbursement viewpoint. So...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Dalcetrapib I wasn't too sure. I missed the part of your question, Sachin, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are two parts. One, any color on the efficacy component of your next interim analysis, any idea of the relative risk reduction that would, I can see Karl shaking his head, that would stop or &#x2013; that would stop that study either direction post of a negative relative to the primary endpoint power of 15% relative risk? And then the second question was Severin talked about starting pertuzumab in adjuvant for metastatic very early. At what point do you get comfortable enough with the dalcetrapib profile, appreciating it is very high risk to take it beyond the existing ACS patient pool?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the dal-OUTCOMES 2 study is already expanding the patient population.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually, sorry again, I was talking about that study, and we may not have talked much about it, but we're preparing for a second study in the dal-OUTCOMES 2 study and that would expand the patient population beyond ACS when we launch it. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're preparing for that, but the study has not yet started. So that's where we stand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is the study I was referring to before where we would basically reduce the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And on...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we haven't decided to go forward. We are just preparing, and if we launch it, then essentially we are ready to do it at a much lower cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As far as the interim data are concerned, of course we know as much as you know. We will &#x2013; it's event driven, so as soon as the events come through, we will see what the decides are. The readout, the planned readout is for end of 2012, for December 2012. So that's the target date. Good. There was a third question on the tax rate, Alan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think you know how it is with taxes. It depends very much in which region. We have very successful and not so successful, so let's see. I think it cannot be more than just an indication, but I think it should be around the number or the percentage rate that you've seen at half year. But we have certain fluctuations, and that's how it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So let's move up here, perhaps here in the third row and then I'll start from the back forward again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack Scannell, Sanford Bernstein. Two questions on the R&amp;D productivity point. I think the first one is lots of us would love to believe that basic science and improvements in basic science reduces attrition and makes drug discovery more effective and efficient. The trouble is history shows that isn't true. The probability that a small molecule is approved once it enters human trials is stay constant for about 60 years, despite massive advances in basic science.</p>
          <p>Returns on R&amp;D investment have declined over the last 60 year despite massive investments in basic science. Now given that, why should investors believe that improvements in basic science from here are going to turn that around? That's the first question. And the second question is if one spends about 8 billion Swiss francs a year roughly, roughly on R&amp;D for the next few years and for the last &#x2013; and for the previous few years, that should be generating profits and revenue sometime in the future. So given a run rate of around 8 billion Swiss francs now roughly, roughly what incremental revenue and profit should one see around 2020, '21, '22 to just &#x2013; to show a decent return on that investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your more general question, when I talk about excellence in science, I am not talking about basic research. We are not a public institution which sponsors basic research. It is true that societies are putting literally billions, if not trillions if you look at it over the longer period, into basic science. We are not in this business. So the money we spend into R&amp;D is not basic science. If I talk about excellence in science then I'm talking about translating the increasing knowledge we have about diseases, about the molecular biology of diseases, into drugs. We are not in basic science to make this very clear, number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, you are absolutely right, and that is a fact that the productivity, the R&amp;D productivity in the industry has massively declined over the last decades. We have this span of constant output, if you like, of about 20 to 25 new molecular entities per year if you look at it on a long-term basis, and it's true that the R&amp;D costs have almost risen exponentially in the '90s and in the last decade. So the industry as a whole, the productivity of the industry as a whole, has come down. I can tell you that for our strategic reviews what we did.</p>
          <p>When we looked into this topic of R&amp;D productivity, we looked not only at what has happened with the industry as a whole, we looked what has been the differences between the different players. And I can tell you that there is a huge difference, there is a huge difference between the different players. You have groups where there are groups of companies where their R&amp;D productivity was lousy by any standards. Some of them don't exist anymore. And then you have a group of companies, their productivity actually was pretty good.</p>
          <p>If you look at Roche, our productivity has been much, much better versus the industry standard. Now part of that is you have seen this 4.9, which is an external study, therefore I used it. Part of that is also because we entered into biologics very early, and what you said about small molecules is, of course, true. Many of the small molecules which you move into the clinics fall out because of toxic reasons. That, of course, is much, to a much lesser degree the case in biologics and that is one of the reasons our early entry into biologics where our productivity over the past decade has been substantially higher than the competitors' productivity.</p>
          <p>And of course, it is our ambition and I think not only our ambition, but our obligation to produce a better R&amp;D productivity because we over-proportionally invest into R&amp;D. That must be the goal for us. And I hope to shed some color on how we are going to do that, but I do believe that the understanding of the disease biology, not necessarily that you do the basic research yourself, but that you are closely tied into academic institutions, for example, that you closely work together with the external world to understand the disease biology has always been a big strength, proportion has been part of the better than industry productivity in the past. So that I hope sheds some light on your R&amp;D question. There was a second one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What kind of run rate profit should one see if you're generating decent returns in relativity...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can only &#x2013; yeah, no. I mean, here you're literally looking forward 10 years, and who knows exactly what the price level will be in 10 years, who will know exactly how the regulatory framework will be in 10 years. What I do expect in more qualitative terms is that the environment will get tougher. And the reason why I believe that is because I don't see any light on the horizon in terms of household deficits, at least in the developed countries around the world. I see a continued explosion of healthcare costs as we go forward, and that will put enormous pressure on the system.</p>
          <p>And I think that the size of allocation mechanism which you will see in the long-term for payers will be what is the additional benefit per patient? That will be the decisive allocation. If it's really getting tough in the system, if it starts to crunch, then people will look at how much benefit, medical benefit, clinical benefit do I get out from the dollar I invest into the healthcare system? That will be the decisive factor.</p>
          <p>And the only way how you can drive and how you can improve healthcare delivery in my opinion is innovation. And I believe eventually what we will see in 10, 20 years is a consolidation of the industry in two camps. You will have on the one hand, companies who really focus on generics. There will, of course, be a demand for generics and that is a matter of economies of scale. That is a matter of driving down the cost and making a margin on a high volume. And then you will see a number of distinct companies who really drive innovation, who really drive medical benefit and a differentiation for the individual patient.</p>
          <p>Now the group in between, and the programs in between and I will claim there are still lots of those kind of programs around, and there might be some in the Roche portfolio and we have to weed them out, all of those will not be successful and all of those will not be sustainable. And I think one element which we see increasingly, and I think where we have a competitive position and a sustainable competitive position across the industry is the notion of personalized healthcare. Now we've been talking about this for a long time. This is now getting reality. If you look into our late-stage pipeline, out of the 12 new molecular entities, six of them, that is half of our portfolio, are examples of targeted therapies MetMAb, for example, which we presented recently at ASCO, lebrikizumab, pertuzumab, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And why this is so powerful is not only because of the medical value, but because it makes healthcare delivery much more efficient. The reality today is that 50% of drugs are wasted. If we can target it much better to sub-populations of patients, of course the medical value per patient will go up. So to come back to your question, I cannot tell you what exactly will be the price levels in 2020. I cannot tell you what exactly will be the regulatory framework around the world. Not only in the U.S., in Europe increasingly so, also in the emerging market I wouldn't know, but what I'm absolutely certain about it, it's about the medical differentiation. It's about the innovation. I think for truly life saving drugs there will be a demand also in future. There will be winners and losers, and I believe with our strategy, with our focus on innovation we will be on the winning side. Thank you. I made my point I hope.</p>
          <p>Yes, please? I promise to go into the very back. Can we have with the second microphone in the last row up there? Yeah. We another 20 minutes.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Leuchten from Barclays Capital. One question for Severin and Alan maybe. Very nice presentation on cash flow generation; operating cash flow up 7% in Swiss francs. What I didn't really get from your presentation is what you're going to do with it? You started paying down some of the 2013 bond. You left your options open on the dividend. What's your thought on the 2014 debt target that is maybe an old target now, what do you think about the cash position on the balance sheet? And then a question for Pascal. If I look at the distribution on the international markets there seems to be a dichotomy between the bigger products and the more mature products. And the more mature products don't do as well as the bigger products. Why is that the case? Why do I not see the organization pushing the entire portfolio? Is that just regional differences? Or is there a difference in strategy between the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps if I can take your first question essentiality the use of cash. Now in the context of the Genentech transaction in 2009, you know that in addition to our shareholders we got a new stakeholder group, and that was bond holders. And at that time it was very important in the communication to signal to the market that we are diligent about cash flows, and that we are committed to generate the necessary cash flows to step by step pay down our debt according to the maturities of the bonds. And remember back that was during in the middle of the financial crisis. We closed the Genentech deal, I think it was March 2009, so this was really, really at the bottom.</p>
          <p>So at that time what we did is we signaled to the market that we expect with the Genentech transaction to be able to be cash positive or net debt positive by 2015. And from what you have seen over the recent past, actually the cash flow was even exceeding the original plans and that led to the repurchase of certain bonds in the market. So in the meantime, I would say the environment has changed a bit, otherwise at that time this was really, really critical. In the meantime, the trust of our bondholders in the viability of our cash flows and in the financial strength of the company fully established. And therefore in this context you shouldn't see this goal which we have given ourselves in 2009 to be net cash positive in 2015 like as a goal where we will kind of if this was the goal for the sake of being there because obviously we are under-leveraged in such a situation. And I think it's a good goal in terms of monitoring cash flows internally in the company, and keeping the discipline in terms of cash flows if you have this goal and if you work along it, but probably we will never come to this situation that we are under-leveraged.</p>
          <p>Now I keep saying here let's cross the bridge when we have to cross the bridge, but at one point we will be confronted with the question of use of cash, and there are really two options: one is that we use the cash for licensing opportunities, for M&amp;A transactions, and you have seen what we have done over the years. You know our policy in this respect, and the other one is some form return it to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now I don't want to be more concrete at this point. Let's see how things develop. With the current leverage I think we still have some time before we have to make the respective decisions. But don't regard, don't consider this net cash positive as a sacred cow where everything is kind of determine to get to this net cash positive event in 2015. I hope this gives you a bit of color why we have given ourselves the goal, but how we see it in the broader context. And I think also the environment has changed since March 2009. If we can continue in the, perhaps just over there...</p>

Let me just make maybe first a general comment is that our firm belief is that the international markets over time will actually behave exactly like Europe or the U.S. And the room you see or the place you see today for branded copies will disappear, and those markets will polarize between generics, whole generics and in innovative medicines. So we believe anything we do with products that are out of patent, trying to promote branded copies like some of our peers are doing, we don't believe it's a good use of our cash from a long-term perspective.</p>
          <p>So having said that, we still promote some products where we see there is an opportunity at a reasonable cost. We do it in China. For instance, we promote ceftriaxone, Rocephin. We promote Madopar. So some products that may be out of patent if we seen in a given market there is really an opportunity, we do it. But in the great scheme of things, given the pressure that we have to manage our resources, we see more value investing in new projects, new products and development while promote older products that are out of patent which, we don't believe would respond that much. And so we focus our commercial investment in our so-called bigger products, the Herceptin, MabThera. There's still enormous amount of growth that could come out of those. So this is clearly our priority.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Leacock from RBS Pharmacy. Just briefly on your R&amp;D productivity, and Slide 11 has a few specific questions on that. Firstly, you should showed us that Roche is just over two times better than the industry standard. At what point in those successive transitions is Roche most successful or maybe what points? Secondly, the data presented is '05 to '09; we're now in mid of '11. Where would you say the numbers are more likely to be today? And most importantly really, the key transition certainly as far as the industry is concerned is the failure between Phase I and Phase II at 25%. Although you've been very clear about your late-stage trial success rate, could you be a little more clear about your Phase I to Phase II transitions please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Now first of all, versus industry. As I said beforehand, I think what you do see is a difference between companies who had a strong foot in the biologics market and those companies who were more footed in the small molecules market. And one of the reasons why we have this above average success rate over this period, which I showed 2005 to 2009, was certainly related to the fact that we are very much in biologics and that is typically a question of toxicity safety, where you have more off-target events with small molecules.</p>
          <p>Now, perhaps before I'll come to the question where do I see the critical interfaces along of the value chain and how we manage this approach, perhaps just also on the data. This is data until 2009 and indeed in 2010, we were certainly not satisfied with our success rate in the late-stage. I mean we are all aware of the various setbacks we had and we really came down in 2010. Now if you look into 2011, here, we really couldn't be more perfect. We had a series of, I mean, 100% hit rate in the late-stage trials since then. So we had seen a fluctuation between 2010 and 2011 and that's where I hope us to see as we go forward into 2011 and the years to come.</p>
          <p>Now what are critical points in moving forward compounds along the value chain? I mean first of all, as far as research is concerned, I repeat myself, I do believe it's a lot about understanding the biology of diseases. You have to be at the forefront. If you just read about a new target in some publication, it makes you a fast follower. If you are really entrenched in the scientific community, if you really know what's going on, if you really understand better than others what is happening here, I think you can choose your targets much more carefully, you can move forward in the research setting really the most promising compound.</p>
          <p>Now as we move over, in terms of the value chain, I think traditionally a very critical one is preclinical-clinical. A lot of things work beautifully in mice, but unfortunately, they do not work as well in human beings. So a lot of attrition happens from the preclinical into the clinical phase; something we refer to as the translational research. And we have lots of efforts underway to make sure that we manage this interface in a good way, two elements perhaps in this context. One, an organizational one. If you look at how we have organized <mark type="ph" /> chiret and piret (1:35:22), then you'll notice that this is not the traditional organization as you see it in many pharma companies' research development, which is clinical development, and then marketing and sales, et cetera. We have combined research and early development on the one hand and late-stage development for the group as a whole on the other hand and I think this was a wise decision. When I listen into the organization, I hear a lot of excitement about the fact that the research organization is looking at things both from a preclinical and from a clinical point of view and that almost changes the mindset of people. I think this is an important element.</p>
          <p>The other important element is when I talk about this transition between preclinical and clinical is that you can't succeed on your own. I mean the human body is so complex. If you think of all these biomarker opportunities, et cetera, it's extremely important that you link up with academia. And very often, traditionally what you see is the researchers link up with the researchers in academia and the clinicians link up with the clinicians in hospitals, et cetera. But this interface which is so critical internally between research and clinical is equally important in the structure of your external relationships. And if you look at what has also &#x2013; we haven't publicized it a lot, but if you look at what we have done in this regard over the last three years, we have built up 10 what we call translational hubs with external partners and those are typically networks. We have one in France, for example; we have one in Singapore; we have two in Switzerland; we have one with Harvard in the U. S.; we have one in Toronto; we have one in the Netherlands. Those are typically networks where you work together internally between the researchers and the clinicians, very often together with our diagnostics people when it comes to biomarker research development of assays. And if you like a mirror to the outside where you work together with lots of institutions and you cross and you almost force the outside to also think across the preclinical-clinical wall, if you like, and that has been, I think, very fruitful and a lot of very interesting stuff has come out of that approach. So that is very important.</p>
          <p>Now, if you move on into the later stages of development, then really where you see and you refer to that, where you see the cost going up is when you go into Phase II, of course, for a trial and then very much so into Phase III. Now, the way we are setup here isn't, and Pascal mentioned it a moment ago, we have what we call a so-called late-stage lifecycle, late-stage portfolio committee, LSPC. And Hal Barron is heading this LSPC, our Head of Global Development, together with David L&#xF6;w, the Head of Marketing. And it would be this LSPC which sets the criteria to move projects from the early development, which in our terms is the Tarceva, the Genentech and the <mark type="ph" /> piret (1:38:41), the Roche research and early development organization. They would set up the criteria, the target product profiles, if you like, for transitioning into Phase III. And that is not a classical approach, but in a way it's almost too late at that point. So what we do is for every project in our portfolio, we set these criterias, but we work already together with the early development folks when they enter into Phase II.</p>
          <p>Now, why is this important? First of all, if you wait too long and you go into Phase II and only at Phase III, you discuss whether the criteria are fulfilled or not, it's too late in a way because you have already wasted the money in Phase II potentially. And also you get a bias into the decision-making because the people who move things into Phase II, they really, really, really want to push it into Phase III. But if you define the criteria already beforehand, so before, together with late-stage &#x2013; we work kind of like an outsider, but independent &#x2013; you get much more vigorous decision-making into your process, much more vigorous decision-making. And that leads to a situation where either you don't move projects forward into Phase II to start with or what happens, and this is very interesting to see, you move them forward with a completely different trial design and that makes a huge difference. And then you really answer the questions, which are critical already in Phase II, so that you can set up the Phase III trial. And then if we move on into Phase III, there I would say it's also a lot about driving the machinery; being efficient; looking at whether you have made clever arbitrage, for example, as we discussed in the context of operational excellence; how do we simplify our data needs for our trials, the dal-OUTCOME 2 example for example; et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So I hope it gives you a bit of a flavor how we look at it. I don't think there is a recipe. It's a lot of factors which play together and at critical points at each stage of the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Perhaps the lady here in that hall.</p>

          <p>Marietta Miemitz, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. A couple questions, please. The first one is on dalcetrapib. Are you actually willing to share with us the stopping criteria for efficacy or of utility at the interim analysis? Or asked a different way, why are you so confident that the interim analysis will inform your divestment decisions with regards to the production sites, given that normally you would expect the DSMB to just let it run after the interim analysis and you will not get an indication as to how likely it is to meet the primary endpoint? Should I ask my second question later?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. The second question is just would you mind running by us the patents for Herceptin and MabThera in your international regions? I'm just trying to understand whether in the international regions, the patents run a lot longer than Western Europe or whether there are any reasons to assume that a biosimilar, if it does actually get approved and launched in Western Europe, would not also be launched and used in the international regions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the first one, Karl, help me. Do we disclose stopping criteria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. I'm sorry for that. But let me give you a general answer on dalcetrapib, just to put it a bit into perspective. I always keep saying this is the biggest proof-of-concept study we have ever done. As you know, we are investigating whether HDL really is leading to a better mortality and morbidity and nobody has shown this in the past and we will only know when the recites read out. And you know as much as I do; we just simply don't know. And by the nature of an interim study, you of course could get results or it will continue as planned until the end of 2012. It's event-driven and we'll see what events come in. That's all I can say and we have to wait.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question Inaudible] (1:43:23)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is not. No, no, you're referring to the Florence side, which we are not divesting. The simple reason why we are not divesting Florence is because economically it doesn't make sense. We do operational excellence to reduce our cost, so if we end up selling a site or even having to pay for a site and then we have to produce the products which we are currently producing at Florence at a higher cost, it just doesn't make sense. It's as simple as that. It's an economic decision. I mean just because we have operational excellence going and then we come along and we announce the reason that we closed to Florence, but then if we come along and we are offered here conditions which makes it more expensive to produce the products which we are currently producing in Florence in spite of the over-capacities we have and which are in the market, we're just not doing it because it's economically stupid. And it has nothing to do with dalcetrapib. We do that because it makes economic sense, point.</p>
          <p>Now, on your second question regarding the patents. Now, we don't disclose the exact patent expiries for Herceptin and MabThera on a country basis outside of the U.S. and we do that for competitive reasons. So that's the reason why I can't give you more information here; it's really to protect the shareholder value of Roche. And we don't want to make it easier for biosimilar companies by disclosing all the patents we have in the respective markets. But roughly, as you know, the patents for MabThera and Herceptin in Europe expire at slightly different times across Europe, mid of this decade. So our strategy clearly here is that we come up with better products, which move to standard-of-care by then. And in this context, of course, the news which we communicated to you on pertuzumab last week, obviously very, very important because we believe that we can move to standard-of-care and that should enable us to protect our two franchise in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More or less they are very similar. But we don't disclose those dates country-by-country, as Severin told you, but the dates are very similar. The U.S. is a special case, with much longer patent protection. The rest of the world will come together for both Herceptin <mark type="ph" /> and MabThera (1:46:04).</p>
          <p>As far as the interim analysis, our chief lawyer tells us we can't disclose the stopping hold. But you will understand that this interim analysis is important because if we hit the futility criteria and we stop the study for efficacy and we end up with a very strong efficacy, imagine that you don't sell the same volume of a product that has a 30% improvement of mortality, morbidity versus a product that would still be viable but only reduces mortality by, say, 15%. The days when you could sell a product like Plavix with a 10% improvement are probably counted and payers are becoming more difficult. So that would certainly give us an indication of how big the product can be.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:47:04). Two questions, please. First, a very short one. On Zelboraf, you suggested the very soon answer from the FDA, if I'm not wrong, you filed in May, so even with the six months prior to review, it drives us to November. Could it be even faster than that? And second question is on your outlook for 2011, full-year on core EPS. If we listen to each of you, it looks like second half is much better than first half. First of all, the comparison basis is lower; you won't get Tamiflu; you won't get Avastin fourth quarter; you have less healthcare reform impact; then in international region, we could see some tenders back in Russia Diagnostics; you should see less expenses in M&amp;D; coming on the savings, at least as many savings in H2, in H1. So how all this translate into a similar growth in H2 than in H1 to drive full-year at 10% growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, first on Zelboraf. Of course, it's up to the FDA to decide when they are ready to approve the product, so we couldn't be more precise at that time. But I think what Pascal indicated is that due to the extremely strong data we have seen with BRIM3, the FDA is really is extremely supportive to move this drug to patients as soon as possible and I think it's fair to say that we are on an accelerated track here. I mean the medical benefit of this drug is so enormous and if you have such an event, then the FDA is really, really behind it and is helping and pushing to get it to patients as soon as possible. So we'll see when we bring it to the market. What I can say is we are very confident that we launch it in the U.S. in the second half of the year and indeed this could, depending on the decision of the FDA, already be earlier than end of 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of the outlook for the full year, well an outlook is an outlook. There are always uncertainties in an outlook and there are many factors playing into such a forecast. To our best knowledge, if we put all of this together, we came to the conclusion that we increase our guidance from high single-digits to around 10% and I would like to leave it at that. You can then, of course, go into various elements; you can take all kind of assumptions and come out a little bit better, a little bit worse. The only one which I perhaps would add just as another consideration in the elements which we are considering is that we had a good improvement in the tax rate in the first half of the year. So if you look into the second half of the year, and Alan has indicated that kind of roughly we will keep this tax rate, then you don't see the leverage on the tax side which we have seen in the first half; you wouldn't see this leverage in the second half of the year. I don't want to over-emphasize this point either, but there but there are many points. And all I want to say, if you put all of that together, we come to around 10%.</p>
          <p>Yes, please? We have a question there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, gentlemen, it's Keyur Parekh from Goldman Sachs. Two questions for Mr. Hippe, if I may. First, if you just conceptually, theoretically think about an industry where you invest $8 billion, $9 million a year into R&amp;D and on the back-end assume 4% success rate, how do you think about it from a capital allocation perspective? And secondly, you spoke about your view of the industry being split longer-term between winners and losers. Clearly, I know where Roche management stands on its view of where it will end up, but the investors seem to be suggesting a very different group on where you will end up. What are we missing, either in terms of your strategy or its execution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan, you want to give it a shot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're here to create value. I think we certainly, we serve the needs of the patients, but I think when we look at capital markets, we have to create value. I think that's the simple answer from my side to this end when it comes to investment and I think Severin said all this about how the pipeline looks like and certainly also Pascal. Our plan's promising. We can argue how long this timeline is and how you do your valuation, but I think at the end, there has to be value. And that's why I'm also here, at least it was one of my &#x2013; how should I say &#x2013; triggers to come to Roche because I see value here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe to add one point, I think to contrast the $7 billion or $8 billion investment with a 4% success rate is probably the one contrast because what you do is you take a series of options as you spend your money in R&amp;D. And first of all, our view is that the probability is more like 9%, 10% of success for our product to go from research and development due to market, but we don't spend $8 billion in research; we spend $8 billion for the whole value chain. And the success rate when you spend money in lifecycle is much higher. So in terms of your <mark type="ph" /> PTS (1:52:58) relative to the investment, it is a very different proposition when you invest it in lifecycle management and we spend a lot of money in lifecycle management. We move a product from Phase II to Phase III, like MetMAb, and the first time we move it into Phase III, it was one indication and then we expand the scope of the product and we turn it into a very big product based on its lifecycle activity. So you really have to look at it as a series of options that you take for the life of a product.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's an acceptable capital allocation return from that perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean to give you an investor's answer, I mean of course you have to at least &#x2013; and the cost of capital as a minimum. But what I really don't like to do, and I've always been very explicit about that, to run behind our research in their labs, go through all of these products and ask them what their internal rate of return is. This is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. You cannot do that. Especially if it comes to the early part of the value chain, if you talk about research, if you talk exploratory development, I mean it's kind of &#x2013; I mean let's walk together through some labs and then we make a list of all the projects; and then we walk out of the lab and say what are the criterias, what is the internal rate of return, et cetera, et cetera; and then we walk back to those people and say, can you please fill it out for me and make a spreadsheet out of it and then we sit here and say, well now this project has to go, this project has not to go.</p>
          <p>In the early part, this is about the quality of science. There is a lot of judgment. This is a lot about people. When I looked at the Genentech transaction, when I looked at what are we buying here, I was not having a little spreadsheet calculating my internal rate of return of <mark type="ph" /> chevat (1:55:01). I was most concerned about the quality of science; I was most concerned about keeping those people motivated, have an organization which really kind of is excited and which remains excited as part of the Roche Group. That's much, much more important.</p>
          <p>When you then come into the later stages, then it's much more of a kind of, how shall I say, a hot numbers game. And then we do these calculations. Then we look and we go into the details and where can we save money; what is the probability, what is the probability that we bring this product to the market; what is the commercial potential; what is potential prices here; what is the time schedules involved in here; what are the discount sectors that still make this viable, et cetera. It is more like building factory, if you like.</p>
          <p>But I warn you to look at the pharma business and to the R&amp;D business as if you could manage it on a spreadsheet; this is not possible. You have to manage productivity, you have to manage the cost. But I mean these internal rate of returns at a very early stage, it doesn't work; nobody can tell me it does. And I take it up with everybody and then we walk through some labs and we do a debriefing at the end of the day and I'm sure 100 out of 100 here will agree with me.</p>

          <p>Thanks. It's Naresh Chouhan from Liberum Capital. Just a couple of questions for me, please. On your slide showing 2011 core operating profit versus 2010, you show 950 million Swiss francs of cost savings falling through to the bottom line, which is obviously all of what you achieved in &#x2013; I'm sorry in the first half. So should we assume that the whole 2.4 billion Swiss francs falls through to the bottom line? And if not, then where do you expect to reinvest the savings and can you give us a guidance to what you may think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know, to be very clear. If we talk about savings, we talk about real savings. We are not in this game, here, be safe and then we reinvest part of it. And if you look at the chart, what is very important to note here is you see the profit growth from the underlying business and that includes the cost which I needed to drive this business. You remember these four boxes and the third green box I think was the profit from the ongoing business. And all the cost which we need for this ongoing business, be it in diagnostics, be it in the emerging markets where we invest a lot, that is all included in this third box. So the 950 million Swiss francs is true savings and the same of course is true for the total amount; we want to save the 2.4 billion Swiss francs. Now, as far as the 950 million Swiss francs are concerned for the first half of this year, about 100 million Swiss francs as through related to the Genentech integration, 850 million Swiss francs are related to the operational excellence. So this is not reinvested in anything else.</p>

          <p>Yeah, what we have talked about in the past is the pricing of the combination. The core formulation of the two molecules is an option, of course, and we are looking at whether it is feasible. But the key is really even if these are separate drugs, separate products, how do you price the two because I mean, first of all, we needed to know what the pertuzumab clinical benefits were. We have a better idea now, so we can start thinking about how we would price this. So what is the value of pertuzumab as an agent. And two is how much is it possible to price for the treatment of <mark type="ph" /> hard to metastases (1:59:34) breast cancer when you combine the two. And then when you define this is how do you split the cross in between Herceptin and pertuzumab.</p>
          <p>So I don't have the answer yet. Luckily enough, we have another few months to figure that one out. I know how to price pertuzumab in isolation relatively quickly; what I need to figure out now is the logistics and how do we practically implement the pricing of the combination. There's clearly a need for us to help payers manage their total cost because we know cost is going to be an issue. Even if the two products are very cost-effective or will be cost-effective, there is of course a limit to the ability, the willingness of payer to pay and that's the affordability part of it. So we need to help them and we need to figure out how do we do this, considering of course the fact that the pricing of Herceptin over time is going to decline because of then lack of patent protection. So I don't have the answer yet.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for the interest. And with this, I suggest that we split out into the breaking groups. Pharma and diagnostics will be, I think, in this direction.</p>
