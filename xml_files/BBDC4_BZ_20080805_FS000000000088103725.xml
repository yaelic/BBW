      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. Bradesco posted a net income of R$4.1 billion in the first half of 2008. This was an excellent result taking account; first, the tougher global economic scenario; second, the higher volatility in the market; and third, the jump in inflation which led the Brazilian Central Bank to increase the base rate. Nevertheless, the Brazilian economy continues to grow in a consistent and sustainable basis, pointed to around 5% GDP growth this year.</p>
          <p>Before transferring &#x2013; transfer &#x2013; the floor to Jean, we will be conducting a detailed presentation. I would like to comment some highlights of Bradesco's recent performance.</p>
          <p>Our net interest income is expanding, thanks to the strong growth of our loan book, which grew by almost 39% over the last 12 months. In the corporate segment, most of the demand has been driven by credit lines focused on the business expansion, as for individuals their higher gross rates derived by consumer finance operations, especially in vehicles, credit cards but also in mortgage and agriculture.</p>
          <p>Bradesco's loan portfolio continues to grow and its quality remains very sound with the more than 92 days delinquency ratio it's standing flat at 3.5% for the third consecutive quarter. Provisioning for those delinquent loans reached a comfortable 166% coverage. Bradesco continues to invest in expanding its infrastructure. Over the last 12 months we have increased our distribution by more than 4900 points.</p>
          <p>We've highlighted the opening of 162 branches and 665 mini branches, in terms of IT and benefiting our customer and distribution network, we have almost finished to upgrade our hardware, software and telecommunications with state of the art equipment.</p>
          <p>We believe the IT improvement project will be key for supporting the strong growth we expect Bradesco to achieve in the future. This project will enable Bradesco to move into the new operational standards increasing quality of service, agility and safety to our system.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we were the first movers in our technology of the contact last card with Visa, and we installed in more than 300 ATMs by master readers of <mark type="inaudible" />. Bradesco's operational efficiency has also improved as its cost to income ratio moved from 42, in June of 2007 to 41.3 in June of this year.</p>
          <p>Our Insurance Group posted a net income of more than R$1.4 billion which represented 36% of Bradesco's net income. This end of our insurance company is based on our strategy of first relying on Bradesco's Banco comprehensive distribution network. Second have a multi line approach and third, count on a very good relationship with brokers.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to emphasize the fact that we continue to be very optimistic about the future and for attending the needs of our millions of customers. We are identify investments in IT to any of our staff and continuously expand our distribution network. We just approved internally the opening of broker-dealers up to the end of this year in Dubai, Tokyo and in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the floor to Jean. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us now move to slide number two. We are presenting in this slide, Bradesco's main highlights comparing the first half of 2007 and 2008. Slide number three. Bradesco posted a net income of more than R$2 billion in the second quarter of 2008, 5% higher than the previous quarters of R$1.9 billion. The main component to this performance derived from, a) growth in net interest income as the loan book expanded strongly, b) good asset quality, which is reflected in the constitution of provisions we considered at the normal level, c) growth in business volumes and in the customer base essential for to helping to mitigate the effect of regulatory measures which affect us, more specifically fees. d) growth in operational expenses as we expanded in the beginning of the year based on expansion and distribution and IT mentioned by Milton in his opening remarks.</p>
          <p>Please note that all the analysis and ratios included in this presentation in the press release and in the factbook consider net income adjusted by non-recurring events.</p>
          <p>Slide number four, in the first half of 2008 annual EPS calculated in a 12 month basis increased by 10.7% standing at R$2.48. I would like to draw your attention to the increase in the efficiency, which moved from 42% in June 2007 to 41.3%, despite all the capital expenditures mentioned before. Just to give an example, in the second quarter we added 447 distribution point, basically mini branch.</p>
          <p>Slide number five, Bradesco's total assets surpassed the R$400 billion mark increasing by 13% in the quarter or around 40% over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>The quarterly growth was mainly due to 1) the increase in securities and interbank investment, which jumped by R$39 billion and 2) to the long book, which climbed by R$9 billion.</p>
          <p>As for the adjusted net income, the annualized return on average equities stood at 27.2% and the annualized return on average assets averaged 2.1%. The reported ROE stood at 28.6%. In June 2008, the capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.9%.</p>
          <p>As of July 1, 2008 the new Basel agreement called Basel II came into force in Brazil. Making assimilation with the figures as of June 30, the new capital adequacy ratio would increase from the actual 12.9 to 13.9%.</p>
          <p>On the top of that, if we exercise the option of excluding of our total foreign investment, the hedges for the equity we own abroad which is a possibility given by the Central Bank of Brazil, this ratio would jump to 16.7% and the potential increase in the loan portfolio maintaining everything equal would be up R$135 billion.</p>
          <p>In both cases, in Basel I and in Basel II calculation, the capitalization ratios give us a comfortable position in terms of operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Line number six, unrealized gains of Bradesco and its subsidiaries totaled almost R$4.2 billion in June 2008. Even with the volatility in the market which happened in the second quarter these potential gains remained stable. It is important to remember that these gains do not include our participation in companies that are not listed such as Terraza and VisaNet.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven. Bradesco's net income breakdown is inline with the previous quarters. In the quarter despite a slight reduction, the insurance segment accounted for a significant portion of Bradesco's total net income. It is worth noting that fees maintained its relative participation even after the realignment of these in the individual segment.</p>
          <p>Slide eight. In this slide, it is worth noticing that the operating results increased by 8% in the quarter and by 14% in the 12 months comparison. The 10% change in this quarter in other operating revenues and expenses refer to R$58 million increase in some of the losses, R$47 million increase in financial expenses and 9 million reduction in operating provisions.</p>
          <p>Slide number nine. Thanks to the strong growth of loans the net interest income increased by 9% in the quarter and by 17.9% over the last 12 months. The evolution of the non-interest earning line refers to the higher gains from treasury, securities and stronger credit recovered. Actually, the first quarter was weaker and out of the curve. It is also worth noting that the increase in the volume of operation continues to be an important factor since it has more than offset the fall in revenues derived by lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Slide number ten. On June 2007 and 2008 comparison, one can see that the net interest income from interest earning operations jumped by 19.3%, thanks to the higher volume of loan operation as we mentioned in the explanation of the previous slide. Please note that this slide does not include treasury gains, gains from investments and effect of mark-to-market</p>
          <p>Slide number 11. In this slide, one can see that loan operations has been increasing their relative participation quarter after quarter and correspond to 69% of the net interest income vis-&#xE0;-vis 65% as of June 2007. In this quarter, the increase in the base rate of delinquency was responsible for the increase in the share of funding.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12. We can see on the slide, the summary of the margin derived by loans. I would like to draw your attention to the black line in the middle which shows the net margin, which improved by 18% between June of 2008 and June of 2007.</p>
          <p>Slide number 13. Bradesco's total loan portfolio reached in June '08, R$182 billion representing a quarterly growth of 7% and a 39% increase over the last 12 months, outpacing the market which grew by 33.4% in the same period. Also, in the last 12 months, new borrowers generated around R$28 billion in new operations, fuels being responsible for 25% of the increase in the loan book excluding sureties, guarantees and credit card receivables. It is important to emphasize that corporate demand for loans increased due to market conditions. As a result Bradesco has been operating strongly with various types of corporate loans. For example, working capital. This becomes clear, when we look at the solid growth of the loans to corporate.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14 and 15. These slides shows a breakdown of Bradesco's main credit line for individuals and companies. As one can see there is a continuous growth of auto mobile financing basically through direct lending and leading credit line. Bradesco has been focusing on new vehicles through leading operations, which accounted for 54% or R$29 billion of the total consumer financing operation.</p>
          <p>Also in the individual segment, Bradesco has been investing in new and improved services, including the new Bradesco Mortgage and Bradesco Rural sites that are already helping to boost mortgage and agricultural loans, which has risen by 11 and 10% respectively just in this quarter. In the corporate segment, loans for financing production performed extremely well.</p>
          <p>Slide number 16. This slide shows the level of coverage of our provisions with regard to expected losses. In relation to the mandatory requirement of the Central Bank of Brazil, Bradesco posts an excess of provision of R$1.2 billion. However, if we look at the effective expectation of losses for the next 12 months, we expect increases to R$2.8 billion, proof that we are extremely well provisioned.</p>
          <p>Slide number 17, in the quarter, delinquencies remains stable. Even with the slight increase in this ratio in the individual segment due mainly to credit card and vehicle financing. In the SME segment, the decline in the &#x2013; in this ratio shows that the substantial growth of this portfolio has not affected its quality.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18; Bradesco's mortgage origination reached a record level of R$3 billion in this first half of the year, a 94% evolution if compared to the first half of 2007 performance.</p>
          <p>Bradesco have an outstanding position in this segment with a 23% market share. In 2008, Bradesco financed more than 24,400 properties which represented 19% of the total home finance in Brazil, a 90% evolution vis-&#xE0;-vis the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>Slide number 19. In the first half of 2008, fees increased by 8% mainly driven by one, credit card fees derived by the growth in the card base and by the 24% jump in the number of transactions and two, asset management fees mainly due to the increase in assets under management.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2008, these revenues remained stable despite the 18% decline in fees derived by loan operations as a result of the several tariff restructuring in the individual segment.</p>
          <p>Slide number 20. In relation to operating expenses, more precisely personnel expenses, the slight 2.6% increase in structural expenses in this quarter was due to the expansion of the distribution network. Just in this quarter, Bradesco opened, as I said before, 449 new mini branches plus 24 branches and 36 mini branches inside company.</p>
          <p>The non-structural expenses fell by 16% in this quarter due to lower labor provision in the amount of R$40 million and to a R$25 million decline in profit-sharing expenses and management bonuses. The increase in administrative expenses was due partially to organic growth, higher business volume and investments in the IT area. It is worth noting that the percentage of expenses compared with total assets has been falling continuously which we consider a good indicator of efficiency. We are always strongly focused on cost control and improving operating efficiency despite investments in distribution, expansion and quality improvement.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. The coverage ratio recorded a slight decline basically due to higher IT investments, expansion of the distribution network and to fee restructuring in the individual segment as from the first quarter 2008. Taking into consideration that this is an accumulated 12-month ratio, improvement normally tends to occur only after this period. However, we are counting on the growth in operation and in the client base to anticipate this cycle.</p>
          <p>Slide 22. On this slide, we showed improvement of funding with an outstanding performance of demand and savings deposits, segments in which we are the leaders among the Brazilian private banks. The strong expansion in timed deposits was due to fund the solid loan book growth and to the impact of the new reserve requirement of 25% over funding operation of leasing companies. In the asset management segment, equities had the best performance growing by 9.5% in the quarter and by 119% over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide number 23. In order to provide better understanding of our insurance, private pension plan and savings bond operation, we are presenting here in this slide a summary of our insurance group income statements.</p>
          <p>Slide 24. Revenues from insurance premiums, private pension plans and savings bonds reached R$11.1 billion in the first half of this year, a 13% year-over-year growth representing a 24% market share with the data that are released up to May 2008. Giving these results, Bradesco's insurance group remained top ranked in property and life insurance as well as in open pension plan.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 and 26. Owned financial assets and technical reserves guaranteed reached R$71 billion equivalent to 36.3% of the market. Let me add that these assets correspond to 80% of the pension plan and VGBL investment portfolios. Total assets grew by 14% over the last 12 months. Technical provisions reached R$62 billion or 35.5% of this total insurance market, again with the May 2008 figures.</p>
          <p>We would like to draw your attention to the technical provision in the health insurance segment which amounted to more than R$3.3 billion. As for Bradesco's health provision. I would also like to point out that if current market conditions are maintained especially in regard to the level of claims and the capability of adjusting premiums to keep pace with medical inflation, we do believe that our health provisions level is appropriate to the identified risks according to the respective technical notes.</p>
          <p>Slide number 27. As you can see in this slide, we present two ratios related to the insurance efficiency. On the top of the slide on the left side, we can see the efficiency ratio which decreased by 0.2% in this quarter. The improvement of this ratio reflects the reduction of personnel and administrative expenses. Below on the right side, we are presenting the combined ratio which shows a slight decline in this quarter in spite of an improvement of 2.2% in the first half of 2008 vis-&#xE0;-vis the same period of last year. This ratio indicates the real operational efficiency of the insurance group regarding claims control and underwriting policy.</p>
          <p>Slide 28. On this slide we present Bradesco's guidance for 2008. Once we are in the middle of the year, some guidance indicators were changed as you can see. Concerning loans, we increased the growth perspective range from 21 to 25 to 24 to 29%. This increment was done due to the higher demand of large corporate clients &#x2013; of large corporate clients. By the way I would also like to point out that the increase in operating expenses that you can see on the slide is due to the impact of the inflation rate the IGPM on the top of administrative expense.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, here you can see our economic areas forecast for 2008 and '09 regarding GDP, base rate, inflation and exchange rate. The highlight here is the base rate projection which should reach 14.75% by the end of this year. But it should be declining in 2009.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we went through many challenges in this semester. Uncertainties derived by strong turbulence in the international financial market, high inflation and interest rate which impact administrative and funding cost, creation of a new reserve requirement over funding and reaching up to 25% for the leasing funding derived for other ends but leasing. Readjustments of individual client fees including the extinction of the credit processing fees called PVC.  Increasing the IOS tax which impacts loans to individuals, increase of the social contribution from 9 to 15%.</p>
          <p>So, in general terms and from considering that we have many structural and expansion project being implemented. We configure that Bradesco presented a very good result in this quarter.</p>
          <p>We would now like to open the floor to your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin from Goldman Sachs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I have two questions. My first is related to the expansion in the distribution network for that you've highlighted. Can you quantify how much Bradesco stands on this investment in, let's say branches and mini-branches in the first half of the year? How much was expensed versus being capitalized and what we should expect of the second half of the year in terms of investment and what will go through the income statement? And my second question is related to the net other expenses line which was over R$1 billion in the second quarter and about R$2 billion in the first half. Obviously, there are lots of moving parts in there and I know it's not easy though, for me it's not easy to forecast as &#x2013; but is there any and which was &#x2013; the last two quarters have been a bit of an up tick from where it was in the past. Is this kind of the level that we should expect going forward, if you can comment on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason. Responding your first question, we don't have the exact amount of this additional investment. First of all in terms of IT, the IT improvement project is a project of around $1 billion and we roughly have already invested approximately 70% of that. On the top of that we usually invest $1 billion a year in IT.</p>
          <p>In terms of distribution, the average cost for opening a branch stands between 7 to R$800,000 and we are planning to expand basically over three years, approximately 500 branches, so this has an impact on our cost. But I cannot tell you precisely what would be the incremental cost. For that we are passing through over the last year or at least over the last few years. But definitively what we intend to do is that process of amortizing his cost in the longer period of time and we expect the cost to income ratio to be relatively flat over the next 12 months, but after these 12 months it will be beginning to move down from the actual 41, 42 to around 37% in the range of &#x2013; to the next three years. So, this would be &#x2013; I would say a guidance we would be giving you in terms of cost to income ratio.</p>
          <p>In terms of the question that you asked of other operating revenues and other operating expenses, I would say that the range that we are passing through since this year has been moving up, the net amount to more than R$1 billion and it's very difficult to give you a precise direction for that because they are sometimes &#x2013; some expenses that are recurring that &#x2013; we include in other operating expenses that are difficult for us to predict going forward. For example, sundry provision and others that I mentioned in the explanation are difficult for us to predict. But in general terms, we have a level of net revenues and expenses, which moved up definitively this year, but we cannot tell you precisely in which direction it's going to go &#x2013; it's going to grow more than that we don't think so, it should be relatively stable.  There are some expenses linked to civil provisions that might be occurring in the future that are again very difficult for us to project going forward.</p>

          <p>Excuse me.  Our next question comes from Mr. Ian Smith from Nevsky Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just have a couple of questions, as well.  The first one is just a confirmation question.  On the split of net interest income, the non-interest elements of 870.  Can I just confirm that just includes trading for the treasury gains, as well as provision recovery?  The other question is just on the operating expense growth guidance, I saw that the top end of that have just been increased after 17% year-on-year.  With OpEx running at about 15% year-on-year in the first half is that sort of projection that you see that &#x2013; that rate picking up towards the end of the year as we see more expansion cost coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, in terms of the &#x2013; these net interest income calculation what we consider as non-interest would be a series of different items.  You have the recoveries for loans, we have the effects of the mark-to-market of securities, you have the effects of trading gains.  So, we have several pieces that take part into these calculations.</p>
          <p>We basically, just wanted to highlight that the level of these net interest income derived from non-interest, has been if we look over the quarterly explanation, high but historically speaking, if we analyze this portion of non-interest compared with the total net interest income, we have a range of participation of this between 8 and 15%, and actually the highest was in the second quarter of 2007.  In this quarter of &#x2013; second quarter, it was 13% as it was in the last quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>And just to explain why it jumped out quarter-after-quarter, first of all the sudden risk was much higher in the first quarter, higher than in the last quarter of 2007, and also much higher than in the second quarter of '08.  So part of that was higher sudden risk in the first quarter.  This also affected the stock exchange market.  There was a decline in the Bovespa index of 4% in the first quarter and an increase of 6% in the second quarter.  Third, you have more recoveries that usually happen in the second quarter, R$80 million more recoveries for loans, so comparing second with first quarter.  And last but not least, a lower realization, negative realization of some derivatives in the amount of around R$31 million.</p>
          <p>So, just to reemphasize that the level of net interest income just derived by this non-interest part actually is not a record high, it's actually within the range, just the first quarter was much weaker than that.  When you talk about the operating expenses, the operating expenses guidance is that we are showing in the slide number 28.  We have a range of 11 to 17%, so a little bit higher and part of that because of the inflation, the inflation has been moving up in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Because of increasing the fact of the bank because we are expanding the operation.  So, this actually affects the cost.  So the range will be a little bit higher instead of 10 to 16, 11 to 17.  And just to give you an idea, we're going to have in the third quarter the annual agreement for increase of wages with our employees and to give an idea for every 1% of increase, which is approved between the bank and the labor union, we have R$3.5 million more expenses.  So this is something that should not &#x2013; per month.  So actually this should not be changing dramatically our expenses going forward. But we basically are increasing a little bit the operational expenses for the second half of the year.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Paul Makines from JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning Jean and Milton. Couple questions. First, I wanted to follow-up on Jason's questions on the other operating expense line. Just looking at the other operating expense line, it rose 31% sequentially in the first quarter; second quarter it was 40% above the level that you've seen in the fourth quarter of last year, and it's been one of the primary drivers as to why your recurring earnings momentum hasn't been better than what it is? And frankly, I don't really have a great sense for what's driving that increase and there's obviously I realize it's very difficult to forecast that and to look at that numerous items in that. But obviously with that magnitude of an increase, there is something going on there that's driving up expenses, and can you just comment on that what's &#x2013; what it maybe even in general terms as to what's driving that &#x2013; what's being driving that expense line item up and if you can just give us a little bit of color as to what the primary factors have been there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This was the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the first question, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So responding to your question, I would say what happens is that you have an increase of some specific expenses that are classified in order operation expenses. Some of them would be linked to Civil provisions and you have some customers which answered &#x2013; who answered with a lawsuit against the bank to recover economic plans and of course losses that they believe they have in their savings deposits and others. And we basically had to make provisions. Actually, the provisions were little bit higher than we estimated. We thought that they were basically ending, but they continued to come. So, part of that would be more provisions &#x2013; civil provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On that question Jean, on that question in the past you've normalized for that and you've taken that out of recurring earnings the provisions for past economic plans, is there a reason why you haven't in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second please. For the <mark type="inaudible" /> plan basically the provisions were already done and it's okay, but there are some provisions for their own plan, which are in the amount of around 100 to R$150 million per quarter, which could maybe continue. So it's again very difficult to predict if it's going to continue for how long, but probably, maybe over the next couple of quarters. So affecting just up to the end of this year, these provisions should be built and would no longer impact the 2009 numbers. So it would be just maybe up to this end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And another kind of pillar of provisions for expenses are linked to discounts that you give for loans that are classified in this other operating expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; that's great. Second, let me ask you just a follow-up question also on your expense guidance. Obviously, the wage negotiations are going to impact the second half results in your 11 to 17% guidance what are you kind of expecting for increases in wages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second. Sorry Paul, basically, last year we had a negotiation increasing the wages of the employees of the bank of around 6%, and obviously this year we have more pressure on inflation than last year, but it is very difficult to give you a guidance if it's going to be the same or more. More pressure on inflation, but this is something that will be a negotiation between the bank and the union of employees.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. I have two questions. The first one is on your tax rate, it seems like you chose not to activate some of your deferred tax credits in light of the higher social contribution tax. Just wanted to know what is the policy of the bank going forward? When do you plan on making this activation? Second question has to do with the funding environment in Brazil, clearly, you have the funding book of your long growth time deposits. I was wondering about the evolution of your cost of your time deposits, I think, at the beginning of the year, your time deposits were pretty much close to market rates. We heard March or April therefore some bank they have increased about a 104% of CGI. So just wanted to get an idea if you see some relief in that front. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mario. In terms of the higher social contribution that the bank has to pay since this quarter, actually what we are doing is reimbursing, we are paying debt. But we are activating deferred tax assets mainly to neutralize fully these impacts. So what we &#x2013; there is a cap reimbursement impact, yes. But on an accounting way basically, you can neutralize this fact and this quarter we had around R$200 million of higher expenses which were basically neutralized and we have an increasing stock of deferred tax assets of R$1.27 billion because they were calculated before at a rate of 9% and now they are calculated in a rate of 16%. You can have basically access to that on the information on the footnote number 34 E, E like England.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, Jean. Is that the policy going forward? Is just to activate enough to neutralize the quarterly impact and then &#x2013; we are calculating an effective tax rate of 27% in the quarter, is that the level you expect to see for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, these are two different items. First of all we are questioning through lawsuits this higher social contribution. So since we are questioning we are basically every quarter that we have to do first we are going to have this usage of the deferred tax assets, this is one thing. If we look at the effective tax rate, there is zero impact on that, the only change is that the bottom line of the company the net income has been growing but what helps most to reduce the effective tax rate is the usage of interest on capital. The interest on capital you've got by the long-term interest rate and it's stable at around 6.3% a year, but the net income is growing. So theoretically speaking the possibility to lower the attractive tax rate will be shrinking because you have more net income but with a stable long-term interest rate. So basically the idea is to have the usage as much as we can, but effectively if we look at the both numbers you increased by roughly 1% the effective tax rates between the first and the second quarter. So mainly the trend would be to be at least maintaining this level because you have still a growth in the bottom line but with no increase in the long-term interest rates. To respond to your second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just sorry, Jean, just going, sorry. Like you said, you guys are questioning this increase in social contribution. When would you expect to get a final decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second. Mario, sorry. First of all, when I say Bradesco's questioning, actually <mark type="inaudible" /> is questioning. They are questioning in the name of the bank. With the actual stock of deferred tax assets, which increased by almost 1.3 billion we would be able to neutralize for almost 24 months this effective higher social contribution. So it's not possible for us to tell you what is going to happen with this launching period, zero expectation of timing for that, but there are at least 24 months that we can continue to use these deferred tax assets to neutralize the social contribution. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the second question that you asked me in terms of the environment, definitively long books continue to grow strong and the funding is coming most from timed deposits, more with institutional clients. So basically part of that's because of higher loan demand, we need more funding, but also because you have more reserve requirements, because every &#x2013; basically, every month you have to increase by 5% the collection of reserve requirements from leading operation up to achieving 25% by the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost of this funding, actually the cost of funding has been relatively stable in the beginning of the year when the reserve requirement was large, there was an impact, yes, on the cost of the funding. But since then the reserve requirements basically, the impact of the reserve requirement was lower on the cost of the funding and the cost is relatively stable. But obviously within institutional clients, the cost is close to the selling or a little bit higher than the selling.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Daniel Abut from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is on asset quality yield. You've said in your remark that overall it has been stable. In face of <mark type="inaudible" /> when you give the details for different types of loans, we do see though a small slight increase in the delinquency rate for individual loans, which went to a 6.7% asset being stable for a number of quarters.</p>
          <p>I wanted you to talk and comment, what trends do you expect to see in delinquency and individual loans going forward, particularly as you head to 2009, because it's clear that you're expecting a much slower economy next year, if I'm not mistaken you're now expected only 3.5% GDP growth next year, so much lower than this year than last. But also you continue to grow very fast in most individual loan categories, you'll retrain your guidance of about 25 to 30% growth this year for most of these lines. So would you comment on expectations for credit quality in individual loans going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Daniel. Basically, the delinquency ratio is stable for the bank as a whole around 3.5%, and the delinquency for individuals, which basically moved up in the process up to December of 2006. But basically because of a change in the mix of the portfolio movement moving into different credit lines. So there was also a kind of learning curve effect for example, in private label cards and others we had to understand better the application of the storage system. And then since then it has been relatively stable at 6.4%.</p>
          <p>I believe you remember in the first quarter, we mentioned that there was an increase in delinquencies, which was more geared towards the loans to motorcycles, and we had to basically readapt to put into place again some double checking that we, for a period of time, we didn't have some specifics, debt that basically impact still the delinquency ratio for individuals. So what we are posting here is the 6.7% also takes into account this motorcycle credit portfolio but, its very difficult for us to subtract from the delinquency ratio what is the effect &#x2013; the full effect of this motorcycle delinquency ratio increase by the core rates that we are improving. For the next year again Brazil is growing strong, we have more employment, we have a better employment and the delinquency &#x2013; sorry, the unemployment ratio has been the lowest.</p>
          <p>For the next year some economists say that some unemployment rate is going to increase. It's difficult to tell you by how much, but I believe what is important for you to know is that most of the credit lines that Bradesco is working with individuals they have collaterals, like auto. So they are directed into credit lines where the risk is much lower like the payroll deductible loans. So, in general terms this should be making the effect of Bradesco over the next year if you really have an increase in the unemployment rate, being much more mitigated than maybe with other banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But fair to say, just to follow-up Jean, fair to say that you're not overly concerned about credit quality next year, given the base of origination that you continue to do and that you expect to continue doing in the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look Daniel, it's fair to say that we are always concerned to have the best asset quality as we can and obviously if the situation is good, we will not be forgetting about this core rates, investments on training and so. But for next year I would say we're not so concerned that we could see another wave of problematic loans coming into the banking system, also because most of the banks have been investing massively in systems and in training.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Ms. Daniela Aslan from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the call. My question is about the &#x2013; your capital ratio which has decreased a lot and I was wondering if this is a level that we're going to see for the next quarter? And I was also wondering what made you revise so much your guidance on the payroll deductible loans for this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, basically the level and we tried to explain that in the presentation that we consider the capitalization ratio of Bradesco extremely sound. If we look at Basel II, it even increases, and if on the top of that we consider the letter of the Central Bank it goes almost to 17%. So this is much more than enough considering that minimum ratio in Brazil is 11%. So, we are totally comfortable about the capitalization ratio.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance that we are giving for the payroll deductible loans, we changed the guidance from almost 100% to maybe even less than half of that because there were a series of changes in the legislation, which affected the growth of the business. Also there was a possibility to direct part of the loans to cards and that maybe you would be seeing part of this growth in the guidance of cards, so a part of the growth of payroll deductible loans would be included in the cards and not in the payroll deductible loan line itself.</p>
          <p>And we would write down to 35 to 45%, but we definitely believe that we have a solid edge towards the acquisition of BMC and that's very possibly over the &#x2013; up to the end of this year or the beginning of next year Bradesco and BMC together should be leaders in the payroll deductible loan business.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jean. Just a follow-up on that payroll deductible, first of all. So, would it be fair to say that you're not going to be giving up market share by bringing down this guidance, it's more a question of how the market is going and how the market is growing in payroll deductible loans, that this revised guidance reflects?</p>
          <p>And then on my second question on fee income. We see here that the guidance is 5 to 8% for the full year. Would you be thinking that the growth rate would be slowing in the second half of the year? And what can we expect to see in key areas like fee income from checking accounts and credit operations, which has obviously been one of the most disappointing of the big size shall we say, of the big contributors to fee income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Victor. Yes, you are correct. We will be growing less in payroll deductible loans, but we are going to grow our market share and the market should be growing less than Bradesco will be. The approach of BMC and the distributions that BMC has and the expertise obviously, are a solid edge that we have vis-&#xE0;-vis the competition.</p>
          <p>In terms of fees we obviously have a assessment year-to-year we have been growing double digits during many, many years and people were used to it and with the changes in legislation basically we had an impact. We changed the guidance and we performed over the last 12 months at a rate of 7.9% gross which is inside the range that we have here. Maybe we have still some deceleration in the second half, but we are comfortable to say that we should be achieving in 2008 this guidance of 5 to 8%.</p>
          <p>It's also important to tell you that 2008 is a transition year. From 2009 on we will be able to grow again because we are going to grow the client base. We are going to grow obviously the businesses. Maybe Brazil is growing less its GDP 3.5% in 2009 than 2008, but it's still growing higher than the average growth of Brazil for many, many years. And also we will try to increase the number of products per customers in a way to increase the service fees. It's also a key driver on that as you &#x2013; as was mentioned and you said, accounts and we are growing definitively, massively the number of cards, the number of transactions and the fees that are generated from that.</p>
          <p>Asset management also is a very big component. And checking accounts will be from checking account, and credit cards will be growing next year, but from a new basis because you have several fees that you used to charge before that you are not allowed to charge anymore. But you will be growing with volumes. So fees again, transition year, but from 2009 on you should see good performance again in fees and then the coverage ratio comparing cost and fees which basically declined from almost 80% should be probably over the next 12 months coming back to closer to 80%.</p>
