      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cindy. And hello and good afternoon, everybody. This is Thomas Eisenlohr. Thank you for joining the call for our three-months results. Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO will be hosting the call. Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board, he will also be available for your questions.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg Denoke and we will open the line again for Q&amp;A session at the end of the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Thomas. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A warm welcome also from my side to our three-months results conference call. I start my presentation with the highlights on page 3 of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Linde's very positive business performance in 2010 has continued in the first quarter of 2011. Our group sales increased by 14.9% to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. While the growth in operating profit with a plus of 18.7% to &#x20AC;761 million, proves and over proportionate increased. This operating performance translates in an increase of earnings per share of 42.7% to &#x20AC;1.67, adjusted by the allocation of the purchase price of the BOC acquisition, the earnings per share increased to &#x20AC;1.88.</p>
          <p>Also the operating cash flow grew by 10.8% to &#x20AC;440 million. The main drivers for our double-digit earnings growth are an ongoing strong growth momentum in the growth markets and solid growth in the mature regions, which was supported in particular by further recovery in the Cylinder business, as well as our HPO initiatives. The group operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 22.9%.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we reinforced our outlook of growth in sales and operating profit compared to the record year of 2010, and we also reconfirm our full commitment to our HPO initiatives, which will result in &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings until 2010 &#x2013; sorry, until 2012. And our guidance for 2011 is cost savings of &#x20AC;150 million to &#x20AC;200 million on a gross basis.</p>
          <p>I will start the detailed business review with Group sales on slide 4. Gases sales of &#x20AC;3.325 billion increased by 13.8% versus last year with comparable sales increase up 8.3% in the first quarter; our underlying gross momentum in the Gases business is strong. For comparison reasons, it's shall be mentioned that the comparable sales growth in the full year 2010 in Gases was 5.7%.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Engineering division were as expected above the level of last year. As in previous quarters, order intake in the first quarter of 2011 was characterized by a number of small and medium-sized new orders, the execution of the order backlog of around &#x20AC;3.7 billion is fully on track. Our expectations that full-year sales in the Engineering division will be in line with the previous year is unchanged.</p>
          <p>As you will see now on slide five, our profitability remains on a very high level. Looking at the operating profit development, you see that the positive development of the Group's operating profit with an increase of 18.7% to &#x20AC;761 million was driven by a strong performance in both divisions. Also contributing to this increase was the income of &#x20AC;60 million, arising from the amendment made to our UK pension plans.</p>
          <p>From 2012 onwards, the special contribution to the UK pension scheme will lead to a lower cash payment than in the previous years. The one-off income in the first quarter was included in the operating profit as part of corporate activities.</p>
          <p>The operating profit in Gases continued the double-digit growth track and increased by 16.3% to &#x20AC;727 million, also the margin increase continued. With additional 60 basis points, the margin reached the level of 27.3%. The increase in profitability in the first quarter 2011 compares to the first quarter 2010 was due to a positive price volume effect as well as positive contributions of our efficiency improvement and process optimization measures within the framework of HPO.</p>
          <p>The Engineering business again achieved a strong operating profit growth with an increase of 21.6% to &#x20AC;62 million. The operating margin in the Engineering division remained strong with 10.5%. This strong profitability has been driven by the successful execution of a number of individual projects. The sales bridge on page 6 gives you more insight in our Gases performance. As mentioned earlier, the underlying price and volume effect excluding acquisitions for the three months period reached 8.3%. This strong comparable growth rate proves that the ongoing good growth momentum remained intact also in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Currency effects remained with 4.8% supported, although they have decreased from 7.6% in the full-year 2010. The sales impact from the pass-through of higher natural gas prices as well as from consolidation was slightly positive.</p>
          <p>To deep dive into the operating segments, please turn to slide seven. Kindly be reminded that during the reporting period, we changed the segment structure of the gas distribution and reallocated regional responsibilities. The first operating segment is Europe, Middle East, Africa from <mark type="ph" /> listing of (09:00) the region Continental Northern Europe, the region Eastern Europe and Middle East and the new merged region Africa, UK, Ireland.</p>
          <p>The second is Asia/Pacific, which covers the region Greater China, the region South and East Asia and as well as the region South Pacific. And the third operating segment is Americas, which of course includes North and South America.</p>
          <p>In the appendix, on slide 20, you can find an overview of the total historical data of 2010 for the new operating segments for your reference.</p>
          <p>I come now to the sales development in the operating segment starting with Europe, Middle East, Africa. In this operating segment, we achieved sales growth of 10.2% to &#x20AC;1.393 billion. On a comparative basis, the growth in sales was 6%. The economic recovery in the EMEA region continued to strengthen in the first quarter of 2011. We have been able to achieve volume and price increases especially in liquefied and cylinder gases. We have seen in particular a further recovery of the cylinder business in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>In the on-site business, there was an improvement in the capacity utilization of existing plants as well as new plants that have gone on stream after the first quarter 2010. Examples of these are the air separation plants in Bremen in Germany, in Scunthorpe in the UK, which supplies Linde's major customers ArcelorMittal, EMCO, Tata Steel with industrial gases.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, these plants had not yet commenced operations. In Sweden, the country's first terminal for liquefied natural gas started production at the end of 2010 and became fully operational in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We own and operate the terminal and sell the LNG to customers in industrial segments and in transported shipping. With this new terminal, Linde has gained entry into a promising growth area with strong synergies with our existing industrial customer base.</p>
          <p>In Asia/Pacific, we achieved a high rate of growth boosted by an on-going dynamic economic situation, and by our leading positions in these markets in Asia. In the first quarter of 2011, sales in this region grew 22.5% to &#x20AC;707 million.</p>
          <p>On a comparative basis, the increase in sales was 11%. Strong economic growth in greater China region and in the markets of South and East Asia continued in the first quarter. In this economic environment, we achieved double-digit growth rates in all industrial gas segments in greater China.</p>
          <p>With our integrated business model, we benefited from the continuously rising demand in the market for liquefied and cylinder gas. In the on-site segment, the development of the business was driven in part by ramp-ups and stock-ups of several plants.</p>
          <p>Compared to last year, two air separation plants came on stream in Eastern China in the Ningbo Daxie industrial cluster. Here, we are supplying oxygen to Ningbo's steel, steelworks and oxygen and hydrogen to the chemical company Hanwha. The further start-up that impacted the growth in Asia/Pacific was a new air separation plant in Malaysia, which started production in the second half of 2010. With an investment volume of around &#x20AC;45 million, this plant is our biggest single investment in Malaysia.</p>
          <p>In addition, Linde officially started operations of Australia's first micro-LNG plant. This joint-venture project includes the supply of six filling stations for the transport company in Tasmania. In respect to Asia/Pacific, I would also like to highlight that last month we signed an agreement to build and operate a large hydrogen and synthesis gas plant in western China in the Chongqing Chemical Park. Later you will see a detailed slide of this new investment.</p>
          <p>In this operating segment, Americas, sales in the first quarter grew by 12.8% to &#x20AC;580 million. On a comparable basis, the increase in sales was 11.1%; all top regions did contribute this growth. In North America, the improvement in the general economic situation resulted in higher demand for industrial gases. We were able to achieve significant rates of growth in all product areas, here we benefited from start-ups of new plants that have gone on stream only after the first quarter 2010. The hydrogen plant in Lemont, Illinois is one major example.</p>
          <p>In South America, we achieved double-digit growth rate in the first quarter of 2011. All product areas saw positive trends with the strong performance of the on-site and Healthcare segment. The profitability of our operating segment is outlined on page 8 with a detailed operating profit by operating segment.</p>
          <p>Starting with EMEA again, the operating profit in EMEA increased at a faster rate than sales, 4.5% to &#x20AC;395 million, the operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 28.4%. This trend was driven by all regions, the implementation of the various productivity improvement and process standardization initiatives as part of the HPO program made a positive contribution to this development.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Asia/Pacific, the operating profit rose by 21% to &#x20AC;196 million. Since we believe in an ongoing strong growth in Asia, we have pre-invested in our Asian setup to be well prepared for the projected growth. This has slightly affected the margin in the first quarter. Despite our pre-investments, we expect that at the year-end, the margin will be at least on the level of the last year. To sustain this high level of profitability, Linde is continuing year two with the further implementation of its HPO program.</p>
          <p>In the Americas, the operating profit rose 21.4% compared with prior year quarter to &#x20AC;136 million. The operating margin was 23.4%, which is an increase of 160 basis points. Here the achieved substantial margin improvement was supported by the implementation of HPO and one-time effect.</p>
          <p>I'm now moving over to the Gases sales product area on page 9. As already highlighted in the beginning, the comparable growth in this first quarter was 8.3%. The positive performance of all product areas reflects the overhaul positive trends in the Gas division. The Healthcare product area again saw steady growth, achieving sales of &#x20AC;292 million, which is an increase of 5.8%.</p>
          <p>The highest rate of sales growth was in the On-site business, strongly supported by ramp-ups as well as stock-ups of numerous new production plants and better capacity utilization of existing plants. Sales rose here on a comparable basis by 12.1% to &#x20AC;659 million.</p>
          <p>Sales in the bulk area in the first quarter increased by 7.3% to &#x20AC;636 million. The late cycle cylinder business continued its recovery trend, achieving growth of 7.5% to &#x20AC;1.075 billion.</p>
          <p>I think it's worth moving forward to the next slide, page 10, for the quarterly view of these growth rates. With 5.8% comparable growth in the first quarter of 2011, the Healthcare business continued with the growth profile, which is in the range of the expected organic growth rate of 5% to 6%.</p>
          <p>In the Tonnage segment, sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% against the strong quarter in the previous year. Besides the already indicated improved capacity utilization, this growth is also driven by stock-ups and ramp-ups, part of our project pipeline.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we have also seen strong growth rates in the Merchant business with 7.3% comparable growth in the bulk business and 7.5% in the cylinder business. The growth trends in the cylinder business which is the late cycle business shows a clear recovery of this business and was strongly supported by the growth in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the project pipeline in the Gas division on page 11. For the years 2009 to 2012, we haves allocated a total investment amount of &#x20AC;2.8 billion to project above &#x20AC;10 million, which go on stream in the respective years. Of this investment amount, 70% are dedicated to growth markets. Since our last communication, the total project amount by on-stream date for the year 2012 further increased by &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;650 million.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we have also signed additional contracts for start-up dates beyond 2012. In general, we see an increasing number of project opportunities with a large portion in growth markets. In respect to the project opportunities, we have provided already an indication with our full-year results. We have not seen any major changes in the mentioned amount of opportunities of around &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>We have seen further project wins in growth markets but also in the mature markets in the last quarter. These wins have been across all customer segments. One example is our new project in Chongqing, which you can see on the next slide, slide 12. You might be aware that in China, a new chemical cluster in the Chongqing area is under development. This cluster saw supply at the fast developing investment China area, which represents more than 200 million people. We have already moved very early into this cluster with our long-term joint-venture partner Sinopec in 2009.</p>
          <p>The plant is expected to go on stream this year. Now Linde has been able to strengthen further its position within the cluster with the already mentioned new project in Chongqing. Linde and its partner CCPHC will invest more than &#x20AC;200 million in this project. This fully consolidated subsidiary will supply via pipeline to BASF and the HYCO project and various CCPHC projects in the chemical cluster.</p>
          <p>The large scale HYCO plant will be designed for the processing and purification of up to 400,000 normal cubic meters per hour <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:40) and will produce carbon monoxide, hydrogen and syngas. The expected on-stream base is scheduled for 2014. This new project is an important step in building up this cluster, but it is also a larger project for our Engineering division, which will supply this plant. This brings me to the Engineering division on the next page.</p>
          <p>The international large-scale engineering market continued to stabilize in the first quarter of 2011. In its four main product segments, Linde saw a revival in investment activity. Sales in the Engineering division in the first quarter of 2011 increased by 14.3% to &#x20AC;591 million. The successful execution of the number of individual projects supported the growth in operating profit which increased by 21.6% to &#x20AC;62 million.</p>
          <p>The operating margin was 10.5% and there was, again, significantly exceeding the target figure of 8%. The order intake was &#x20AC;444 million in the first quarter. As you know, in the engineering project business, a quarterly year-on-year comparison is only of limited use due to the project character. As in previous quarters, order intake in the first quarter of 2011 was characterized by a number of small and mid-size new orders and over 90% of incoming orders were <mark type="ph" /> end (25:35) released, spread over the following regions, Asia/Pacific, North America and Europe. More than half of the order intake is related to the product areas for natural gas and air separation units, while the remainder was evenly distributed across the other plant types.</p>
          <p>Linde's order backlog remains high, end of the quarter it stood at &#x20AC;3.7 billion. I want to ramp up my presentation with a look at our cash flow statement on slide 14. Our operating cash flow increased by 11% from &#x20AC;397 million to &#x20AC;440 million. The working capital has increased due to higher business activity and changes in the inventory, such as the first filling of our LNG terminal in Sweden and advance payments to suppliers of the Engineering division. This partly one-time negative impacts on working capital were compensated by the payment of the BOC Edwards vendor loan in the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>We have increased our free cash flow before financing by 13% to &#x20AC;233 million in the first quarter. Furthermore, we made payment of &#x20AC;237 million for investments in tangible and intangible assets. For the full year, we expect investments to exceed the level of 2010. The majority of the free cash flow before financing was used for further debt reduction in the first quarter. The net debt figure decreased by &#x20AC;275 million to &#x20AC;5.222 billion. The rolling net debt EBITDA ratio for the last 12 months was per end of March, 1.7 times.</p>
          <p>Let me finish with our outlook on page 15. On Group level, we expect in 2011, further growth of sales and operating profit. Furthermore we reconfirm the target range of &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings of our HPO initiatives in the years 2009 to 2012. In the Gases division, we expect an increase in sales. This gross will be driven in particular by continuous ramp-ups out of our tonnage pipeline as well as ongoing structure growth in healthcare and the continuous recovery in the merchant product area, mainly cylinder. We aim to achieve an over proportionate operating profit increase.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering division, we expect 2011 sales to reach at least the 2010 level and an operating margin of at least 8%. Please let me also highlight our midterm targets, which we have published together with our annual report in March. In 2012, we want to achieve on a Group level an operating profit of at least &#x20AC;4 billion and we want to further grow the adjusted return on capital employed to 14% or higher.</p>
          <p>For the Gases division, the average CapEx sales ratio shall be 13% plus. The plus if you remind is for large scale energy projects. As you can imagine, our ambition is to outperform the market with our revenue increase.</p>
          <p>To summarize, my key observations over a successful quarter. There are strong mega trends offering structure growth potential in our core businesses and we have the right setup regarding the local market shares, technologies and customer contacts. This we have just proven in the Chongqing cluster. We have further improved our already solid financial structure and profitability and therefore are ready to embrace the upcoming opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are full committed to further strengthen our portfolio on our continued path towards a high performance culture. Thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now. I hand back over to Cindy for the questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line from Jean De Watteville from Nomura. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. Hi, Jean De Watteville from Nomura. Thanks for taking my question. So the first question I would like to ask is, you're talking about improvement in the investment climate in engineering in western Europe and I was wondering if you could be &#x2013; bring a little more color on which area and which region you see investment decision improving? And in particular, I'm interested about your view about steam crackers investments; obviously, we know that there was a significant supply shock in the Middle East about two years ago. But propylene and propylene derivates, and butadiene derivatives are pretty tight and so there would be a case for naphtha crackers and that gas is cheap in North America, we've seen some decisions here for investing in steam crackers. I'm interested your comments there and how you are positioned? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, you talked about LNG per terminal projects, which seems to be quite different to some of your competitors and I'm interested here if you can bring some color on the strategy around that? Does that have strong synergies with the natural gases? Does that open doors to other industrial gases contact or local merchant contracts and what's the typical size of it? And how big could you think that business could be?</p>
          <p>And the last question, on cylinders, pretty nice performance this quarter, particularly if you compare with L'Air Liquide. I think one difference here is that L'Air Liquide obviously does not report the specialty gases in their cylinder, they separate that in the different division, can you give us this &#x2013; the performance of cylinders excluding electronic? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jean, for your questions. I think I hand over for those first two questions related to engineering and also to the LNG strategy here, especially in Scandinavia, to Dr. Belloni</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Jean, this is Aldo. I start with your steam cracker question, we actually mentioned this, the improvement is global, it's not just Western Europe. With regard to the olefin business, you're right there is a repositioning of the industry, the C3 and C4 chemistry are taking a lot of attention by the big players, also by the national oil companies. We are participating in a number of this, as we speak, we're talking about India, Oman, Qatar, Uzbekistan and as you also mentioned, we are very intent to the revival of steam cracker projects in North America, primarily hinging on the abundance of C2 plus material from the shale gas deposits.</p>
          <p>These deposits are very reaching C2 plus hydrocarbons, which have to be of course, first of all, removed for pipeline gas utilization but at the same time, they have created a potential market &#x2013; I say potential, because we have not yet seen some final decision. But most chemical players are looking and are studying the location of new crackers in North America to make use of this raw material source. So we know about it, we are very well planned into this community and we are very, very hopeful that here and there we would be successful. Also, Saudi Arabia is still talking <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:23) and we would be prepared to work there as well as in the past.</p>
          <p>Coming to the &#x2013; what Linde defines merchant LNG strategy, where the terminal in Stockholm, of course, is kind of a lighthouse project but we do the same in other geographies like in Australia for instance. This business is, of course, sustained by two factors, first of all, a logistic factor, the lack of pipelines density in certain parts of the world, where it is not economical to invest in Greece, due to the low density of potential customers, number one; and number two, of course, the environmental pressure. The key carbonization of fuel as much as possible and LNG of course is or natural gas very conducive to this reduction of CO2 emissions. So in some parts of the world where the combination of these two key drivers, talking about Sweden, which is a very good case study. We will be playing this LNG capability in three ways.</p>
          <p>First of all, some encore customer like hydrogen plants located in refineries nearby -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nearby the terminal I mean; secondly, of course, we do have a position in the LPG business in Scandinavia. Therefore, we will be selectively substitute LPG cus &#x2013; or convert LPG customers to LNG. This is as I said, it is primarily due to the better environmental performance of the fuel. These are I would say medium-size customer, industrial operation. And then, of course, we will have some much smaller type of customer, which we are acquiring day-by-day. There are synergies, of course, with the Gas business, because these companies have also the need of industrial gases and we would be pursuing that or even in the case of refining, of course, even small tonnage business.</p>
          <p>So I think this is a very interesting new area of Linde, which has been preceded also by our engineering position, because the LNG in this particular case comes from a plant which we have built-in Norway for a third-party customer. So we have a very strong knowledge and control of the supply chain of the LNG, which is probably the most delicate and difficult piece of the value chain, the chain to be tackled. And so we played a full keyboard between Linde Engineering and Linde Gas in this particular product. And now Georg will address your third question.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth from Westlb Frankfurt.  Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Firstly, I want to ask about this one of impact from this pension scheme adjustment in UK, because you mentioned in the interim report, one that in the second quarter, there should be also impact. Can you give us a little bit color, which size this is? And you mentioned that from 2012 onwards you have lower &#x2013; with the pension expenses, can you give us also a size of that? And I think it's different a little bit, what is the expenses on reported and what is the cash impact? So perhaps give us the different figures for both kinds?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be, looking ahead a little bit on working capital development, do you believe it will &#x2013; yeah, in the next quarter still the same that we have still some negative impact from working capital increase and perhaps at the end of the &#x2013; once again, as we saw traditionally in the history, more going than to further out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you know but for your questions, I think in pensions, it's a very difficult forecast because you have to foresee the parameter development. But overall, the first quarter has the most significant impact therefore we were mentioning it from a P&amp;L perspective. I think this not available in the next quarters on the same magnitude; it's rather a smaller single-digit Euro number over all quarters, which we expect.</p>
          <p>And then we really have to distinguish between the cash impact and I really would like to focus more on the cash impact because, again on the parameter side, it will be also an positive P&amp;L development, but it's difficult to forecast. But our contributions from the cash perspective is something which we can mention. As you know when we took over PUC, we had significant contributions in the first year of &#x20AC;120 million at that point in time in euro also because of the different foreign exchange rate against euro and then British pound.</p>
          <p>This year probably, it will be around I would say &#x20AC;70 million, &#x20AC;60 million, &#x20AC;65 million to &#x20AC;70 million and we assume that next year, it will be roughly &#x20AC;40 million less, something around &#x20AC;25 million to &#x20AC;30 million or so, that is what we can indicate and then of course, it depends on the negotiations of funding principal but that is now done. And so we assume that this is good for the next three years. So it's a significantly lower cash number we anticipate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So and &#x2013; so the net effective is around about &#x20AC;40 million or something from 2012 onward on the cash side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, compared to this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on P&amp;L, that depends clearly above the parameter and but the &#x20AC;16 million was only because it was the bulk of the past two <mark type="ph" /> adjusted (42:23)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was the bulk, the different changes we were negotiating, I mean, this is a long story and it was a very successful long coordination with the trustees, it's about the members' contribution, it's about the restrictions to pensionable earnings and the cap on pensions and all these kinds of things. So we had a lot of things we were putting together. So that is a good success from the perspective here what we achieved in the different plans in UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we move over to your second question on cash flow, I think overall we expect an increase of the cash flow as you would anticipate and from a working capital perspective, that should be in line with the <mark type="ph" /> safe (43:07) development I would argue; of course, it is also difficult to foresee, but as you know, I think we have an more busy pipeline in front of us when we talk about opportunities in engineering, so I think that is the right guidance at that point in time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Thanks for taking the question. First, the dynamic in the developments of the emerging markets isn't very evident now in your reporting structures, so I'm wondering if you could describe for us the comparable growth you've been seeing in developed markets such as the U.S. and Western Europe. And then if you would, could you possibly split that into price and volume growth? And then secondly, 2011 guidance does seem a bit cautious, given the first quarter's results, I'm wondering where you see risks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for your question. I think on the development, you can clearly see that, I mean, we have in the text the reference against the new structure in the operating segments, I think you can see that &#x2013; I think it is the expected recovery in North America especially, which was positive in all segments from healthcare to merchant and tonnage. A good recovery and when we focus more on continental northern Europe, UK, of course, UK was a little bit softer in the bulk area, but still positive compared to western Europe from a continental perspective. And it is, let us say, catching up with North America, it is different from country to country and in Western Europe as you know. From an price- volume perspective, we don't count that out on a quarterly basis, but overall, I think we can mention that the volume of cost was more pronounced than the pricing. But as I said earlier, pricing was contributing positively to the performance of the Gases business.</p>
          <p>When we talk about the forecast, I think that is our normal way of communicating. When you ask us about risks, of course when we look into the climate, the climate is further improving, it is normally and you talk to the business people, it's all very positive but definitely the visibility and the forecast period has become shorter since the heat of the crises. And I think this is in a way the risk &#x2013; the forecast from a customer perspective is on today's perspective, really significantly shorter what they tell you than it was pre-crisis. And I think this is the reason from an perspective of being an &#x2013; a sensitive business person when we talk about the forecast. But, overall, the mood is positive and of course you know the risks from a global perspective, also from a macroeconomic perspective as well as from the perspective of the events in the politics, the revolutions in North Africa, all these kinds of things. I mean, volatility has increased since the crisis and that is the reason why we keep our guidance more careful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, few questions, if I may, the first on investments. In Q1, your investments are slightly below the guidance as a percentage of sales, can you give us the guidance when most of your investments should come in 2011? And the second question, the cylinder gases, in Eastern Europe, where do we stand compared to 2008 maybe you can give us a kind of indication? And then lastly, can you give us a flavor on how long the operating margin in Asia/Pacific is affected by the pre-investments and then the structured growth initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Markus for your questions. I think we indicated the expected CapEx amount for 2011 in our last call is around &#x20AC;1.5 billion, which we expect roughly. When we look into the development of the cylinder business, in Eastern Europe, this is compared to last year double-digit, which is of course very positive. Your last question on Asia-Pacific, as I said in my comments, we assume that we will be at least for the full-year on last year's level. So it will be an &#x2013; let's say not one time, but it is a pre-investment, which is especially visible in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again a follow-up question on the first two questions particularly on the investments. Can you give us a feel when this &#x2013; your investments will come more on the first half now in Q2 or then more at the end of the year of this &#x20AC;1.5 billion? And on the cylinders, can you also give us a kind of index compared to 2008? Are we now 10% below 2008 or where do we stand for &#x2013; compared to the 2008 level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the pacing is not too easy but what we have seen in the past as you know, the profile is also from an investment perspective more pronounced to the end of the year always. I think this is the normal pattern in a way but it can be little bit different depending on &#x2013; of the size of the projects you win and then execute. But overall I would say it is more pronounced to the second half than to the first half, no question about that.</p>
          <p>This question of level of activity against the pre-crisis level of 2008, I think is very different from the different product segments in the different areas. I think tonnage has recovered significantly, as we pointed out also in our full year call already. So overall the PGP business, I think is not on the full level of 2008 especially in Eastern Europe. It's in a way, Eastern Europe was late, we have now seen two quarters of recovery, which is very positive and probably this is the rate. It will soften a little bit against the end of the year, I would say from a growth rate perspective, not in absolute terms because we also saw some recovery in the second half of last year. So it will be the level around, I don't know, seven or so, I think that is the growth rate we can expect for &#x2013; from a cylinder perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. I have got four questions, if I can, please. Firstly, just a point of clarification, if I &#x2013; removing that UK pension effect from the non-gases and engineering EBITDA, which actually gives us a charge of &#x20AC;44 million or so in the first quarter. I wonder if you've got some guidance for that number for the full year, please.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just to go back to this &#x2013; the discussion about the LNG terminal in Sweden, just &#x2013; should we look at that as a &#x2013; as an industrial gas contract, in other words, is that virtually the same contract terms, internal rate of return expectations and so on?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, you've talked a little bit about the pre-investment situation in Asia, I wonder if you could just detail the one-off effect that you think boosted margin in the Americas and then perhaps quantify the event &#x2013; the net effect of both, please, in the quarter? And finally, the contract with CCPHC, this is a slightly sort of broader question, but I was surprised particularly given that you have the contract with the air separation unit on the construction side of chems as well. I was surprised that the air separation part or the atmospheric gas part of the CCPHC contract went to Praxair and you won the HYCO contract. Can you perhaps explain why that might have been split, is that a deliberate decision on the part of the CCPHC to prevent one of you getting a, let's say, stranglehold on the &#x2013; on that &#x2013; on the Chongqing region or is something more &#x2013; something sort of elsewhere that would have determined that decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your four questions, Peter. I think I start first with the LNG question, The LNG business is in a way here linked to similar business model in Scandinavia as it is in our industrial customer base, visible for the merchant business, so it is a bulk-related kind of business model, with similar durations. From a margin perspective, of course, you do have here the impact of the pass-through of the natural gas price as an input cost, so it comes with a slightly lower operating margin as we know it from other businesses, too, which do have an significant fixed cost impact. So that is slightly lower, but I think it's a overall &#x2013; it's a very positive development as Aldo mentioned in his answer, it fits perfectly into the strategy of our industrial gases customer footprint in Scandinavia.</p>
          <p>So from the overall correction related to corporate tender cost, and the cap out, I think, yes, you will see an slight increase of the corporate cost over the course of the year, this is also in a way pre-investment to our commitment to grow, it is related to also doubling functions in Asia from an corporate perspective; in some respect, it's also related to some of our HP own driven IT development where we invest into the platform. So from that perspective, this is visible so it's not negative, it's really driven by growth and by our standardization which we are working on very hard over the last years already.</p>
          <p>So I don't have a really a guidance with me but it's not wrong if you have &#x20AC;40 million on a quarterly basis as an assumption. I think that would work. From an perspective of North America, there was a question from your side, can you repeat that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed, you talked about one-off effects that boosted the margin in the Americas. I wonder if you could explain what those are and then quantify the net effects of the Asian issues that depressed margins and the American issues -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't mix up, Peter. I do not want to mix up here, Asia/Pacific and North America. But I can tell you that the impact from North America was driven by our big hit in 2009 when <mark type="ph" /> lined by bezel (56:08) moved into a chapter 11. So that's a single-digit U.S. dollar number so from that perspective that is the reason for North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so it is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:21) -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is over to &#x2013; related to the CCPH, the question to Dr. Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter, this is Aldo. Of course these issue award was not predetermined, as you correctly pointed out, we had already been successful in the same area with the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:44) pack, which is called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (56:46). And therefore, it's normal that for a second opportunity you cannot charge too many merchant credits to your investment as somebody else was the new entrant and this is part of the explanation.</p>
          <p>Second, of course, it has to do also with the general appetite, I mean we have a very, very challenging project with this hydrogen carbon monoxide facility, this is not a steamer format, this is not a partial oxidation, this is a unique plant using several gas, multi-sources and multi-products. This is a plant, which only Linde could build and we are very, very committed of course. I think this is a kind of an explanation why the one part of the project went to Linde and the other one to Praxair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. Thank you very much for that. Could I just come back on that? You said that secondary separation you can't charge too many merchant credits unlike Praxair, but surely that would generally argue that second or third contracts in a particular cluster would tend to go to third parties rather than the existing producer and of course that isn't entirely consistent with the idea that once you're in position in a cluster or a particular region, you can start then to monopolize that region, am I missing something about that particular situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the two &#x2013; the sites are not adjacent, on the cost something where you have the synergies in terms of operation or logistics. Chongqing is not a city; Chongqing is a region more or less. Yes, of course, the desire of monopolizing a region is reflects something that all gas companies, but I think one has to be reasonable and I think we're very much satisfied with the position which we have developed, we are pursuing other opportunities not at the same proximity of the first plant and I think there is space for more than one gas company and there are already incumbent companies in this part of China.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. Yes, it's just one question really; it's regarding the Cylinder business again. You keep mentioning Eastern Europe having seen a decent recovery; I'm just wondering what's happening at all if anything in Western Europe? If we look at the cylinder market in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia, etcetera, I would have thought Germany might have been seeing some sort of volume life now, so it's really the cylinder business across the Western Europe countries. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said earlier, it's visible in all the geographies, especially pronounced in Eastern Europe, but when we look into Western Europe, it's positive in UK, it's positive in continental Northern Europe, more in Germany and the North than in the South. I think that's also very obvious about the macro economic developments. So I think this is the detail we wanted, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is this something you expect momentum to continue forward? Because I mean, I heard you got into the cylinder business maybe  7% for the year, but I would of thought with that latest cycle of business coming through in your big markets in Western Europe, that scenario &#x2013; that could actually continue to see year-on-year <mark type="ph" /> redemption (1:00:33).</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Nadeshda Demidova from Equinet. I have just one question left. I know we should not look at margin in the near, continuing division on a quarterly basis. And but nevertheless, your <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:01:37) margin in Engineering division in Q1, is clearly above your guidance for the full year. I would like to know even margin positively impacted by the favorable procurement effect for project signed in the past or is it just due to the faster completion of project and therefore, do you &#x2013; took the early completion premium, that's what effect &#x2013; force you to keep your margin target for the Engineering division unchanged? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think this is the same explanation as you were referring to which we told you at the year-end. So it's a cautious guidance, so it is an 8% plus target margin, which we keep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But for the margin in Q1, impacted by the development procurement effect to you? Or is this just due to the faster completion?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's an nice occurring effect, I think it's coming out of contracts, still contracts from an peak level, pre-crisis executed in the crisis, this is one effect. And this is also a successful claim management with suppliers for example. So it's a multiple effect.</p>

          <p>A good business is as you know in the other activities when I gave to Peter, I gave the answer about cost expectation of this line others and center. This includes just from an perspective of our expectation. So from a revenue perspective and this is always in our quarterly report. The sales of the other activities is mainly here -- so here you have the numbers, here you have the development.
