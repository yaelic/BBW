          <p>Thank you, Julie. Welcome to today's Second Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin, I'd like to review the logistics and format of the call. Some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.</p>
          <p>And now for the call participants and format &#x2013; today's call is being hosted from Paris, where I am joined by both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and also Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the second quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter income from continuing operations was $1.16 per share, up $0.10 sequentially and $0.14 above the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Oil Field Services second quarter revenue grew 8% sequentially, reflecting strong growth in all geographical areas despite the impact of Canada's spring break-up on North America. Outside of North America, Oil Field Services revenue grew 11% sequentially. All technologies grew sequentially, with IPM, Completions, VCS, Testing, SIS, and Drilling and Measurement registering double-digit growth rates, while WesternGeco was essentially flat with the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil Field Services generated $1.7 billion in pre-tax operating income, up $202 million from the first quarter, with margins improving by 129 basis points to 28.1%. Outside North America operation, margins improved by 218 basis points to 29.4%. By area, Oil Field Services highlights were as follows, with comments on sequential basis. North America pre-tax margin declined 167 basis points to 23.9%, where the improvements in the U.S. land GeoMarkets, which witnessed strong Web Services and Wireline activities, and in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which saw increased demand of high-margin Drilling and Measurements technologies, were more than offset by the impact of the spring break-up in Canada. Without the impact of Canada, North America margins improved sequentially despite the continued increase in cost of operations.</p>
          <p>Latin America pre-tax margin rebounded by 296 basis points to 23%, primarily due to increased demand for high-margin technologies offshore Mexico/Central America, together with a more favorable activity mix in Brazil. In addition, lower IPM project start-up cost on land in Mexico/Central America also contributed to this improvement.</p>
          <p>For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pre-tax margin improved 181 basis points to 28.2%. The North Sea experienced a record quarter with high-margin Drilling and Measurement technologies gaining from higher drilling activity and Wireline benefiting from the drilling of high-pressure, high-temperature wells. In addition the rebound of East Russia following the slowdown in the winter and a more favorable activity mix in West and South Africa GeoMarket also contributed to this improvement. This performance was partially offset by operational delays in the Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea GeoMarket.</p>
          <p>Middle East/Asia pre-tax margin increased by 148 basis points to 36.3%, most notably due to an increased demand for high margin Wireline, Drilling and Measurement, and Web Services technologies in the China, Japan, Korea, Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, and Gulf GeoMarkets. This performance was also driven by a more favorable activity mixed for exploration-driven services in Australia and Thailand/Vietnam. However these increases were partially offset by slowdown in India and Qatar.</p>
          <p>WesternGeco pre-tax income was $196 million and the margin of 29.2% were in line with the previous quarter, as improvements in Land and Data Processing performance were partially offset by the impact of the multiclient sales mix in North America.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 20.9%, which was higher than last quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings in WesternGeco, as well as the positive impact in the prior quarter of the favorable resolution of tax determination in a number of countries. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year.</p>
          <p>The earnings for the quarter included $41 million of expenses relating to stock-base compensation costs. Net debt was $2 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Significant liquidity events during the quarter included: $555 million for a stock buy-back program; $1 billion of CapEx, including $107 million of multiclient surveys capitalized. During the quarter, we bought back 5.45 million shares for $555 million at an average price of $101.90 per share.</p>
          <p>And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. The strong sequential growth seen in the second quarter throughout the eastern hemisphere led to the improved performance in all areas except North America, where the effects of strong growth in the lower 48 states and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was more than offset by a prolonged spring break-up in Canada.</p>
          <p>Growth was helped by increased drilling efficiency in the North Sea, improved performance and lower mobilization costs on IPM projects in Mexico and Russia, and a favorable exploration mix, particularly in the North Sea, Eastern Siberia and Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>The quarter also saw increased amount of well placement technologies and rigless work, as operators strived to increase production from existing fields.</p>
          <p>Looking at the areas in more detail, the U.S. land GeoMarkets in North America recorded strong revenue increases, driven by a robust demand for Well Services and Wireline technologies, in addition to the rebound in activity following the end of the seasonal winter weather restrictions. Offshore, the U.S. Gulf Coast also registered strong growth through demand for Drilling and Measurement Services and a surge in Completion product sales. These increases were largely offset by the seasonal slowdown in Canada.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, sequential revenue growth was strong across the area, led by Mexico/Central America GeoMarket due to the ramp up of IPM projects, as well as to higher offshore activity. Peru/Colombia/Ecuador saw significant improvements due to higher demand for Wireline and Drilling and Measurements technologies, together with increased gain share on IPM activity in Colombia, while the Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarket benefited from strong demand for Well Services and Wireline technologies. In the Brazil GeoMarket, growth was driven by higher exploration activity and increased SIS product sales. The Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarket improved on strong demand for Well Services and Wireline technologies. However, growth was partially offset by operational delays in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Sequential revenue growth in Europe, CIS, and Africa was driven primarily by demand for all technologies across the North Sea GeoMarket, particularly by Drilling and Measurements and high-pressure high-temperature Wireline Services. Strong activity for all technologies in West and Southern Africa, together with increased demand for exploration-related activities in East Russia, also contributed to growth.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East/Asia area, sequential revenue growth was led by the Arabian GeoMarket, with high demand for Well Services and Testing Services technologies, together with increased Completion System product sales. The China/Japan/Korea GeoMarket experience a robust rebound in activity following winter slowdown in the first quarter, while our Australia/Papua/New Guinea grew on increased offshore exploration activity, but resulted in strong demand for Wireline and Drilling and Measurement Services. Growth was also recorded from exploration-related Wireline services in the Thailand/Vietnam, and from Wireline and Well Services technologies and SIS product sales in the Gulf GeoMarket. Well Services technologies and artificial lift products were particularly strong in Indonesia. Activity declines in India and Qatar partially offset these positive factors.</p>
          <p>Oil Fuel Services bidding activity during the quarter was strong, particularly for Drilling and Measurements, Wireline, and Testing Services. This led to a number of significant contract awards, particularly in the area of Drilling Services where advances in rotary-steerable systems and well placement technologies, coupled with increased reliability, are critical to operators in today's environment of very high spread costs for offshore rigs.</p>
          <p>Our WesternGeco sequential revenue was essentially flat, as increases in Multiclient sales and Data Processing were offset by the seasonal drop in marine activity. Significant increases were recorded in the backlog for land operations while marine contract bidding activity remained robust.</p>
          <p>Newly awarded activity included a contract in Indonesia for the proprietary WesternGeco coil shooting azimuthal acquisition technique that uses a single Q-Marine vessel to acquire azimuthal data, thus significantly increasing operational efficiency. Also a contract in Kuwait for the largest Q-Land acquisition and processing contract ever won that is expected to last for two years.</p>
          <p>Turning now to other events, we made a number of acquisitions during the quarter that increased our capabilities or added specific technologies to our portfolio. In Canada, shareholders of Saxon Drilling voted to accept the Schlumberger offer made jointly with First Reserve Capital to acquire the company. Schlumberger has enjoyed a long association with Saxon, which has included operating joint ventures in Mexico and Colombia that deliver Drilling Services to support integrated project management activities.</p>
          <p>Also in Canada, we acquired the business of Extreme Engineering Limited, a leading supplier of unmanned MWD systems to land markets in the U.S. and Canada. This acquisition will help facilitate the rapid uptake of rotary-steerable systems technology in these highly cost-sensitive drilling environments.</p>
          <p>Other technology acquisitions included Integrated Exploration Systems, a Germany-based technology leader in petroleum systems modeling; and Staag Imaging, a Houston-based provider of leading-edge depth imaging technologies for seismic data processing. Both these acquisitions add further strength to our seismic offering in an exploration market that we expect to see more and more demand for technology integration.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the year, we predicted a more complex growth pattern for 2008. Notably, we were uncertain of the evolution of North American natural gas activity and the extent to which delays in the completion of new-build offshore rigs would affect growth. We anticipated solid increases in the Eastern Hemisphere land rig count. At the half-year, the uncertainty around the direction of natural gas drilling in North America has been removed, and extremely high commodity prices have led operators to increase their budgets overseas. We anticipate that approximately 35 new offshore rigs will enter the fleet in the remaining half of the year.</p>
          <p>The overseas land rig count has evolved much as we predicted. It appears that customers are responding vigorously to the current commodity price levels. Inflationary pressures, particularly for certain commodity supplies and some categories of personnel, are increasing worldwide but particularly in North America where the rapid ramp-up in activity is exaggerating the trend. Improved pricing will be key to further investment in some markets.</p>
          <p>In the longer term, we remain convinced that, absent a deep worldwide recession leading to a steep drop in demand, higher levels of investment will have to be sustained to bring some equilibrium to the market. We therefore reiterate our stronger for longer view of the current cycle of exploration and production spending. It is significant that during the quarter, an additional 28 new offshore rigs were reported ordered for shipyards with delivery dates after 2012, increasing the total on order to 180.</p>
          <p>I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much conviction do you have in North America beyond year-end given the rapid increase in production? And do you think you'll be able to book some net pricing gains across all your product lines before the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually haven't even tried to make myself a full conviction on 2009. I think it's too early. I think that there is some pricing power going forward in the stock market. And I think that how much pricing power we have in the big contract cycle towards the end of the year is going to depend on the view of 2009. But I think it's a bit early for me to &#x2013; I would be dishonest if I said I thought I knew what was going to happen in 2009 yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the international, you state in your comments that you're seeing a ramp in international E&amp;P spend. So would you be comfortable with international credit revenue growth in the mid 20s for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no reason to believe that it won't be above 20%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't do that. And just before I give up the floor, in terms of the geographics from higher to lower, how do you think the geographic markets rank in growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think 2008 Latin America will be the star. And 2009, actually I think it's going to be very much influenced by the arrival of a lot of the offshore rigs, which is North Sea, West Africa, Gulf of Mexico, and to some extent, Brazil. And then on land I actually think that Russia will be very strong again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you very much. And nice to hear you're in a more confident mood again, Andrew, than over the previous three quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What am I supposed to say, Ole? I like to say it the way I see it, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you do, and I'm glad you're seeing things a little bit different now. And CapEx at the beginning of the year, you highlighted at that one point in time that it would be 13%. And we felt, I think, at the time of the conference call that it was low. Now you're going up to 29% year-over-year, which seems to say very confident tone for how you see your business. Could you talk a little bit about exactly what product lines, what regions that you have grown more confident on to have this type of a CapEx increase relative to the beginning of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say at the beginning of the year our CapEx was very much orientated to how we saw the evolution of the offshore replete. But what is coming in as supplemental now is probably the big increases in land activity that we had not foreseen, and actually, it's being affected by some of the contract wins we've had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anything in there on product line, more exploration, more development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the bulk of our CapEx is the four big ones. So it's Wireline, Drilling and Measurements, Testing and Well Services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one follow-up. We are seeing the biggest price increases in anything to do with metals, whether it's <mark type="inaudible" /> or drill pipe. I would image that other form of products like Completion or rental tools or anything to do with metal in the well work could be getting some pricing/surprising the type. I mean, how do you see those <mark type="inaudible" /> segments of the market now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, you have to remember that in most of our tools we're using specialty alloys. We're not using the common or garden &#x2013; well, I won't say common or garden. We're not using the steel of the type one uses in drill pipe or casing. So the price increases in specialty alloys are horrible. So, I mean, you look at chrome 25 and stuff like that, the price has doubled. But there's not an availability issue. So there is a cost issue, but not an availability issue in the alloys that we use mostly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your ability to raise prices to compensate for this?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far it's too early to say definitively that it's okay, but it's going quite well.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, sort of elevating the perspective here and speaking broadly about international margins, they were nicely improved this quarter. But going forward, reconcile the tension for me between on the one hand increasing drilling and technological intensity and rising offshore content, on the other hand, on the one hand, with an environment in which life is still fairly competitive on these bigger projects, and some of these projects are being won, not necessarily from you, with sort of seemingly stark pricing and bids, and also cost inflation continues to be relatively unabated. So given all those elements, where do margins go from here internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if people want to maintain or increase their international margins, they are going to have to pay attention to inflation, particularly in any sort of project that requires a great deal of third-party supplies. In technology-centered projects or big offshore drilling or stuff like that, I think that the operators' spread cost of rigs is so huge compared to the marginal increase in pricing that we need that it's not a big issue. Reliability is becoming more important every day. So I don't think that people will win very large offshore drilling projects on price necessarily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So specifically, do you expect international margins to continue improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I said at the beginning of the year that it'll be lumpy, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in a quarter where we have really good exploration activity and really strong drilling activity like this quarter, there's no doubt that margins can increase. In a quarter where you have seasonal weather in the North Sea or China shuts down for the winter, then you probably have margin decline. So I don't think there's going to be a constant linear increase over quarters. But on an annual basis, provided the exploration holds up, I don't see why we shouldn't still have some room to run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the follow-up here, with regard to North America pressure pumping, I was wondering how successful you were in the second quarter and how successful you are on a leading-edge basis with respect to getting fuel surcharges implemented and cost inflation as it relates to fuel addressed? Or does...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fuel surcharges, we are more than reasonably successful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. So, I mean, North American margins came down relatively sharply quarter-on-quarter, yes, largely due to Canada...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, as Simon said at the beginning of his thing, North American GeoMarket margins increased in every GeoMarket except Canada.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Good morning. Andrew, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary around the international operators. You said a vigorous response. That, combined with kind of the 20%-plus &#x2013; I think you'd been talking about high teens international growth rates &#x2013; it does sound like international clearly has picked up within the last two, three, four months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was surprised, as I think we all were, by the strength of the rebound coming out of the winter. And so part of that was just the normal huge pickup in drilling efficiency in the North Sea, stuff like that. But part of it was a real effort to, where people could, to increase activity particularly on land where as you know it's much easier to increase activity than offshore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay, thank you. And then could you generally comment &#x2013; your joint-venture partner, M-I is now in the directional drilling business, so Smith buying WHQ. How does that affect your thinking about the M-I joint venture going forward, and what are the mechanics associated with that JV?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I'm not quite sure what you mean by the mechanics, Dan, but M-I has been &#x2013; is and I hope will remain a very strong partner. There will be competitive situations which will be quite difficult to manage, but they're not very common. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't continue to enjoy a good material relationship with them, with M-I.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of quick ones, hopefully, from me. First, Andrew, I was struck by the comment in the press release concerning the Continental Resources Woodford Shale job and wondering &#x2013; You've talked in the past about the technological evolution within the North American pumping business. And it sort of feels like reading that comment, hearing press releases, or seeing press releases from operators talking about 11- and 12-stage frac, et cetera, that there's perhaps more of a technological revolution going on in that business. Can you talk about the pace of sort of technology uptake and what that could mean for margins just beyond pure pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually, Michael, I think that like any new play or any new play, operators don't &#x2013; they will not pay for technology until they understand what it can do for them. And now we're getting to the stage in shale gas where a combination of horizontal wells and stage fracturing, together with this capacity that we have to monitor fracs in real time, is very different from -If you monitor it and then just give the result to the customer afterwards, it's what we call internally a so-what service. You told me what you did, but you can't do anything about it. If you're doing it in real time, it allows you to start to look at modifying the engineering of the frac as you're performing it, which is really quite important.</p>
          <p>So I think it is not common &#x2013; not just Schlumberger, by the way, but leading players in pressure pumping are now getting to the stage where there is some differentiation in what they can do. And to a certain extent in a tight market, that will reflect well in pricing. In a very slack market, it will allow them to maintain pricing. But there's absolutely no doubt that the technology of contact, reservoir contact or contact with a well bore is improving fairly dramatically at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. How would you characterize the uptake today versus what you might have thought 12 months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's suddenly accelerated. I mean, 12 months ago we were experimenting with a lot of this stuff, but it's now I think accelerating. I think our issue is going to be providing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Second question from me, a lot of discussion of mix internationally, obviously a shift toward exploration helpful. Are you seeing a discernible difference in the oil/natural gas mix on the exploration side given the tightness in the global gas market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regionally, yes. In other words there is a lot of gas exploration in the Middle East for example. Globally, I would say it's still reasonably balanced between them, between oil and gas. What we are seeing more and more and I suspect is that, as you point out, the shortage of worldwide gas means that people are starting to look at unconventional sources of natural gas overseas, which is something we thought would come much later. I mean, you must have seen some of these deals in Australia where operators are going off to coal bed methane for example, even to feed LNG sometimes. So this is really very different.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I understand it correctly, the revenue per rig and profit per rig in international gas is even greater than the difference in North America. Is that...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the big LNG projects, that's undoubtedly the case</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point being that most of the developments have penalties attached to late delivery of the gas, and therefore execution of the development projects is key.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I just wanted to talk a little bit about &#x2013; in your comments in the press release and not in your comments this morning, you talk about rigless work a number of times. And I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a sense of what percentage of your total revenue is rigless, and how those margins kind of stack up relative to the overall business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chuck, I don't know is the honest answer today because it varies very much going country by country and area by area. When we have campaigns of rigless work, the margins are really very good because we normally get to control the execution, which means that we can be extremely efficient in the use of our resources. So we mentioned for example one or two contracts in the press release where we have 300 wells to do. If we control the logistics on that, the margins are very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess in Latin America on margins specifically, it looks like you're getting closer to those peak levels that you reached in 2007. Is it safe to say that the startup costs in Mexico are pretty much behind the company at this point? And could you see margins potentially go higher in Latin America as those Mexico costs are completely wound out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually I think that the margins in Latin America, less than the startup costs now, will be driven by the drilling performance. And we still have room to improve there. So to the extent that we improve, margins would improve. But I would also say that in Latin America there is the same shift as everywhere else towards more drilling, particularly of exploration wells, and therefore the actual revenue mix is going to improve, not just IPM.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on the directional drilling side. Directional drilling continues to be a pretty solid product line for a number of years here globally, and you've recently made a small Canadian directional acquisition. And could you comment on maybe how tight the directional drilling market is today, and more specifically maybe how you see the North American market for directional services in the context I guess of higher directional rig count and then a rising rig count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that if you watch the rate of growth in the horizontal rig count in the U.S. compared to the vertical rig count, for all sorts of different reasons, be they geological reasons or be they infrastructure reasons, there's no doubt that directional drilling will go on increasing. But directional drilling in North America has to be provided at a cost that is effective. Otherwise it's not going to grow the way it should be. So our purchase of Extreme Engineering brings us a service where we can use MWD without manning it, probably by monitoring it from a centralized drilling center. So we still think that it has, in the land market both in the U.S. and overseas, a long way to run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at that as a growth driver, how are you assessing that for Schlumberger? Are you looking at it more of an investing in maybe the lower-end directional tools or is this an acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, we could've built one ourselves, but the fact is that Extreme Engineering was a company that was originally funded by Shell with technology from Shell. And the decision of having it available immediately through buying the company rather than developing our own became fairly obvious because of the rate of growth in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one last question will be on the bit side. You've talked about wanting to be back in the bits business. Can you talk a little bit about &#x2013; I guess no pun intended there &#x2013; about strategic thinking behind this and what aspects of the product line that are most important to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the access to bit technology is because of the interface between bit technology and the BHA and the steering capability. And so we need access to bit technology. We don't necessarily need to own a bit company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you're planning to address this desire, is it more through a joint venture or technology sharing. How do you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we actually do own a small bit company where we can build our own prototypes. And we probably would let out the manufacturing of those prototypes under license to one of the existing bit companies.</p>

          <p>Good. Now I have just questions about two specific contracts. You mentioned the people will not win these big offshore contracts on price. I wanted you to comment on InTech's big win done on the petrobras work in Brazil and what you make of that. And then secondly, I wanted to ask you about the Chicontepec area in Mexico, Weatherford obviously bidding less on ATG1 and ATG2 than you bid on Chicontepec-3, and whether you think you'll have to bring your prices down on future Chicontepec work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't like commenting on competition's pricing policy, Jim. I don't think InTech is a good competitor. I don't think that their Brazil win was on price. And Chicontepec, all I can say is that the big companies bid roughly the same price, and somebody bid very low. And I wish them the best of luck in execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you think that would impact your prices that you would have to work for &#x2013; for peanuts in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second one is in Saudi, where you had spoken about activity levels in Saudi kind of leveling off here over the next year or 18 months or so. Given the rapid increase in the oil price that we've seen and some of the comments out of the Saudis themselves in terms of potentially once again taking up their capacity, has your view on that changed at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not for oil; for gas yes. In other words, the Saudis I think, will probably undertake some major gas development programs inside the Kingdom, but not for oil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>I want to come back because I'm trying to connect the dots, Andrew, in terms of the big increase in the CapEx. You talk in the press release about the strong bidding activity, but it seems like that comment was tied to offshore. And you said in the press release that the international land business is developing as expected. But then in some of your other responses to questions, it seemed like it was the international land that was driving the big increase in CapEx. So can you help us understand that a little bit?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Well. I mean. I was answering the question in function of what Ole asked us about &#x2013; whether or how we planned our CapEx for 2007 &#x2013; 8, sorry. Actually in 2008 we planned the offshore CapEx pretty much. But we probably didn't expect &#x2013; we expected land to respond. We didn't expect the U.S. to respond, and therefore globally on land we need more CapEx.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's not dramatically stronger except in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the size of the CapEx increase would suggest that you have confidence in that continuing into '09, I'm inferring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I mentioned, we have had some contract wins, which means we've had to revise some of the numbers for offshore as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay, all right. Second question, you said that the development of unconventional resources internationally was progressing more quickly than you expected. Does that raise the prospect of frac capacity issues emerging internationally over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've known for some time that the growth in the frac market overseas is going to be much stronger than people would have imagined two or three years ago. So I'm not sure whether that produces a capacity crunch or not because it'll depend so much on North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And the nature of the capacity required for those international projects in terms of the equipment, the technology type, it's similar to what's used in North America or different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Except you don't have the same logistics.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew, I just wanted to touch base on third party revenues for IPM. The first quarter release talked about third-party comps accounting for about 45% of IPM revenues during full-year 2008. The first half has been running something between 33 and 34 implying a big pickup in the second half of the year. Is that still the case or has something changed there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Simon to answer that, if that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, it depends on the area. Overall what you've seen, it's a 34%. Yes, this is the current level of the third-party revenue of IPM. As we go forward and the projects ramp-up is increasing, we will see an increase in the third party. For example, in Mexico obviously it is more than 34%. But as you see the project ramp-up increasing in the future, we're going to see that this percentage slightly increasing, but not significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it sounds like the 45% for full-year 2008's a little high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be high because we are increasing IPM revenue in other places where the third party is less significant than what we have in the Mexico GeoMarket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just based on previous commentary, it suggests that even with third-party revenues increasing in Latin America, specifically Mexico, that margins can still be expanding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So two elements in Latin America increased the margin this quarter was the less startup, as Andrew mentioned, and as we mature in the project, also as Andrew mentioned. And as the efficiency increases, the margins improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Also kind of an IPM-related question here &#x2013; how big do you think the IPM market is from your standpoint on an annual revenue basis? In other words, what is your annual revenue opportunity that you're going after, and how do you expect to see this evolve over the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we don't look at it on that basis. We look at it on a project basis. So we don't pre-calculate a revenue target that we're aiming for. We actually keep a portfolio of projects that we're going after. And normally, apart from Mexico where the market is material, the sale cycle is two to three years. So actually I don't even want to disclose a number because it'll only encourage my friends in other places.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, potentially it's our four big product lines. So it's Wireline, Well Services, Drilling and Measurements, and Testing. And please don't ask me for a number because a huge amount depends on whether that well is dry or it has a find.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think actually there is another factor in Drilling and Measurements, and that is that with rig spread costs at 1.2 &#x2013; it's double the day rate, so say $1.2 million a day &#x2013; people don't fish for stock tools very much. They just cement them in and sidetrack, which means that the build-out of CapEx has to be adjusted for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew, just on this &#x2013; you've mentioned several times on the call the number of offshore rigs being delivered in the next few years. How far along are we, either on the 35 rigs delivered this year or the 180, in terms of allocating contracts for Oil Field Services on those new rigs, and kind of what's your strategy to maximize your presence on each of those new rigs that are being delivered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly I would like to point out that the 35 of this year is very much loaded on Q4, so they may actually slip, some of them, into '09. So if the equipment has to be bolted down &#x2013; so cementing units or pumps or some of the testing spread &#x2013; then the contracts will tend to get allocated, or at least the contracts for the equipment at the time of the build. For Wireline, Drilling and Measurements, and Testing Services, I would say that probably about half the contracted rigs have already awarded those contracts. And the reason they've awarded them is very often because they're operator contract, particularly for exploration rigs that are going to move from country to country. If they tend to be in very mature theaters of operation like the North Sea or Gulf of Mexico, they may come under an existing contract or they will get bid much closer to the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if we compare the new &#x2013; The question is, how are you doing on the new builds compared to the existing fleet of offshore rigs in your market share and various product lines? Do you believe that on the new rigs your market share is the same or better or worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple of questions &#x2013; one, I guess just some clarification on Russia. Andrew, could you, say, quantify year-on-year revenue growth in Russia relative to &#x2013; end margins relative to change relative to the rest of the broader segment? Is it better or less? I guess I was expecting slower Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in the first half-year, it probably exceeded the average of the rest of the Europe/Africa unit. But don't forget we still have the effect of an acquisition in the first half of the year. So it will probably slow a bit in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, but through the effect of the acquisition, not through any lack of activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've been hearing some pain from some of the smaller competitors in the frac business there. How are you &#x2013; did you feel the same...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the frac business has been tough particularly in the South for the first half of the year. There was over-capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did that bring Russian margins down for you overall?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not overall, no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just quickly wanted to switch to North America. You were reluctant to reach out on an '09 forecast that Kurt was fishing for. And your customers all seem to be raising budgets, raising capital, pretty positive outlooks for '09. So is the reluctance just a function of the volatility of the market and the risk to gas prices, or it's just too early to make the call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just too early. I mean, I've been reputed to making too early calls on North America, so I thought this time I would wait a bit, Kevin. I don't know. If you like, it's more in function of what Kurt said, which is the very substantial increases in production that we're seeing. And then you have to take into account the summer and the weather and all the rest of it. And how much is the current oil price affecting gas consumption? The fact is that no LNG is going to the States. There are so many factors in it now that it's quite difficult to make a longer-term call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've got our cycle down to a level where we can make the allocation much later.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Andrew, I wanted to step back and address the stimulation of the Shell reservoirs from more of a mechanical standpoint and try and get an idea. One of the things I've heard about being done recently is what someone called zipper frac to me, whereby you offset the placement of the fracs in the adjacent well bores such that you create an oblique stress field. How much do you think that has the potential to raise productivity of something like the Barnett? It that something that can help take the pressure from 3 million to 5 million a day along with other advances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I have to tell you I just don't know. What I will tell you is that in producing Shell gas reservoirs, geo-mechanics is fundamental. It's in some ways more fundamental than petrophysics. So I am sure there are lots of ideas going around about how you can alter stress fields in such a way as to release the gas. But the fact one of our top scientists spent some time looking at this recently and said one of the biggest issues with Shell gas is nobody actually knows what the production mechanism is. So you may well be right; I don't know. What I do know is there's still a lot of work to be done on how these production mechanisms actually work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and a follow up &#x2013; I wonder if you can share with us what you do know about how the shale oil production mechanism works say in the Bakken shale. That's still kind of a mystery to me, and wonder if you could shed some light on that.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>...on the construction of our vessels. We have one vessel that is delayed about four months, which was supposed to come around about now, but it's not coming till the end of the year. But the eastern eco-vessels seem to be pretty much on schedule; therefore there's no change in the level of CapEx.</p>
          <p>On Multiclient, we have seen in the last quarter some improvement on pre-funding levels. Therefore...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Less CapEx.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...I think we've increased slightly our budget, but really it's marginal. So I would say that, compared to what we showed you at the end of the first quarter, there's really no substantial change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thanks. Now you mentioned that marine bidding was robust. Did we read through there that there's still pricing power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In certain segments of the marine market, there is still pricing power, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My follow-up is to try again sort of, Kevin and Kurt, on America. But I'm assuming that when you're rolling North America, that's inclusive &#x2013; your conviction in improvement is inclusive of Canada as well? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a different way to ask would be, do you know of a commodity price level? Rather, that we all have many variables in front of us, weather, summer, et cetera, but what is this increase from your customer perspective due to the price increase, not just new developments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean our price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm sorry, the commodity price increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think at current levels it's just fine, right? I mean, there is some guarantee of future activity in the extent to which our customers have hedged their forward production. I certainly think that production drops in Canada will mean that there will be a very healthy Canada through the rest of this year and the first quarter of next year. I'm just not prepared to take a definitive position on North America, the whole of North America land for next year yet. I just don't feel comfortable doing it, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and I understand it with the variables in front of us. Very good. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and our final question comes from Alan Laws with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a quick high-level follow-up question on growth. When you look for what's the most important trends for Schlumberger over the next few years, if you looked at like rise of exploration or expansion of the offshore recount or the increasing well complexity or architecture or then just straight-out IPM, what would be the number one driver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I actually think there are probably two drivers. I'm thinking three to five years now, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first driver has to be the extent to which there is a real effort to renew the reserve base and therefore exploration, which will largely be either offshore or in harsh environments. But as I mentioned in answer to I think it was Michael's question earlier, the current gas situation is such that a lot of gas exploration that was not planned two or three years ago is going to happen. So the first is exploration.</p>
          <p>The second is &#x2013; and I've said this before; I'll say it again &#x2013; is that the secret to stemming decline curves is, number one, you have to drill and, number two, you have increase the amount of reservoir contact. So the service intensity around stemming the decline curve will have to increase fairly dramatically if people are serious about it. And actually I think that's a little bit of what we saw in Q2 with the extremely high commodity price.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay, great. That's good for me. Thank you.</p>
