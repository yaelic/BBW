        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcia, and good afternoon everyone. As everyone is aware, our reported earnings this quarter were impacted by the goodwill impairment charge that we announced in the middle of April. As a result, we had a net loss of $50 million under GAAP. But the change, of course &#x2013; the charge, of course, is a non-cash item, and does not affect our cash net income, our ongoing business or our capital ratios. Our cash net income was approximately $1 billion this quarter, which is up 4% from last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Five, our earnings were also affected by market-related losses and a general provision. These reduced our net income by $442 million and earnings by $0.31. As you can see, market-related losses have been subsiding. Our underlying results are solid. And we believe we have tremendous momentum in all of our businesses, with the exception of US retail banking that of &#x2013; that continues to operate in a very difficult industry.</p>
          <p>Our capital ratios are extremely strong, and significantly higher than historical levels. Our Tier 1 ratio was 11.4%, and our tangible common equity ratio is 7.9%. Over the past two quarters we have grown our Tier 1 ratio from 9%, which was amongst the lowest of our Canadian peers, to a current level which places us amongst the highest of our peers. This is the result of both planned capital raising activities, targeted management of our balance sheet, and growth in our cash earnings.</p>
          <p>In the short-term, we believe it is extremely important to be conservatively capitalized because our capital strength provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace and substantial flexibility. We have tremendous opportunities to deploy capital in our existing businesses and toward other opportunities consistent with our strategy.</p>
          <p>Over time, our ratios will likely trend down as we take advantage of attractive ways to deploy capital. And I must say, I have never been more positive in the ability to earn good returns on marginal capital as we begin to exit this difficult economic environment that we've been dealing in.</p>
          <p>We're also maintaining our dividend this quarter at $0.50 per share.</p>
          <p>We believe that our businesses are well positioned for the current economic cycle. It's worth spending a few moments to talk about the environment, and address the potential of our various businesses to perform through different points of the cycle.</p>
          <p>In the context of the global Capital Markets, we are starting to experience stabilization. Credit spreads are beginning to ease. Volatility has moderated from its recent peaks. And investor confidence is increasing. Global economic conditions, however, will be slower to recover, as there is always a lag. In the US, the rate of decline in the economy is easing, which is a good sign. But the economy remains in recession. The auto sector weighs on growth, and the de-leveraging by households and businesses continues to restrain activity.</p>
          <p>The Canadian economy is also in recession, but certainly to a lesser degree than the United States. I would expect the Canadian economy to perform differently than the US through this cycle. As I've mentioned in the past, there are important structural differences between the two markets.</p>
          <p>The underlying fundamentals with respect to the Canadian housing market, consumer debt levels and fiscal policies better enable Canada to manage through this cycle, and hopefully will result in a faster recovery. There are signs that the economy will bottom out in Canada in the first half of calendar 2009. However, we would expect the pace of any economic activity to recover very slowly.</p>
          <p>In terms of RBC, I believe the diversity of our businesses gives us a tremendous advantage over many of our peers. We are the market leader in most of our businesses, and each business performs differently during different stages of the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>For example, our Capital Markets capabilities have enabled us to take advantage of volatility in the current Capital Markets. And will allow us take advantage of further opportunities as global markets to continue to recover and corporate activity, financing, M&amp;A et cetera increases.</p>
          <p>Next, our leading Wealth Management business operations, while stressed by the asset level declines over the last little while, can be expected to strengthen as these asset values begin to recover and investor confidence improves.</p>
          <p>And finally, it is well known that our retail Banking tends to lag overall changes in the economy. But as the leading bank in Canada, we expect to be able to outpace the competition as we move through this cycle.</p>
          <p>I've talked for several quarters, if not years, about the virtues and discipline of our diversified business model because of its ability to generate good returns throughout the cycle. As you know, we focus on managing our company for long-term growth, and remain committed to what we believe has proven to be an appropriate business mix. Our long-standing goal is to have 75-25, roughly 75-25 split between our retail banking, Insurance and Wealth Management businesses on one hand and Capital Markets on the other. Of course you will see some variation of this mix over the short-term, reflecting the stage of the cycle.</p>
          <p>For example, as you're aware, we are currently seeing higher contribution from Capital Markets. This business does have better short-term prospects than the banking business these days, particularly in the United States. But I would point out that the strength &#x2013; this is a result of both strength in their businesses, but also of course, weaknesses in the earnings of our US banking business and Wealth Management businesses as well. However we would expect that that mix to revert to our long-term range, once these other businesses start to improve &#x2013; post improved results as the cycle progresses.</p>
          <p>Our strength, business mix and consistent execution against our strategy has translated into solid performance over the medium- and long-term. Our total shareholder returns compared to our North American peer group are on Slide Seven. We ranked first and outperformed the markets over all periods.</p>
          <p>I will now go through each of our business segments in more detail. Our Canadian Banking segment remains our foundational strength, and has allowed us to continue to invest and grow in other businesses and geographies over time. We continue to generate solid volume growth reflecting our ability to attract new clients and new businesses from existing clients. Our Canadian Banking results compare favorably to all of our peers, and are exceptionally strong given the economic and interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, each of our reported segments fully absorbs the impact of the interest rate environment and charges in interest rates in their respective businesses. Our philosophy is that this provides a more accurate and transparent picture of each segment's performance, and also incidents the right behaviors and decisions within those businesses.</p>
          <p>Margins continue to be affected by the low interest rate environment, particularly spread on deposits.</p>
          <p>In terms of credit performance, our provisioning levels are within our expectations in banking, and consistent with the current economic environment. Our residential mortgage portfolio continues to perform very well, and reflects Canada's solid housing fundamentals and our conservative lending practices.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management, as I said earlier, has been impacted by market conditions, including the impact of low interest rates on spread income from client deposits. The business is very well positioned for the future. And we see significant opportunities and growth as equity markets continue to improve and investor confidence returns. We are expanding our product line, and remain focused on attracting top advisors both in Canada and outside who are able to leverage the strength and stability of RBC for the benefit of their customers.</p>
          <p>Insurance generated consistent earnings in the quarter, adding to our diversified earnings stream.</p>
          <p>International Banking was largely impacted by the non-cash goodwill impairment. As I mentioned, the US economy is still experiencing many difficults, and the business remains challenging &#x2013; challenged as a result of the provisions for credit losses reflected in the weak &#x2013; by the weak environment. We are focused here on refining our operating models to improve efficiencies, and enhance our competitiveness in our US banking business.</p>
          <p>Our Caribbean banking business is a good contributor to earnings. And RBC Dexia continues to execute in the global custody services arena.</p>
          <p>Capital Markets produced solid results, once again demonstrating our ability to take advantage of market conditions and our overall strength as a counterparty. We had strong trading results in the UK and the US fixed income and money market businesses, and US-based equity businesses. Market environment-related losses, as I said earlier, are beginning to subside, reflecting improved conditions in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>Through these uncertain times, it is clear to me that clients are choosing to do more business with RBC because of our brand, our financial strength and our expertise. Across our enterprise, our people are providing advice to help our clients create what is important to them as they plan for their future. We will continue to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace, building on our client base, recruiting key talent, and enhancing our efficiencies.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Morten Friis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gord. Looking at Slides 10 to 14, specific provisions for credit losses increased by $153 million over the last quarter. We also added $223 million to the general provision, which relates primarily to our US banking operations.</p>
          <p>The impact of sustained recessionary conditions in the US has been significant across our US banking portfolios, particularly residential builder finance. Housing and commercial real estate markets remain weak, although there are signs emerging that the pace of decline in home prices and housing starts is moderating.</p>
          <p>In our International Banking segment, the increase in provisions by $89 million from last quarter is mainly attributable to our US Banking operations. This quarter we saw further deterioration in residential builder finance as well as lot loans, home equity, and residential mortgages. Provisions in our commercial and business portfolio remained roughly level with last quarter, including commercial real estate loans.</p>
          <p>Our experience within individual portfolio categories has been consistent with that of our US peers. However, our portfolio mix is different, with a higher concentration in residential builder finance. The homebuilding business is among the first portfolios impacted when the housing market has a downturn and economic condition slow. As a result, residential builder finance portfolios in the US, including ours, have been at the front end of the credit deterioration, and have been impacted more quickly and at a sharper rate than other portfolios.</p>
          <p>Outside of residential builder finance, credit losses typically peak one year after the trough of the economic cycle has been reached. And our US Banking portfolios will remain under pressure until a definitive bottom or turn occurs in the market.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Caribbean, as expected, we are seeing some softening. But it's moderate, and the portfolio is small. Our portfolio is primarily retail and commercial, with nominal direct exposure to hotels and resorts.</p>
          <p>In Canada, the economic weakening has been less severe than in the US, and not a direct result of the housing market. In our Canadian Banking segment, the increase of $81 million in provisions from last quarter is mainly due to higher impaired loans and credit card write-offs. Credit card specific provisions as a percentage of average loans was 437 basis points this quarter. The level of provisions is consistent with what we would expect at this point in the economic cycle, and reflects the sustained recessionary conditions as well as increased personal bankruptcies.</p>
          <p>Our Canadian residential mortgage portfolio continues to perform well, and with a specific PCL ratio of 2 basis points, which is consistent with last quarter. The uninsured portion of the portfolio, including secured lines of credit, has an average loan to value of 55%. The rest of the portfolio is insured.</p>
          <p>In Capital Markets, specific PCL increased $87 million from a year ago, and decreased $15 million from last quarter. We took an additional provision related to impaired loans to an RBC-administered conduit. These are the same loans I've spoken to you about in the past, most recently in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impaired amount is $201 million, and we have taken aggregate provisions of $121 million against these loans. We also had a few additional impaired loans in our US corporate lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>Finally, you'll recall that last quarter we took a provision related to a specific prime brokerage client in our Canadian corporate portfolio. This quarter, we recovered approximately $100 million, or 75% of the provision taken in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 14, let's look at trading value at risk. During the quarter, there was one day with a net trade &#x2013; with net trading loss, which exceeded VaR for the respective day. Both the loss date and the large profit at the end of the quarter arose primarily from credit valuation adjustments, including those for MBIA.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the presentation over to Janice Fukakusa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. As Gord mentioned, we reported a net loss for the quarter of $50 million as a result of the goodwill impairment that we announced on April 16. Cash net income was $993 million, up 4% over last year; mainly attributable to higher trading results, lower market environment-related losses and higher securitization gains, offset by higher provisions for credit losses and higher non-interest expense. The rise in non-interest expense was attributable to higher earnings-based variable compensation driven mainly by higher trading results in Capital Markets, increased expenses due to our prior year acquisitions and the stronger US dollar.</p>
          <p>Capital Markets began to stabilize partway through the quarter, and resulted in lower market-related losses and a lower net unrealized loss position in our available-for-sale portfolios. Tightening credit spreads had both negative and positive implications. We had negative adjustments on RBC debt designated as held-for-trading and on credit default swaps used to economically hedge corporate loans. Positive credit valuation adjustments on derivative trading activities partially offset these amounts.</p>
          <p>Several new US GAAP standards became effective November of 2008. These standards require enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding our use of derivatives and hedging activities, and our continuing involvement with assets for which we've obtained off-balance sheet treatment. These disclosures can be found in the US GAAP reconciliation note of our second quarter consolidated financial statement.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the performance of our five business segments. Starting with Canadian Banking on Slide 16, net income was down 4% from last year, reflecting higher provision for credit losses, continued spread compression and lower mutual fund distribution fees. We continue to grow volumes across all businesses.</p>
          <p>Lower interest rates impacted margins on deposits. Slide 17 shows net interest margin decreased over the year and the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Wealth Management on Slide 18, net income decreased 31% from a year ago due to lower fee-based and spread revenue.</p>
          <p>As shown on Slide 19, Insurance net income was up 9% over last year. This largely reflects lower funding charges, growth in most businesses and an ongoing focus on cost management. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable actuarial adjustments.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to International Banking on Slide 20. The net loss was mainly due to the goodwill impairment and higher provision for credit losses in our US banking businesses that Morten highlighted.</p>
          <p>Looking at Capital Markets on Slide 21, net income was up $407 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher revenue from our sales and trading businesses along with lower market environment-related losses. These factors were partially offset by higher variable compensation, commensurate with the higher trading results, as well as higher loan loss provisions in taxes.</p>
          <p>A large portion of our Capital Markets' variable compensation is based on profits rather than revenue. Revenue only payouts are more the norm in the investment banking industry. We believe our incentive compensation structure strikes a better balance of risk and payout for our shareholders and employees.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 illustrates RBC's total trading revenue. Our strong trading results were driven by increased market volatility, declining interest rates, wider bid/offer spreads and increased client flow. We have higher trading volumes in more traditional, less structured fixed income and currency products such as FX spot, forwards, bonds, money markets and interest rate derivatives.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the questions-and-answers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now take questions from the telephone lines. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Jim Bantis from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A few questions on credit. Morten, one of the ways we continue to look at credit quality and trends is the coverage ratio. And I know each bank's reserve coverage ratio is not apples-to-apples comparison. And yours slipped to about 68%. Of the GILs you've got, the 4.2 billion, how much of that do you think is fully recoverable, i.e., that you won't lose a cent on? To put your coverage ratio in perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me try to put some light on that. The &#x2013; as we've talked about in previous quarters, the coverage ratio that we have reflects the asset mix that we've got, and our view of ultimate recoverability. The biggest driver of our &#x2013; the reduction in coverage ratio continues to be our US Banking portfolios, and specifically the residential builder finance portfolio.</p>
          <p>And maybe what I should do is speak a little bit to the process we have for setting provisions and allowances for that portfolio. It is driven off current view of market appraisals for all the properties that are impaired. The appraisals are done to industry standards reflecting what's recoverable, assuming disposition over a reasonable time, which is not instantaneous, but months rather than years. And the resulting provision is one that gets a fair amount of scrutiny internally from our regulators and from our auditors. And so the outcome is that the &#x2013; if you look at RBC Bank portfolio overall, we have a 16% coverage ratio. So when you take that off the total, our coverage ratio gets north of 100% again.</p>
          <p>So I'll purposely avoid answering your question directly, because the &#x2013; I'll do it indirectly. The provisions that we set reflect our best view of the losses that we expect to take. So to the extent that you expect continued deterioration in the economic conditions, there is likely to be additional provisions on loans that are already impaired. But the current provisions and allowances reflect our view as of today's market. And we actually think it is appropriate. It follows both GAAP and regulatory requirements.</p>
          <p>To the extent that we end up having a bottoming out of the credit conditions and an improvement in overall economic conditions, chances are we will then see coverage ratios improve through increased ability to dispose of assets, and a more positive view on what allowance is appropriate for the portfolio as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I would suspect in the near-term your ability to dispose of assets remains difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It &#x2013; in the near-term the movement is relatively slow. But I would emphasize that we continue to sell modest amounts out of our builder residential portfolio, which is, I think, the area that people tend to be the most interested in, at values relatively close to par. And we don't &#x2013; we expect to continue to sell assets at discounts that are not excessive. But it will be at a modest rate.</p>
          <p>And to the extent the markets continue to deteriorate, clearly that becomes &#x2013; or to stay, continues to stay difficult &#x2013; if it improves those conditions should become somewhat better. I think just overall, if you look at &#x2013; it'll &#x2013; coverage on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis, as I said, we are actually comfortable that the provisions and allowances are appropriate and reflect the appropriate level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And your &#x2013; I remember last quarter you had suggested that your coverage ratio on the US homebuilders portfolio was roughly 20%. Is that pretty well the same ratio at the end of this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I got distracted. What's the question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You had stated last quarter, Morten, that the reserve coverage ratio on the homebuilders portfolio was 20%. And has that dramatically changed quarter-over-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it has fallen somewhat. It's about 16% as we speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that against the total portfolio, or the impaired portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's against the impaired. Just for the record, I know that is the ratio that the industry looks at. It is theoretically, and if you like, the wrong metric. It should be the specifics against the impaired, and the general against the total portfolio, given what the allowances is supposed to reflect. But quarter-over-quarter there has been some further slippage, just given the fact that &#x2013; and maybe I should just add, if you look at our US portfolio overall, we've had a net increase in impaireds of about 280. We have taken specific provision &#x2013; and this is the US wholesale portfolio, you can see it in the supplementals. We've taken provisions of about 507 million on the US wholesale. The &#x2013; of the 223 million increase in the general, 173 of it was associated with the International Banking platform. And as a result of the inflow and outflow through write-offs, the net increase to the allowance is about 18 million. If you look at our total general of 1.9, something in the order of 30% of that is attached to our International Banking portfolios in total, where the largest piece of it would relate to RBC Bank.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My first question has to do with risk-weighted assets. If I go back to the Q4 call, we were told at that time that two-thirds of the sequential RWA growth was due to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar, which fell about 15, 16% in that quarter. If I think about where we are right now in Q3, quarter to-date the dollar is up, Canadian dollar is up 9%. How should I think about the impact on risk-weighted assets, and how that could further benefit your already strong Tier 1 ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sumit, it's Janice speaking. So I'll answer that. If you look at the strength of our Tier 1 ratio, about 40 basis points of that was related to the capital issuance, the lower RAA what &#x2013; about 30 basis points was related to lower RAA. And as Gord said in his opening remarks, a significant portion, 20 basis points, due to our cash earnings. And if you drill down on RAA, of the 30 basis points, about a third of that would be related to -</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>30%, great. 30% of that would be related to FX. And with the balance being related to the reduction in RAAs and the effect of RAA management. So that gives you an idea.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful. Thank you. One more if I could. I very much understand that the loss rate on &#x2013; or the provisioning rate on Canadian residential mortgages is quite low, and certainly still remains that way. When I look at Royal Bank over a longer period of time, the proportion of mortgages on the balance sheet that are insured sit at about 25% today. If I go back to beginning of this decade, it was almost half. I can understand, and correct me if my numbers are wrong there, I can understand lately there's been an uptick in securitization activity that would affect that number. But it seems like it's been for quite some time that the proportion of insured mortgages have been dropping on the bank's balance sheet. Can you talk to me a little bit about what the mindset has been in that regard? Is it NIM related? Is it the fact that you don't think the actual default rates are going to be that low, so you haven't needed the insurance? Maybe just a idea on what your thought process has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Sumit, it's Dave McKay here. Certainly as we look at our current balance sheet, it would be along the ratios you mentioned. But when we look at our originations and what are, say assets under management, it certainly reverts back to that ratio around 45%. So really it is. You pointed to the answer yourself. It really is the fact that that is the asset category that normally gets securitized. And we originate at the 45% level, but we tend to take them off through securitization. So when you add back securitized and look at the total residential book, it comes back to that ratio. Well there's nothing going on as far as specific targeting or changes in business that we're targeting. It's all around securitization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that would suggest to me that the &#x2013; well, maybe it's just that you use more securitization over time that that's driven that ratio lower. So I'll check back on that. One more if I could, Marcia, if that's okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, one more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. On the call last quarter, I believe it was Gord mentioned a internal cost reduction mandate that was happening within the bank, and specifically in the context of Canadian Banking. Doesn't look like we saw too much flow-through on the expense side this quarter. It was talked about that there was a lot of work being done. We might get some sizing of that in the future. Are you in a position to offer us anything in that regard, how that's progressing, and what we can look for in the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sumit, it's Janice, and I'll talk a bit about that. We're currently in the process of sizing this, what we're looking at in terms of being more efficient. The actual initiatives involve simplifying a lot of the process, getting closer to the client. And then looking at all of our discretionary spend and &#x2013; including real estate, in effectively taking our cost base down. But we're currently in the process over the next few months of actually getting everyone to commit to it. Because the critical thing about this whole cost management initiative has to do with the fact that it's being very business led. And all of our businesses are signing up to all of the efficiency targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sumit, it's &#x2013; sorry, it's Dave McKay. Maybe I'll make a comment about the current quarter, because we're actually quite happy with our performance around cost in the second quarter. We're up 1% year-over-year. Just under 1%. But that &#x2013; we actually drilled 12% to 13% volume growth in assets with that 1% growth. So we had a very productive quarter with operating leverage around 3%.</p>
          <p>So in our view that &#x2013; and we are managing costs very carefully. We're actually down in FTE from our peak in October, about 350 to 400 FTE. So we're actually driving higher volumes, good revenues with excellent expense control with less FTE. And we're managing it very prudently along a number of lines, including opening branches without increasing FTE. We're looking at performance management and attrition and managing down our employee base. And we'll continue that going forward. So I think our cost to revenue performance was very good, and showing all the right trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would add to that because I &#x2013; just to provide flavor. We're not going to size it at this point in time. But I also don't want people to be left with the impression that this is just a statement that we're going to be more efficient or take cost down. And we have a major undertaking going on across the organization. We have some support on some specific initiatives from the consulting side. And as Janice says, this is very much business driven. And it will be bedded into our budgeting process, which is finalized to the Board this &#x2013; it will go to the Board this summer for 2010 and 2011. So while there'll be some of it this year, when you look at the magnitude of what we intend to do over that period of time, this is a very, very significant project for the organization.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. A couple of questions, if I may. The first one, another question on capital. On page 21 of the supplementary package, looking at bank credit risk, if I look at bank credit risk it's down about two-thirds in quarter, or getting up on 7 billion. Or if you'd like to look at it this way, about three-quarters of the risk, total risk-weighted asset declined in the quarter. So the number had been unchanged for well over a year it looks like. So could you tell us a bit about what's going on in that line, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we take that offline, because I'm having a bit of trouble following what line you're on. You're on page 21 of the supp, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Page 21, right at the bottom of credit risk, the bank credit risk with exposure of 43 billion and risk-weighted assets of 2.9 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, why don't we take that offline Steve. We'll get back to you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine. Another then, if I may, on again, on the setback on page 26. The non-bank financial impaireds, which had been pretty steady, upticked quite a bit there to 279 million. Didn't see a bump in provisions at all there. So I was wondering if we could get a little color on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is &#x2013; it's Morten. On &#x2013; this is on page 26 where we show non-bank financials impaireds up 279?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that relates to one of the larger US Capital Markets-related accounts that was taken through the quarter. And if you flip to the next page on page 29,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>you see the allowance has also moved up. The reason why the provision on page 28, where you show a net recovery of 10, is showing up is that there are a few moving parts. And one of the larger elements is the recovery that I mentioned around the prime brokerage accounts that &#x2013; where we had the provision in the first quarter. We had about 75% of that moved back during the second quarter. We then had the &#x2013; one of the larger provisions in the corporate portfolio moved the other way. So net-net, you ended up having an addition to the allowance seeing that the provision last quarter was written off. But on the provision line you don't see the specific number move through because of the other movements back and forth.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Goldberg from Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. How much of the US builder finance portfolio is now impaired? And how big is that portfolio, can you remind us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so it's Morten Friis again. So the US builder finance portfolio in terms of both what's in the RBC Bank legal entity and what's in &#x2013; outside of the legal Bank entity itself is currently about $2.6 billion. I don't have the precise impaired number in front of me. But it is &#x2013; if you bear with me a second I might be able to get it. So the &#x2013; on an impaired basis, we are at around 400 basis points overall in terms of impaired for that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Around 4. So what do you mean? Your &#x2013; 4% of it is impaired?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that &#x2013; sorry, that was the legal entity number. So it's somewhat bigger when you end up including &#x2013; the pieces that are outside would be a bigger percentage. So I'd &#x2013; we'd have to get back to you on the totals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'd be much different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the vast majority of it would be outside the legal entity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, about half of it's out of it. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it'd be a different number. We should get back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Michael, we'll get back to you on that number, not the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no that's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not the right number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm really trying to get at is, how much is already impaired? And how much more could potentially go impaired? When I look at your formations, it looks like about half of the $1.2 billion of wholesale formations in the quarter came from the United States. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so if you look on page 27, you got 1.8 billion total new impaired. So 1.2 billion of it's wholesale. And out of that you end up having net impaired &#x2013; yes, that would be about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that said, I would emphasize that we had some additional impaired loans in our corporate portfolio. So not all of it is related to RBC Bank or the builder finance portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us some other &#x2013; some further granularity about those wholesale formations, maybe by Canada, US, US builder and other International?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so I would &#x2013; in terms of impaired formations, the most significant growth has been in the US relative to its portfolio size. In the Canadian portfolio, we have seen some movement overall, but it's relatively modest relative to the size of the portfolio. We ended up having a small number of accounts with the predictable chunkiness. So we had a slightly larger provision in our commercial portfolio that we &#x2013; than we've had in recent quarters, although frankly, quite consistent with the economic environment. In the corporate banking portfolio, I spoke to that in my comments. So we've had a small number of significant accounts with provisions, the securitization conduit and a couple of other corporate connections that had generated provisions. From an impaired standpoint, it is a slight negative trend. But no dramatic shift from recent quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A separate question. Gord, you described the US retail banking environment to be difficult. And given the goodwill impairment, you can't be thrilled with your franchise. Is it realistic for us to believe that you can create a better franchise among the opportunities that are out there in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the first think I'd say, not that I defend the franchise, but this is obviously a very difficult business. I think it was Sheila Blair of the FDIC who said two days ago that the business model for banking in the United States is broken. And unfortunately the region that we're in, which is where there's a lot of real estate component to it, it is a very, very difficult environment.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the performance of our banking business from a PCL perspective, it's pretty much in line with what's happening as you go through sector-by-sector. Now we have a higher percentage of real estate because of our builders finance business. But if you go through the portfolio, as I think Morten has said this, that we're pretty much in line with the industry. So it remains a very difficult industry, and hopefully that will change.</p>
          <p>But it's &#x2013; one of the challenging parts about the US banking industry when it comes to investment, acquisition investment in particular, there's been very few dollars invested really over the last 15 years in that business, originally because of valuations versus returns. And more now because of -compounded by the recent crisis, which has been a good return from a shareholder perspective. It's just been a very difficult business.</p>
          <p>Now, will that change as a result &#x2013; as we move out of this crisis? There will certainly be opportunities for both business models to shift. And there may well be investment opportunities as a result of what is happening in the United States as well. But it remains, I would say, a very stressed industry from a business model perspective given the, just given the nature of the industry, the high loan loss rate across the industry, margin compression across the industry. It remains challenged.</p>
          <p>But we do have a major restructuring underway, which Jim Westlake may want to comment on, with respect to the existing business model. And then I think in terms of building on that model, as I've said in the past, we want to remain very &#x2013; have lots of optionality as the industry starts to restructure, consolidate and unfold going forward.</p>
          <p>But we've literally been in an 18-month holding pattern. And certainly we don't see coming out of that very quickly given the overall environment in terms of opportunities, consolidation et cetera. But there's a lot of attention being paid to the existing business model. And frankly because of some of the stability, we are seeing &#x2013; stability provided by RBC relative to some of the other competitors, we are seeing some positive things on the deposit side, the customer side et cetera. But you're on a treadmill trying to keep up with the credit experience.</p>
          <p>Jim, do you want to comment on some of the specific things going on in the existing business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Gord. I think the one thing I would add in addition to being overweight on builders, we're a little overweight in Florida relative to some of the competitors; which has seen some of the toughest stats coming out. And I think that it's safe to say that as the US model goes forward, there are going to be significant differences in terms of credit availability, in terms of reliance on builder finance, the residential mortgage business.</p>
          <p>And we do spend so much time talking about PCL that it does mask a lot of those individual initiatives to retool, and make sure that we are structured appropriately for what we think the market will look like as we come back up the economic cycle. So we are focusing a lot of attention on our products, on the offerings that we have in credit cards, residential, small business. And refining our branch network and bringing our costs inline. So that as we go back up the economic cycle, we'll have a much better performance.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. The increase in PCLs in the domestic business retail, I think we can all understand what's happening there. A little bit more on International Banking, jumping to 289 million this quarter after it'd been level for about two &#x2013; at about 200 million. Was there something specific this quarter, as in the Bank maybe being a little more aggressive and pushing through files? Or what was it specifically that would cause that 50% bump from one quarter to the next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there was nothing specific in terms of actions on pushing things through. It's simply the &#x2013; how the portfolios have developed. If you look at the piece that doesn't get a whole lot of attention in this, you end up having the provisions in the Caribbean moving up slightly, but not significantly. And essentially in International Banking the whole story on the increase is in the RBC Bank portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So taking that just one step further then, if you look at the, what you have referred to as the troubled areas, you talk about the builder finance which is at 2.6 billion. You talk about lot loans about 1.1 billion. Is that essentially where the &#x2013; of that 289 million, how much of that 289 million essentially relates to that, call it, 3 or $3.5 billion that we just went through, the lot loans and the builder finance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't provide the level of detail and disclosure on that. And I don't really have it easily available. But if you look at the &#x2013; outside of the builder finance-related areas, the largest dollar number is associated with our commercial and business banking, at around $50 million. And then the rest are in the 20s and 30s per portfolio. What has happened over the quarter is that we have seen some further deterioration in, particularly in both home equity and residential mortgages. And the lot loan portfolio, which is in Canadian dollar terms, almost exactly at $1 billion, which is a loan to individuals but for purchase of lots largely for home development or vacation home development, had also a further deterioration there. So those are the more significant areas. But from a file process standpoint, there's no change in how we manage the process. It's reflecting our &#x2013; the flow of files that become problematic and how we view them at the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything you can offer in terms of, does this take another step function up in the next few quarters? Or does this feel -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I tried to reflect in the comments at the beginning, if you look at our builder finance portfolio it is clearly the portfolio that saw the deterioration the earliest. And where we're now seeing charge-offs picking up, and where the slowdown and deterioration, if you like, is likely to come first.</p>
          <p>If you look at the rest of the portfolios, it's largely dependent on the economic environment. If the economic environment is in fact stabilizing, we will likely have another few quarters of high PCL, with the possibility of some deterioration. But it &#x2013; the level of overall provisioning is going to be driven primarily by the economic conditions that we're facing. But if you look at what started at is a 3 billion and now a $2.6 billion builder finance portfolio, it is the part that has clearly seen the most of the pain. But therefore will also cease to contribute large numbers the soonest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally, in the wholesale segment where you took the PCL related to the, let's see here, the multi-seller conduits, I think it's 60 million or so this quarter. Is that what you referred to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I forget the precise number. The order of magnitude, that's about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now there's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's &#x2013; let me just see here. Yes, it was about 60. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you referred to $2.7 billion of asset-backed securities in the US multi-seller, a loan of about 1.8 billion. Is there anything you can tell us that would put to rest the notion that there could be a few more shoes to drop, at least insofar as this $2.7 billion of asset-backed securities are concerned in the multi-seller conduit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our multi-seller conduit business, we've talked about this in previous quarters, this loan of 200 million is the only facility of its type with this particular type of mortgage-related CDO-type exposure underlying it. And so in a multi-seller conduit context, we have, out of the 30 billion plus in total assets, we have I think no more than about 1 billion of structured assets of which this particular loan is the only significant loan with mortgage-related type CDO exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>200 million, and it's written down to what, about 100 now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've taken cumulative of 121, I think. Again, if you look at my comments, it's in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a great pronunciation. Morten, just to make sure you're on your game here, so we've got obviously those various pages in the supp pack, 25 to 28. And first of all, thank you. The disclosure is very good. When I look at page 28 and you look at the provision, so just to understand this issue on the prime brokerage in and out here, so in Q1 the client, I think it was Silver Creek filed. You seized the assets. You impaired the loan. You took a charge. So it was 142. If &#x2013; it didn't show up in the allowance. So that meant it went straight to write-off. Then the next quarter, which is this quarter, you had more non-bank financial services credits go bad, which threw up the gross impaireds. You reversed some of the previous provision. Is that broadly what happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so first of all, I won't comment on client names. But so you're right that in the first quarter, we had provisions of around 142, of which the majority was related to one specific account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we took the provision. Had the write-off. So the provision did not cause an increase in the allowance. And then this quarter we had recoveries of close to $100 million, around $100 million on that particular account that showed up as a recovery. Or old bets written off, I guess, in accounting language. And then moving against that we had, in what shows up in the same sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On page 28, we had one of the provisions that we took on the US corporate portfolio happened to be in the non-bank financial services sector. So that offset the recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So really the way to think of it is, the 142 of provisions in Q1 really should have been, let's say, 20. And then this quarter it should have been 120 or something like that, or 100. So it really was in and out. Where you provided too much, you were able to get out of the securities that you seized. And you unwound them when you booked &#x2013; you reversed it this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Janice comment on the accounting niceties here. But the provision that we took, as of the first quarter, reflected our view of the market at the time. And then with working with the portfolio, we then were able to recover the amounts that showed up in PCL recovery for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have thought that would have been a trade and gain, because it was in and out of the loan book, impaired loan book. And then it became a securities position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, what we look at is the fact that we had actually had a change in estimate on the PCL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's how we recorded it. So basically we made an estimate on the PCL last quarter based on prices of securities, among other things. We looked at that again, and re-estimated it this quarter. So from that perspective, it &#x2013; with 20/20 hindsight, we would have provided less in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to the portfolio during the quarter. It's a very unusual item, but you know it's because of the nature of the items.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes. The second quick question is it looks as if your credit default swap book is declining dramatically. And is there some strategic initiative? I don't know if Stan is there, or Gord or Morten. It looks as if you're really taking down credit default swaps. Am I right on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi Ian. It's Mark Standish. The answer is yes. What you're seeing there actually is reflective of what we did in the first quarter, and any P&amp;L impact from that. And that was primarily selling the correlation book hit up in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>What you saw in the second quarter is having neutralized the risk, we then went through the fairly labor intensive process of matching off and assigning all the individual trades. So the reduction of notional you see in the second quarter. But there was no P&amp;L impact, positive or negative in the second quarter from that reduction.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The last question is from John Aiken from Dundee Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. And I guess I'm going to be forced to try to make this entertaining. But Gord, you mentioned in your prepared comments about when you talk to your capital levels, the opportunities that you saw in the marginal deployment of capital. And based on commentary around the US platform, I'm assuming that you're not about to pull the trigger on something down there. But could you give us some insight as to where you think opportunities may lay over the next quarter or two to deploy the capital that is arguably start &#x2013; beginning to depress your profitability on an ROE basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, John, the first comment I'd make is that I don't know whether it'll happen over a quarter or two. We have made the decision that being one of the best-capitalized banks in the world is a competitive advantage for all of our businesses. And in, and so in terms of reduction of capital levels, I think that will to some degree be dictated by the environment. So I don't want to give anyone the impression that we're going to drive that capital ratio down immediately. We want to remain extremely well capitalized because we think it's a competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>But to answer your question specifically and I'll take a slightly broader answer. I think that &#x2013; I don't know when we're going to come out the other end of the valley. And &#x2013; but at some point as we start to move in that direction, I think you're going to see a lot of very positive things for the industry generally. You're going to have a repriced balance sheet at a much better pricing of credit. You'll see margin expansion because you'll naturally see that happen as interest rates start to move up. And you'll obviously see a very different environment and even potential reversals when it comes to things like marks and provisioning, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; but in addition to that, given all of the things that have occurred in the marketplace, competitors have exited particularly the shadow banking system. There are &#x2013; valuations have clearly come down. The pricing of asset levels has become more attractive. And so if you look at each of our businesses, whether it's our Banking business here in Canada as well as the United States, whether it's our Wealth Management business, whether it's our Capital Markets businesses, we do think there will be very attractive ways to deploy that marginal capital in each of our businesses. And generate much higher returns than perhaps were available over the last number of years, where you had significant margin compression whether it was because of excess liquidity, competition, more competitors in the marketplace, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So it's not just that there will be one opportunity out there to buy a bank or to buy an asset manager. I think it will be very much across each of our businesses. But I think as we start to come through the valley, having the ability to invest that excess capital will, I think, put us in a very strong position. And because we think there will be lots of opportunities, as I say, either through acquisition or directly in our existing businesses just because margins will be more attractive. And one of the things that we've intentionally tried to do is make sure that we're well positioned to take advantage of that.</p>
          <p>What I can't tell you is when we're going to start to see those &#x2013; sorry, when we're going to start to get to that point in the cycle where we're very comfortable taking down those &#x2013; our capital position. But I do believe that the industry over the long-term will not revert to the capital levels that it was at going into this crisis. But it will certainly come down from where we are today. And I'd rather be in a position of over capitalization today, going into the future and the ability to invest than be in a position of under capitalization.</p>
