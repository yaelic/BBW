          <p>Good afternoon and good morning, good evening I say to the people on the telephone conference. Good afternoon to everybody here in Stockholm for attending this presentation of Atlas Copco Group's Third Quarter Report 2011.</p>
          <p>We are a stable, often predictable company, so we'll do exactly the same format that we normally do. I will soon hand over to Ronnie Leten, our CEO, who will introduce his comments to the quarter. And then shortly after that, we will start with the Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, please, Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans Ola, and good afternoon and good morning for those who are calling in from the other side of the ocean. Like before, I will also go through the presentation and refer immediately to the number of the slides so you can follow me easily.</p>
          <p>Let me go immediately to slide number two where we talk about the highlights. When we look to the quarter, demand remained at high level and we saw a very solid development in &#x2013; on the manufacturing side but also on the Mining business, which was very solid. But the one which was maybe on the negative part coming out is the construction part which was, in demand terms, weaker. And I would comment a couple of times on that during my presentation, but it was mainly China and Brazil.</p>
          <p>And then here we have record, record, record in all the places where we could be, coming from of course a high level, but also a very strong support from our aftermarket business. And I'm very happy also to announce that we had done a couple of strategic acquisitions, especially when it comes to Schucker, which is a nice add-on for our tools business and also shows our commitment to that area.</p>
          <p>Let me go immediately to slide number three now where you see the figures. I think they account for themselves. Organic 14% up, revenue 21%. You see also the output of the factories is coming. And then, the operating margin 23.1%, okay, a bit inflated by, as it says 0.2%, the positive impact of the provision for our long-term incentive program, and we had a restructuring program. Earnings per share, almost SEK3, but maybe one area, and Hans Ola will elaborate a bit more on that later. I believe, a very strong cash flow, if you give the volume which we are producing now.</p>
          <p>Then we come over to the geographical spread. This time, and it's a long time I've not been able to say all double-digit growth. Here we have a bit of &#x2013; yes, a broader spread that we'll more go in detail later, but what is good to see is plus 14% organic growth in the quarter, and for the year 25%, which I believe is a very solid achievement.</p>
          <p>Let's take the Americans now on slide number five, strong North America, high demand for industrial equipment, our compressors side, but also our tools side. If you look a bit deeper, we see that mining and construction is sequentially softer. But we are comparing and we should not forget that we've a very strong second quarter this year.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, also our effort to further develop the market and the service market in the three countries there is definitely yielding good result and giving this strong aftermarket.</p>
          <p>We take South America, plus 7%, which is, say, it's only single digit. Here I have to make a remark. You remember also that this continent came back earlier and is really at the high level and remains at the high level. We see still good development in Brazil. It's not growing as it was say a year ago, but still stays at very solid level. But &#x2013; and maybe that's one site remark, the construction area, especially when in Brazil was softer, so you can think what all the other businesses are still doing well.</p>
          <p>Europe, plus 19%. Yes, the crisis &#x2013; this maybe not hit us yet, I don't know how we should read it, but that came from a very strong Russia and a very solid Germany. And the Russia particularly was strong. As you remember, some of you are following as in very detail. We announced last year that big order for <mark type="ph" /> Zygaline (05:53) pipeline, the gas pipeline which was in this quarter, and then 2010, but even we beat the quarter of last year this time and a very solid Germany as I already said. But again here also sequentially a softer construction pie, it's not that it is really dropping here, but we have seen a softening in Europe. You can say maybe it's a bit seasonal that could be but okay, we feel that we had to share that with you.</p>
          <p>Then Africa, Middle East, all strong, but the only remark is North Africa, I think goes again, no surprise for any one of you that also there we are struggling. And hopefully very soon, we can start again growing there. But the Middle East doing well and Southern part of Africa was very solid, especially when it comes to the mining part.</p>
          <p>Then Asia, the catch, only plus 5%. I but I can say if we take it any deeper first we should say we comparing also again with a very strong quarter and last year we also had a very large order from Kazakh mines in Kazakhstan which we did here unfortunately didn't have. So that was the large and tough comparison, but if we dig deeper we see a very solid China, although you read about it, but I think that is still going on although the construction market and for certain specific construction market was softer in China, but all the rest was still doing great. And we see also a weaker India. I'm not saying that it's really going down, but we don't' see it really taking off as we had hoped it would be. So, that is one point, which I would like to share also with you. And again, Asia also our effort there to develop our presence with the aftermarket also is giving a fantastic growth level.</p>
          <p>Australia, minus 15%. Is there something cooking in the mining business? is there cancellations, no. Again here also we are comparing with very strong quarters. And this quarter, we didn't land any large order, especially not for the service mining part. So that made the comparison very tough, and is primarily on the equipment side. But the aftermarket, it keeps going on. And we see still a lot of activities and quotes going in this industry for Australia.</p>
          <p>The quarter &#x2013; I think you see seven quarters where we go up. And now it come to 14% last quarter. But then &#x2013; I'm now on the sales bridge, slide nine. Price plus 2%. So we still see a good development of the price. So our inflation and cost increases are definitely compensated with the good pricing power we have in the market.</p>
          <p>Currency is a bit less, as we all now have seen what is happening. So that is a good case for us. And volume, you can read where we are today. And again if I point one specific figure, then I see the revenue plus 19%, so on that one, I'm very pleased to see the output of our factories, it's really coming on full speed.</p>
          <p>Now I will go through the different business areas. And to calibrate each other here, we are now reporting in four legs, where we before were talking about three. See here the two major ones Compressor and Mining, which are more or less on par. And then we had the Construction and Industrial Technique.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the Compressor. A very solid organic growth, 17%. Coming of course mainly from the industrial compressors, because that's also where we have it now. And a good, solid adjacent business, the air treatment product. And again to repeat myself several times, on the aftermarket.</p>
          <p>A very solid profitability. Maybe some of you when we compare with last year, we &#x2013; said only 24%. I think this is a very solid one. And you may be the ones who listened to me a year ago. I said let's remember it, the 26.7% as EBIT. But this is a very, very solid development we have here.</p>
          <p>And we have landed a couple of good orders there. One is geothermal power plant in Turkey, which is a step-up in our gas and process business.</p>
          <p>Then we come to the Industrial Technique, slide number 12. Very solid all over. Good Europe, good U.S., good China, good India, and GI in the motor vehicle business. So also yielding a 24% organic growth. A good development, and we see still good development when we look forward.</p>
          <p>Operating margin. We just missed the 22%, but I think, given the output, a very solid result. And like I already said in the beginning of my presentation, we are very happy to see this Schucker acquisition, and at the same time, we also did an acquisition in France, specialty drilling for the tools business.</p>
          <p>Then, mining and rock excavation. Strong solid organic growth. Still high activity going on in the Mining business, mainly in the underground, where we see good demand. And of course the lower for service drilling equipment, you can relate that to my remark when I was talking about Australia and a good aftermarket. And on top of that, also a very strong demand on consumables.</p>
          <p>And the profitability, I would say, fantastic. 25.6%. So a record operating profit. A very solid development coming from good output of the factories in an efficient way. And on top of that, also a fantastic aftermarket yield.</p>
          <p>Construction Technique. So the new fourth leg. Yes, it's the first time we report like this also.</p>
          <p>So it's not a very strong start, but we see a weakening of equipment, mainly in the road construction area. We have an operating margin little bit below 12%, but as you also can see, the construction cost we took for the closing of our factory in Sweden here in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:01) which then lowered the operating margin. Changed for this restructuring cost, it would have been close to 13%. So more work in process for all of us in that business area.</p>
          <p>But we also had a good add-on acquisition, which makes us much stronger and much agiler in the generator business, and that is our new Spanish generator manufacturing company Zaragoza. And then we have a new business area President from the 1st of October, so he is now running for a couple of weeks and that's Nico Delvaux who is the new business area and he was before running the service business for Compressor Technique.</p>
          <p>Group total, I think I told you all the figures where you see revenue plus 17%, operating profit plus 27% and a record SEK4.8 billion and what I think what is also one figure which we should be looking to is the return on capital employed. We are back on the plus 30s, so strong 36%.</p>
          <p>Hans Ola, maybe you can go now further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronnie, thank you. I'll give a few more comments on the next couple of slides starting from the same that we have now here and just giving a little bit of a comment.</p>
          <p>You see that the profit for the period and also the earnings per share show a stronger increase than the other profit numbers. So that indicates, of course, that we had a relatively low tax rate in the quarter, 23.5% roughly. And these percentage points of our tax payout ratio, as those of you that have followed us, you know that it varies a little bit. I would still say that we now believe that around 25% is probably the best estimate that we have going forward. We have a couple of changes that works in our favor for mix, et cetera, compared to the previous guidance which was perhaps more 26%, 27%, so slightly better going forward also, we think.</p>
          <p>If move on then &#x2013; we normally comment a few words on the profit bridge with last year's third quarter. I think for the group as a whole, you recognize the numbers now and you see that it doesn't look very dramatic. If we move to look at the pieces of the group, it is a bit different from normal in that sense that it's a little bit more diverse and not as homogeneous perhaps as before.</p>
          <p>First of all, on Compressor Technique, you can see in the second column that the so-called flow-through from an increased revenue &#x2013; from price and volume is very small in this quarter, and I would just leave it by pointing to what Ronnie said was the quarter of last year when everything came together at one time. So I don't think that is very representative. We are still confident that at the level of growth that we are having we believe that the underlying incremental profit is there between 25%, 30% or something like that. So, that's a little bit more reflecting previous year than this year.</p>
          <p>The other comment I would make is on Construction Technique, which Ronnie also said that it's, as a first quarter for the new business area, did not start on a profit direction that was so good. But on behind this development of a negative incremental profit, because they still grew on revenue and volume, lies basically two things; there are a couple of markets where the orders and the revenues have dropped dramatically, and Ronnie referred to two of them, China and what I shouldn't say dramatically, but substantially lower at least in China and Brazil in particular. And at the same time, it reflects that in those markets we are still investing in our market organization. We are investing for the future, so hence the flow-through looks &#x2013; it is negative, but, again, I don't see that that is reflecting a longer trend.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to the next slide, it's the balance sheet. I think you can say in a very high-level assessment that from December to September, the total balance sheet is the same size but we have swapped excess cash for investing in working capital and acquisitions, if I summarize it in two words. But it's also fair to say that when you look at the development from Q2 to Q3, the growth of the working capital, specifically inventory, and to a certain extent receivables, might look as almost a worrying sign as we speak about the somewhat weakening demand outside. However, you have to remember that there's a lot of currency translation effects in those numbers.</p>
          <p>So, when we look at the cash flow, you will see that the growth of the working capital is more balanced than what it looks like, when you compare with previous quarter. That's unfortunately not on this map, on this slide. But if you look at it, it's roughly half or less than half of the increase is this real volume increase on the inventory and receivables.</p>
          <p>So, on the balance sheet and on the capitalization of the company you can see that we are back on the normal track, if I call it like that. We had a very big capital distribution to shareholders, which put the net debt-to-EBITDA up. And now steadily as she goes, we are moving down in leverage for the &#x2013; in the short term.</p>
          <p>And then, if we move to the next slide on cash flow, here you can see what I refer to that on a net basis in the quarter, we did accumulate some working capital, but considering the growth of the output and the growth of the revenue, it's perfectly in line with what we had expected. In fact, it can be interesting to note that when we measure inventory turns in Atlas Copco, we are quite a bit lower today than we were in September 2008, for example. So that of course to us gives a good feeling about the quality of the assets. And similar could be said about customer receivables.</p>
          <p>So we end up with SEK2.125 billion in operating cash flow, and this is of course not including acquisitions as you can see here.</p>
          <p>So with that, I hand it back to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So the slides and then to talk about the near-term outlook, you can see what we expect about our products is that if you look further, a bit of somewhat weakening of the present situation, but I would like to highlight, we should not forget that today the business runs at a very high level.</p>
          <p>So by this, I would like to draw your attention, all of you. We have an open day in Antwerp, a beautiful city, but that's maybe not the reason why we would like you to come to Antwerp. We also have our capital market day where we really show you around at the middle of universe of compressor &#x2013; compressed air and show our new products, and also the way we work and develop the aftermarket business. So you're all invited to 29th of November to share the capital markets day with us in Belgium. It's actually a beautiful country.</p>
          <p>By this, Hans Ola, I give back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And I will immediately hand it over to the operator of this call in order to give the participants on the telephone conference some instructions for questions. Please go ahead.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our first question comes from the line of Guillermo Peigneux. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. It's Guillermo Peigneux from Morgan Stanley. Maybe three questions, if I may.</p>
          <p>First, regarding book-to-bill and the progression through the quarter, could you give us some flavor as to whether September book to bill was still above one or close to one or even below one given the shape of economy?</p>
          <p>Secondly regarding mining consumables with some of the, let's say, major miners talking about slightly lower demand, have you seen a slowdown in demand for consumables or do you foresee that here going forward?</p>
          <p>And then last question regarding your exposure to emerging markets, especially when it comes to head count, are you experiencing, put it this way, inflation pressures there, and probably looking forward we should be seeing a degree of compression in your margins or in a way all variables remain equaled going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can take the three questions, Hans Ola.</p>
          <p>When it comes to September, September was a very solid orders-received month. It's not that you can say that we saw a sliding going down the further we came to the quarter. So from that point of view, I think we were very confident to see that because the book to bill is also influenced by the output of the factories and that was very strong also in September. So I think it was more or less coming close.</p>
          <p>Then when it comes to the consumables, we have not seen a slowing down on the consumable business where we are in. That &#x2013; I still believe that we have a lot of potential to grow that further and I've not spotted any softening in the business. But to remind you and going back to 2008, 2009, also then I think we didn't see so much slowing down in that business either. So it is a rather resilient part of our business.</p>
          <p>Then when it comes to what exposure of the emerging markets and the head count and the inflation on salary, yes, it's there. It's there for everybody, so &#x2013; and that is, of course, up to us now to work on efficiency &#x2013; efficiency in our factories, efficiency in our aftermarket; and last but not least, and maybe I'm repeating myself in this, is also to work on product development, innovation, selling value. So to compensate on one hand, the cost inflation you have, and that's the same for all our competitors, to make sure that we have a strong power on the pricing side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we take one question more from the telephone conference, and then we'll switch back here to Stockholm after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Nico Dil. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please.</p>
          <p>First of all, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the weakness you have seen in Australia. I'm wondering whether this is purely mining related and whether you see this as a sort of sign that major miners are perhaps rolling over their CapEx.</p>
          <p>Second question here is on the inventory increase. Hans Ola, you highlighted on the call that roughly half of it is due to an inventory increase underlying and the other half is currency. Could you highlight how much of the inventory increase is final versus raw materials? The third question is on the mining margin.</p>
          <p>Ronnie, on the call, you highlighted that last year we had a phenomenal margin in compressors. Is that now the case in mining and should we expect that to slow a little bit from here? Or could we see a good development going forward from here as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first two and then you take &#x2013; and then Hans Ola.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the margin on the mining, it is of course a very solid margin. But of course before, for all of you, it was rather difficult to see where we were cruising it if it was of the same mixed with the other operations. But this time, what we can say is that we have a very good equipment output, so the factories are doing a very good work and also contributing very good absorption in our factories.</p>
          <p>But second, also our focus on aftermarket which we had been doing on, say, for several years and with this solid demand we have is coming &#x2013; then this margin is coming out. And do I say we will come up next time maybe even in a higher figure? I'm trying not to say that. I say you should really expect a very solid development in the margin &#x2013; of continuation of the margin in mining. I think I don't expect that we should go back below the 20%. But I think you should expect from us something, yes, a very solid &#x2013; a bit above 20% margin in the mining.</p>
          <p>Then when it comes to Australia, I don't want to call it a weakness because like I try to say when I was talking about the geographical areas, if we make a comparison and if I would show you the demand in Australia. You would see that we had a couple peaks with larger orders we got that these orders we didn't get this time, doesn't mean that there are not such orders in the pipeline, yes, they're in the pipeline. Unfortunately they're not landed with us now, but we still see a good demand going on in Australia. So, I would not call it a weakness in this area. Then I think inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if I, it will be very short answer to your question, Nico. The ratio if I put it that way, the composition between manufacturing stock, intermediate, and finial product is about the same as we have seen in the last quarter. So I don't see any trend change there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we take the first question here in Stockholm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken Capital Markets. My first question relates to the construction side.</p>
          <p>You talk about significance drop, a dramatic drop or a somewhat weakened situation. Could you please help us with the rate here, how much is actually orders declining sequentially say in Brazil and China on the construction side to get the feel for the slowdown?</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have discussed mining for both Australia and some aftermarket revenues, could you help us to understand how your customers are figuring out the demand going forward when it comes to placing orders for exploration project stuff like that? It doesn't seem that you see any hesitation right now, but they ought to be some out there. So, could you please help us out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When it comes to construction, first if we take it from a geographical point of view, we see definitely a significant drop in China and in Brazil for all construction equipment. So, it's geographically China and Brazil. When I look to underneath on the construction business, it is road construction, that is. It's not &#x2013; we don't see it in the portable energy part that it is really significant going down. We see a bit of a softening there. Also, you have again the seasonality which is playing when you compare quarter two with quarter three. That we have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry for interrupting, but significant in your mind is minus 20%, 30% or it sounds like that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can have it a minus when it comes to China I think you can take a minus 20% and more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On specific product ranges...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, again on the specific one that is. It's definitely not on the portable energy and construction side. Then on the mining side, yes, and of course this is also a question which plays with me and then try to find out you have heard about the consumables. You have heard me saying there we don't see anything. I think if we could produce more, we could sell more and because there we are on our top and that is also the reason why we're investing.</p>
          <p>When it comes other equipment I think we got still a good development, good interaction, good quotation going on. Will they &#x2013; then they I mean the mining companies, will they a bit hesitating to place the orders later on when depending on what is going on? We would see. That is the question I also have. It's good to have quotations. It's even better to get a firm order, so we will see that.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the exploration, yeah, I think you can say you see some activities which is a bit softer, you can say that. But is it really to do with certain projects, certain mine companies who are waiting? That, I don't know, I cannot give you that answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My third question, very, very short.</p>
          <p>China, we talked about cost inflation stuff like that, <mark type="ph" /> eventual (34:05) export duties. Have you seen any of your non-domestic competitors starting to sort of think about moving production back to the U.S. stuff like that? Have you come to that yet or it's still in the future? And in that answer, could you update us on how much you actually net import to China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You say moving back to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but what I mean is some U.S. production is rather healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And companies that's not really in China for the local demand, in my mind figure out whether to stay in production or actually moving it back. That might be a situation further down the road, but have you sensed any of this happening when you talk to your customers and in the landscape?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I &#x2013; of course, when you look on one end, you see the strong demand for investment goods in U.S., like I said. And then you &#x2013; when you start looking to the currency and you a take time horizon for a couple of years, yes, the renminbi has strengthened. When you listen then to the salary increases, cost have been increased in China, so that may be for certain products that someone is moving back to home for certain production. If &#x2013; because for the reason if they have done their transplants in another area, could happen, I'm going to say I don't have an opinion about that because we have strong presence in U.S., strong presence in China. As long as they invest, I have no opinion where they're going to do it, if you take it from Atlas Copco's point of view.</p>
          <p>When you talk about us, the majority of the products we are producing in China are for China, so that is even more than 90% what we produce in China is used in China; and you can say what we sell in China it's around &#x2013; it's a bit more, I think a bit more than 70% what we sell in China is produced in China. So the rest like couple of spare parts we are flying in, specific unique parts which are produced wherever, could be in Sweden, could be in U.S., recommend some products that we are good bit of gas and process which are the majority is still made either in U.S., in <mark type="ph" /> market range in California or in Cologne in Germany (36:36). So these are not produced in China for another reason, but the majority is what we produce in China is for China.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Frederic Stahl with UBS. I was wondering if you &#x2013; your book-to-bill has been running above 1 for two years now, I think, and I was wondering if you could quantify your backlog as it stands today, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the aftermarket you had a lot of strong language I think in the release, that you're growing very fast, and if you could quantify or give us an idea of how fast the aftermarket business is growing, and whether there's a business between the mining business and compressors?</p>
          <p>Finally, on the mining side on the consumables, do you think that you can outgrow the amount of volume of dirt that is grown up &#x2013; that is dug up from the miners? Can you &#x2013; in volume terms, can you outgrow the mining activities &#x2013; the earth-moving activities there? And if so, how can you do that, is it market share gains or is it any other buttons you can press?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the consumable part, I think of course but we are now in the site trying to get market share, but all of us, if you will talk to our competitors the same, everybody's going after market share and that is to work with presence, new products and all that. That, we will definitely try to do. But I think when it comes to the consumables and specific for Atlas Copco, I think we should still extend our offer. We are still a narrow player in that part. I think we could do more on that and that is I think we should do over the years to come, but that will take time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give an example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you see the acquisition we did a couple years back in India where we had the specific bits which we didn't have before so that I think helped us and by that technology, we again &#x2013; this was most used in China, was also more used in Russia. So we leveraged our presence because that is the strength of Atlas Copco selling in 178 countries and getting products in that network and that's the mission we all have. That's on consumables I think and that's the reason why I believe it could be a good path for more growth.</p>
          <p>Then on the aftermarket, it grows double digit. There is no big significant difference in growth rate between mining and CT. It's a bit more in mining now, but mining can do that. Second also in mining, we have installed &#x2013; we have a much more higher installed base if we compare with two, three years. So there is &#x2013; for me there's still more to come from that part. So if you would ask me which one you bet will grow faster CT or mining, given this input, I would say mining. So that is where we can grab more. Maybe on the backlog, you can take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean first of all, it's about the same size as in Q2, but that was an easy one for you to calculate yourself with a close to 1 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter. Now but there is variation between the businesses and of course in our case with more than 40% of our business being consumables and aftermarket and other stuff that basically doesn't carry any stock, we're talking about equipment. So on equipment in the two big business areas and I'm talking mining and when it comes to backlog that is the Mining and Compressor Technique it's somewhere in the region of between two and three quarters on equipment, measured as that. But of course there are big variations between different products in Mining and different products in Compressor Technique but as an average, yes.</p>

          <p>No, no only for the equipment, only for the equipment that is and of course, if you take the whole business, it becomes much shorter than that of course. But so with that, we pass over to two questions on the telephone line, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ben Maslen. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Ben Maslen from Merrill Lynch. Two questions please.</p>
          <p>Firstly Construction Technique. When you look back, that was pretty close to breakeven in 2009, and I think Dynapac made a small loss in that year. We're seeing those markets soften again, can you talk a little bit about how different that business is now relative to back then in terms of cost base, your manufacturing model, flexibility and so forth, and maybe what you've done to the business? And &#x2013; and if we saw a repeat of a &#x2013; or a similar downturn, would the margin resilience be different, do you think, to 2009? That's the first kind of all-in question, I guess.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on your outlook, you give it sequentially, so I guess you're talking about Q4 relative to Q3. Can you talk a bit more about which end markets do you think are going to sequentially weaken, and in which markets do you think will hold up? So, I guess, we've already seen Construction go down, do you think it goes down again or about stable, there are other markets that will soften? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll leave it to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a lot of questions. When it comes to the Construction Technique and going back to 2008, 2009 when you recalculate the thing, the figures, and you say it's breakeven, and would this happen again? When we looked in a couple of weeks back, actually couple of months back, and we looked to our sensitivities and our contingency plans and where are we, where could we be, I think we are much better equipped than, I think, at that time.</p>
          <p>The reason for that, I think, we have really reduced our &#x2013; or should I say, <mark type="ph" /> over loose capacity (43:05). You have seen that we have closed several factories and reduced our square meters, so that part is definitely not there anymore. So that will be a bit easier. I think also, when it comes to the whole setup and that counts for all our businesses, I think we are a much more agile organization than we were in 2008, 2009 and what does that &#x2013; make me saying that?</p>
          <p>First, I think we have done it before. Second, I think we also have when we were growing during this period and that start say, end 2009, when we started recruiting again, 2010 when we start to recruit more than announced now. I think we have been much more prudent where to grow and how to grow when it comes to manufacturing, when it comes to certain overhead. So we really have stayed close to our core when it comes to our processes and making sure the organization keeps their agility.</p>
          <p>So in other words, in practicality, we have much more temps as we have today, as we had in 2009 in that business. In the other hand, we also had developed further, the resilient part of the business, so the aftermarket part is stronger, more solid, so that make me saying that, yes, if it would be the same scenario as &#x2013; and I hope it will not, we would have in October 2008, if I take that as my date, I believe we are much more, yes, we are solid on that part and I don't believe that we will hit the breakeven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then when it comes to the outlook, yes, you can read the outlook. I think when it comes to the construction part, we'll see what happens in China. That is the question because it's a big part road construction, what will happen in the months to come. I see a more positive outlook on Brazil I think where we had before down part on the road construction thing. I think that is coming back slightly. But if you ask me, I would say I would be prudent on the construction side because the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:50) in Europe is coming.</p>
          <p>So we have the last quarter, which has never been the strongest part and same is on the U.S. side. So there I still sequentially, I would say a further softening. When it comes to Mining and Industrial Technique, I would say I think it will hang in. There I &#x2013; I'm believing that we should not expect any big movements and on CT side, we have a bit of a mixed view there where my <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:32) I still believe they will go home where the bigger tickets, that is for me also a question mark. There's a lot of quotation going on but these need to land and that is where also I had a question, okay, is it due to the fact that we have now this uncertainty in that people don't decide to do the investment and wait and see what Merkel and Sarkozy go to do in the coming weeks. It's that reason, but that is where we see a bit of... yes, hesitation I could say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben. And then, we take another question from the telephone line, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of <mark type="ph" /> James Moore (47:25). Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got three questions, one on your sequential daily order growth outlook.</p>
          <p>It is a pretty good job cooling the outlook last quarter, so I'm interested in what you're saying now. But do you really expect to see a negative group volume number in any of the next four quarters? Is that what ultimately happens if we go a year hence, and we still got that sequential negative picture? I'm just trying to understand, given the mining support in the backlog, whether you think that really is going to head in that direction?</p>
          <p>Secondly, China and Brazil, is it that they make much higher margins and that there's a mixed effect, or is it that China and Brazil margins have fallen?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on road construction, Dynapac, is the margin still at the mid single-digit level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, that were the questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, on Dynapac, yes, I think of road construction engineering, as we call it, I will call like that &#x2013; otherwise, we talk about the brand &#x2013; I think we can do better there. And I think we are also working on that to get new products moving around with some manufacturing, which we have already done. And of course, we're working on efficiency, internal efficiency, and working harder on the availability of the parts and service part. But that's still on the &#x2013; yes, on the single-digit margin part. So more work to do.</p>
          <p>When it &#x2013; when it comes to the margin where you were asking, and I've said already several times, for Atlas Copco, we don't mind where to grow, geographically. I think &#x2013; is it Brazil, is it China, is it U.S., is it Europe? We don't mind.</p>
          <p>I think the margins which Atlas Copco makes, if you take globally, is rather equal. If there is one specific country where it's better than another, yes. But it's maybe not to do with more of the margin and the pricing of the product. It's more with the efficiency of the country. The way it's done in that one. So on that part, I don't mind. If it is &#x2013; if we sell it China or if we sell it in U.S. or we sell it in Kazakhstan, I think I don't mind.</p>
          <p>Then yes when it comes to the outlook &#x2013; and I would like to read it again what we said. I think we expect that it will weaken somewhat. I'm not &#x2013; don't believe in that it will drop, if I use that word. But I think that given everything what is in the pipeline, and you see the growth measures in China, you see also our European situation. We see U.S. and then the whole banking situation &#x2013; I think this we should not neglect will have an effect on the total business. And how much will it be? Who knows?</p>
          <p>I think on the other hand, to repeat one of the questions I got here, of course, we go for aftermarket share. That's for sure. We believe also that we have a very strong aftermarket potential. We can take more market share. We have high presence, and we can do  better in all areas. Also even in the mining area, when we even have good profitability.</p>
          <p>So on one hand, maybe we will get tough winds &#x2013; of tougher winds. No tailwind maybe. Maybe we get headwind. But on the other hand, I also believe that this company should be able to perform at any weather. I think there is a saying that they say here in Sweden &#x2013; there is no bad weather, there is only bad clothing. So let's take that one as an advice.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, <mark type="ph" /> James (51:39), I mean we might have had the two questions in one. In your first question, I think you started asking about our sequential order outlook, but then I understood that your question was, does that really fall into a negative revenue development? Was that your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was thinking a negative order volume number in any of the next four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we don't believe in any demand development, that is, of course, a risk for that. Absolutely. That's how you should read our outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I thought. Could I follow-up on your China/Brazil answer as well? Just &#x2013; I was referring to the minus 4% incremental organic margin on the revenue growth in Construction Technique, and Hans Ola, you gave an answer about China and Brazil. I didn't really understand what you were saying there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Construction Technique, well, we have a negative incremental margin.</p>
          <p>What I meant was that the two examples of very important markets for this business have fallen quite severely, very quickly. And we mentioned Brazil for Construction &#x2013; for let's say road development equipment, primarily, in China and Brazil.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, these are the same markets where we are really wanting to grow for the future. So we haven't completely stopped all activities, when it comes to the investing in the market organization, in the service organization, et cetera. And I think the combination of those two things gives in the quarter a poor incremental situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you couldn't size the absolute margin drops in these areas, as to how much you've been prepared to sacrifice for investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we &#x2013; I don't think we are prepared to give you any clear answer on that. But it signals, of course, that we have the long-term view on these both markets and products, and that's why we invest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think one thing I can elaborate maybe on China. I think one area where we really will be very reluctant to &#x2013; when it comes to feet on the street, and then, I mean, service and sales people &#x2013; really to reduce is in China. I think we really need to go further in developing the presence, and getting also experienced Chinese Dynapac people on the street.</p>
          <p>And of course, when it is a bit tougher for six months or a year or a year and a half, I think then I need to hang in. Because if I don't hang in, then I will be too late, even one and a half year, when the market comes back. And that &#x2013; I think this company can set that out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:37). Sorry for getting back to the outlook again, but if you look at the aftermarket business as such, you're talking about good development. In growth terms, do you expect growth in aftermarket in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter?</p>

          <p>Yes, that is for sure. And also we have seen even in the crisis situation, where we were and very recently &#x2013; we all know 2008, 2009 &#x2013; we also have seen that our aftermarket was really not dropping. It was &#x2013; I think &#x2013; okay, we got a couple of percentages, if we take over the period of a year, where we had a couple drops. But it was very, very small I think. And that is also what I expect if something &#x2013; kind of softening &#x2013; that we still are able to grow in the aftermarket.</p>

          <p>Shorter follow-up or a related question. I don't know if it's relevant or not. But is there &#x2013; in the present environment during the third quarter, has there been any difference in the pricing environment, if you compare new equipment sales with aftermarket? Or is it equally strong or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Because it's different, aftermarket pricing and equipment.</p>
          <p>Because if you take aftermarket, I think that goes on. I think aftermarket pricing goes partly together with inflation because that is &#x2013; because everybody sees that this &#x2013; it's people. And on the other hand, I think it is specific services, value you create. So it's the package. And I think that has hold on. I think that goes on.</p>
          <p>When it comes to equipment, that can be different. I think you can have a competitive situation. You get to have launch of new products. So that's a totally different situation.</p>
          <p>But I have not heard &#x2013; and you have seen us reporting also &#x2013; I've not heard anyone that there is more price pressure now than there was a quarter before. There is always price pressure, <mark type="ph" /> and if you lose it &#x2013; (56:41)</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The aftermarket business is somewhat gaining from the fact that you're holding back investments in new equipment &#x2013; I mean serving older equipment more or...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but that will &#x2013; I think in this short period, you don't see that. That I think we should see over longer period. So I don't &#x2013; that I cannot see for sure.</p>
          <p>I hope that if that happens, if people &#x2013; it's like with your car. At the end of the day, you need to replace your four tires.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you are &#x2013; so that will also be the same in our case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, very quickly, has there any weakness you've seen in the automotive-related business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. And you know, we are in the tooling business. I think I see a very strong development going on in Europe with the big Europeans. I see a very solid quotation level and really lending orders in China. And I think the bottleneck in China is us. And related to people and getting enough people and all that. And I think I saw a very, very, very solid development also in US.</p>
          <p>So these three &#x2013; there are a lot of models in the pipeline. And now we very soon &#x2013; okay, I need myself to train a bit further in &#x2013; when you come to the Schucker business, which will be a business which is two years ahead of our existing system. So I will get more and more insight on that part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a question here. One more in Stockholm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:19) just a couple of easy ones, first regarding production levels towards the end of the year. What &#x2013; is there any difference there for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, if you look at daily production rates?</p>
          <p>And secondly, once again about mining, you mentioned you expect to operate above 20%. And I guess it's a quite substantial way down. Should we see that as a forecast for the fourth quarter? Or is it more like a long term that you are able to do it better than 20%?</p>
          <p>So I guess my question is more like are there seasonality impact or there mix effects there in the fourth quarter that sort of make a big difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you taking the last one? [laughter]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can complement what Ronnie said before.</p>
          <p>But I mean what we believe is that at this level of activity, at this level of revenue height, et cetera, we don't have anything specifically positive in the Q3 report for mining, if I put it that way. So I mean everything else we equal, we don't see that there is any need in the short perspective to see any dramatic movement, but mix can be different and so on and so forth. But...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know also in the mining, and we all know, it can be a stop and go. And I don't know. So that's the reason we need to be very agile on that.</p>
          <p>But I think we also have seen, even during the stop which we got in 2008, 2009, I think the aftermarket kept up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's been some volatility in the mining-related currencies. Has it affected or will it affect you going forward? Like South African rand -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think &#x2013; of course, I don't like that the rand &#x2013; that the rand is going down, the Australian dollar is going down, and the Brazilian real is also softening. But okay, then you get &#x2013; you get some gains and some losses in that part.</p>
          <p>I think when it comes to the currency, if we take the whole basket &#x2013; because I'm not looking for specific &#x2013; for one specific segment product range. Because we decided to produce underground rigs in Sweden. We decided &#x2013; but we make service drills in China, and we make them in U.S. I cannot make them in each currency. That would be fantastic.</p>
          <p>So you gain and you lose in that part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have seen lately, and as we speak, actually, is that emerging markets' mining-related currencies, if I call it that, have fallen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the Aussie dollar and the Canadian dollar have stayed reasonably good or even in par with &#x2013; with what the dollar has been doing. And the dollar has been strong, and the Chinese currency is strong. So it's basically rand and ruble and Brazilian currency that has weakened.</p>
          <p>But all-in-all, as Ronnie says, we don't see that as a major impact in short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that we are coming actually &#x2013; time flies... Sorry, for the production...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Yes, I need two months (01:01:42). Now, I think what we see is, we had a very solid output in quarter three.</p>
          <p>And I think we still &#x2013; I think, to answer the question a bit different, and when Hans Ola was talking about the book-to-bill and the orders-on-hand situation, we still have a lot to deliver. So if the orders received side stays around this level, I think we will definitely keep for a while, this output level.</p>
          <p>And normally, quarter four, from historically &#x2013; we will see if it is &#x2013; normally when it comes to factory output, a very solid invoicing quarter. You have seen when you can play with inventory and all that, but on the other hand, I don't think we have a big backpack inventory because we make &#x2013; we don't make the stock, we make for orders. Everything what we make is sold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we have used quite a lot of time. I know there are many questions left on the telephone conference. So if I just take one last. I'm sorry for that, but as we always say, after the call you are very welcome to call me, Mattias Olson in IR or anyone that you can reach, and we will try to answer your questions. But we take one final question in the conference then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from the line of S&#xE9;bastien Gruter. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions if I may. Just one question on the inventory to sales ratio the end of this year, where would you like to be in terms of inventory-to-sales ratio?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be on the aftermarket as the percentage of sales. I mean that's <mark type="ph" /> for the full year (01:03:38) you gave us a number for Q3 this year, but could you give us a number for Q3 last year and for Q2 this year, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest, Hans Ola, you answer both questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when it comes to the first &#x2013; your first question, S&#xE9;bastien, on our inventory to sales, now we don't have that type of projection or type of planning tool that relates inventory to sales. What we do track internally is the turnover in days.</p>
          <p>But if we give too many details on that, we are also giving away quite a lot of information about the different margins and the different segments, so it might not be so useful either for you. The inventory to sales, we have no reason to believe that it will change dramatically. We don't feel worried about having too much inventory entering to a slightly more uncertain demand situation. That's what we answered before and I think I will have to stop with that comment. We don't see any trends that our turnover in days either for receivables or inventory is showing a very negative or let's say &#x2013; any direction for the time being. For the last three years, we've actually improved it and that is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's efficiency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's efficiency, exactly. Then there was a question on aftermarket. I didn't pick that up, really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I had difficulty. So I think you were asking a comparison between quarter three last year and this quarter on aftermarket but what was the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The aftermarket as a percentage of group sales, I mean you gave the number 41% for this quarter and I was wondering what was the percentage in the last quarter and in Q3 last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are referring to the pie chart that we showed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is really a 12-month number. So it's not specific, or am I wrong there? So it is Q3. You were right and I was wrong. Sorry about that. Q3 number was <mark type="ph" /> 48 &#x2013; 41 (01:05:46), but that consists of services &#x2013; the spare parts and the consumables, some specialty rental et cetera. So it's a relatively big aggregate number, but when we look at the specific spare parts and service proportion, you can definitely see that we have fallen in that respect from last year. In the &#x2013; so we have more equipment sales this year, but I don't have the numbers right off the top of my head on that. We will have to come back to you on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And compared to Q2, is there any meaningful change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a very dramatic one. It's rather similar but again, perhaps we can enlighten you a little bit more on that later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I can help you a bit in your thinking and you can call later on for the exact figure. But we have a solid double-digit growth in the aftermarket. That goes on for several months, several since the crisis and since &#x2013; after the crisis, and I think you can also see what we have been doing on the equipment side. So you can see that the ratio is gradually moving more to equipment, but that is not spectacularly moving due to the fact that the aftermarket is growing still, yes.</p>
