          <p>Good day, and welcome to the Sberbank First Quarter 2012 IFRS Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Anton Karamzin, Deputy Chairman of Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our quarterly results call. Today, we have published our condensed interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for three months ended 31st of March 2012.</p>
          <p>I will focus for a couple of minutes on the main highlights of the published results and then we'll open it up for your questions. Our net profit for three months ended 31st of March this year reached RUB92.2 billion or RUB4.28 for ordinary share. This is a 6% increase on the RUB86.8 billion that we have shown for the same period in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our net interest margin reported is 6%. This is the same level as the first quarter in 2011. We have shown a stable growth in our loan portfolio with retail component growing by 14% for the first three months this year, and corporate growing at about 6%. We have continued to show high returns on equity at 27.9% in the first quarter as compared to 33.6% first quarter last year. We have also continued to show improving loan quality. The non-performing loan ratio improved slightly from 4.9% as of the end of 2011 to 4.8%, while non-performing loan coverage ratio remained healthy at 1.5 times, and we have shown a net recovery of provisions of RUB3.2 billion for the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Our cost to income ratio remains at an adequate level that we have forecasted before, mid-40s, which is 46.3% exactly versus 43.3% for the same period a year earlier. The cost growth quarter-on-quarter between &#x2013; year-on-year between the first quarter of 2011 and 2012 has been relatively steep, but we will be happy to comment as to what were the key components of that.</p>
          <p>We remain very healthily capitalized. Regardless of the fact that in the first quarter of this year we have consolidated the purchase of Volksbank International, our capital adequacy ratios remained high. The total capital adequacy is 15.4%, which is well above the 8% minimum requirement, and the Tier 1 ratio is 11.8%.</p>
          <p>This rounds up the highlights of the main reported numbers, and I suggest we open it up for the questions. We have roughly an hour and a quarter. We will be rounding up at about 6 p.m. Moscow time. However, as usual and as always, we will be happy to provide answers to any questions that may have been unanswered or not fully answered during this call in an online mode through all the standard channels: website, telephone numbers of our Investor Relation function.</p>
          <p>So with that, I am opening it up to your questions. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is on the OpEx dynamics. I noticed that the wage component in quarterly OpEx was flat sequentially which is unusual, and it would be interesting to see the impact of VBI and what is happening with the other components like depreciation, IC, renovation. And it would be great to get an updated guidance for the full year, either year-on-year growth or cost to income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Alex. Hello, thank you for the question. Well, the payroll component of our costs is shown in our presentation on the slide number &#x2013; let me just share that with you, yes, number 15. And again, I forgot to mention, sorry, as usual, our presentation that helps you to look at the &#x2013; this in a more convenient format that everybody is used to is on our website in Investor Relations section, in the usual place.</p>
          <p>So, the growth of staff-related costs compared to the first quarter of 2011 has been 20.6%. The effect of Troika and VBI consolidation has accelerated that a little bit but not very significantly. The overall impact in the pay-related stuff costs is driven by the overall growth in the business itself, and again if nearing to completion this period of about a year and a half that it took us to roll out the new pay systems that tag the compensation closer to the market &#x2013; market level after the freeze that we had back between 2007, 2010.</p>
          <p>The non-pay related costs are consisting of a number of components that the overall run rate that represents the core regular business, and then there's the strategic component to that which is what we continue to spend on making investments in the overall strategic transformation program.</p>
          <p>The proportions between the two are roughly &#x2013; they somewhat vary sometimes from quarter-to-quarter, but they are roughly 60%, 70% of the core revenue business expense and 30%, 40%, the strategic driven costs. The biggest five drivers for the transformation strategic driven costs are focused on the following topics.</p>
          <p>Firstly is creation of the unified and centralized IT platform for all our territorial banks. As you remember, we've always mentioned this topic. This is one that will ultimately in a year or two will allow us to consolidate our IT platform to just two core systems and help us to consolidate our data centers into just two big data centers. So there's the component that is in the project that is software and that is also the hardware.</p>
          <p>So there is two other items related to that is &#x2013; as a separate spend item which is the increase of the resilience and productivity of our IT processing systems. And there's the hardware part which is the big &#x2013; first big data center that we've launched back in the fourth quarter of last year, which is if you recollect we've mentioned in previous calls, is the one that is number eight in the world in size and number one in Europe. So the first portion of that, the first section of that data center has been launched in the fourth quarter, but we start generating the regular maintenance costs associated with that, and it also starts amortizing some of the CapEx and that is &#x2013; it's having the impact on the expenditure.</p>
          <p>The other two topics that are key drivers in the strategic side of the cost is reformatting of our branches in accordance with the new brand book as we have started two years ago, having done the first dozen back in 2010. In 2011, we have done the first 800. The plan for this year is to do the next 2,000 branches into the new format. The cost of branch of this exercise is, of course, reducing because we're now starting to incur the effect of the bulk, processing of this &#x2013; of this reformatting and its centralized unified procurement, et cetera. So whilst the first three topics I have mentioned in 2011 were to the full year to the tune of about RUB20 billion spend, so there'll be a proportionate amount of number &#x2013; amount of cost that you will see in 2012.</p>
          <p>The second topic, which is reformatting on a full annual basis in 2011, was about RUB8.8 billion. So it will be somewhat proportionally more in 2012 to reflect the number of branches that we do.</p>
          <p>And the third topic is the consolidation of our back-office functions. This is right in the middle of its process. We have &#x2013; we'll re-operate &#x2013; we already operate at the interim stage, the 15 instead of the original. Actually, we have &#x2013; the overall transition is from 800 down to less than big operation centers. But there's two stages to that. First, we created 15 and cut some of the back offices of the 800 that we had originally, so this is in full swing. These are the back-office units that concentrate a few thousand back-office personnel in the biggest hubs in the country and allow us to increase efficiency quite significantly. And we will run this program for another two, three years before we can fully claim that we're less than 10 and all the 800 back offices that we had historically could be closed. We have started this three years ago, so we're roughly in the middle of executing this program.</p>
          <p>So overall, we see that having started heavily investing and spending on &#x2013; for the first strategic purposes that gives us, that started giving us certain good impact on the top line revenues and efficiencies and the cost for particular heavily operational processes. We continued to make those very profitable investments, which starts driving the costs quite significantly in both directions when we spend and then when we make the savings. However, in nominal terms, that still means that our year-on-year comparable cost line growth is going to be quite significant. So we would like to modify our guidance much closer to the consensus that most of the analysts that cover us are projecting on The Street. We have collected the most recent consensus and it is roughly around 20% nominal growth. So, we modify our guidance to confirm that, yes, this is a correct assessment of what it is going to be this year. I guess that should probably answer most of the questions you've asked, Alex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Anton. That's very helpful indeed. And if it is possible to comment on the general business environment and the net interest margin in this contest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the general business environment continues to be quite stable with a bit of a positive inclination to that and that is stable in reference to what the normalized trend that we would have seen in 2011, which means it excludes the spike in activity in this period that we've seen in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The margin dynamics are the following. Whilst some of the cost of funding driven by the situation in the markets and some of the mild interest rate increases in our retail deposit base has seen some pressure, we are confident in keeping our margin forecast more or less stable. The 6.2%, 6.4% range remains valid. We may see some color that it could be a bit more conservative, maybe close to 6.2%, but the only the kind of main reason for that is the fact that the compensating growth in the assets yields in our margins are actually coming in a little bit late. We have raised our rates like in retail loans back in the 20th of March as the press has reported. So this &#x2013; the positive effect of this is going to come in starting from the 2nd of quarter and onwards. So there's a little bit of timing difference in how our margin operates, but nevertheless, the 6% margin flat that we have shown for the first quarter this year is exactly the same that we've shown for the first quarter last year. So we're more or less comfortable that the seasonality and going through the year will be similar in what we've seen last year and therefore, our margins will be roughly stable.</p>
          <p>Alexander Morozov who is here with us, our Head of Department of Finance and also an Executive Board Member, also has a little bit of a color to add to this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have just liquidity cost money and taking in account volatile environments in the world, the technology have additional liquidity cost in our balance sheet and pay for it if is necessarily experienced, but what we have today. And say, adding to what Anton has already mentioned, we'll not exclude some other measures which will be further undertaken by the bank to further increase the margin on asset side. So it's in our projection, so to cut the long story short, we believe that the composition of our loan portfolio with accelerated growth of retail loans, and the first four quarters exactly confirm what we versus a relatively more stable and more conservative growth on corporate side, but exactly what we need to improve our margin. Hence, we believe that's how initially &#x2013; initial guidance 6.2%, 6.4%, that's exactly what will happen at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Anton. Thank you, Alexander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question will come from Cristina Marzea from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Perhaps, I could follow first on the margin question. Just to be honest, I was surprised looking at the details. I was surprised to see the retail deposit prices moving so much in a quarter by 50 bps. And I remember previous guidance was that it takes roughly three quarters before a price increase on the deposit side seeds into the whole deposit base. Can I confirm whether that will still be the case, i.e. will we still see further increases in your cost of funding? And then following also on the corporate lending side, again surprising, given the liquidity conditions that we've seen prices on corporate loans coming down, any color on new prices on corporate lending currently in the second quarter and how quickly they can seed through would be appreciated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the partial effect on the liabilities side of our kind of very moderate steps in increasing the cost of retail deposits is a bit of cannibalization. When some of the people forgo the interest on the old deposits and pop into the promo rates, promotional rates that I used in our marketing campaigns. That in the long run is actually &#x2013; may not have &#x2013; be very economically viable for the client but such as psychologically some clients do that. So in the long run, that effect is kind of leveled out a little bit but on the short term, it shows a little bit of a spike.</p>
          <p>On the loan side, again, the effect of the repricing in the corporate loans is &#x2013; in corporate retail loans is also a little bit of a lumpy process that start filtering through not from the very beginning, especially in corporate loan side. It's also the function of the risk assessment that we make. There's also the effect of us sticking to the better risk profile and therefore maybe compensating with a bit lower margins in there sometimes.</p>
          <p>In terms of corporate term deposits, we're also saying that there is quite a bit of an increase, but term deposits, if you remember, is this valve that is the most flexible handle for us to regulate the liquidity that the corporate treasurers in the Russian market are very sensitive to an extra few bps in the rate and therefore, you can use this to regulate your liquidity demand much faster and more efficiently and flexibly than with a huge critical mass of retail deposits that moves very, very slowly.</p>
          <p>We also have borrowed not only from corporates in the first quarter, but as you can see in Slide 11, the analysis of interest expense, on the top chart, there's the blue section of the bar that mostly relates to the additions &#x2013; the costs associated with additional liquidity that we've taken from the repo market, with CBR, et cetera. Those were down in the moments where other sources of funding in the market were sort of prohibitably expensive for us and we start to a bit more cheaper funding that was available. So, this hopefully gives you some color about how our thinking was working on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So to confirm, your message was normally the retail repricing happens more slowly. This time, there were some acceleration, so we shouldn't treat this increase as a trend to continue for the next couple of quarters. And perhaps I can follow, could you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing &#x2013; the only one thing that I would add to that is that, the overall interest rate environment, the funding environment has become a bit more volatile than last year. And therefore, the market players, including us, will have to be a bit more agile in their reaction to that or maybe being proactive to that and therefore, people will see a little a bit more volatility in terms of interest expense or interest income items in all the bank income statements, and although it's always to the less extent pronounced with us because we're that big. But nevertheless, that would probably be noticeable with us too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is actually an excellent leading to my second question which was on your view on the current funding environment, and I think on a previous call and we've seen your CEO making comments in the press about lobbying for some sort of a solution longer term funding from the government. Is there any update on those on the funding framework that you could give us? Clearly, you're now reaching over 100% loan to deposit. You're also looking at acquisitions where you need to fund more. So any thoughts on that topic of broader funding would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the work is continuing. Also, this is an important discussion that needs to get all the key stakeholders in the regulatory and government side included. And as we all know, there's been a change &#x2013; recent change of government. So we need to leave a little bit space to the new officials to formulate their views and start interacting with us on the practical side. Also, there's not only the long-term funding arrangements in some of the &#x2013; there's some other components to the liquidity, which in terms of how the authorities may contribute to improving the environment and that includes various other topics like the system of deposit insurance, how and structurally it's being built up from and from what parts of the banking sector the money is sourced, and what's the role of the bigger banks and smaller banks in there. So, there's a variety of topics. So I do not have anything specific yet to report but, I guess, last time we spoke about this, we were really warning that the real answers to that question are going to be coming probably closest to the second half of this year anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is great. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I've got three questions and I think that two of them are still margin related, so they we're staying on the topic I suppose and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're happy, no allergies to any questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My first question is, could you remind us about the magnitude of the repricing of both the retail and corporate portfolio that you have done since the fourth quarter of last year? Because I seem to remember that &#x2013; but of course, you've mentioned the one in the late March, but we have seen at least two previous ways from repricing already, so just to be able to see the viability of the associate increases. If you could remind us of those, that would be great.</p>
          <p>And the second question is still about the liquidity. I think that, of course, we have seen in the first quarter quite a significant increase in your interbank funding and, of course, interbank assets as well. Could you just sort of let us know how do you actually see the liquidity situation within the Russian banking system, whether your interbank positions are coming &#x2013; are sort of &#x2013; are done with a &#x2013; with Russian or international banks and whether the liquidity is really ruble or U.S. dollar?</p>
          <p>And my third question is about &#x2013; I suppose the impact of the VBI transaction on your reported renegotiated loans both in retail and in corporate, we have seen quite a significant increase in those reported numbers quarter-on-quarter, and I just wondered and what is, yes, what's the impact on VBI on those? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me start taking it in reverse order. Yes, renegotiated loans both in corporate and retail. All the increase that we report in the first quarter are actually mostly coming from VBI. That is relatively moderate. We're happy with the market at the level of fair value at which we're taking the assets from there. So, these renegotiated loans sourced from within Sberbank without VBI are negligible this time.</p>
          <p>Now interbank liquidity, we see it's quite &#x2013; somewhat volatile situation, but the one that doesn't actually make us nervous because we have all seen that the Russian monetary authorities when the liquidity situation got soft back in the end of last year have acted very efficiently and swiftly and injected short-term liquidity. So the market didn't skip a beat. So we're comfortable that if the going gets really difficult and the regulator is confirming that they're in a standby mode, so there shouldn't be disruption. Longer-term liquidity continues to be relatively constrained and difficult.</p>
          <p>In terms of interbank balances, we've always maintained that we don't really keep much in the interbank account except from the very liquid <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:29) balances, we don't really engage in a lot of interbank lending other than on a properly secured repo market. Therefore, we don't find ourselves sensitive to any risk implications from the unstable or volatile situation in the money markets. And on the margin, <mark type="audio gap" /> (29:57-30:06) yes, I didn't quite get &#x2013; you asked to me to what scale have we repriced our deposit base and our loan &#x2013; yes, our deposit rate. Yes, there were a number of marketing campaigns where we're going to select the little buckets of some products and we're putting some higher promo rates on them than the overall increase in the broad range of products. But how would you want us to measure that and the scale of that repricing to answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Anton, actually the question was more about the loan side of the margin rather than the deposit side. I think that in the conference call of the fourth quarter, we talked about the kind of the first wave of repricing, and I think the number suggested then was about 100 basis points on the average corporate portfolio. And I just wondered through the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter by how much has the loan rate effectively gone up? I think there was also an announcement in retail where I think all the retail loans and prices went up ex-mortgages, if I remember correctly about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the overall repricing has had a kind of modest impact, but if you look at Slide 10, you actually see from quarter four to quarter one, there's a little bit of a downtrend in terms of repricing in both average loan yields and corporate loans and loans to individuals. And there's two effects to that: one is somewhat lower yields because we've consolidated the book of VBI because it generally on average is a bit lower yielding one and also there is &#x2013; there's little bit of a &#x2013; just one second, let me check one. <mark type="audio gap" /> (32:17-32:31)</p>
          <p>And the other temporary impact was effect of some other promo campaigns for retail loans to the clients of our corporate &#x2013; to the retail clients of employees of our corporate clients and that was a temporary effect. So it actually leveled itself back out. That has had a very good impact on the volume of loans, however. As you can see in our first quarter, the growth in the retail loan book of about 14% not only for just the one quarter is a very healthy one.</p>
          <p>What I would actually also observe at this point is that the credit quality of this growth is continuing to be at the stellar high levels and we are not seeing the &#x2013; any quality deterioration associated with this growth for the one very simple reason, it's just the expansion of the client base of the same quality rather than getting into other risk segments within the population of the client, which is something that we are very pleased with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. I'm so sorry, I must have been unclear. I understand the averaging effect in the third quarter. What I suppose I was trying to get to is the marginal loan yield increases, if you were to compare what you're offering now, for example, versus what you were offering in the third quarter of last year?</p>

          <p>Just one second, let me <mark type="audio gap" /> (34:22-34:36). We have rechecked our numbers together with Alexander here, yes. The retail loan increases that were done in the first quarter are roughly 2 percentage points above what &#x2013; the levels that we had before. And on the corporate, it's a bit milder, we &#x2013; on the big large corporates, as I've said, we were sticking to quality. So there isn't really that much increase that one can get out of that segment simply because of the rates environment because the quality remains very high there. And in the lower segments, it's been a moderate increase in the rates because the growth there has also been relatively moderate as you can see from the balance sheet side.</p>

          <p>And our next question will come from Bob Kommers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. We'll actually take a question from Alan Webborn from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Could I ask you firstly about the sort of trends in fee income? Are we guessing any one year of point where the efficiency gains that you're making within the retail will start to impact the amount of fees you can actually charge? I mean, clearly it improves efficiency going forward. I mean, are we getting to a point where the sort of fees that you can charge for basic banking businesses start to fall away as the customers use more remote channels, as the efficiency grows. I just wonder where you think you are in that sort of longer-term trend, that would be interesting.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think yesterday, you may have suggested that sort of RUB10 billion to RUB15 billion was about the cost of risk that you were looking for for 2012 and I think you said in an earlier answer to a question that the credit costs &#x2013; the credit quality of the growth that you're experiencing now is very high. And I wondered if you'd like to take a stab of what you think the normalized level of a cost of risk once this process of write-backs comes to the major end of, I guess, it's sort of coming to at some point.</p>
          <p>And finally, I understand that clearly there's a process going on, but it would be useful for you to &#x2013; for us to hear your thoughts about DenizBank, and what you can share with us in terms of the impact on capital and why as the only bidder that you felt it was right to carry on and execute that transaction at the current time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for the question. The fees, we are already in the territory where the kind of the basic fees that we charge from the vanilla transactions done in the branch physically when the client comes have started to fall down. We firstly have implemented the technology for people to do it through online channels much cheaply and have increased the tariffs for the visits that aren't really necessary physically to the branch. And that has resulted in the amount of basic transactions done through remote channels growing up in about three years from 25% to almost 70%.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we have started seeing that downward trend. However, what is good, as you can see, is that we still show very healthy growth rates in overall fees and commission business because we actually generate some new types of fees and commission charges that are growing very healthily, and this is anything that is associated with plastic cards, anything that is associated with fees and commissions we get from the insurance companies for distributing their insurance products through our branch network. We also get quite healthy acquiring fees on the plastic card payments. We get fees on credit cards. We get quite a number of things.</p>
          <p>Also, so that still delivers us anywhere between 15% and 20% on average nominal growth, annualized nominal growth in the past five, six quarters. We've been pretty stable. So the positive effect compensates for the negative and we see that this pace of growth is still sustainable in the long term.</p>
          <p>Now the cost of &#x2013; normalized cost of risk, we will really be able to get all &#x2013; we have really minor plugs in our assumptions for the recovery rate, right now, we're pretty precise more or less. However, we're just getting to the end of the full five-year recovery period of problem loans that have been created in the vintage of 2008 and 2009. And obviously, it's closer to the end of this recovery period that you see the really more difficult rubles to be collected than the easier ones that we've collected up until now in the first three years since the crisis. Therefore, until we really get the more difficult ones, we cannot fully say yes, I &#x2013; my planning of the cost of risk is not reliant on any kind of qualitative assumptions. It's really statistical because we've gone through the cycle. We've collated all the data.</p>
          <p>So that type of a precise conversation, you and I can have closer to the end of 2013. But now again, the guesstimate don't hold this &#x2013; close to that is that after the recovery cycle completes, it should be roughly 100 basis points and below rather than close to the 100 itself. And then Deniz, well, we are in a period of exclusivity. I'd rather not actually comment that much. There has been a lot of research published on this topic including some of the items that was published by Moody's. I think it had to go &#x2013; I guess you can source and call it from that but overall, this is all &#x2013; what I'd say is it's not in relation to Deniz, it's just that we are not deviating from the fundamentals of our international expansion strategy that we've always been describing to everyone and that were laid in this strategy document, if I use strategy document that we've published back in nearly end of 2008 and this is just a part. Everything that we do is that just executing the strategies, so I'll probably limit the answer to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Yes, I had a follow-up question on the asset yield trends. You mentioned in the &#x2013; on the loan side the repricing of your loans, but could you give any indication of how &#x2013; what percentage of your corporate loan portfolio, you've been able to reprice since the third quarter of last year? Has that been 20% or 15% or 30%, how much has it rather been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, hello Bob, thanks for the question. I guess, it's not really much of a specific effort that we have taken, therefore the percentages are much close to the average run rate of how much loans actually reprice through the natural maturity and year financing cycle. So it's around 15% or something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the &#x2013; yes, in the average corporate loan yields which were down in the first quarter, what was the impact &#x2013; what was the impact of perhaps on some mix deterioration during particularly the fourth quarter of last year when you experienced very fast growth in the loans to the largest companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't really observe quality deterioration associated with the peak of activity in loan growth for the fourth quarter for very simple reasons, that we reported back on the last call when we were reporting the fourth quarter is that a lot of that activity was actually related to the fact that we've enjoyed our competitive position. But the fact that most of the other competition, external markets, domestic markets, banking sector, public markets have had liquidity problems and have had difficulties supplying to the basic funding needs of the corporate client universe. Also, seasonally, the demand from the corporate clients was somewhat higher.</p>
          <p>So we've used &#x2013; we've taken the advantage of this by growing in absolute size pretty nicely and in terms of market share quite nicely without having to deteriorate in quality. Yes, the rates that you charge for loans to somewhat higher quality because some of the big blue chips came to us for borrowing into &#x2013; in the quarter four instead of reaching out to the public market. The absolute yield may be lower because the quality is high somewhat, but that's kind of a nice problem to have I guess. So in short terms, no, we didn't really experience feasible deterioration in quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And on the funding side and I just wanted to clarify whether I understand correctly on the retail deposit repricing, were you saying that there was a high take up of promo transactions also on the deposit side and therefore a larger proportion of the repricing on the retail deposits has been done already, and therefore you would expect that quite a large part of the repricing has already happened, or is it going to follow the usual repricing of that three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I wouldn't be as aggressive to say most of the repricing has actually taken place. Again, our retail liability book is relatively slowly repricing one because of its critical mass. Therefore, there is little bit of an early effect of that, that some of the &#x2013; a little bit of that, a minor part of that is front loaded by people jumping over and not always to their kind of full economic benefits. As I mentioned, it's somewhat psychological sometimes.</p>
          <p>The full effect of this early jump is yet to be assessed because some of the promotion programs that we've kicked off have not yet finished. They usually lost them, so but were &#x2013; for some smaller parts of the product in retail deposits, we're picking them up early in the year than a little bit in March than we have a nice little deposit for the May Day and then Victory Day, that's branded the Victor for visitors. So that program is going to run a few days and weeks, I guess, or actually end of May, I think it's scheduled to finish.</p>
          <p>So the full impact we will be able to calculate and see for the second quarter, however, as I mentioned, a little bit early that the rates and liquidity requirement overall in the market remain a little bit volatile. So we will be using all those marketing tricks every time &#x2013; every once in a while one way or another to work on pricing and the market share. So sometimes, this is going to be -going to bringing in a little bit of a statistical volatility but on a minor scale throughout the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Gyorgy Olah from HSBC. Just had two questions, one on returning to the personnel costs, you have explained very well the reason for a year-on-year increase. But on a sequential basis, it's quite unusual to have the first quarter as high as the fourth quarter. Could you maybe shed some more light on what was exactly happening on the personnel cost front quarter-on-quarter? And regarding the VBI acquisition, how much was the impact of the consolidation on the NPLs and also on how much was the impact on the Tier 1 ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your first question in terms of the pay costs jumping quarter-on-quarter, well, actually &#x2013; if you look at the slide 15 on our presentation that we put on the web, if you look at the fourth quarter pay cost of RUB52.2 billion and first quarter RUB38.8, quarter-on-quarter it isn't actually a big jump. It is a bit of a jump first quarter to the first quarter of 2011 &#x2013; oh, sorry, no, I'm reading the top part of the chart. It's from RUB56.7 billion on the bottom to RUB57.3 billion, so it was a little bit of jump, but it is not particularly high.</p>
          <p>And, of course, we are taking on about 6,000 people in VBI and we have also taken up Troika a little big earlier, but nevertheless it's about 3,000 people. And the kind of the people that you obviously take in an investment banking trading business is a little bit more expensive on average than you run in close to 1 million of employee population.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just ask regarding this that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another little tiny twist to that is that part of the team that we are having in Troika is being further built up because we are gearing up for the very healthy pipeline that the fact of our merger with Troika has generated in investment banking. And therefore, we needed a bit more resource in actually being able to process that, which is a good news. I guess in investment banking market, this is not a very frequent occasion where you hear such type of a dynamic. I don't think many competitors can say that. But yes, we are in a hiring mode there because we need to execute pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, can you confirm that actually this flat quarter-on-quarter personnel costs is not due to the fact that you may be &#x2013; you have changed how you are accruing for, let's say, bonus costs throughout the year that previously not have assumed, no, or that has nothing to do with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe its full accrual basis, there are some little differences that you may observe if you look at our Russian accounts between how these things accrue, because they do accrue in both Russian accounts and in IFRS accounts. But technicalities are a little bit more weird in the Russian side but that's as far as it goes. The only impact is externally Troika and VBI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we should expect that this would be more or less than the rate for the first three quarters and then again a bit seasonal jump in the fourth quarter in personnel costs like last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to certain extent, yes. Because you can't really accrue much of the annual compensation part before you get closer to the end of year and you see how well you have done, which is what has happened to us last year. We didn't even quite expect ourselves to grow our net profit by 74% year-on-year. So, there's some seasonality to that, you're right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And on the VBI, impact on the NPLs and the capital ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, most of the impact on the renegotiated loans and the NPLs is coming from the VBI. So that again, we're sort of happy that this is what we have taken on is fairly valued. In terms of impact of VBI on the capital adequacy ratios, it's &#x2013; I guess it's negligible, it's less than half a percentage point I guess that we get from VBI. We've &#x2013; yes, and we have looked at the consensus expectation out in the street in terms of what are Tier 1 were &#x2013; what they expected at the end of the first quarter, and there you can see we have come in quite visibly better in Tier 1 overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one more question on the Tier 1, I know that on DenizBank you do not comment much, but can you just maybe confirm that there was an interview apparently on Reuters where there was a quarter attributed to you that &#x2013; and a potential acquisition of less than 100 bps impact from the Tier 1 ratio? Could you confirm this or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Great. Just a couple of follow-up questions on the capital and the margins again, but just on capital, just follow-up on that on Gyorgy, what is &#x2013; what level would you get concerned from a Tier 1 point of view? Clearly, you're at 11.8%, you're looking good. You made this acquisition and what kind of level of the threshold of where you don't want to go below from a Tier 1 point of view? I will the second question, once you are done with this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Dave, I guess we will stick to what we have said before on this, roughly 10.5%. I guess we've said that on our annual results call is somewhere where we would &#x2013; I wouldn't even call it have internal alarms ringing because we never really take our eyes of the ball there, but it's where we will start thinking about planning for saying it bit more carefully but then again our capital generation capacity from our core activities remains pretty healthy.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's clear, that's clear, fair. And just on the margin side, I'd buy into the concept that you're repricing up and you will be uptaking your NIM as you go through the year and towards that 6.2% to 6.4% range, but short term &#x2013; and you mentioned that the volatility that we're seeing in specialty and cost performing, the quite realistic thing that your margin could be flatter even full in Q2 before we actually get the uptick in the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it has any potential to actually go deep down in &#x2013; not deep down but a little bit of a dip down in the second quarter, rather expected flat with even a bit of a positive inclination.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Anton. I've got a couple of questions and my first question is on capital. We understand the regulator looks at the N1 ratio that is already similar to sort of Basel II standardized approach that will include operating risk-weighted assets, fully phased in from the summer and then it already includes higher risk rates on certain exposures like the offshore and the related cost exposures, and just it would be quite interesting to hear your thoughts of sort of when do you expect to transition from the Basel I and the Basel requirements to Basel II standardized or when Basel II IRB approach.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on, what is on the impact of Greece leaving the Eurozone? And your chief economist forecast that in the event of that happening in the worst case scenario, the oil price could drop to $85 a barrel and we could see inflation rising to over 6% and GDP shrinking to about 2%. Just it would be quite interesting to hear what your thoughts would be in terms of the impact there in terms of loan growth, P&amp;L and more importantly, asset quality. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of Basel II, I guess it officially goes live in Russia from the 1st of January 2014. Yes, we do see the regulators moving it out by introducing some parts of approaches into the existing regulatory requirements but again, this is done relatively mildly. So we do not foresee anything radical as we see it now. Now of course, a lot of the work is yet to be done in terms of setting the methodology. And as we mentioned in our year end call, we &#x2013; we are part of all five work groups that the Bank of Russia has set up to brainstorm the approach as to implementation between its own aspirates and the representatives of the industry. And I think out of the five groups, our people are actually leaders on, I think, two groups out of five. So, we &#x2013; and yes, the underlying question is, do we expect any big shocks to how our capital ex-ratio is calculated with respect to that, and the answer is no.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:00:15-01:00:19) Greece topic, I guess, the <mark type="audio gap" /> (01:00:29-01:00:34) I'd say it's a difficult one. But let me &#x2013; my colleagues are making jokes about this, as most sensible people in the world sometimes do because it's hard to hold this flow of the negative news from Europe. But the thing is that let me make the following comment, the Russian &#x2013; real fact in the Russian banking sector environment is positioned better this time to any such external effects that will certainly, if they happen, will impact the overall economic activity and the pace of growth, the inflation, the oil price. We certainly do not see the basis for any kind of a domino effect that would spill over from the oil price and crash in the world market, if that were to happen. Because again, as we described, the situation of liquidity in the banking sector is difficult but manageable, and the regulators have shown that they can do this and at least the provision of short-term liquidity for stable functioning of the money market is tried and tested and doesn't perceive to be as any potential problem. Our regulators have very well seen them to form that role.</p>
          <p>And then the spillover from the banking sector to the real sector is also much, much less likely because following the lessons of 2008 and 2009, a lot of the Russian corporates are no longer running that much of an over leverage or liquidity mismatches on their book. And even if some of them would actually like to do that, the banks are much wiser following the crisis now. They wouldn't let them fund their long-term assets with short-term liabilities to the same extent as it was in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>Therefore, well, yes, Russia could be impacted if by a major global European event but compared to what that impact would have been in 2008 and 2009 is much lower for the reasons I've just described and see and also for the reason that our GDP growth in real terms was only &#x2013; last year was only up 4%, just above 4%. So it's not a very high cliff, it's a fall off of. We are clearly not an overheated economy as some of the other emerging markets may be at this point in time, so we therefore relatively comp.</p>
          <p>Also you could see when the prices were dipping on the market, securities markets, quite significantly a couple of times throughout last year, down to the levels that historically would have been implied that the oil price would drop to $70, $80 per barrel. And that was still kind of not causing majoring shock events to the real sector in Russia in 2011. Yes, we invested in securities, felt that but then they recovered back and therefore, the markets both in Russia and externally with respect to Russian risks that we foresee but haven't really been there. So therefore, even if the negative scenario realizes, I don't think we'll share some of the extreme use of my sale is going to global doom and gloom. I hope maybe not that much global &#x2013; that much doom and gloom for Russia for the factors that I've just described.</p>

          <p>For this year, it definitely is significantly below 100 basis points, so the numbers that we were discussing with our colleague a bit early on this call were related to the numbers after the recovery, but that recovery cycle is over and we'd be full of provisions. 2012 is going to see &#x2013; still going to see quite significant provision releases in the base case scenario for us that so far we are sticking with.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for the answers you've given to us already. I have a few follow-ups. One was &#x2013; will be a follow-up to the answer you've given to Magda and I think, just correct me if I'm wrong, but you said that you increased your retail rates by around 200 basis points since that quarter, but you haven't really increased the rate on the corporate loans, is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. What I was saying on retail, I was saying the third month of this year, which is end of March. Therefore, some rates increases were &#x2013; yes, and therefore, the P&amp;L impact on that is only going to be seen starting from quarter two. And in corporate again, there isn't such a thing as a monthly comp where you publish your rates on the web and slap the banners on the street to advertise get consumer loans from us for this investment rate. This obviously as I was &#x2013; when I &#x2013; as I implied when I was saying to &#x2013; actually not implied, as I was mentioning to both questions, how many corporate loans have we repriced, we said we repriced them on a regular flow basis as they mature, so it's about 15% since the recent quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yes, but the question was &#x2013; it was a different one. So how much &#x2013; so either from the third quarter or from the minimum, how much do you think that run rate for the corporate went up? So how &#x2013; the fund rate, the ones that you apply to new loans, so have you increased them and if yes, by how much on average? And I don't need a breakdown by segments or specific lines for sure. But just on average, how much have you applied to corporate loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The average is flattish. There is a little bit of an up. But it's flattish, much more meaningful impact is from the change in the mix, of course, because the smaller segments grow fast and they yield a bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's something I can understand because if I'm looking at your EPS you're funding, your customer deposits are 80% of your funding rates and then the corporate book is 80% of your loans. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dmitry, just before we get to the next one, the other important component, which is I've already mentioned but I just want to stress, is that we do &#x2013; because of the difficult liquidity conditions, we do a little bit of a cherry picking on risk from our corporate clients that are above the SME, of course. So it's another contributing factor. We grow &#x2013; we somewhat reprice the loan upwards with a given same level of risk, but it's just that there is a little bit more of higher or better risk profile loans that we take on. And therefore, the margins there are a bit thinner and that has an impact. But again, as I mentioned before, it's a high &#x2013; it's a kind of better quality issue with &#x2013; that is what we consciously do this recent month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anton, I appreciate that. I just try to reconcile your guidance for the margins which is 6.2 to 6.4 and the fact that you repriced the retail deposits, which is the bulk of your funding and corporate deposits as well as we have seen in your results, and the fact that you said you are not repricing up the corporate book which is the bulk of your obviously asset side. So the problem we're having here is that you repriced the funding side, right? You repriced the retail deposits, you repriced the corporate deposits, now you haven't repriced as you've just told us the corporate side of your loan book, so how can your margin be flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I'll give a bit more color. You're repeating a bit more simplistic message that we are sending. On the asset side, we are saying there is much repricing itself but in terms of interest income flows, there is high &#x2013; there is more higher margin products that we get on the corporate side because SME grows fast than there is higher margin attached to that. So repricing is one. The increase and acceleration in interest income flow is because the change in the mix of yielding assets is a different effect but still positive. And the other component of the positive compensating effect on the margin pressure is the fact that we've raised our retail loan pricing only this past end of March and therefore the full effect really starts kicking in from April. Our retail is growing really, really well. And as I mentioned earlier on this call, what is good is that whilst the yields on this growth, the quality remains to be the sell-out of very high quality, low provision, low problem rate. So that is &#x2013; these are the two compensating factors and they are very material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, but I mean, you haven't touched mortgages and the consumer loans are just 14% of your loan book, and the corporate &#x2013; the big corporate, as far as I understand, in overall corporate segment is by far the biggest component like &#x2013; as far as I understand from my previous conservations with you is 60% of your corporate line is actually be corporate. So I'm trying to say is that, you repriced the very bulk of your funding and what you're trying to tell us that we compensate this with relatively small part of the loan book which is, a, consumer loans, these were repriced 200 basis points; mortgages, you didn't touch; then we also repriced somehow &#x2013; we haven't repriced even the SMEs, but they are growing faster. I'm just trying to get my head around on how you can compensate for a big increase in the retail funding with just the fact that consumer loans are repriced and then maybe SMEs are growing higher than &#x2013; faster than the big corporate tickets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, you're just forgetting another factor is that a lot of the repricing happens naturally. A lot of the corporate loan book is duration anywhere between 12 months and 18 months and sometimes two years, which is the working capital loans. And as they just roll out, when they were issued about a year or two ago, that was very close to the trough in the corporate lending rates and therefore, whilst we're saying we're not making any specific repricing efforts, the mere fact that we just used the market rates and I'm not pushing anything outside of the market to price things up, through the natural kind of refreshment of maturing loans with new loans, there is some repricing effect that takes place, and that's quite a bulk of our medium segment loan book and small ones and the large ones. Although on the large ones, the effect is slightly less pronounced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the exponential stage is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry just for me to understand, so you're trying to say that in 2011 you were issuing loans at a higher rate than, say, in 2010 and these effects still contribute because otherwise, there is no way your margin can stay flat or even fall by 10, 20 basis points. It should be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right. I'd like to share a couple of words to mention to both. We have insurance and price increase in the bank, and all our assets and our liabilities attracted the places on the basis of this constant repricing where we add or discounted for some specific premiums. So at every single moment, if we have some &#x2013; our regional market some change in market rates, prevailing market rates, we simultaneously change pricing on our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:19) say corporate deposits and loans, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:15:22) at that time.</p>
          <p>So at the moment, Sberbank has no single product, no single loan, no single deposit with negative margin versus this funds transfer pricing. And please take into account that when you price our corporate and all pricing in corporate loans made centrally, we definitely charge all our expense and capital charge and risk charge, all components to be added on top of this fund transfer pricing. And then it really plays and attracts additional deposits.</p>
          <p>We also discount our fund transfer pricing for all the respective expenses and including expense on insurance, fund insurance. So be sure about when we are speaking about flagging of our margin and say when we are &#x2013; so sure about 6.2, 6 point something a margin we have the kind of model which assumes that say it can get accounted &#x2013; one-fourth of our portfolio is maturing every year. So 60%, it's up to six months and so now 16% maturity up to one year. We take it into account, and on overall basis, we believe that our yields on asset side portfolio was just a little bit still up.</p>
          <p>At the same time, as Anton has already mentioned, we use the momentum to make cherry picking and to take the best customers and best grades. And if we have a choice and we have some trade-off between high interest rates and better credit quality, definitely we go with credit quality. And if we have a choice to further increase our margin or stabilize our liquidity position and have some liquidity cushion, we prefer to be on the safe side because in front of us definitely what hit in Europe. And we prefer to be definitely on the safe side, it's very important. So margin is about 6%, that's our clear target and our limitation, and we believe we can achieve even more this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other thing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just you said 16%, sorry, I'm just writing down. It was 16% of our portfolio repricing every year or it's just &#x2013; what's the number there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's roughly 15% per annum. It sometimes accelerates; it sometimes slows down. The other thing that makes us more, of course, certain about what we're saying is that we use this metric as not the net interest margin, which is measured through the flows of interest &#x2013; in the income expense through the P&amp;L. It's also the interest rate differential that we look at, which is in absolute terms the difference between the interest income flows in rubles and billions of rubles and interest expense outflows.</p>
          <p>On a forward looking basis, i.e., what would be your one-year P&amp;L effect as a difference between those two if your portfolio has remained static as of now. And as long as this difference shows a trend in increase at least or flat, that tells you that the composition of your portfolio as it's been built up until now is ensuring stable margins. And so far this graph that we as an executive board carefully watch on a regular basis, every time our outcome meets and every time our executive board meets, we see that it's been showing a positive trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So to summarize it, I mean, the way you want to compensate for your funding increase is that you're seeing, that on &#x2013; with the given maturity of your corporate loan book, you were issuing loans at a high enough rate previously, so that the run rate is compensating for the funding increase you're &#x2013; which occurs now, right? Is that what you're trying to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is one of the meaningful factors. Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, guys, sorry. And I'm probably the one who is asking tough questions today. The second one is on the cost side, and just I understand fully the way you readjusted the guidance. One thing I wanted to ask is that I think we have the second &#x2013; it's the second or the third year we have this conversation, and obviously you come up with the guidance which is initially relatively conservative or low, and the market is putting this guidance in the model and it's easier, I think the market didn't take your words for granted and readjusted the guidance.</p>
          <p>And then, you constantly come up and increase your cost growth. So the question here is, although I understand the reasoning on why your costs are high, why is the forecasting power so &#x2013; is relatively weak? So why wouldn't you come up in &#x2013; at the end of last year and say, look, guys, I mean our cost is going to be 20%. That's how we see the franchise, investments, blah, blah, blah. So why do you need to guide lower and then increase...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a fair question. That is a fair question to ask. The answer to that is actually very simple. The quality and the speed at which we implement our strategic projects is continually increasing above our own expectations. If before like two, three, four years ago when we planned for costs, we would put a sensible amount of costs in and then find yourself at the close to the end of the year that we've actually not been able to spend all those real money because your project execution runs slower.</p>
          <p>Now the project execution is getting to be much more accurate to the original plan as a project by project stage, but we actually accelerate the spending much faster, even fast in the past year or two &#x2013; to be honest, even faster than we could have anticipated ourselves and therefore, we found ourselves caught up in saying, yes, we will grow a bit faster but still execution is even faster than that. I guess that leaves us some room for improvement. We take this comment, it's absolutely fair. We should be forecasting a bit better, but I think it's a bit of a quality problem to have where your project execution capability is getting very efficient and fast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes, hopefully, we will &#x2013; these two lines would be converging. The last question I would have is actually similar to the one we've just heard on the capital situation and the Basel II. I clearly understand transition is only in 2014, but we know that already on the Russian Accounting Standards, you have fully incorporated the operational risk charge in your capital adequacy calculation. Now, on the Basel standards so far, you are not showing any capital &#x2013; I'm sorry, any operational risk charge and on our estimate, that's at least 80 basis points of a negative effect. So, would you comment on &#x2013; would you be adjusting your Basel I ratio for operational risk charge given that you already have to account for this on the national capital probation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we have an intention to do that. Before Basel II officially kicks in as a full blown standard in Russia and I guess, look, we're formally in Basel I and that is something that we'd like to follow.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone. I would like to switch to loan loss provisions and what we see for the fourth quarter in a row, which was supported by, I think, that the credit quality remains very high. If the decrease in the provision rate, you have said that you managed to extend your loans and to grow by lending to your existing clients, which maintains your credit quality, but surely it will end at some point where you will have to extend outside of your current client base, thus decreasing the credit quality.

          <p>I'll give you &#x2013; I'll give you some facts that will persuade you in why we feel so comfortable about that. We have over 20 million payroll clients &#x2013; retail clients that are not just retail clients. Overall, it's 70 million count. But 20 million of them get the payroll from the employer into the accounts of Sberbank because the employer is our client too, and they subscribe to this payroll distribution service that we provide. So we see their full history of how much people earn and we, therefore, can have the best history in the quality of the credit history that we can get and this is our client.</p>
          <p>Compared to that, the fact that our retail loan book transaction size is about 4.5 million, 5 million transactions only, credit cards is only &#x2013; sorry, yes, the retail is more, credit cards that are only 5 million. The new process of this credit factor that we operate for the past two, three years only adds about 30,000, 40,000 loan applications process every day, so it grows pretty well. But before it reaches 70 million of our clients, it'll take too long. Our market share in retail deposits is roughly 46.34%, but that's in monetary terms. In client head count terms, you can calculate 70 million in a 140 million populated country, but 140 million includes babies and people who are legally not allowed to handle their own money.</p>
          <p>So look, in terms of head count, our market share is roughly 60%, 70% and the level of penetration of loans by banking sector into a consumer is such loans, so low in Russia. It's like 3.2% of GDP is the mortgages, and they're on 10% in retail loans. But even if that is not feeling you with a comfort that never is the right word, we have always maintained at least we have access to the best available data market about credit quality of people. We have online links to the national pension fund that give us the pension employer contribution retrospectively for the past two years for anyone who has ever officially worked in Russia for any employer, not only the ones that are own clients. We have online check to the National Federal Migration Bureau to check any passport in Russia within seconds online.</p>
          <p>So the credit quality in terms of transition from whether it's our client or not our client is not an issue and is never really going to be. On top of that, the nice cherry on the top of the pie is that we actually together with the well globally sound company experience, we co-owned one of the two largest credit history bureaus in this country. We provide our own data from that and we also gather data from the rest of the market. And the heat rate when you inquire into the credit service bureau, credit history bureau, on retail client is much, much more than 50%. So from that standpoint, the Russian retail market is very, very well developed. It is characterized as very low credit costs overall. So I think nothing less than never is a legitimate answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that sounds impressive and then coming to the SMEs, you have mentioned that the share of the SMEs of the loans to SMEs is growing, and obviously an SME is a riskier segment than your average big corporate. So what do things that impact from the provisional rate will be from increasing lend into SMEs and maybe some specific dynamics of the provisional rates for SME, if it's possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't expect anything out of the ordinary there because we have the luxury of throughout the crisis having been able to process all the data on roughly over 2 million clients of ours in SME. While data on SME client is something very vague as we all know, but just the fact that we have millions of them and we have seen them leaving through the crisis in the past four years since 2008, it has allowed us to be able to price their risk very adequately and as you would have noticed, we've only started paying publicly that we are going to underwrite SME credit risk on an industrial scale at about the end of last year. So we've only just rolled out this new well priced, highly quantifiable risk product just now and for the same management team that was building our risk systems from the very beginning, from like 2008, we have not been comfortable saying such things for the first three and a half years. It's only now we really started that, which means that we weren't comfortable despite the fact that up until now, we are still the biggest SME lender in the country. But we weren't comfortable calling it an industrial underwriting, a big, big, volume in SME risk in the nearest two, three years, it will really get to the big, big convert to us in the next two, three years before we're fully comfortable that we can price and quantify the risk adequately. So what that means is actually we do not expect material changes to provisioning rates and cost of risks due to the change in the mix of our loan books going a little bit relative in favor of SME.</p>
          <p>Besides again, to refer back to the fact that we're not yet out of the recovery, that debt recovery cycle for loans &#x2013; problem loans of the vintage 2008 and 2009 and therefore, we still continue to release material provisions this year and maybe into the next year as well. So, that impact is much, much more material before there's ever any impact from the increased provisions that may or may not realize on the longer-term horizon for SME.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And the third similar question is on the VBI. What's the provision rate for VBI included in the first quarter accounts? How would you focus that especially taking into account that in most conservative operations, there is negative GDP growth, GDP is falling and the unemployment is going up, and there seems to be no end for it in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the thing is that the IFRS consolidation rule require you to take on the assets from the purchase bank at fair value as opposed to gross kind of nominal loan size and then the provision against it. Therefore, if you look at the accounts now, anything and everything that comes from VBI is a fair value. So there's &#x2013; and we will start provisioning properly only from the date of consolidation, so there is hardly ever any provision. We do disclose the gross amount of the loans that have been provided where fair value is different from their nominal value plus accrued interest. And that's in the disclosure is highlighted as RUB16 billion. We haven't aligned there. But then again, it's not the provisions; it's the kind of problem loans themselves that have &#x2013; that may have been impaired a little bit and therefore it's taken a fair value &#x2013; that's it. It is meaningfully lower than the nominal value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And going forward, what would you say the dynamics for this year for VBI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're already fair value, so that will really depend on what the performance of the banking sector and the loan portfolio is in each of the country is going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And, the final question from me is your non-life insurance. I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the one comment I would add though is, it would be unfair for me to say that we are not going to be providing at all. What we do see is that the dynamics in the markets where we've just entered are somewhat negative in the recent months. So, I would say we're doing a little bit of a fresh analysis on that. We do understand the book itself very well because of just under the deal, but it's just that we're doing a little bit of a forward-looking analysis given the most recent developments just in the past month or two in the European banking sector. So, I'm not ruling out that the first thing that we are going to be doing is maybe proving a little bit more, although it's not really material numbers for us. But, then going forward from there, we'll see how the European banking sector situation develops.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you. And the last one from me is you have non-life insurance business plans, if any. There have been rumors that you are planning to enter in the non-life insurance market either by buying somebody or maybe going from scratch. Well, is this true or not? Are there any specific plans? And if there are fresh plans, if you do enter this market, will it mean that you fully lose one of the most or one of the fastest-growing commission lines for you which is the agency commission from insurers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not the fact that we will get into the non-life insurance and not lose, we're just not intending to get into the non-life insurance.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our last question from Alexander Golovtsov from URALSIB Asset Management.</p>

          <p>I have seen recently that the issuance of deposit certificate has grown quite sharply by Sberbank in the first quarter and then in April, Sberbank has reached the maximum rate on deposit certificate to almost 10% per annum. Have you seen any further acceleration of this business line in April and May, and do you have any specific targets on how large this volume could be in the perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will very much like to advertise this product to you. Ladies and gentlemen, come and buy the bank certificates. The reason why the rate is so nominally high but rather is not costing us that much money, in fact, its real yield is on par with the deposit products we offer for us but for the client is much better, because CDs are not subject to the cost of the retail deposit insurance, and also they don't accrue interest on a monthly or quarterly basis. They pay a bullet at the end. So for us, if you're concerned about our cost base, no, there isn't very much pricing impact. For the client, it is very good and it has become &#x2013; the product has always been there, it's just that we haven't really marketed it properly. But we've realized it is a very nice way of raising liabilities without paying extra costs, and the client understood the benefit as well. So that is why I started my answer by saying, look, welcome, it's a nice rate, come and buy.</p>

          <p>So this is the first time. When before the March time of completing the conference, we actually have run out of questions as I can see in the queue. So I suggest if there's no more questions, we will &#x2013; we're thanking you for all the attention to our numbers and to our bank, and we'll be welcoming you to our future calls going forward. And again, if any questions after this call, you're knowing where to find us, where and how to contact our Investor Relations department. Thank you very much.</p>
