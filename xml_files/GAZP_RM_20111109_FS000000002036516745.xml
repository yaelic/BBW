          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Gazprom First Half 2011 IFRS Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just to remind you that today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd hand it over to your Chairperson, CFO and Deputy Chairman, Andrey Kruglov. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I'll be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and hello dear ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you to yet another telephone conference dedicated to the disclosure of the consolidated financial report by Gazprom covering six months of 2011 and prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>Together with me here, we have present Deputy Chairman of Management; Senior Accountant of Gazprom, Elena Vasilieva; the member of the Board of Directors of Gazprom, the Head of Economic Assistant and Pricing Department, Elena Karpel; and also my colleagues who represent the management of various departments, such as the Foreign Economic Activity, Marketing, and Liquified Hydrocarbons Processing, Finance and Economics Department and Gazprom Export.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you that for the purpose of teleconference, we have prepared a presentation which is available on our website. And so, please look at slide number three.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2011, the net profit, which is related to the shareholders of the company, grew by 56%. The net cash flow declined down to RUB 27 billion, however, remains positive. At the same time, the operational cash flow went down by 8%. The reduction in both figures can be explained by changes in the working capital line. The net debt went down by 7% by the end of the first half of 2011 compared to the start of the year because of the strengthening of the ruble exchange rate and while the relationship of the net debt to the adjusted EBITDA improved from 0.64 by the end of 2010 up to 0.49 by the end of the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>A few words about operational results, which is slide number four. In the second quarter 2011, production grew by 9% compared to the similar period last year, which continues justifying to the recovery of the demand for gas in our core markets. The production compared to first quarter of this year has been brought about by the seasonal factor in the production of gas. Production of oil remained at the level of last year. Growth in the production of gas condensate has been brought about by the start of production from the Valanginian and other is in the Zapolyarnoye field.</p>
          <p>Slide number five represents the balance of works of our gas transportation system. This chart reflects the physical movement of gas through the trunk pipelines rather than commercial work of the group. In the second quarter 2011, the volume of gas which has been transported through the gas transportation system has grown.</p>
          <p>Please now go over to the next slide, which demonstrates operational results by months. I'd like to note the growth of the exports volume of gas into the Western Europe and CIS countries during the 10 months of 2011, compared to the similar period last year, they have grown by 10% and 14%, respectively. The sales of gas in Russia stayed at the previous year's level, while production grew by 2%. And now, it would be logical to take a look at the supplies of the gas.</p>
          <p>In slide number seven, there's a potential change that has occurred compared to the previous period. The main consumers of gas in the former Soviet Union countries remain Ukraine and Belarus, and in Europe, Germany. Speaking about the supplies of gas to the Russian consumers, the biggest are still the power sector consumers as well as the households.</p>
          <p>In Q2 2011, the overall earnings from the sales of gas grew by 36% compared to Q2 2010, which was brought about by the improvement of the price environment as well as by greater volumes of sales in our core sales markets.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to give the microphone to my colleague, Deputy Chairman of the Management and the Senior Accountant, Elena Vasilieva.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear ladies and gentlemen. Andrey Kruglov in his presentation noted the positive sales dynamics in our core segment which is the sale of natural gas. Apart from the growth of sales in this segment as you may note on slide number 10, in Q2 2011 positive effect of the profit from sales was delivered by the growth of revenue from sales as well as the gas processing product as well as the sales of power and heating.</p>
          <p>At the same time, revenue from the sale of gas and oil processing grew by RUB 71 billion or by 43%. Primarily, this kind of incremental growth can be explained by the global prices growing for the oil and gas processing product as well as the volumes sold. The earnings of Gazprom Group was at 86% in the total amount of revenue from the sale of oil and gas refined products. The earnings from the sale of power and heating grew by RUB 15 billion or 29%. And the growth in the sales of power and heating can be explained by the growing tariffs for electricity and heating, as well as greater volumes in this segment of sales of heating and electricity.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move over to the next slide and describe certain indicators within our operational construction. Operational expenses during Q2 2011, compared to the similar period last year, grew by RUB 154 billion or by 29%. As can be seen in this slide, the main effect on the growth of the operational costs within Q2 2011 came from taxes. Costs within this particular element grew by RUB 31 billion or by 42%. <mark type="ph" /> Amongst all our cases (06:51) because of the growing MET tax by RUB 24 billion or by 56%. This growth can be explained by the greater tax upon the production of gas because of the rate growing from RUB 147 up to RUB 237 for 1,000 square cubic meters as of January 1, 2011 and the growing rate on the production of oil because of the global oil prices growing.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the cost for acquisition of gas grew by RUB 120 billion or by 20%, amounting RUB 219 billion. This incremental growth can be explained by greater volumes of the acquired gas as well as the growing gas prices which we acquired from third parties in the territory of Russia as well as outside of it.</p>
          <p>Cost for the acquisition of oil grew by RUB 26 billion or by 59%, amounting to RUB 69 billion. This growth came from the growing oil prices. Costs for labor grew by 20% amounting to RUB 90 billion during the three months which ended on June 30, 2011. The increase can be explained primarily by the growing average wage level. The loss in terms of the currency exchange within operational line items during the three months which ended on June 30, 2011, amounted to RUB 9 billion against the profit and RUB 14 billion during the similar period last year, leading to the growth in the operational expenses by RUB 23 billion. This change, brought about by the growing ruble exchange rate as opposed to U.S. dollar, compared to the reduction of the ruble exchange rate as to the U.S. dollar and the appreciation of ruble against euro during the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>Other operational expenses grew by RUB 15 billion or by 53%. This change can be explained primarily by the acknowledgement as part of our operational expenses during Q2 2011 of the return from the custom duties following as well the court decision in the amount of RUB 8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move over to the next slide which represents information about our changes in working capital. Positive effect of changes in the working capital during Q2 2011 amounted to RUB 30 billion, which was the result of the effect coming from the following factors: the reduction of the receivables for gas by RUB 86 billion against the receivables from the sale of gas into group going down by RUB 46 billion. The receivables from the sale of gas inside Russia because of the payment of that to the regional companies for the sale of gas which previously was granted upon terms of sales, went down by RUB 36 billion.</p>
          <p>The growing total amount of deposits were at the maturity in between 3 months to 12 months reflected in the composition of the other assets by RUB 18 billion and the growing of the payables by RUB 26 billion and the growth of the gas reserves by RUB 54 billion.</p>
          <p>Please allow me to complete my part of the presentation with that and pass the microphone over to my colleagues from Finance and Economics Department.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Elena. It's Andrey now. In conclusion, just a few words about our debt situation. Our average is going down. Our debt ratios are at a comfortable level. The structure of payment of debt is balanced throughout the various years which is the result of a conservative financial policy pursued by the company.</p>
          <p>This is the illustration that you can see on the slide number 13, considering the results of first half year 2011, the average rate in all of our borrowings was 6.7%. In summarizing, the result of our presentation, I would like to share with you our outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>We believe that there will remain a stable growth in the net profit including the growth in the net profit of the head company under the Russian accounting standards, which I shall remind us is the basis for the compilation of dividends, considering the overall year results, we expect EBITDA to grow by more than 38%. The debt ratios should remain at more than comfortable levels. We are maintaining control over operations of the company which alongside with the favorable environment would lead to the growing profitability.</p>
          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for your attention, and now I and my colleagues will be ready to answer your questions. We will have about 45 minutes for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I have one question regarding renegotiation and arbitration of contract into Europe. So if you could give us some color into the arbitration procedure versus the Germans and the renegotiation versus the rest of Europe, so where are you, where could this lead to?</p>
          <p>And final question will be if we are seeing a recession in Europe, i.e., lower gas demand, will some of your buyers being, take up your obligation in 2012? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>We are not expecting any essential or substantive changes because the current negotiations are taking place. And we would expect that by the end of the year, we are going to achieve agreements with a number of customers.</p>
          <p>As far as arbitration procedures are concerned, they will be following a certain course of consultations. And as a result of which, I will not rule out the possibility that as far as the pricing agreement is concerned within this cases, we might achieve the expected agreement.</p>
          <p>As far as the 2012 is concerned, there are not going to be any strong changes that would naturally be expected as part of our commitments. The commitments within the contract will remain as they were, and we would not expect any leniency in terms of the expectations on the side of the buyers. But the take-or-pay in terms of the overall obligations within the contract shall remain as they used to be, and this is the kind of situation which we would expect to stay for 2012.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language]. How much gas transit is likely to be moved from Ukrainian transit lines to Nord Stream next year? And will gas be displaced from Polish Yamal transit lines into Nord Stream? And I have another question, what is the transit charge in Nord Stream, is it comparable with Ukrainian or Polish Yamal or transit charges in European countries such as Prague?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] In today's issue by Kommersant Newspaper, there was an interview by the General Director of Gazprom Export dedicated to the inauguration of an on-stream, and approximately the same question was raised, Meaning to say that the Polish, Belarusian corridor is not going to be affected as part of the displacement of volumes, and the existing route will continue delivering new gas as well as the old gas.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the specific question whether there is going to be any displacement from the Polish destination, the answer was negative. But as far as the tariffs are concerned, they eventually are being calculated specifically per each system that we are looking at. And so, it would not be totally appropriate right now to make an assumption whether it's going to be the same or not, because various factors will be taken into account, including the investments made into each construction and operation, and consequently, the tariff will be then determined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] On top of what has just been said, I would like to add that it would all depend upon the demand for gas in the Western Europe. Right now, as we have just heard, there might be a certain reduction, because of the volumes being displayed out of the Ukrainian destinations. But if the demand in Europe grows, then there will be enough gas, both to load the Nord Stream as well as the Ukrainian pipe.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My question is related &#x2013; I'm from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:43). My question is related to the last <mark type="ph" /> leak of (24:48) information from the next year budget related to dividends of the company for the next year. Could you confirm the information that the percentage of net income paid as dividends will be increased from current 10% and to which level? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the issue of the dividend payout is being maintained according to the dividend policy. The 10% basically was not something that we have paid because the true level was 17% &#x2013; 17.5%. And so, the draft budget for the next year, which hasn't yet been endorsed, and consequently, I am not able to give this as a finite answer or statement. The figure in the budget is also at the level of 25%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. This question comes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Mr. Kostanian. The first question, there are two questions. Because of the recent data as far as the consumption by Europe of the Russian gas is concerned and specifically because of the decline in September, October and possibly within the period remaining in 2011 and the beginning of 2012, do you expect that your exports volume shall remain the same as far as the deliveries of the gas in 2011 and 2012 are concerned? If so, could you remind us of what are these volumes?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the current negotiations with the Chinese counterparty. What is the stage that you are going through with China as far as the time of the delivery is concerned, as well as the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Mr. Cherepanov will answer the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as the question was raised about the Russian consumption &#x2013; rapid decline of the Russian gas, say, in Europe, it was not very much correct, because the European statistics demonstrate the overall consumption of gas is declining. But as far as our deliveries are concerned, this year we've been able to supply much greater volumes compared to 2010. But I would say that this year, we'd be in a position to deliver about 150 billion, 152 billion cubic meters, and we hope that with the coming of winter, the take by Europe of the gas will grow.</p>
          <p>But we do take into account certain factors, which might affect the decline in consumption apart from our plans, we also have a figure of 164 billion, and the various commitments in contracts put together would specify greater volumes. But right now, about additional 10 billion to 12 billion additional cubic meters of gas, we would be able to supply to Europe next year, which is basically the incremental volume that we would be able to offer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As to the second question and as far as the negotiations with China are concerned, we are at an advanced stage of negotiations. As far as the timing is concerned, ourselves, as well as our Chinese counterparts, are undertaking serious efforts so as to reduce, as much as we can, lead time before the contract is achieved.</p>
          <p>Now, we would expect the first gas to be delivered within four years after the contract is signed. And as far as the price is concerned, I would say that the price will be exactly the one which will be to the satisfaction of both the Russian and the Chinese parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Alexey Pavlov is raising this question from Sanford Bernstein Company. There are two questions; the first one is regarding the situation with the Chinese negotiations. When we're talking about signing the contract, you know the first gas in four years, did you mean the eastern or western destinations or both routes? That was the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question about the Nord Stream, could you clarify the correlation between the new and the displaced gas for this year and for next year? And if we talk about two different tariffs then, which of the volumes have already been contracted and which are the contracts that you bear in mind? Is it a long-term contract with an oil correlation or it's a spot price contract? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The answer to the first question is that the plans have it for the western corridor. And the second question will be answered by Sergey Kupriyanov.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So we have the commission to operation in the Nord Stream line yesterday and starting the delivery, the capacity will be about 22 billion cubic meters. But, of course, this is not going to be the capacity achieved on the first day because for next year, we are planning to commission the second part of it.</p>
          <p>And as far as the new and displaced volumes are concerned, I would say that we would be putting into the first line the displaced volumes. And with the commissioning of the second line, the overall volume within the new contracts will amount to about 22 billion cubic meters, as well. And these are the long-term contracts which have been signed with the currently existing partners, German companies, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:45) and such as Gaz de France, Dong and GMT. So, these contracts, as I've said are long term, and primarily they are related in terms of pricing to the current basket as you have referred to.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] So, the additional couple of questions, do we understand correctly that we are bearing in mind only the western corridor as far as Chinese negotiations are concerned, and that there would be a separate signing and separate arrangement for the eastern corridor?</p>
          <p>And as far as the Nord Stream is concerned, do I understand correctly that 164 billion cubic meters is the target for 2012 for the sale of gas into Europe?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answering the second question, not exactly because to a certain extent we are starting to deliver some volumes of the new gas in the first line of Nord Stream. But for the volumes of next year, we are taking into account this because some of the deliveries will start only &#x2013; along the second line which should &#x2013; expected to be commissioned in October. And we do envisage a certain period where we're going to be gearing up in terms of the volumes. And in terms of 164 billion cubic meters, exactly, there are some part of it which is included into our expectations of the 22 billion cubic meters which we are planning for next year.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] Nadia Kazakova from JPMorgan is asking this question. There are three questions. The first one is what kind of effect on Gazprom will come from the relaunching of the Greenstream, meaning the Libyan gas which went to the UK? Could you comment on what will happen in Q4 this year as well as next year?</p>
          <p>The second question is about your export outlook for next year, could we say that the additional 10 billion to 12 billion cubic meters, which destinations that would go to? Where do you expect the Russian gas consumption to grow in Europe?</p>
          <p>And third question concerns the negotiations you're currently having with RWE? As far as I understand that the exclusivity period is going to be over by the end of the year, are you expecting to resign the contract and prolong consequently this exclusivity status? Could you please comment on these questions? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Cherepanov will answer this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Answering the first question, I would say that the deliveries of the Libyan gas into the European market this year in terms of the gaining were not really significant. So, you cannot consider deliveries of the Russian gas as some sort of an alternative to that. The situation in the Italian market during the past few years has not been a straightforward one. But nevertheless, we were able to see the renewal of the Libyan gas volumes going there, which actually did not affect in any way, the taking of the Russian gas in those destinations. And so, in Q4 this year, we're not expecting any serious changes, as well as next year, we don't expect it to happen.</p>
          <p>As far as the increase of overall volume of sale of gas is concerned, and this is something that I have previously answered, that we do intend to start the deliveries of gas under the new contract through Nord Stream which are not going to be quite significant yet, not RUB10 billion to RUB12 billion at this point in time. But we do expect the European market environment to improve. And as a consequence, we would also expect that the volumes of gas supplies to Europe would grow within this format.</p>
          <p>And also, as far as our negotiations with RWE are concerned, we are planning to try and complete these until the end of the year. And we will see whether we would need to revisit any pricing question. As I partially explained previously, we are in the arbitration process with RWE. But I would say that without expecting the final judgment by the arbitration process to be pronounced, we might be also able to achieve a settlement outside of the arbitration process.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:42) from CommerzBank Credit Research. I have a question on your funding plans. We have recently seen you accessing the European commercial paper markets, and I wanted to know if this is a trend likely to continue until the European market conditions improve or you will be more focused on the ruble-bound markets for the time being and next year? [Foreign Language].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. This is a traditional question, and I will try and also give you maybe a traditionally sounding answer, because in fact, our plans are very much dependent upon our needs in funding, as well as the state of the financial markets, as you quite justifiably noted. If you may recall, the decision, as part of the road show that we went about to the European markets, but we opened the book only sometime after the road show took place because the situation in the financial markets was not favorable for [ph] these years (48:56). And principally speaking, in the future, we are not going to plan to borrow money at whatever the cost may be.</p>

          <p>Yes. <mark type="ph" /> Elizabeth Sperna <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:17) You mentioned that there was an increase in the gas volumes you bought from Russian independents and also from outside Russia in terms of gas. Can you give us some idea of what the increase in gas volumes was for the half year compared with the last half year?</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] The overall volume of the acquired gas during the first half of 2011 was RUB57.5 billion and 44.9 billion cubic meters in last year. So, the growth was incremental 26%.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Alexey Pavlov. Please go ahead. Alexey, your line is now open. Can you please just see if you're mute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is could you specify the timeframe for the Chinese deal and could you describe what is it going to be? Would it be the end of the year or the first quarter next year &#x2013; I mean, in terms of signing? So, what is the objective?</p>
          <p>And the second question was that during the presentation, you've stated that there is a decline of the receivables which was the result of the shorter payment terms in Russia. So, I would like to ask you to specify what were the terms and conditions upon which these shortening of payment terms was achieved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as your question is concerned about China, this is a hypothetical one and so you can receive a similar answer because if you try and understand when the signing is going to take place, you should raise that question simultaneously to both the Russian and the Chinese side because we may be having one plan while our counterpart may have a different plan. And basically, I can state that the negotiations are moving and there is a positive dynamics. And I can say that the contract is going to be signed in time.</p>
          <p>As far as the second question is concerned, we'll have Mikhail Rosseev answering it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. And in answer to the second question, one can say that taking into account specifically that this affects quite a number of the Russian trading operators who are trading gas, it's going to be quite difficult to give you a uniform answer. But most importantly, that we are able to reduce these receivables simply by very purposefully working on reducing these receivables and making sure that the payment which is due is paid in time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. I'd like to refer back to a question I asked. I didn't quite understand it, because I was getting an answer in rubles and in cubic meters. Did I understand it correctly that Gazprom bought 26% more gas from Russian independents and CIS countries in the first half of 2011 than in 2010, if you could clarify that. And also, give me the actual figures for the volumes.</p>
          <p>And an unconnected question, when will the feed for Stockman be ready? Do you expect it to be ready by end of 2011 as planned? And will it be for both LNG and piped gas?</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language.]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] I apologize, [indiscernible] (57:11) because I was talking about volume basically, about a billion cubic meters &#x2013; 57 billion cubic meters, which was in the six months of 2011, 44.6 billion cubic meters during the first half of 2010. Indeed, that is the bigger volume of gas which we acquired from the companies which are not part of the group inside Russia, as well as outside of it.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language.] And as far as the acquisition cost for this gas is concerned, it was RUB326 billion within the reporting period, compared to RUB186 billion in the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language.] And for the question about Stockman, we'll have [indiscernible] (58:13) answering from Gazprom Export.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language.] And this is going to be quite a short answer, because indeed we, as far as the decision is concerned, would be planning to make it by the end of 2011, and that is the target date whereby we, as well as our partners, will be trying to make unanimous decision exactly by the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Yes. Hello. <mark type="ph" /> Elizabeth Sperna, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:35). Yeah. I just wanted to ask about the Stockman again. The feed decision, is this going to be both for LNG and the piped gas? And a supplementary question about the Eastern Gas Program, have you taken a decision about whether to expand the LNG project at Sakhalin II, or will you prefer to conduct a new planned project at Vladivostok?

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] With respect to the Stockman LNG Project, yes, indeed, we are currently working to prepare ourselves for the final investment decision, and most probably it's going to be combined mode of &#x2013; including piped gas as well as the LNG.</p>
          <p>As far as the eastern capacities are concerned, we're currently reviewing the program, but no final decision in terms of the future audit has been made just yet.</p>
