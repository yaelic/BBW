        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and a warm welcome to all of you. And thank you for joining us at this Half Year Media Conference, and thank you very much for agreeing to join us at such short notice having to change your plans, and I apologize and I hope that wasn't too much of a disturbance. And I also apologize to those who thought they would see me the last time at the year-end conference this spring. And unfortunately I have to disappoint you. But it is not the half-year results, but it is our announcement about Genentech's which persuaded me to come to this meeting.</p>
          <p>We will be addressing both sides. We'll be addressing our half-year results this morning. And Severin will lead you through those, and afterwards we will be addressing Genentech, and open it, of course, up to questions and answers.</p>
          <p>I think what is important right at the outset to say is as you look at those half-year results, they are a picture of health and a picture of strength. And it is based on this financial strength and operational strength that we are building our case in order to take over Genentech because we believe that also creates the strategic strength that is necessary in order to be the leading healthcare company in the next decade and in the years to come.</p>
          <p>So, with that introduction, I'd like to hand over to Severin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to be here in person with you in New York. As Franz has said, we will certainly concentrate today, of course, on the Genentech transaction. But we are still eager to lead you through the half-year results which we believe are very solid ones.</p>
          <p>Can I have the next slide, please? If you look at the group results and if I may take your attention to the bottom line here, you can see that overall if we exclude for the Tamiflu pandemic sales, we have grown by 10% in local currencies or 18% in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceuticals is up 9% at the high range of our expectations mainly driven by the continued double-digit growth in oncology. Diagnostics 11% up and even if we include additional sales from Ventana, clearly above the market. Ventana itself ahead of our internal expectations confirming that we are on a good track with the integration.</p>
          <p>The results have been heavily influenced by two factors, Tamiflu and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. You can see over the first six months, we have grown organically by 2 billion Swiss francs after the 10% local growth.</p>
          <p>Tamiflu takes off 1 billion and currencies again 1.8 billion so that we end up with a negative growth of minus 4% in Swiss francs terms.</p>
          <p>This strong organic result is reflected on the profit, you can see, we have grown by 2% in terms of our operating profit and that is also reflected on a core EPS level which has grown with 3% in local currencies. And with those results, we are confident to fully reconfirm the objectives which we gave at the beginning of this year that is high single-digit growth for the Group as a whole, above-market growth for both divisions; Pharma and Diagnostics, and a core EPS at least at the record level of 2007. And also in spite of the Genentech transaction, we do not intend to change our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to hand over to Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Severin. Pleasure to be with you and to share, I think, a very good set of first six month results, and then in the second half, we'll concentrate more on the transaction with Genentech.</p>
          <p>Really, for the first half year, an extraordinarily good performance if we take in local currency terms, the growth that we have, it's twice the growth of the world market at the moment.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date through April, the growth of the world market at 4.3%, it's less than 1% here in the United States. So, it's a very modest growth rate in the global market, and therefore the underlying growth of 9% excluding the sales to government, I hope you believe and would recognize as being very strong.</p>
          <p>The operating profit margin despite the fact that we have lost that Tamiflu revenue, despite the investment that we've made in research and development, you have also seen the operating profit margin move forward by almost 2 percentage points while we continue to invest in the mid term and long term future of the company.</p>
          <p>We've seen in the half-year a strengthening of the pipeline, major Phase III decisions, CETP inhibitor recruiting as we speak in the large 15,000 mortality morbidity study, the GLP-1, as we shared with you at the ADA on the West Coast, now moving into Phase III. This will become, I am sure, a very successful, once weekly GLP-1 with a relatively pain free and simple administration. We've opted in with our partner, Memory Pharmaceuticals on an interesting molecule in Phase II. We've completed the Pyramid acquisition. This was an acquisition in the United Kingdom of a PI3-kinase target. Two principal goals here; one is in oncology and the other is in inflammation autoimmune diseases. Genentech had already partnered on the oncology indication with Pyramid, but we bought out the entire company and that has now been completed.</p>
          <p>Also, maybe as you saw this morning, we've completed an acquisition in Madison, Wisconsin of a company called Mirus, Mirus Bio Corporation. This is a company that focuses on PolyConjugates as a way of delivering siRNA. And as you know, what you are seeing Roche do is put together the Alnylam deal, the centre in Kulmbach. We have relationships with some of the universities in China and now Mirus comes into it because the delivery systems of siRNA are the secret. We know that siRNA works, but actually delivering it to where we want to deliver is the challenge. And this is some of the most impressive data that we've seen so far. This is a private company and has been acquired for $125 million this morning.</p>
          <p>Also during the first six months, we've completed the licensing deal with ThromboGenics in Belgium, BioInvent in Scandinavia, and they were the joint owners of the PIGF growth factor. This is a potential new target to us in our desire to continue to own angiogenesis. And in the ways that this product works, it'll be entirely complementary, as we see it today, to the role of Avastin in cancer. So, it's a complementary product that comes into Roche from the partnering with ThromboGenics.</p>
          <p>So a busy first six months and a very productive one. And I hope you'd agree strong performance, good on the profit and good on deals and making sure that we're building for the future.</p>
          <p>The sales numbers you've already seen. The fact that it's sustained over the quarters, and if you look just in the box, I'd highlight the Roche Pharma component has been growing in double digits now for many quarters. And you're seeing that continue through the second quarter, a continuation of 11% growth there.</p>
          <p>The P&amp;L gives the snapshot as I've just described it. Good control on the cost of goods, good tight control on M&amp;D, that invest in R&amp;D, and the operating profit moving forward at an impeccable 8%.</p>
          <p>Much of the margin improvement came within Roche Pharma, but it's a credit to all parts of the division that we are at this level. Now again the standard comment I'd make, usually the half year results are a tickle ahead of the full year. Usually the costs in the second half-year are slightly higher then the first half-year, so just please bear that in mind. That doesn't take away the trend that has been observed in many years now on Roche and its operating margin.</p>
          <p>Turning to the therapeutic areas, oncology, a 15% growth and you can see that in the Roche  invoice territories, 21% growth, 24% in Japan, as Chugai takes Avastin, Tarceva, Herceptin in early breast cancer, and Xeloda forward in the Japanese market, and an 8% growth that Genentech reported on the 14th of July to you.</p>
          <p>For the key brands, you see continued and sustained growth across the piece. Avastin, in particular, 78% growth in the non-United States territories, so in combination with the double-digit growth from Genentech, this is a 36% growth first half-year for Avastin. Growing adoption across the piece, the new indications, the roll out, it's all moving forward in a very strong way.</p>
          <p>If we were to look at the news flow, and many of you followed us through ASCO. I think and hope you would agree that ASCO for us this year was a strengthening and a deepening of our understanding of the role of our products in the oncology area, and that really there is not too much to lose too much sleep over on the competitive landscape in the near term.</p>
          <p>Now that doesn't mean to say we take things lightly; we've still a lot to do, and here you see summarized some of the news flow that we should be seeing in the second half-year.</p>
          <p>MabThera in relapsed, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, this was the second study that should be coming in the half-year. Maybe just to say, since we published the half-year results we have now just submitted the chronic lymphocytic leukemia dossier to the European authorities in the last couple of days. So that's now a submission.</p>
          <p>If we turn to inflammation autoimmune, this is the second leg, if you like, for the future that Roche is standing on, 19% growth, strong performance from CellCept, MabThera/Rituxan and its adoption into rheumatoid arthritis going well.</p>
          <p>Some of you may have seen yesterday in the United Kingdom, their health technology assessment agency, NICE, has just adjudicated that there is insufficient incremental benefit by using a second or third anti-TNF, and that people should go directly to Rituxan, because that is the next authorized reimbursed product, and this validates some of the clinical work that we've presented at International Congresses in recent times.</p>
          <p>Actemra was approved in Japan, and has been launched in the incremental delivery presentations, the strengths that we need for rheumatoid arthritis were launched in June. In Japan you have to recruit on the order 3,000 patients in a controlled setting, like a post-marketing surveillance, that is well underway and the patients are recruiting fast. We presented at EULAR in Paris, the Phase III results from couple of the pivotal studies. And the end of next week, if I've got the right week, yes, the end of next week, the 29th we'll have the advisory panel with the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
          <p>Now we know where the feedback has come from, the Food and Drug Administration, and we think this is in good order for discussion next week. We'll see this data either being filed or results coming. And the only one that actually stopped was the systemic lupus that we've communicated during the course of the first half-year, but the rest on track.</p>
          <p>In terms of metabolism in bone, Boniva, here in United States, holding up very well. What we saw post genericization of Fosamax, was an expansion of the use of generic Alendronate for a temporary period of time. We start to see that, easing back but it's more a replacement for Fosamax, and the role of Boniva continues and is holding good share. And we've also seen very strong growth outside the United States, so 51% growth in Boniva.</p>
          <p>In the erythropoietin sector, the decline here, particularly of NeoRecormon in the European setting, is predominantly price war between the other brands and the biosimilars. And our volume has held up well over the period, since the beginning of 2007, I think we've lost just under 2 percentage points market share, given the turbulence of the markets. So holding up very well and MIrcera is off to a respectable start, the sales are still modest, but the take-off in France, sorry, in Germany and the United Kingdom is of the same level as the take-off of RNS, similar number of months post-launch. And we still have France and Spain and Italy to go.</p>
          <p>You see us move forward, as I mentioned, on CETP and GLP-1, our DPP-IV, where many of you have been following what would happen with the phase II results, very good efficacy, a very clean product. But we did not see the weight loss that we required for us to move forward, so this now becomes an out-licensing candidate.</p>
          <p>We also have some rather intriguing and very positive initial phase II data on our PPAR (&#x3B1;/&#x3B3;). We have good carcinogenistic data, the two-year data's in. We're just waiting for the renal study data. So by the end of this year, I hope to be able to share with you what we're planning to do to do with that compound.</p>
          <p>In virology, Tamiflu, as predicted, we shared with you at the year-end results, 1.7 billion sales we would lose this year, we're absolutely on track with the 1 billion washout, first half-year.</p>
          <p>Pegasys intriguingly has moved forward into modest growth in total. Market share developing well in the developed world at about 65% currently, and what we see is volume growth in countries like Russia, Brazil and some of the emerging seven markets.</p>
          <p>So finally, just on the score card against our news flow for the year, strong start on track for the various reporting items, as I've mentioned and on the filings and you can now tick the box on MabThera CLL, and we stand by the guidance for the year of above market growth.</p>
          <p>And with that I'd like to hand over to J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer to take you into the diagnostic section. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Roche Diagnostics continues to grow above the market with 11% growth in local currencies and 22% in U.S. dollars for the half-year further extending our market leadership.</p>
          <p>Sales grew ahead of, or in line with the market in all regions, with strong performances particularly, Japan and the emerging markets in Europe and Asia-Pacific, but also in the U.S. with regard to Professional Diagnostics, Applied Science and Tissue Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care returned to growth and the basis for this strong growth is built on new products and above all on instrument placements in all areas. All business areas contributed to this growth, with particularly strong contribution from Professional Diagnostics and Applied Science.</p>
          <p>Immunochemistry sales continued to be the main driver in Professional Diagnostics, with 19% growth over double the market. During the first half-year, we have launched six new tests which will positively influence future sales.</p>
          <p>Amongst them are an anti-CCP immunoassay for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and an anti-TSH receptor antibody test for the diagnosis of Grave's disease. Point of care cardiac assays posted solid double-digit growth and also Coagulation monitoring continued its strong double-digit growth, driven mainly by the CoaguChek XS monitor for professional use and patient self-testing. I'm pleased to report that Diabetes Care returned to positive growth in the second quarter with 7% growth worldwide and 9% growth in the U.S. Accu-Chek Aviva and Accu-Chek Performa, both of which were launched in additional markets, were the main growth drivers.</p>
          <p>Molecular diagnostics maintained its market share, based on the strong automated systems. And the launch of several new tests, especially multiplex blood screening assay for simultaneous detection of HIV, 1 and 2 HCV and HBV is launched in all areas of the world with the exception of the U.S., in the U.S. it's in the final stages of FDA review. In applied science, the highly innovative sequencing business grew over 100% in comparison to a roughly double-digit market growth.</p>
          <p>Over 40 NimbleGen microarrays were launched worldwide for applications ranging from gene expression studies to DNA sequencing. And finally, I'm very happy report on an extremely successful Tissue Diagnostics business. Integration with the former Ventana Group is more than on track. And the business on the standalone basis grew by 27%, which is clearly ahead of expectations.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, our strong investments in the business and in our strategic acquisitions have had an impact on our operating profit in the near-term with a margin decline of 8.6% to 12.2. Half was caused by the recent acquisitions, in particular Ventana 454 and NimbleGen, the other half was due to investments in the ongoing business, in particular the enlargement of sales forces, instrument placements and research. A number of these items are onetime effects. Therefore, we are expecting already in the second half of the year, an improvement of the situation.</p>
          <p>We have already launched a number of new tests and systems in the first half of the year. We will proceed with it in the second half of the year, so that the growth will continue within the previous code. Thank you, I would like to hand over to Erich.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks J&#xFC;rgen. Ladies and gentlemen, it's good to be here in New York, so when Bill and myself went through immigration at mid-night tonight, this guy look at the screen and said, good Lord, is this another one of these one-day trips to New York you have had, and I say yes, we are flying out tonight, but we are here to serve our customers.</p>
          <p>So, if we have a look at the financials, I think what you see in the cost structure it's absolutely what we have planned for and you see that our focus is on innovation that's where we really make our commitment and all the other elements of our cost structures are under control, if you would worry about this administration cost going up, as J&#xFC;rgen just has explained, there are some one-time effects in there, but &#x2013; I can assure you that a basic G&amp;A is under control.</p>
          <p>If we go into the tax rate, very nice development for the Swiss tax set up, which has led to a considerably lower tax rate for the whole group in the first quarter, I think we are now really competitive.</p>
          <p>If you look into our cash build up and I think that's also quite interesting in hind sight of the next transaction we will be discussing, you see, we start it out of a quite a position of strength but what is important, the underlying cash generation ability is strong, as you can see from Roche Pharma and Genentech and then of course in the first quarter we always have major tax payments and dividends and we made this step with closing the deal on Ventana and we increased our share holding in our Japanese Habenspoke partner Chugai by 9.9%.</p>
          <p>If we look at the overall situation of the Roche Group, if you go to Roche; Roche, at the core is almost debt free. We have actually delayed over the several year, billions of debt and start out of a position of strength into the new transaction.</p>
          <p>And with this I hand over to our Chairman Franz Humer</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Erich, so let's get into the thrilling part for you today. You know the facts; we have made an offer to buy the remaining outstanding shares at $89, a total of 43.7 billion. The offer has been presented to the independent directors of Genentech through a letter and a brief phone call that I made to them on Sunday night. They are now organizing themselves as they have to according to the affiliation agreement that exists between Roche and Genentech. And we will be starting negotiations as soon as they are ready.</p>
          <p>Our offer, we believe, is fair and generous. It's a premium of nearly 9% over the closing last Friday, 19% over last month. And if you look at the average over the last three months, then it is a premium of around 22%.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm sure some of you &#x2013; when you saw the release and announcement, probably wondered have we decided out of the blue to change our strategy; is there something wrong with our current strategy, especially why are we changing our partnership that for 20 years has been an example in this industry and has been extremely successful. Now, let me first of all tell you that this was not an easy decision. We gave it due and long consideration and soul searching. But at the same time, we are absolutely convinced it is the right decision.</p>
          <p>And the Executive Committee as well as the Board support &#x2013; not only support this decision but are convinced that this not a fundamental departure from our strategy, just the opposite. It is a big step forward in achieving our goal, becoming the leading health care company in the world. Closer collaboration with Genentech will strengthen our ability to innovate and to transform innovative research into medically differentiated products and services. Bringing those two companies closer together will also strengthen our ability of collaboration between diagnostics and pharmaceuticals, especially also in the light of the successful acquisitions of Ventana and Tissue Diagnostics. But what it will undeniably change is the way of working between Roche and Genentech.</p>
          <p>Now, I've had over the last or we have had overt the last 24 hours, a series of questions related to the culture of Genentech. Let me reconfirm here, we are admirers and remain admirers of the research culture that exists in Genentech and we want to preserve that culture. Therefore, Genentech research and early development will operate independently and as a separate unit within Roche. Because we are convinced that diversity and research is one of the keys to successful innovation. I mean we ourselves, with our own research have two years ago embarked on that road to better decentralization. We've created disease biology areas, five of them. Those operate in a different way from a totally integrated pharmaceutical research company. Those disease biology areas have freedom to set their own priorities.</p>
          <p>Genentech will not be integrated into our disease biology areas. It will remain a separate unit, maintaining its own processes, its own leadership structure, and above all its own culture. And we will do as a management team, together with Genentech, everything possible and everything necessary to preserve that.</p>
          <p>You have heard me say on a number of occasions that I am against mega-mergers and mega-acquisitions because they have a tendency to destroy value rather than to unlock value. Is this different from a mega-acquisition? It is. It is fundamentally different. It is not the coming together of two companies that they don't know each other. It is the coming together out of mutual respect of two companies who have had a 20 year partnership. It will lift that partnership to a new and to a different level. Genentech would not be where it is today without Roche and Roche would not be where it is today without Genentech.</p>
          <p>There are two main reasons for our offer to the minority shareholders. The first one is the evolution of Genentech itself. When we acquired the majority in 1990, Genentech was a small biotech company, with nearly half of its staff in R&amp;D. Due to its success; Genentech has grown to a fully integrated pharmaceutical company, with 11,000 people. There are today more people working in South San Francisco than in Basel. A fully integrated pharmaceut &#x2013; large Pharma company with all its advantages and all its disadvantages.</p>
          <p>What we want to preserve is that independence on the research side but it is obvious that if we combine two large Pharma companies between Roche in Nutley and Roche and Genentech. We can create and we can unlock value and create synergies in those areas where critical mass, competitiveness, and costs play a major role.</p>
          <p>And the second important reasons for taking that step, is the environment. The pharmaceutical industry has changed significantly and the market has changed significantly in those last five to 10 years. And you have written about it on a number of occasions. It is essential for a company in order to succeed in the next 10, 20 years to become even stronger, to strengthen our market presence in the biggest, most important market in the world, the United States. And the United States will remain the most important Pharma market in the world for the foreseeable future, irrespective which government comes into power. But irrespective which government comes into power, the competitive pressures, the pressures on prices and margins will continue.</p>
          <p>This merger of Roche and Genentech will create one of the most successful companies in healthcare. And together continuing our strategy, we will aim to create true innovation, medically differentiated products.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And I hand over to Severin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me also deemphasize from my side there is no change in strategy. We will remain focused on pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. We will remain focused on medically differentiated therapies and diagnostics. Innovation is and will remain at the core of our strategy. And therefore this transaction primarily is about enhancing innovation. We will also improve our operational efficiency. But at the core of our strategy, at the core of this transaction, is the willingness to enhance innovation. And for us, innovation has a lot to do with diversity. It's not about streamlining of thinking. It is about having different approaches, having different perspectives, be it in China, be it in Switzerland or be it here in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And as you can see by keeping the founders &#x2013; the Genentech Founders' Research Center independent, we will work on the same indications on both sides, as we do today, in areas such as oncology or inflammation.</p>
          <p>What we will do, however, is we will concentrate our activities on two significant research and development hubs on the West Coast and on the East Coast. That means that we will transfer the activities in Palo Alto for virology to the Genentech campus and for inflammation to our campus in Nutley, New Jersey.</p>
          <p>Today Genentech has the right and the duty to respect the interests of the minority shareholders. That makes a free flow of intellectual property or technologies very complex, sometimes impossible. So, when we combine the two entities, we have mutual access to IP, to technologies without the legal and financial constraints we have today when working together.</p>
          <p>We will get the lawyers out of the room and our research people and scientists can concentrate on what they are really good at and that is developing novel approaches to improve medicine.</p>
          <p>And there are many examples for that, I'll just called quote a few from the Roche side. Genentech will have access to our biomarker work, which they do not have today. They will have full access to our libraries for small molecules. We can exchange our technologies in antibodies. And we can share our broad and wise expertise in diagnostics. Be it in immunohistochemistry, or be it in other areas such as molecular diagnostics and we will have mutual access to the various partnerships.</p>
          <p>Let me reemphasize it again, our strategy is based on innovation. We have an enormous respect for the unique and the science-driven culture at Genentech and we will build on that.</p>
          <p>Thank you. With this I'd like to hand over to Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>If there's one common value that we share, and it's fully shared between all members of Roche and all members of Genentech, it's that the goal that actually brings us to work every day is the idea of making a difference in patients' lives. That's the primary driving force for anyone that you meet in Roche or you meet in Genentech and it's with considerable pride that our colleagues in Palo Alto can look people literally in the eye who would have gone blind but for Valcyte. For people that recover from their hepatitis, due to the work done on Pegasys in Nutley with Herceptin, with Avastin, with the differences that we make there.</p>
          <p>So this is the unifying force that we've always had and it's one of the reasons why I think the relationship has gone so well and that there is such good mutual respect. But there is this complexity where the business model required that our colleagues in Genentech had to look after minority shareholders and these Chinese walls start to get tricky.</p>
          <p>If I just then touch on some of the areas where we have most contact it's in late stage development and in manufacturing. Within late stage development, if your goal is to get a product fast to the market and make a difference to patients' lives, then that's where you want to go international fast. And that's where Roche has kicked in and that's where, historically, sometimes it's been a bit slow, in recent years it's much faster, it's coming together very quickly. But there is still a complexity, a duplication of effort that goes on and then beyond that in commercial and admin there are clearly some scale effects that we can benefit from by having one operation here in the United States</p>
          <p>Let me touch on the late development first of all. Overlap of compounds, as we try to go from a position where we've had a remarkable S-curve on monoclonal antibodies where Rituxan comes in and makes a huge difference to patients' lives.</p>
          <p>We are now working at second-generation and indeed third-generation molecules, but we are not alone. There is more complexity out there &#x2013; there is more competition out there.</p>
          <p>With Avastin, at ASCO, I counted something like 35 to 45 compounds that people are trying to profile as an anti-angiogenic. We know some of the limitations of some of them but some people are going to get in there.</p>
          <p>We have to think what is it that's going to be right for the next wave, how do we continue to own angiogenesis, as the two teams partner in different ways, it's not so easy just to pass that technology across.</p>
          <p>I mentioned to you ThromboGenics, that we have just partnered with in the first half-year. What do you expect us to do? To give that as a gift to the minority shareholders of Genentech, no, we have to be putting a deal on the table and having a discussion about whether we do partner or not. Similarly from the Genentech side. If they do a deal with somebody else it's not always obvious, but Roche would be the international partner.</p>
          <p>So, there are complexities. As we take forward the clinical design, the clinical work on our portfolio that can be made easier. And I think in tomorrow's competitive world and some of the areas we're dealing with, we will have to be faster. Trial, design and execution, more and more, we are working with the same investigators, whether it's here in the United States or internationally, presenting ourselves with one opinion, one view point to that group of patients &#x2013; of trialists will be important to us.</p>
          <p>If we turn to manufacturing, many of you in this room and others really put us through the mill after 2005 ASCO. Did we have enough capacity? Were we going to be able to meet the demands of the market? The good news is we have. The good news is we didn't miss a beat. It was fortuitous that Genentech could buy the Oceanside facility from Biogen Idec, and in the mean time the expansion in Vacaville is well on track; Basel with the production capacity for Avastin has been validated; Penzberg where we do produce Herceptin, and indeed in Singapore there is the opt-in possibility that Genentech have with the Lonza facility that's being built there.</p>
          <p>This is a network that today accounts for between 30 and 40% of worldwide capacity for biotechnology products. There is still an enormous wave of new products that we're looking at, from armed antibodies to antibodies with enhanced ADCC, looking at products that could possibly cross the blood-brain barrier for central nervous system applications, and optimizing that capacity, getting the benefits out of the full network, without it always having to be a legal contract means we can move more swiftly, more nimbly. Also gives us, I think, the avoidance of capital expenditures in the future. And, we will take out some of the duplication from the system. Here in the United States commercially, we have a very strong and successful team in South San Francisco with Genentech and a strong team with specialty care and Bonviva focus out of Nutley, New Jersey.</p>
          <p>First important thing to say is we've made sure in the press release from the start, all the sales team absolutely needed. This is a field force combined of about 3,000 people. This is certainly not oversized in today's world in America. Each of these people have absolute work to do. Small area of overlap is in oncology where more people actually, I think, will equal more sales, greater contact with the customer. And that's only about 200-odd Xeloda field force in Roche, New Jersey.</p>
          <p>So, there is a real complementarity here. And indeed, in getting ready to grow that business for the future, we've got this interesting new molecules coming through the CETP. GLP-1s, new therapeutic areas, standing on more legs, having the strength and the combined power within this domestic United States market, is going to be very important. This will be a company that is number seven in the U.S., $15 billion in revenues, 17,500 people and about 3,000 sales team. So it's a big organization. It's a successful organization as it comes together, and we see a lot of complementarity.</p>
          <p>Given the size and scale, clearly the colleagues in South San Francisco are today running a bigger business. We are moving the headquarters from New Jersey to South San Francisco. And we will continue to trade using the Genentech name. The obvious follow through to that is, we can take out complexity in the back office, whether it's from the ultimate closure of the Palo Alto site. And there, we also are taking particular care of the gifted scientists that we have in Palo Alto to make sure that we do move as seamlessly as possible into the new locations, another big challenge for us. But we will also take out the back office support and eliminate the overlapping functions.</p>
          <p>Within an overall snapshot then, clearly research and early development, and this really is through to proof of concept, we will ensure that this diversity, this power house that has been the Genentech model continues on a standalone basis in South San Francisco. We will ensure that there is the minimum impact in the Nutley, New Jersey site as they get ready to welcome colleagues coming from the West Coast. Our Palo Alto site we obviously have to pay particular attention to, since people are moving either to South San or across the Eastern Seaboard here, and make sure that that transfers seamlessly.</p>
          <p>Then, in late development, it's more about an alignment in manufacturing. It is an alignment on the biotechnology production. The small molecules galenical production that we have out in New Jersey, we will ultimately close at the end of 2010. The high potency work that we do there, we do have another facility that is coming on stream and will take over that work. We will streamline and use the combined power commercially. The sales forces are powerfully intact. And I do believe that that, as we go through a few months of discussions and getting the new world order in place, that keeps us outward looking to the customer, outward looking to make sure that we don't get too internalized, which can happen in any form of major upheaval like this. And that the headquarters will be for the United States home office in Genentech in South San Francisco.</p>
          <p>What are some of the guiding principles, particularly in areas like the commercial area, we will take the best of both. We have a lot to do. This is not about trying to downsize the power and the capabilities but it's about making sure that we have &#x2013; where there are competing jobs, the best out of the combined power of the company.</p>
          <p>It is absolutely about innovation being at the heart of everything we do, the appreciation of the science culture in Genentech and in Roche, leveraging the brand and reputation that Genentech has certainly built up in the last 30 years here in the United States, and also leveraging the reputation of Roche has over 100 years in the United States, integrating that operational management, looking for the synergies where it is sensible and possible and integrating based absolutely on the best talent for the job available.</p>
          <p>And with that I would like to hand over them to Erich to talk about the financials for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bill, so turning to the key transaction numbers. Yes, it is a big transaction and of course we are reading everything which is written after such a transaction but we should stick to the key facts.</p>
          <p>Roche has acquired control of Genentech in 1990, so this has absolutely nothing to do with a change of control. This is taking a company private, so I respect that a lot is written about premiums but as soon as people are comparing premiums to merger and acquisition transactions, it's just not a valid argument because this is a very clear and specific legal transaction of taking a company private which the mother company already controls today. And also to make it absolute clear, Roche has not even the slightest intention to divest our shares.</p>
          <p>So, this is also totally untypical for a situation of a takeover because there you would have potential interlopers or peers, that's not the case. We control Genentech and we are now finding a process to actually take them private and acquiring respectfully the remaining minority shares.</p>
          <p>So financially, this transaction makes a lot of sense for Roche and we've given you, out of our modeling, a very clear guidance that this transaction in the first year after the closing will be accretive for Roche shareholders.</p>
          <p>We have also, and I think out of the discussions yesterday we had already in Europe, we have also made a very clear bandwidth to you about the potential synergies. And also here, to repeat what our chairman has said and to stress what our CEO has said, this is not a transaction about cost cutting, taking together two matching organizations which have all the overlap and then taking it out, that's not the fact. As you have seen large parts like sales force like the core of innovation and early development, this is all complementary and we will not touch it there.</p>
          <p>So therefore we commit to this bandwidth of synergies in the range of 750 to 850 million and please, even if you ask 10 times where are these synergies exactly and how do you realize this, we will not answer any question because what we invite you to consider behind these figures there are people and this transaction will create high value if we respect the rights and also the feelings of all our people on the Roche U.S. side and on the Genentech side.</p>
          <p>So I think we will diligently develop the plans and then roll it out first to the people who are affected and then we will give you the details but you can plan enough and I think you can trust this transaction if you have this bandwidth.</p>
          <p>For us of course another important element, and you have seen &#x2013; some of you may have seen the first comments of the rating agencies. Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday came out and has rated Roche based on this transaction above &#x2013; upon closing of this transaction from AA plus to AA minus. That's an outcome which respects, if you look today our AA plus rating of Standard &amp; Poor's is just based on the cash we have direct access to, so for instance everything which is generated in the legal entity Genentech is not even considered in the rating of Roche because we respect the rights of the minority shareholders and we have never gripped into the cash pockets of Genentech. We just cannot do this in the actual situation.</p>
          <p>One big benefit of taking them private is of course that we then can take the united cash for the development, as our chairman has said, of the most important healthcare market in the world and we want to be a strong player in this market.</p>
          <p>Financing, with a AA minus rating, it will not surprise you that I think we can definitely finance this transaction. It's not a question, if we can finance, it will be a question at what terms and I can report that my team is having negotiations at the moment with seventeen potential partners who are interested to support the Roche group in financing this transaction.</p>
          <p>Another element, if you want to do your models, is the accounting. In a merger and acquisition transaction where you have change of control and all this, you usually &#x2013; the acquirer usually takes a heavy burden of goodwill on its balance sheet and then also has to impair &#x2013; has actually to amortize or impair intangible assets acquired or even goodwill if the development does not sustain.</p>
          <p>And here there is another example that this is a totally different transaction. We are not even talking about goodwill, amortization or intangible asset amortization. If you go to the half-year results and to the half-year financial report, you will find a detailed explanation of us increasing our shareholding in Chugai, which we already controlled by 9.9%, and this accounting will be exactly the same for the actually going from our actual controlling majority to 100%. So the attractiveness for the P&amp;L in the future will be that there will be no charges in any sense for intangible amortization or goodwill.</p>
          <p>The process, and I also respect that of course yesterday after such a big transaction is announced there were so many questions, so but the basis is very clear. When Roche re-floated Genentech in 1999, the basis between these two legal entities are formed in a so-called affiliation agreement. That's a very complex legal document but both sides over the last 10 years have really taken care that we always respect it, any paragraph in this document and that's exactly what we're doing now also. And this document prescribes very clearly the first way and the starting way of how we would go in a situation which we now have chosen to go and this is that we submit an offer, as we have done over this weekend to the so called independent directors of the Genentech Board.</p>
          <p>So, to make it very clear, it is not the Roche management negotiating with the Genentech management, that's not the case. It is the Roche Group negotiating with the representatives of the minority shareholders which are the independent directors of the Genentech Board.</p>
          <p>We respect their role and they will now have all the time they need to have their financial and legal advisors and to assess the proposal which is on the table, and we will wait then for the discussions they will initiate.</p>
          <p>In the meantime of course, Genentech and Roche have to function on a daily basis; we have so many interfaces and they all will go on hopefully more or less as business as usual and this includes of course also the board meetings and some of you may know that Prof. Knowles, our Head of Research a colleague who is not here, and Bill Burns and myself, we are Roche representatives on the Genentech board, and it's absolutely clear that we will not be involved in any way, neither in the negotiations, nor into any discussions which the Genentech board will have based on this, proposal on the table. And I think with this, I hand over to our Chairman Dr. Franz Humer.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much Erich. Thank you for listening to our presentations and now open to your questions. Please, who wants to start, here is a question here; one to &#x2013; the microphones are coming.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff Porges, Sanford Bernstein. First question, you indicated to the media that you were going to be talking to Art Levenson today. Could you tell us if that happened and what happened? And secondly a question on the process; it looks as though once the offer goes to the independent directors then they seek the opinion of two national investment banks.</p>
          <p>Let's say that opinion comes back at $100 per share, is Roche obligated to up its bid to that level and if it does, are the minority shareholders obligated to accept it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, you see, I did &#x2013; originally did not want to inform Art on the phone of our intentions. I wanted to have a private discussion with him. Due to the time pressure we were under, that was not possible.</p>
          <p>So I said on the phone to him, "look Art, I'll come over to San Francisco and we can sit down." So that is a very simple human approach. I don't believe in doing deals of that nature, of that size, and informing the other party on the phone, especially when you have, as Art and I have, a long, personal, very good relationship, so this is &#x2013; there is nothing behind it.</p>
          <p>We are not going to negotiate anything. I suppose what we're going to say or what I will say, let's make sure that we both continue to run the business as we have done so far, and let's make sure that in that process we properly look after our people because they are the most important assets we have on both sides. With regards to the process, the independent directors will now select investment bankers, they will select legal advice. The affiliation agreement clearly says that anything that will be agreed has to be mutually agreed between the two parties.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff Meacham, JPMorgan. Two questions here. While you're waiting for Genentech, for the Genentech response and throughout this process, will you be buying Genentech's stock in the open market? And the second question, more bigger picture is, do you think your enthusiasm for Genentech's culture, its pipeline, its portfolio is reflected in an 8.8% premium?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I don't think that we are legally in a position to buy in the open market any Genentech shares, if I understand the legal position correctly. Now, as I look at the premium we're offering, I'm looking less at the 9%, compared to last Friday, I'm looking over at the 22% three months' average, and I think it's time, that is I believe and I'm convinced a generous offer we're putting on the table. And it needs to give the independent directors time to digest that and then sit down with them to explain the reasons behind that offer, and that's what we are going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jason Miller from Twin Capital. Under the affiliation agreement, if the two investment banks are appointed, it uses the term fair value, but there is no definition of fair value. What does fair value mean under the affiliation agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It means that both sides need to agree on what it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does it reflect the fact that you have control of Genentech today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it certainly does reflect that we are the majority shareholder of Genentech. Question here and then back there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had just a quick question Dr. Humer, Dr. Hunziker, regarding the financing. I assume, as you indicated that it will be no problem but I am just curious about the cash flows that you are expecting to generate over the next few years and then how much of that would be used to pay back the debt? How quickly you think you could pay back the debt? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Erich, you want to take that directly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think there are enough analysts reports out on Genentech, prognosing their future and enough on Roche prognosing their future. And I think if you model what I just have explained that we will then, after closing this transaction, have access to all the cash of the two combined legal entities and will have, in addition, the synergies achieved relatively quickly and on the under &#x2013; on the other side, of course, have some debt costs in this transaction, it will not surprise you that we are confident that we can pay down the peak of this debt quite quickly. And that we have &#x2013; this will be one of the strongest global companies in cash generation. And, I mean, if you look at the rating which Standard &amp; Poor's has assigned us with a AA minus, I think we are still belonging even with this transaction to a relatively small group of global companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is important, the way we look at the cash generation, is we will also do it in such a way that allows us to remain strategically flexible. We will continue to have enough cash to do small and middle-sized deals as we've done one today, as we've done Ventana, both in the diagnostic side and in the pharmaceutical side as of &#x2013; as the right opportunities arrive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made it known to the rating agencies that we would reserve ourselves even in the first years a strategic framework of $1.5 billion available for these smaller deals like you have just seen them this morning, because we consider that this freedom of action should be there. So &#x2013; and this figure also appears in one of the announcements, so that's why I give it to you here, so that you just see we have not made unrealistic promises. We want this company to go on as a very aggressive high-tech healthcare company acquiring also specific technology.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Maged Shenouda with UBS. Just, I'm interested in understanding the timing, clearly you've been evaluating this for quite some time, why now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there are number of factors. As you say, we've been evaluating that for some time as part of our overall strategic review process.  And we've been evaluating that not for the first time, we've been evaluating that again this year in our strategic review process; that process came to fruition a few weeks ago.  We then said there are number of green lights here and one of the green lights is also the relationship euro Swiss francs to the U.S. dollar, but that's not the decisive one.</p>
          <p>There are other points like 2015 coming closer.  That's the end of the current agreement &#x2013; marketing agreement with Genentech.  The situation of the overall development in the pharmaceutical market, the price pressures, the competition pressures, which showed us that there are all of a sudden more greens than ambers and red in that decision making. And that's now, however, I don't mean we were aiming for July 20 or July 22.  That coincided that that's when we presented our strategic plan as we do every year to our Board.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Yaron Werber, Citi.  If the fair value as determined by the two independent banks is a lot higher than your current offer, are you committed to this deal or is there a certain price by which you'd walk away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are always trying to lead me down the same way and you are always going to get the same answer.  We've put a very generous offer on the table.  We're going to stick with that offer.  We'll sit down with the independent directors and negotiate it, and I am confident we will achieve mutual agreement.  But they first need to understand where we come from.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners.  Franz, two strategic questions.  Everyone in the industry uses the phrase 'Roche-Genentech model'.  Is that model not practical anymore?  And relatedly, it's not being practiced very widely.  Does that mean that finally, somewhat after 20 years of practice, Roche has come to realize that it is not a very practical model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand your question, and that's probably... the fundamental of your question is probably the issue that, in our minds, give rise to most of the debate and most of the thinking behind it.</p>
          <p>I'm absolutely convinced the Roche-Genentech model was the right model for the last 20 years.  I'm also convinced it is still the right model when you look at diversity of research.  I would do it again today. But I think where we have to remain flexible and not become dogmatic is when we see, all of a sudden, two large pharma companies with two parallel structures in an environment that is getting so much more cost conscious, you've got to address that issue.  Otherwise, I think you become dogmatic in a model forever and nothing is forever, because the environment changes and the players themselves change, and I think that led us to that step.  But if tomorrow there is a biotech company or a smaller company out there, where we see the same potential in terms of creating innovation and science; I would do a Genentech deal of the 1990s again tomorrow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my second question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's your second question is that, does that have the reflection on Chugai? No, it doesn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So which factors do not apply to Chugai?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Chugai is a different case because in Japan, Chugai market develops the Roche products.  So there is inherently a very different link between those two companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we operated as one company within one market. So already when we acquired the majority share holding in Chugai, the &#x2013; that had, subsumed into it, Nippon Roche.  So, already we are operating as one company in the one market.  What we do have, and it's a smaller company, we still have that richness of a diversity within its research and development of its own products.  And they links to academia and things, which probably the international company would struggle with.</p>
          <p>So, it is a different model, and we should play it as a different model and again not &#x2013; to Franz's point, not come to a dogma or a standard formulation.  But to say what is it that's right for the time?  The deal we've just announced this morning with Mirus in Madison, Wisconsin, 50 people, we'll keep them as a separate group there and they will link with the folk in Kulmbach that came that came to us out of the Alnylam deal. We've got also the, my colleagues with Ventana in Tucson, Arizona. These are also diverse hubs and creative people.</p>
          <p>It just so happens that they are working &#x2013; that group are working within a 100% ownership model.  But we still need to encourage diversity.  And I think what we've demonstrated, through Chugai and through Genentech is a lightness of governance, the likes of which most Anglo-Saxon companies cannot do, and that's because one,</p>

          <p>So our lightness of touch, which preserved an arm's length, that has worked for that highly creative phase.  But to Franz's point, when you've got a large business that still has to define how it's going forward, I think the right moment is now.</p>

          <p>We've concluded &#x2013; if you think we're in 2015, from 2015, going back 15 years ago, an agreement which provides Roche with &#x2013; at various stages with opt-ins into the Genentech products and pipeline. And that agreement expires in 2015, and would have to be renewed and renegotiated the same way as it was negotiated in '99.  And again that would fall away with us taking the 100%.  So we've automatic rights to everything that comes out of Genentech.</p>

          <p>Dr. Humer, just a quick question regarding the family controlling shareholders of you shares.  I assume they were contacted long before this deal was announced.  How did they feel about you taking over 100% control of Genentech and then are they concerned at all about the reduced financial flexibility and the possibility that they could be diluted one day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The family of the majority shareholders were not informed ahead of time, I had a &#x2013; we had a meeting with them on Sunday evening at 7 o'clock after the board meeting where I presented to them our proposal, the reasoning behind it, the financing strategy and the family unanimously said we are all for it, we'll &#x2013; we are 100% behind you, off you go.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were not concerned about reducing very short term our financial flexibility.  I mean as I have always said the strength of this family is they do not think short term.  They think, they act and they behave long term. And that allows the company, that allows us, as a management to present those plans to &#x2013; and to work for the long-term creation of value.  And that is what we demonstrated to them also in this scheme.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I understand that this is probably sensitive because you haven't had a chance to sit down with the employees of Genentech yet. But you referred to making &#x2013; strides to maintaining the culture, but here you have to assume that a big part of that culture would have come from a publicly traded stock that's a pure biotech company, so I'm wondering if you can just point us in the direction if you've considered doing some sort of private stock to reflect that sort of private company culture that you want to put in place there, and whether we should stay tuned for that, or how are you going to maintain that culture without a biotech stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've hit a very good point. We're very conscious of that remuneration culture which exists not only in Genentech but exists in general in that part of the world, and therefore we need to be competitive with regard to those companies that are around Genentech and with regard to what Genentech did in the past. And we are willing to embark on various alternatives. It's too early to give you a specific plan but we're working on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're comfortable you could do that within some sort of current SG&amp;A strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are comfortable we can find solutions to that issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Perfect.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we need to remain competitive. It is not just a matter of doing what Genentech did, because out there California is a different environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I just have a question on Genentech's side. So I think, so Genentech has a &#x2013; if Genentech they want to stay independent, I believe they have enough resources to hold against your offer. For example, I think probably they can have a special deal with <mark type="inaudible" /> it might be between $5 or $10 to please the current minority shareholders. I am not sure if that's possible, obviously for Genentech and obviously they do have a number of again options?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Genentech itself has no options; it is the independent directors on behalf of the minority shareholders who are negotiating with us. It's very clear, Art and I, and Art knows that and I know that, are not negotiating. Back there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a follow up question. You consistently mentioned pricing pressures and I am just wondering how the combined entity can deal with pricing pressure standalone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pricing pressure &#x2013; one of the ways of resisting &#x2013; there are two ways of resisting pricing pressures, two fundamental ways. First one is to have products which are really different, and we have that in many cases, so we can resist them as those pricing pressures increase and they will increase inevitably.</p>
          <p>You can resist them by cutting costs.  We can become much more efficient as a company by combining those two organizations here in the United States and internationally. Look at the manufacturing network. Instead of building more plants, we can optimize the capacities we have, we can avoid capital outlay. So there's a lot that can be done here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Roche and Genentech have over the years started developing products in overlapping areas. Do you anticipate any FTC issues, any projects or products that one or other side might need to divest?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to understand from the &#x2013; what I saw on the agreement I thought that you negotiated with the directors, put forward a proposal; if they agreed with it then it went to shareholders, and if the shareholders turned it down then the independent banks would make an opinion, come to an average price between the two of them, and that would be binding?

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if the two banks come back and agree to a price that's...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not a mutual agreement because the two banks are not mutual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what's the point of the two banks? What do they say? They say, "I think it's worth 100" and you say, "No" or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to speculate on that. It doesn't lead us in the right way. I am convinced that in the negotiations and discussions with the independent directors we will achieve a mutually acceptable agreement. Rest assured.</p>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow up on that, is there a potential that the special committee may have such a high valuation, an unrealistic valuation that you might go direct to the shareholders of Genentech, or force the merger just by voting in it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are all sorts of various possibilities one could consider and entertain. I let the independent directors form their committee, get their advice and will sit down with them and discuss and negotiate. And I am convinced that we will reach a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Franz, you started your statements by saying why now and what's going on inside of Roche, and I think many of us are still struggling with that. Can you talk about some of the uncertainties and some of the risks that you see in the business particularly with respect to Avastin.  We have all seen the recent decision in France regarding non-small cell lung cancer, we've seen the decision in the U.K., do you feel that some of the dominoes are falling in the wrong direction with respect to Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I look at our own five-year plan, we do not need to change anything. The strength of our business is very, very strong, as I look over the next five years, and that's what we have done, going forward. Our franchise in oncology is continuing to grow and going from strength-to-strength. New indications are coming through, the RA franchise is coming through; the diabetic franchise is now two drugs in Phase III. I don't know what more I can say.</p>
          <p>Our cost structure is under control. We are in very good shape. That's what I'm saying, we're doing &#x2013; we're taking that step out of a position of strength, not out of a position of weakness, because if you do these things out of a position of weakness you make mistakes. Then you cut costs for the sake of cutting costs. And that is wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up. Maybe I can state it more succinctly and focus on the Genentech side in terms of risks that &#x2013; succinctly I think that the risk proposition with Avastin is when payers start to question how much is two, three, four months of life worth? And when they reduce it to overall survival as opposed to progression pre-survival or any other end point, then it becomes a riskier proposition. I just want to see how you think about that in the U.S. since you clearly have that thought through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we think about that not only in the U.S. but globally, and if I look at what we have achieved in terms of pricing in countries like France and Germany, I'm very happy with those situations. Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the general theme here is that if you are a health technology assessment organization, you take a rather different view than patients. Now, what do I mean by that? We've got one or two authorities in the world. It's typically the old British connection. It's the U.K., it's Canada, and it's Australia that are remarkably arithmetic in how they look at the health technology assessments.</p>
          <p>There are other countries that still have a professional approach, Scandinavia, France, which take a more societal view, and I would put the United States into that arena as well. It's a more societal view on what is the benefit to the individual. And it comes down to &#x2013; if any of us were fighting for cancer, what treatment would we want? And in this country, there is the added sting in the tail is the legal system also supports that individual. And if they are not getting the best standard of care, then somebody has something to answer for.</p>
          <p>So I do believe that the dynamics here, as it is in some of the other countries, will always support good medicine moving forward and not reducing it. Maybe we're not doing a good enough job of explaining some of these outcomes. It tends to get reduced to a progression-free survival of X weeks on average.</p>
          <p>If I took, just a figure that comes to mind, the Tarceva data which has got some similar questioning over average survival in lung cancer. In that picture, you are averaging &#x2013; look at it another way, you have a one in five chance of being alive a year later with late stage lung cancer. With Tarceva, it moves up to three in five having a chance to be alive a year later. If that was in my family, I'd want those odds, and I bet you would too. So I think these activities get rather intellectualized when it's taken by some of the more arithmetic groups.  It then somehow in the room here to specialist analysts maybe is seen as a turbulence to the earnings per share on an Excel spreadsheet. But believe me, there is an enormous undercurrent of demand, and that demand is there. I would have it in my family and you would have it in yours.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But bringing the two organizations together will help us enormously on a global scale to formulate and present those arguments.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question related to Roche shareholders; we've had a lot of questions regarding Genentech shareholders. How do you justify this to your shareholders when you are spending $45 billion for something you already pretty much control? Because synergies are not that great, because it's not really a cost-cutting deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be very careful. We control but we don't own. And there is, as Bill or Severin pointed out, there is no free exchange of information, of know-how, of intellectual property. All that is today not possible. We are running two parallel organizations. We're running programs that are parallel and perhaps should not be parallel. We are developing the same drugs on the one hand in the United States through an organization, on the other hand outside of the States through an organization.</p>
          <p>More and more large company overlaps are being created. So to our shareholders, I'd say we've got access to the cash, this is accretive within 12 months. It's quite a good proposal.  Show me where you can spend that money and say you are accretive in the first 12 months, after closing of the deal.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Very difficult to say at this point.  Even if you look at similar deals historically, anything between 6 months and 18 months is possible.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not waiting for anything. I am waiting till the independent directors are ready in order to initiate discussions with us.

From the employees' point of view, I'd like to get it done as quickly as possible so that we can create clarity for them and with them.</p>

All I can say is, we dug out for the fun of it the press cuttings from 1990 when we bought the majority in Genentech and that press cuttings read, "They are killing the innovative spirit of Genentech", "All the good scientists are going to leave", exactly the same things and we succeeded. Ventana, the biggest concern in the public was, will the good scientists of Ventana leave? On the contrary, the good scientists are joining Ventana.  It is not happening but that has something to do with our management style, with the way we treat people, with the way that we are aware we need a different remuneration structure out in California for that group. That's fine.</p>
          <p>We'll have diverse people, then in Basel someone will say, why am I not getting &#x2013; I'm doing the same job. That's life, that's diversity. And we'll need to manage that and be conscious of it. I'm convinced we can do it, we're committed to do it, we are not coming in like a panzer regiment. Which is what some people always expect from us, but we've never done it and we won't do it this time either. We will listen very carefully what the Genentech employees have to say.</p>

          <p>Yes I'd like to just take issue with a statement that you currently control Genentech. You've been very clear in explaining the difference between how you control Genentech currently and the benefits of owning 100% of Genentech. Access to the IP, access to technology, the ability to eliminate the uncertainty of an agreement that expires in 2015. It seems to me that clearly control as it exists today is different than control as it exists with 100%. As a Genentech shareholder I would like to state that that premium &#x2013; that control premium needs to be placed on those shares to reflect your enhanced ability to control the company that you clearly do not have today.</p>
