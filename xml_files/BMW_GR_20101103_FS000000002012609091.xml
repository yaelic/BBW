          <p>Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you all to the Telephone Conference of the BMW AG on the Third Quarter 2010. With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First, Dr. Reithofer will give you all an update on the business performance during the first nine months of the year. Dr. Eichiner will then take you through our financial results for the third quarter and the first three quarters of the year as well. Afterwards, we will have time for a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>Mr. Reithofer, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group is on track to meet its goals for the business year 2010. Our key financials for the first nine months of 2010 are the best proof of this. With more than one million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce cars sold, we exceeded the previous year's level by 13%. We are benefiting from the attractive, new models in our young portfolio. We also expect a double-digit increase in sales in the fourth quarter. Sales of BMW Motorrad increased by 16.9% to over 81,500 units. The BMW Group achieved a positive pre-tax result of more than &#x20AC;3.1 billion and our net profit stood at over &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Currently, the market climate in many countries is positive and that includes demand for premium cars. However, experts confirm that risks and uncertainties will remain before we see a lasting and reliable economic recovery. Therefore, development in the markets is uneven. Volatility is still a risk.</p>
          <p>During our last conference call, if you remember, I said we operate globally. We are pursuing balanced performance between Europe, Asia and North America. This goal is consistent with our long-term strategic direction. It limits our risk to market fluctuations. And it is our approach to managing the dynamics of important automotive markets with the goal of participating in the long-term growth, always in line with our motto, production follows the market.</p>
          <p>During the first nine months of the year, sales have picked up in Asia, North America and Europe. Let me give you four examples. First, India; at our assembly plant in Chennai, we have increased capacity from 3,000 to 5,400 units. From December onwards, we will not only assemble BMW 3 and 5 Series Sedans there, but also the BMW X1. At the same time, we are expanding the sales network to 22 dealerships by the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Second, China; we have started construction of our new plant in Tiexi. This move will allow us to raise capacity in China to over 100,000 units annually from 2012 onward. The maximum long-term capacity for the Tiexi and Da Dong plants combined is 300,000 units a year. Together with our joint venture partner, we are investing &#x20AC;560 million and creating around 1,000 jobs.</p>
          <p>Third, United States of America; as announced last month, Spartanburg is our competence center for BMW X models. Since September, production of the BMW X5 and X6 has been joined by the new X3, also exclusively for the global market. To allow for the manufacture of this additional model, we have stepped up capacity to 240,000 units per year. This means that more cars roll off the assembly line in Spartanburg than in our Munich plant.</p>
          <p>We have invested $750 million in this site expansion. As a result, we will raise our head count by 1,600 there.</p>
          <p>Fourth, Germany; we also show strong commitment to our home market. This applies in particular to future technologies such as e-mobility.</p>
          <p>We will build our Megacity Vehicle at our youngest plant in Leipzig, which has world-class production capabilities. We consider this a clear commitment to Germany as a location for advanced technologies and also to the country's highly qualified workforce. The production network for the carbon fiber chassis of the Megacity Vehicle also includes our sites in Landshut and Wackersdorf. In cooperation with our joint venture partner SGL Carbon, we are setting up a carbon plant close to Seattle in the United States. And as a first step, we are investing $100 million there.</p>
          <p>All these activities show we continue to invest in our future. This also applies to our models. The new BMW 5 Series Touring has been available since September. Regarding the 5 Series Sedan, the all-wheel drive is on the market now, as is the extended wheelbase version for China.</p>
          <p>Later this year, the new BMW X3 will be launched in selected markets. As a first, we are combining the Auto Start-Stop Function with a six-cylinder engine and an eight-gear automatic transmission.</p>
          <p>The MINI Countryman was introduced in September. This new member of the MINI family demonstrates once again that MINI never fails to inspire fans with innovative and original ideas. The Rolls-Royce Ghost has more than met our expectations. As of September, we already delivered a total of over 1,700 Ghost and Phantom models.</p>
          <p>We will continue to update our model range. This includes other hybrid offerings such as the new BMW 5 Series Sedan with hybrid drive train starting in 2011. The next generation of the BMW 3 Series will also include hybrid models.</p>
          <p>When we launched our Strategy Number ONE in 2007, we decided that we wanted to grow further, in the large as well as in the small segment of the premium market. We were the very first car company to establish premium in the small car segment. For almost a decade, MINI has been the clear leader and trend-setter in this segment.</p>
          <p>Other car companies see how successful we have been with MINI and are now trying to follow in our footsteps. In the future, we intend to participate even more in the growth of the small car segment. This is why we are planning to offer smaller BMW models, positioned below the BMW 3 Series, with front-wheel drive. These models with front-wheel drive will also be made available to our customers with a hybrid engine.</p>
          <p>For this very reason, we are strengthening our strategic cooperation with PSA. Our cooperation is focused on developing and producing components for hybrid front-wheel drive. Additional economies of scale will be achieved by pooling certain purchasing activities. I am talking specifically about e-drives, generators and power electronics that control the integration between a battery and electric drive. We regard hybrids as an intermediate step toward achieving the goal of sustainable mobility.</p>
          <p>The first fully electric, large-scale car of the BMW Group is scheduled to be launched in 2013. I would like to emphasize that even when we talk about electric drive, we remain focused on offering our customers dynamics and sheer driving pleasure. In contrast to all electric-cars currently available, our Megacity Vehicle is being created using a unique approach, Purpose Design. This means, it is being designed from the ground up for the demands of electric mobility. It will have a one-of-a-kind car architecture consisting of a Life module and a Drive module. The Life module will consist of new materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced plastic, setting completely new standards in our industry.</p>
          <p>Regarding production of the Megacity Vehicle, the economical use of resources is imperative. It is a given that the same applies to all our cars. We were the first to add the sustainability element to the term premium, and we continue to do so in the future. In September, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index once again named our company the most sustainable car company in the world. We are also the only German company among the 19 industry leaders.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, due to the positive business development in the past nine months, our guidance for the year 2010 is as follows. We plan to sell more than 1.4 million cars and increase sales by more than 10% over 2009. We will post a Group pre-tax profit significantly above the previous year's level. And we will achieve an EBIT margin in the automotive segment of over 7%. Our long-term profitability targets for 2012 remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>We are staying our course with full confidence. At the end of the month, it has been 50 years that Herbert Quandt became a shareholder of our company, thus giving BMW its independence. This legacy is a strong &#x2013; is as strong today as it was half a century ago. The BMW Group continues to stand for innovation, future viability and success.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer. And now, Friedrich Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from my side as well. The upswing in the global economy has gained further momentum and the BMW Group continues to benefit from this. Our attractive products, our measures to boost profitability and the economic recovery have combined to produce good quarterly results.</p>
          <p>Due to upward trends, especially in markets outside Germany, the magnitude of the seasonal slowdown was less than we had forecast. We expect this positive business development to continue over the coming months. Increased momentum in the Auto segment, in particular, pushed BMW Group revenues to almost &#x20AC;16 billion in the third quarter. This represents an increase of 35.6% from last year. At the Group level, we earned a profit before tax of &#x20AC;1.36 billion in the third quarter. Now let's move on to talk about the significant improvement in earnings and the individual segments in more detail.</p>
          <p>The Auto segment generated a profit before financial result of more than &#x20AC;1.15 billion. Earnings for the year to the end of September 2010 totaled &#x20AC;2.76 billion. For the same period, we achieved an EBIT margin of 7.2%.</p>
          <p>Besides sales growth, our improved product mix also had a positive impact on the Auto segment. The 5 Series Sedan, in particular, generated positive product momentum. This will continue with the new BMW X3, the 5 Series Touring and the MINI Countryman.</p>
          <p>Strong demand for new models also benefited our price positioning. We continue to scale back sales incentives in all of our key markets in the third quarter. We will continue to stand by this pricing strategy. It is fully in line with our clear segment lead and enables us to benefit even more from our new products.</p>
          <p>The reduction in material costs we achieved through optimizing our product development process and working with our suppliers also had a positive effect on earnings. This resulted in lower manufacturing costs for our new models.</p>
          <p>Over recent months, we have strengthened our already solid foreign currency hedging positions at attractive rates. By doing so, we aim to become less dependent on volatile foreign exchange markets in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we reported a special charge from an employee bonus payment in the amount of &#x20AC;100 million. We had already announced this back in August. It has always been our corporate policy to have our associates share in the success of the company. This is standard practice for us. Together with our associates, we are implementing the measures defined by our Strategy Number ONE. We expect these to continue producing positive results.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group will continue to be a pioneer in sustainable individual mobility within the premium sector. Using modular production will improve our allocation of capital and boost efficiency. This will give us greater freedom to develop innovative technologies and new product concepts. We are already paving a way for totally new and revolutionary vehicle concepts.</p>
          <p>Our investment rate of 4.8% and the R&amp;D ratio of 4.4% reflect the temporary difference between our exceptionally strong revenue growth and capital expenditure. We once again increased our spending on research and development from last year's level. We have acquired &#x20AC;1.66 billion of securities on the capital markets, primarily to fund another portion of our pension obligations in Germany.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for this amount, free cash flow for the year to September 30th in the Auto segment was more than &#x20AC;2 billion. Unadjusted, that figure was &#x20AC;468 million. We will transfer the remaining &#x20AC;200 million of our German pension obligations by the end of the year. In doing so, the company is taking an important step for the future on behalf of its associates.</p>
          <p>To remain prepared for possible market volatility, our Group liquidity position was strong at &#x20AC;8.75 billion as of September 30th. In the event of a continued stabilization on the capital markets, we will continue to slightly reduce our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this brings me to the Financial Services segment. In the third quarter, this segment generated a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;318 million. This is three times last year's figure. For the period between January and September 2010, earnings before tax amounted to &#x20AC;919 million. Our Financial Services segment benefited from continuing favorable conditions on the international capital markets and further risk stabilization in the third quarter. In the period to the end of September, new business totaled almost &#x20AC;20.4 billion. This is 11.2% more than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>The percentage of new vehicles leased or financed by Financial Services declined slightly to 47.6%. The level of leasing business remained virtually unchanged, accounting for 24.1% of the contract portfolio. The total business volume, as disclosed in the balance sheet, was &#x20AC;63.2 billion, 3.3% higher year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our Financial Services business recently expanded. In September and October, we received the license required to run our own operations in China. BMW Financial Services China is based in Beijing and will open for business by the end of the year. BMW Financial Services India also received its business license in October. In this way, BMW Financial Services is clearly gearing itself towards future growth markets. The risk situation in the leasing and loan financing business has continued to improve throughout the economic recovery. We expect our financing business to face lower default risks from retail customers and dealers throughout the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>The credit loss ratio for the year to the end of September 2010 dropped to 0.58% from 0.71% in the same period last year. Overall, North America and Europe are trending differently. In North America, used car markets have further stabilized. We expect this trend to continue and default risks to keep falling. In certain European markets, on the other hand, we predict that the recent positive trend in the level of risk will slow. This is true for both, used car markets and the loan business. This situation is based on economic slowdown in certain European countries.</p>
          <p>The positive development in North America and European markets led to an improved end-of-lease business. In the third quarter, this had an additional impact on the earnings in the low double-digit million euro range. However, there is still a degree of uncertainty in the capital markets and in some of the used car markets. We expect this volatility to last and will take proactive, forward-looking measures. Further details on our individual segments can be found in our quarterly report.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is currently enjoying the benefits of three effects; our highly attractive products, the current economic recovery and the company's increased earnings power. The measures defined by our strategy are clearly taking effect and we are optimizing both our cost and performance on a continuous basis. Gradual improvements in profitability and positive product momentum over the next two years are evidence of the success of our strategic measures.</p>
          <p>Despite the uncertainties that remain in the global financial markets, we expect the BMW Group to enjoy dynamic sales and earnings growth for the rest of the year. On the one hand, this is due to our attractive new models which are in high demand. And on the other, it is thanks to the recovery we are experiencing in many markets. The improved outlook allows us to raise the forecast we made in the summer.</p>
          <p>From the current perspective, we will exceed our previously announced EBIT margin of more than 5% for the Auto segment by the end of the year. We are currently forecasting an EBIT margin of above 7% for the full 2010 financial year. And we are still targeting a return on equity of more than 18% in the Financial Services Segment. At Group level, we expect to see a significant increase in our profit before tax compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our goal remains the same; sustainable, profitable growth. That means further strengthening our company's earnings power, and at the same time, constantly focusing on our premium claim. The BMW Group aims to be the leading provider of sustainable, premium cars and services for individual mobility.</p>
          <p>We have the right strategy, capabilities and financial resources needed to clearly meet the challenges of the future. We will continue taking right steps to assure our ongoing success. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Dr. Eichiner. And now ladies and gentlemen, the line will shortly be opened for questions. Please wait for some technical advice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from Kristina Church of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Kristina Church here from Barclays Capital. I have a couple of questions. Firstly, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts on your dividend payment for this year. I know that in the past you've said that you might be looking to raise your payout ratio on dividends. I was wondering if there's any more clarity you can give around that. The second question is coming to the pricing issue. You've said that the pricing environment is very strong and that helps your quarterly results. I was just wondering if you could just make some commentary by country to whether it's strong across the board or whether it's in certain countries that you're seeing the most strength in pricing.</p>
          <p>And then moving on to your Financial Services division. I was just wondering how ongoing you see the improvements in the FS division going into 2011, should we expect this to continue based on the low interest rates? And are you expecting that cost of risk to come down even further or are you happy with the level where it is today? And also on residual values, are you seeing these as being at an optimal level right now or again do you see some improvement likely to come? And then very finally, if I could get a little bit of clarity on the bonus payments in the quarter that seem to have been causing a lot of questions this morning. I just wanted to get some clarity on whether the 100 million that you announced in August that is just a one-off payment made for the 2010 year and then the 150 million is an accrual of the normal bonus payment, so that will be paid in 2011 for the 2010 year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Kristina. A lot of question, I think, fully all for our CFO. Mr. Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kristina, well, first of all, I'll come back to your first question, dividend payment. I mean it's a bit early after the third quarter to talk about dividends. But our few &#x2013; our mid to long-term target is to coming to a range of 30% to 40% and that is &#x2013; of the net profit that is what we want to achieve. And we clearly are prepared to take our first significant step this year. But the amount is still open, I would say, because we need the full-year result first before we can discuss it. But the direction, I think, is very clear. Then your question about pricing, we have a different situation looking over the globe. So, a very favorable development in the U.S. supported by the new products, very strong performance in China as well, and some weaknesses in European markets, especially when you think about markets like Spain, for example, still under heavy pressure. So, it's not a &#x2013; it's a trend that's clearly positive and a bit better than we expected. But the situation is a bit diverse.</p>
          <p>Talking about Financial Services, I mean actually Financial Services is profiting from a very favorable margin, because cost of capital is very low and as long as we can benefit from this development, I think we should still see, also in the future, a strong margin and that's why we think we should be able to keep that level of performances in the Financial Services business at least in the course of 2011 as long as the situation is like it is on the capital markets, knowing that it could change quickly. And residual values, same, so I think we already forecasted improving residual values that is already part of our provisioning and it seems to be quite in line with our forecast situation that is, as well, diverse. So, we have positive developments in the U.S. and some negative developments in Europe at the same point in time.</p>
          <p>Your fourth question is about the bonus payment. Well, of course, we had the one-off payment. It's usually one-off payment, we had in the third quarter, it was announced already in August. And then we &#x2013; in addition we accrued provisions for ongoing operations as a result of the business growth in the third quarter. For example, the accrual of additional provisions for the employee bonus to be paid for the fiscal year 2010 and in 2011. That's what I would like to say about this. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Christian Breitsprecher of Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher of Macquarie. I have a question regarding the eliminations in the third quarter. Could you detail a little more what's behind it? I mean, the report is saying it's the growth in the leasing business behind it, but when I look at the position of the leasing assets in the balance sheet between the half-year numbers and the third-quarter numbers, I don't really see an increase. So what's behind it? And then secondly, what should we expect for the fourth quarter for the eliminations line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are many &#x2013; three effects, I would like to mention. First of all, you have to look at the development of our leasing business. So the overall portfolio was still a bit shrinking in Q3, but the new business, the new lease business increased significantly with the strong performance in U.S. market, for example, that see now the new business, new leasing business is growing. And with growth of this new business, the elimination is coming along, so that is connected. And there are two additional effects you have to know. First of all, I think we have a stronger mix, which is clearly to be seen if you look at the revenue per vehicle and we have improved our margins, our contribution markets, because we have been able to reduce manufacturing costs, material costs and things like that, and this is a positive impact on our earnings as well as now a negative impact in the context of profit elimination. So, this is the context. And what is the expectation? Along with expected growth on the volume side, we will see the leasing business to grow as well. So, I think profit elimination would be negative as well in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Jochen Gehrke of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three quick ones, if I may. First of all, just two clean-up questions. Mr. Eichiner, you mentioned earlier in the year that you were targeting positive cash in flow from working capital. Now obviously given that growth has been a lot stronger that was not yet the case. Your colleagues in Stuttgart are targeting to ramp up inventories for China New Year. Is that something that we should be expecting for the final quarter as well? Secondly on the same side, CapEx still remained extremely low. What should we expect for the full year? Historically, the fourth quarter was always much &#x2013; mostly the strongest. Is that still the case and could you quantify what you expect in CapEx for this year.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on the strategic side, Mr. Reithofer, you alluded in your presentation a lot to the Megacity Vehicle. Earlier &#x2013; I think it was early in the month, last month, you spoke about the profitability that we should expect from these new technologies, that there is a need to be subsidized from existing technologies. Could you elaborate a little bit on how we should expect profitability to come from in particular the electric vehicles? What is hindering it? How much scale do you really need to make money in this? And when roughly &#x2013; and I know this is a lot of crystal balling, when roughly do you expect to return the same margins as you do on your today's operation? Is this something for second vehicle generation or do you think it's reachable in the first? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. We understand. And I think we start with Mr. Eichiner and then the last, the strategic question by Mr. Reithofer. Mr. Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right. We will build up some inventory in order to support a strong business, overseas business, not only in China, in many other Asian markets as well for the first quarter. And this clearly have an effect our inventory and on working capital. Having said this, I mean, the same point in time, we try to do everything to balance it. So, it's a question about trade payables at the same point in time where we end up and we try to find a right balance. Now, if you look at the actual situation, we have &#x2013; matter of the fact the causing working capital to increase. And I think it protects payment and things like that are important in this respect. And I think we should be able to find a balance. But I don't think that working capital could be further reduced in the fourth quarter because of the strong production momentum and inventory build up. It should be slightly up. That's my expectation.</p>
          <p>Now looking at CapEx. While this year we are expecting to be a bit below last year's figures, it was 3.5 billion, and &#x2013; but this is not a year where I would say it's a new trend, we are expecting CapEx to come back and the ratio we are targeting is 7% and below 7%. And I think this is something where we can &#x2013; where we should calculate on for the mid term, because we have to invest into new technologies. We are on our way to build up new product, new concepts, like in Megacity Vehicle. We are investing into very new vehicle concepts. And this will have an effect on our CapEx as well, but as I said, target is to maintain the ratio below 7%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The last part of the question was profitability, electric mobility, Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Gehrke, I would like to give you an answer. You ask, Mr. Reithofer, how do you see it from a strategic point of view, e-mobility and of course our Megacity Vehicle? My first answer to your question is, I mean, e-vehicles, they have to ensure that we make a positive contribution to reaching future CO2 targets. That is, in my opinion, from a priority point of view, it's the first priority that means ensure that e-vehicles make a positive contribution to reaching future CO2 targets.</p>
          <p>And as we all know, I mean, we have a target in the European Union for the year 2020 to 95 gram CO2 per kilometer. We will have similar targets in the United States of America.</p>
          <p>At the moment, we are in the process to discuss with politicians in the United States of America how can the years from 2017 to 2025 look like? But as I said it seems to be more or less as tough as in the European Union. And by using CO2-free electricity, e-vehicles will help significantly reduce CO2 emissions from traffic in the future. That is my opinion, as I said, the first and main priority of a Megacity Vehicle, of a battery electric vehicle.</p>
          <p>And from an economical point of view, I mean, I mentioned already I think during our last meeting, we predict a global market share between 5 and 15% for e-vehicles by 2020. That is from a volume point of view, if you have in mind economies of scale, not yet a volume what we need to be from a productivity point of view really on the right track.</p>
          <p>So that means &#x2013; and a big question mark for the first product cycle, for the profitability of the first product cycle, will be the future political and legislative framework because political and legislative framework will decide success of e-mobility in the first product cycle. That means if we have a favorable political and legislative framework, we can even be profitable during the first product cycle. If not, then, of course, during the first product cycle, it is very, very difficult to be profitable.</p>
          <p>But as I said, main priority is that e-vehicles make a positive contribution to reaching future CO2 targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, can I just follow-on. To put this very clear and maybe blunt from my side. When you talk about legislative framework, you need a purchase incentive from the government also to the consumer to make money. If we don't get it, it will be hard. Is that the right understanding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Gehrke, I give you now a view that's a different answer, I think, what you expect.</p>
          <p>I mean, if I believe, for example, a future legislative framework in the United States of America, then it can be that you will only be able to earn gold credits from 2016 onwards, if you have a better e-electric vehicle or if you have plug-in hybrids. And if you are a large vehicle manufacturer, and you don't have a plug-in hybrid or battery electric vehicle, then it can be that you lose a big portion of your business in the United States of America. And then it's a strategic danger, and we have to use the battery electric vehicle to counteract such dangers.</p>
          <p>So I mean in Germany, I can argue we want an equal, level playing field to promote &#x2013; let me say our money &#x2013; what we put into the technologies, and we don't want to have just subsidies. And what we have in our minds, that is, for example, if you see future tax regulations, future tax regulations to boost electro mobility can help.</p>

        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Horst Schneider of HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Two questions, if I may.</p>
          <p>The first one relates to the question of production capacity. I would like to get some better understanding what is now the limiting factor, is it more the demand or is it more the supply from your side? So maybe you could tell us what is your production capacity in 2010, and what was in the first nine months the level of utilization? And maybe you could update us what are the capacity extension plans, especially for 2011?</p>
          <p>And then the last &#x2013; or the second and last question that I have relates to your China joint venture partner, Brilliance. We get the feedback from suppliers that Brilliance is in a rather weak state. And given the fact that the Chinese government is planning to get active on the M&amp;A front, would it have any impact on your China plans if Brilliance would merge with another carmaker? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to compare once again our plant utilization of 2009 with 2010.</p>
          <p>In 2009, our plant utilization, inclusive Magnesteir, was at around 86%. And we are planning for utilization of well over 90% in 2010. And it will be really close to 100% in 2010. And if you see, for example, plants like Spartanburg, we are from a plant utilization point of view at 100%. We could sell more X5s and X6, but we are limited by our plant capacity.</p>
          <p>If I see our plant in Leipzig, for example, as well, the capacity is the limiting factor for example for the X1. That means from a market demand point of view; X5, very good; X6, very good; X1, very good; the new 5 Series Sedan, very good. That means same challenge in Dingolfing plant capacity.</p>
          <p>But we will have a different story in 2011 because we will move up Spartanburg, as we all know, to 240,000 units. That is additional plant capacity. We will have &#x2013; and further increase of plant capacity in China in 2011, and again in 2012.</p>
          <p>So at the moment not the limiting factor from a plant point of view are 1 Series and 3 Series cars, because 3 Series, as we all know, is in our last 1.5 years. 1 Series, we will have a model change over in 2011. But all the new cars we have &#x2013; for example, if you see X1, if you see 5 Series Sedan, we have a lot more orders than what we can produce. But ladies and gentlemen, that is a very good challenge compared to 2008 and 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the last part of the question was China, our business in China with our joint venture with Brilliance, and the question will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that you see Brilliance in a weak position. For me, it's &#x2013; just the opposite is the case.</p>
          <p>I mean, the hype out of a major loss-maker of Brilliance is Zhonghua business, which is a Sedan business to its master company, the Huachen Group, a group that is owned by the provincial government. The loss-maker is now out of the business of Brilliance. So the business of Brilliance now is based on its minibus business and on the BMW joint venture. Those parts, to my knowledge, are profitable.</p>
          <p>So we see Brilliance now in a much favorable position than in 2009, and it should be a reliable partner, a partner that should be capable to support our investment plans in China.</p>
          <p>And this is reflected in the share price. If you look at the share price development, it's exactly what it shows. So that's why I think for the time being we have a stable partner. And to my knowledge, there is nothing on its way to &#x2013; what Brilliance should be bought up by another car company or something like that. There is not &#x2013; actually not in our knowledge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if that was the case, that would also have no impact on your plans, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would not have <mark type="inaudible" />. I think if &#x2013; you never know because it depends on the new owner, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions. Firstly, just going back, if I may, to the other eliminations on the group EBIT. You had, obviously, the 270 million negative in Q3.</p>
          <p>Could you just give us some indication of what kind of the annual run rate would be? Because I guess as we're sorting of entering normal conditions, to some degree in the U.S. market, things improving, I presume that would be, I don't know, would it be a run rate of 100 million a quarter negative, something of that order? Great if you could give us a bit more on that.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is on the employee bonus. You mentioned putting through some provisions in Q3 for that. Could you just give us some indication of, if you hit your 2010 targets that you've guided us towards today, what kind of a number are we talking about that would be cash payment to employees as a bonus, I guess in the middle of 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Adam. The question will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're right. So the profit elimination could be another low three-digit million euro number in Q4. That is absolutely in line with our growing leasing business, as I explained early on.</p>
          <p>And your second question was about the employees' bonus and the provisions for that. I think it will be again a low three-digit million euro number that we need for the bonus to be paid out in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just come back on that bonus. Just I think it used to be of the order of 300 million in this sort of pre-crisis period for the full year. Just to get some indication, is that the right kind of number or is it rather as you're saying sort of, more like 100 million, just to get a bit of a feel, because I presume that's a cash payment in the middle of &#x2013; in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a bit early to make a statement on this because you first need to know how the first quarter will arise, and I think then you are able to talk about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, just from the part of that, just to say on 100 million Q4 you're saying, but should we not be thinking about this into next year, if we're seeing the growing &#x2013; you had two years where it was a positive other elimination in '08 and '09, and I guess for norm would be &#x2013; that's a negative number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're referring to the profit elimination, again. So I think I'm expecting the leasing business to grow over the next couple of years because actually as you know we have a strong business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We expect the U.S. market to recover under the strong product momentum we have, especially in this market. Think about the new X3 that will come to the market next year. I think it was actually on the 5 Series and there is more to come for the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>We are expecting a growing business overall and a growing leasing business. And that would mean that the profit elimination is the downside of that, and it will grow. So you'll see a higher value on this side that has to be taken out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Eichiner. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from John Lawson of Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Firstly, Dr. Reithofer, you've been within this 8 to 10% auto return corridor for a couple of quarters now, and don't worry I'm not asking you to raise the target specifically.</p>
          <p>But if I'm correct, you're not fully satisfied yet, are you, with the underlying structural improvement. And I just wondered how, in the light of the very good returns that you're reporting, you're actually keeping the organization motivated and focused on the task ahead?</p>
          <p>How are you telling the management, for instance, where you are relative to where you feel you need to be? Do you have a good metric for explaining where the underlying or structural <mark type="inaudible" /> taken you to? And if you have, I wondered whether you could share that with us please.</p>
          <p>And then a second question which would, I suppose, be for Dr. Eichiner. We're talking a lot about these eliminations on this call. It used to be the case, correct me if I'm wrong, that you said there was around a 30% contribution margin, which was eliminated on the signing of a new lease, which was then retimed over the life of the lease. Is that still a good number or do I understand from your answer to Christian that that 30% contribution margin elimination is no longer enough in the light of the improving profitability of the products? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, John. I think we start in this question with Mr. Eichiner and than Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So actually to talk about this number now in the crisis, I mean, first of all, the range is between 20 and 30%. That is the range of the contribution that we are applying there.</p>
          <p>Now, during the crisis it was clearly more at the lower end, and now we are moving up again back to the upper end. That is what is happening. And we are more or less now in the middle of this movement. That's what I can tell you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You noted that in the report for the third quarter, right? So it's a movement that you haven't made at the end of the second quarter, the change in the contribution margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So in comparison to the second quarter, we improved it by 3% &#x2013; 3 percentage points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Mr. Eichiner. Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked me a really difficult question, I can tell you, but I would like to give you a straightforward answer.</p>
          <p>I mean, my first answer is, our targeted return of an 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the automobile segment is not just for the year 2012. That is, in my opinion, John, a very important statement.</p>
          <p>And we believe &#x2013; and that is as well a very important statement. We believe we have a good chance of achieving roughly this range in subsequent years.</p>
          <p>And then you asked me, and Mr. Reithofer, what is your approach, if I understood you right, to push the company further. I mean, that is exactly what I have done during the last three, four years.</p>
          <p>And from my point of view, and I hope you understand we are definitely on the right track, but we are not there yet. And if you are too early where you would like to be, then it can be that it is more difficult to give the necessary push inside than if you can tell your organization we have still steps to go. From a psychological point of view, where we are at the moment is a very good intermediate step and it is a very good starting point for 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>That is my answer. I hope you can live with it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Yes, so are you halfway through the 4 billion variable cost reduction that you target?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Three quick ones, only the one thing is on the improved end of lease business. Here you talked about a double-digit euro range in the financial services division on the profit line. Maybe you can give here a clearer number and is there only such an effect in Q4?</p>
          <p>The other thing is on tax rate. This is close to 36% in Q3 and also for nine months. Should we assume such a rate also for the whole fiscal year 2010? And another question on electric vehicles, again. You presented the MINI e-scooter in Paris. Maybe you can give us some thoughts about the response in Paris or how this project could go on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, your question about the factor of the leasing business and the extraordinary effect from the terminations is a number around 20 million. So that's what I can tell you to give the right size. And if you look at the tax situation &#x2013; I mean, we always said that the tax rate &#x2013; the effective tax rate should be between 30 and 40%. Actually, we are at 36. I think we will end up in this range. And 36 is still a good number for the fourth quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean, MINI e-scooter Paris Motor Show, my opinion, a very, very good response in the medias. And I think it is a good idea to develop and produce the e-scooter, but will it be the MINI brand? We don't know yet. The decision is still pending. We will give you further information if we have decided what is the right brand for an e-scooter.</p>
