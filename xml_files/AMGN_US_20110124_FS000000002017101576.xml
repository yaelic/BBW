          <p>My name is Christian and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Financial Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers' prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you now begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Christian; good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results Conference Call. Unlike most reporting quarters, we are the first to go this year, ahead of other biopharma companies. The objective of this call is to review our solid performance last year despite the impact of U.S. healthcare reform. We'll also provide a perspective on our growth outlook for 2011.</p>
          <p>2010 was truly a notable year as we received approvable for and launched two very important therapies, Prolia and XGEVA. You'll hear more on these launches during the call together with updates on progress we have made towards advancing our pipeline.</p>
          <p>As we did for the third quarter call, we'll follow a streamlined format for our prepared remarks. I think this format was well appreciated as I received many favorable comments after our last call. In other words, we'll focus only on those comments that provide added clarity on issues outlined in our press release.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to introduce our presenters. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer, who will lead the discussion by providing a strategic overview of our business, as well as comments on the acquisition of BioVex that we announced today. Following Kevin, you'll hear from our CFO, Jon Peacock, who will highlight key aspects of our financial performance during the quarter as well as provide guidance for 2011. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Bradway, will then give you a high-level summary of our global commercial sales, as well as a report on Prolia's commercialization. Our head of R&amp;D, Roger Perlmutter, will conclude our prepared comments by providing a regulatory and pipeline update.</p>
          <p>As is the case in such calls, our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. What it says in summary is that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially.</p>
          <p>So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. It's good to be with you. Before I share my thoughts about our 2010 results and 2011 prospects, I'd like to just take a minute to reflect.</p>
          <p>Each year any large global company in virtually any industry faces a number of uncertainties, and last year was especially fraught for us as we think about just a year ago. I am especially proud and pleased to say that Amgen met our challenges successfully and set the stage for a promising future. Here are just a few of the highlights.</p>
          <p>Prolia and XGEVA were approved after 15 years of effort, over $1.5 billion of investment, and the tireless work of uncounted members of our team. We're proud of this result. I think it's biotechnology at its best, and we look forward to helping patients enjoy the benefit of this set of innovations.</p>
          <p>The bone mets prevention study we announced the results of toward the end of last year, our so called 147 study added to the benefit of XGEVA. Roger will talk more about our regulatory prospects and plans there, but clearly this was a landmark result, and we're proud of it.</p>
          <p>Three, we delivered financially even in the face of tremendous healthcare reform and reimbursement headwinds around the world. We effectively and thoughtfully represented patient interest at a variety of public government sponsored reviews of aspects of our ESA franchise. That continues this year, as we'll talk about in a minute. We advanced our pipeline in many ways.</p>
          <p>We made significant management changes in naming a new Chief Operating Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer. We maintained the highest compliance standards and performance in an increasingly challenging environment.</p>
          <p>And finally, we successfully again represented and defended our intellectual property. 2010 was a superb operational year for Amgen, and I want to thank Amgen's staff worldwide for their efforts. It was truly exceptional.</p>
          <p>Our focus in 2011 is easy to describe, but as always challenging to execute. First, we can't take our eyes off and we won't take our eyes off the core business in all of its aspects. The recent MEDCAC discussions made me proud of our work for patients.</p>
          <p>We need to and will advance Prolia and XGEVA. Prolia is a promising therapy for osteoporosis that is growing. However, predicting the ramp rate of any new technology in any business is challenging. However, our efforts and enthusiasm both are very high. XGEVA is off to a strong start, and we're very optimistic with the 147 study only increasing our confidence.</p>
          <p>We need to and will advance, enlarge and enrich our pipeline. Today's announcement of our BioVex acquisition is indicative of our objectives. Good company, good science, and a potential advance for patients with grievous illness with few good treatment options. We were also thoughtful about using shareholder dollars in this acquisition and balancing risk and reward. By the way, the BioVex acquisition related costs in 2011 are reflected in our guidance that we will share in a moment.</p>
          <p>Next we're going to grow shareholder value by keeping our financial promises, executing a smart strategy well, thoughtful use of our cash, and making our pipeline even stronger. We are hopeful this year as the major overhangs or the mega overhangs of the past recede, this will be possible. While we will never be without challenges and uncertainties, I like our prospects.</p>
          <p>We look forward to on April 21st in New York City at a business review sharing more with you about our plans and prospects and we'll reach out soon to large shareholders to be sure we meet your needs and expectations for that meeting.</p>
          <p>Jon, I'd like to turn it over to you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 5 of the presentation, you'll see that in the fourth quarter, revenues were 1% higher, operating income grew 4%, and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. Bob will take you through the highlights on product sales in a few minutes. Other revenues during the quarter benefited from a milestone payment received from Takeda on initiation of AMG 386 Phase III trial for ovarian cancer.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were 1% lower in the quarter versus a year ago. There were a number of factors contributing to this. First, cost of sales were higher by 6%. This was primarily due to inventory write-offs from the Enbrel voluntary recall and some higher bulk material costs flowing through inventory. Research and development costs were 5% lower, primarily due to a licensing fee payment to Array BioPharma that we paid in the fourth quarter of last year. SG&amp;A was held broadly in line with 2009.</p>
          <p>The adjusted tax rate was 15.5% compared to 18.8% for the year. This was due to the full-year benefit of the R&amp;D tax credit that was enacted late in the year and fully recognized in the fourth quarter. The low tax rate that you see in the fourth quarter of 2009 was due to a change in revenue and expense mix during that quarter. Adjusted earnings per share at 1.17 was up $0.12, helped by share buybacks.</p>
          <p>In our GAAP earnings, you'll see we also took an impairment charge of $118 million related to the transfer of our Fremont manufacturing facility to Boehringer Ingelheim. Bob will talk more about the operational impact of this transaction.</p>
          <p>Turning to the full year on page 6, total revenues were 3% higher compared to 2009. Other revenues grew 35%, primarily due to milestone payments received from GSK for the Prolia approval in Europe and from Takeda for the Vectibix approval in Japan. Operating expenses increased 4% compared to 2009. The main drivers here were cost of sales, which again, were up 6% on the year primarily due to higher inventory write-offs from the EPOGEN, Procrit and Enbrel recalls and from some higher bulk material costs.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A costs were 5% higher due to our investment in the Prolia launch during the year and some higher litigation costs. Research and development costs were broadly in line with 2009.</p>
          <p>The adjusted tax rate on the year was 18.8%, compared to 16.9% in 2009. Last year's rate benefited from tax settlements that were concluded during the year. Adjusted earnings per share was 5.21, up $0.30 or up 6%.</p>
          <p>The key balance sheet and cash flow movements are shown on page 7. Our cash balance increased by $4 billion to $17.4 billion. Our net cash balance increased by $1.5 billion, as we issued debt of $2.5 billion during the year in anticipation of paying down a $2.5 billion convertible, which matures in February.</p>
          <p>In 2011, the acquisition of BioVex, that Roger will talk more about, will result in a payment of $425 million to BioVex shareholders on closing. Further payments of up to $575 million will be made upon the achievement of certain defined regulatory and sales milestones in future years.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was $5.8 billion for the year, compared to 6.3 in 2009. This reduction was predominantly due to the timing of U.S. tax payments over the two-year period. Capital expenditures were held at $600 million, slightly above 2009. And finally, the total cost of shares repurchased in 2010 was $3.8 billion, compared to 3.2 billion in 2009. The benefit of this program can be seen in our adjusted EPS results for the year.</p>
          <p>Page 8 provides our guidance for 2011. We expect to deliver revenues between $15.1 billion and $15.5 billion. Our plan has assumed a euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate in the low 1.30s, and we're not assuming any significant movement from this. We expect adjusted EPS to be between $5 and $5.20. This reflects total U.S. healthcare reform costs which we estimate at $400 to $500 million in 2011, and that includes the new federal excise fee, which we estimate will be between $150 and $200 million.</p>
          <p>This compares to total healthcare reform costs in 2010 of approximately $200 million. Our guidance overall reflects a plan to grow adjusted EPS before the impact of the federal excise fee.</p>
          <p>One other factor in our guidance is an expectation that we will invest more in research and development in 2011. This reflects an increased number of Phase III programs, the BioVex acquisition that we announced today, and a step-up in our discovery research investments. This will be partly offset by an expected improvement in cost of sales in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 adjusted tax rate we expect to be between 19% and 20%, and finally we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million, similar to the last year.</p>
          <p>So now I'll hand it over to Bob to review commercial operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jon. I'll provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the quarter and year followed by some high level comments on a number of prospective issues.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our third quarter call, the product-by-product details are contained in our appendix in the press release, and I'll not present that material here, but Jim Daly and I are available to answer questions about the product specific slides during the Q&amp;A period.</p>
          <p>For the year-on-year fourth quarter comparison, our global product sales remained relatively unchanged, which was a function of several offsetting factors. First in the U.S., Enbrel and Filgrastim delivered 3% and 4% growth respectively, and globally our more recently launched products including Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate, Prolia, and XGEVA grew $82 million or 29%.</p>
          <p>EPOGEN sales declined by $112 million or 16% during the quarter. Within the EPOGEN decline, there are several important factors, however, to bear in mind. First it's worth pointing out that roughly half of the sales decline was due to non-demand related items such as changes in wholesaler inventory level and changes to accounting estimates.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the sales decline was due to demand reflecting a decline in dose utilization, partially offset by patient population growth. As we shared with you on our third quarter call, we expected to see this dose decline as providers began in the fourth quarter to refine their treatment practices ahead of the implementation of the ESRD bundle which went into effect at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>For the full year, our global product sales grew by $309 million or 2%, which was mainly due to growth from our newer products, which grew by $278 million for the year and from increased Filgrastim sales.</p>
          <p>I'll make one final comment on our 2010 performance, which is to note that U.S. healthcare reform decreased sales by $65 million for the quarter and $198 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2011, you've just heard Jon provide our revenue guidance. It's important to note that we are anticipating several factors will shape product sales in 2011. We can't rule out further impact to Aranesp from the ESA REMS and I'll speak more about that in a few moments.</p>
          <p>With respect to EPOGEN, we expect further moderate dose declines as providers refine their treatment practices to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. As we have stated before, we believe the ESRD quality improvement program is important in preserving access to important medicines for patients on dialysis and demonstrates a commitment by CMS to these principles.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 guidance assumes a moderate impact on EPOGEN dose, front loaded to the first half of the year, and what we are seeing to date is consistent with that assumption. Our guidance does not reflect a dramatic change in utilization for EPOGEN or Aranesp as a result of any major new regulatory or reimbursement changes. I know there's a great deal of interest in this, and we'll obviously keep you informed on utilization patterns as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>And finally for 2011, we're excited by the denosumab opportunity. Turning to slide 11, I'll speak more about the Prolia and XGEVA launches.</p>
          <p>We continue to make steady progress with Prolia. We're encouraged by the trajectory particularly that we saw in November, December. In the U.S., we estimate that approximately 9,000 physicians have now ordered or prescribed Prolia and 40% of these have placed additional orders. Primary care physicians represent about 60% of our total prescribers, and it's worth noting that approximately two-thirds of our targeted rheumatologists have prescribed Prolia at this point.</p>
          <p>Both specialists and primary care physicians are predominantly using buy-and-bill fulfillment to provide Prolia with low patient out of pocket costs. We expect that the primary care prescribing base will expand as various prescription drug plans announce their Medicare Part D coverage for Prolia, and we expect this to happen &#x2013; to be announced in the first quarter and to be implemented in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Outside the U.S., we launched and secured full reimbursement in nine countries in 2010, including the U.K. and Australia, which are known for their rigorous reimbursement policies. In 2011, we expect an additional 19 launches to provide growth outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>Turning to XGEVA, we're excited about the opportunity this important medicine provides for patients, and we're seeing usage come from both oncologists and urologists and we're encouraged by the early signs from the launch. As you know, however, we had only a few days in which to promote the product in 2010, so naturally we'll have more to say about this in April with our first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 12, this slide displays our actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs in blue are largely a result of wholesaler inventory build-up and depletion, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red lines indicate average weekly sales, and these lines exclude returns and discount accrual true-ups as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons.</p>
          <p>The drop in weekly average sales for Aranesp from 2009 to 2010, as I'm sure you're all aware, is due primarily to a decline in the overall ESA segment, reflecting more conservative use of ESAs in both oncology and nephrology.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the average weekly sales for Aranesp stabilized in the sequential quarters of 2010 as the impact from the more conservative use of ESAs was fully incorporated into treatment practices. However, we can't rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales going forward as a result of the REMS rollout or from any major new regulatory reimbursement changes.</p>
          <p>Finally, to comment on manufacturing, we announced earlier this month that we had entered into a transaction with Boehringer Ingelheim through which they have acquired our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. This move is consistent with our oft-stated desire to optimize our manufacturing supply chain and to improve our efficient and safe supply of medicines to patients. This move was made possible by productivity improvements across the rest of our network.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Roger, who'll talk about our research and development progress in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob.</p>
          <p>Well as Kevin has already noted and shown on slide 14, the fourth quarter was an especially important one for Amgen research and development with the approval of XGEVA for the treatment of patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. This approval was based on three large randomized blinded active comparator controlled studies that showed that XGEVA, administered once monthly by subcutaneous injection, was superior to the then standard of care, Zometa, in reducing the frequency of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases, secondary breast or prostate cancer and was not inferior in reducing the frequency of these events in patients with other solid tumors or with multiple myeloma.</p>
          <p>XGEVA was approved by the FDA on a priority review basis just six months after filing. The XGEVA file is also under review by the European Medicines Agency and in other jurisdictions worldwide. All of these reviews are proceeding appropriately.</p>
          <p>In December we also obtained top-line results from our 147 study, which asked whether administration of XGEVA reduced the risk of skeletal metastases in patients with prostate cancer who had high risk of sustaining a first metastasis to bone. The successful completion of this study provides for the first time, to my knowledge, clinical evidence supporting the view that tumors must activate the RANK Ligand axis to optimally penetrate bone.</p>
          <p>There's still a great deal to learn about the results of the 147 study, however, our more detailed analysis, which includes a variety of sensitivity studies, confirms and extends what we had seen in the top line data summary that we disclosed last month. We will meet with the FDA to discuss this study in the very near future and at present expect to file for approval of this new indication in the first half of 2011. Of course we're continuing to study denosumab in a variety of other settings, both in patients with cancer and in those with other forms of bone loss. I'll have more to say about these studies during first earnings calls.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we also completed our filing for Vectibix in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the first and second line setting. These filings include specific reference to the importance of limiting therapy to those patients whose tumors contain only wild type, that is un-mutated, versions of the KRAS gene and were timed to permit simultaneous filing of a diagnostic test for mutations in KRAS, which we completed with our partner QIAGEN. The data from our filings are already under review in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>Also noted on slide 14, we have revised our view of the timing of completion of the Sensipar EVOLVE study based on additional scrutiny of event rate data. You'll recall that the EVOLVE study assesses long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who are treated with Sensipar or Mimpara in Europe as compared to those receiving placebo. Extrapolation of the current event rate for this fully enrolled trial indicates that we will not achieve a sufficient number of events until 2012.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 15, we also made substantial progress in the fourth quarter with respect to the advancement of our mid-stage pipeline. We enrolled the first patients in our Phase III study of AMG 386, an angiopoietin antagonist peptibody for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. Promising Phase II data in the same setting were discussed at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meetings last June. We also began initiating sites for our Phase III study of AMG 479, an IGF-1 receptor antagonist antibody used in combination with gemcitabine in the setting of pancreatic cancer. Phase II data for this program were also presented at ASCO last year.</p>
          <p>Also on slide 15, I note that we now expect to complete the Phase III MONET-1 study in the first half of this year. You'll recall that this study asks whether daily treatment with motesanib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor improves overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are simultaneously receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin therapies.</p>
          <p>Lastly on slide 16, today we announced that we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire BioVex, a small privately held company based in Wilburn, Massachusetts. For more than a decade, BioVex has pursued the development of a cytolytic, live virus vaccine called OncoVEXGM-CSF, based on molecular modification of a proprietary strain of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1. The virus has been engineered to permit relatively selective replication in cancer cells and has also been modified to defeat a crucial mechanism that Herpes Simplex Virus uses to evade immune detection. This change, coupled with the expression of an embedded (GM-CSF) cassette, improves immune recognition of tumor cells in and around the site of virus injection.</p>
          <p>Clinical studies have demonstrated that injection of this virus into tumors causes direct tumor cell lysis and also stimulates immune destruction of distant tumor cells. These observations led to the initiation of two Phase III studies, both under special protocol assessment with the FDA, one in patients with malignant melanoma and a second in patients with head and neck cancer. The melanoma study in particular is more than 90% enrolled. I will have a great deal more to say about this program and about many of our other programs during our business review meeting in April.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. We'd like to turn it over now for a question and answer opportunity. So, Arvind, if you could kind of lay out the ground rules there, that'd be good.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. You know, just a question on OncoVEX. Obviously we have not had a lot of time to look at this BioVex, but just cursorily looking at ClinicalTrials.gov, it looks like the melanoma trial has a response rate primary end point. And again just thinking about the other therapy in that setting that used I think overall survival as a primary end point, can you maybe talk about your thoughts as you looked at this asset on the viability of the endpoint that they're using and how you kind of are looking at this going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, it's Roger. The response rate is actually a durable response rate, that is a response rate that is maintained either partial or complete response over a period of six months. This was a response &#x2013; an endpoint that was agreed to after discussion with the FDA under special protocol assessment. It's important to note that the patient population being studied here is quite different from patient populations that are being studied with other agents that you're referring to.</p>
          <p>And as I say, we'll have a lot more to talk about after this deal formally closes and when we discuss it at the business review. But suffice it to say that the results of administration of this vaccine are very impressive from the Phase II studies, we don't know of course about Phase III, BioVex has presented some of these data in public forums, and as you kind of look at it, I think you'll probably get comfortable with the fact that there really is a dramatic effect on tumors both proximal and distal lesions as a result of administration of this virus. With time we'll find out how significant that really is.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. The pricing of Prolia is substantially cheaper in Europe compared to the U.S.  Can you comment on XGEVA pricing assumptions, whether you have similar pricing power in the U.S., or is it going to be similarly discounted such as Prolia?</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for leaving so much time for questions too. Hey, Roger, I have to ask you, what did you mean if you might, what did you mean that the data on the d-mab [denosumab] prevention trial "confirm and extend top line data"? Was there symptomatic benefit or not? Is that something that you'd be willing to help us out with at this point?</p>

          <p>Mark, it's &#x2013; understandably when you go in and get the top line data, you have just the results of primary key secondary end points and a few of the adverse experience reports. As you dig more deeply into the clinical study and prepare the final clinical study report, you get a lot of information that looks at sensitivities, geographic regions, it looks at different characteristics of the patients, and of course that looks at various aspects of clinical presentation including some of those that you mentioned. And we'll have a chance to talk about those in great detail. Needless to say, I don't want to jeopardize publication of front line journal by presenting data in advance, but I did want to make plain to everyone that what we see is more than supportive of what we had released on the top line.</p>

          <p>Yes, so in answer to your first question, yes the EPS guidance does anticipate the buybacks that we plan during this year which will be certainly at a lower level than 2010.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we have estimated at this point what we believe will be the impact of the Puerto Rico tax legislation. It's reflected in our guidance overall. We don't think it will be material to our financial results, but at this stage, but I think as you probably know, the credibility ruling by the IRS has not yet been issued, but so we are assuming that the impact will not overall be material, and it is reflected in our guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Question for you on EPO. Obviously the sequential trends in the fourth quarter do reflect lower utilization, but maybe it would be helpful if you could review some of the offsets to the decline that you think will help moderate the franchise in 2011 with respect to maybe pricing or market growth or even sort of minimum thresholds for purchasing for some of the providers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff. This is Jim. I would just first reiterate what Bob indicated that half of the 16% is unrelated to demand, so we're looking at business adjustments and inventory changes. So if you look at the demand portion, it's really quite consistent with what we anticipated.</p>
          <p>As we indicated in the third quarter call, we had about a 4% year-over-year decline. We think we have probably a high single digit decline in the fourth quarter, and as we look at the external Street consensus for EPOGEN, it implies a mid-teens decline in dose offset partially by growth in patients and growth in price. And historically we have seen a patient growth rate of about 3%, and we have been taking about a 2% price increase.</p>
          <p>So as we look at that consensus, as we also look at what our large customers are indicating about their intentions, our internal plans are generally consistent with the Street consensus.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I wanted to ask a more strategic question on cash deployment. I guess first off, could you clarify of your cash balance what percent is ex-U.S., and can you talk a little bit more about your ex-U.S. M&amp;A strategy, whether the potential for repatriation would cause you to think differently there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Jon talk about your second question. Let me take the bigger one on. We think that cash stranded offshore does not does not help the U.S. economy, if that's part of your question. Certainly if repatriation happened at some acceptable consideration, that would be positive from our point of view. However, given that the likelihood of that is probably not high, we anticipate that the offshore cash will remain. We're trying to buy, as I think BioVex demonstrates, high quality companies. We're not trying to buy high quality companies in a certain place, per se.</p>
          <p>However, obviously if all of the stars lined up just right in having an offshore company that met all of our standards, that would be financially attractive given where the cash is. But I don't want you to imagine that our M&amp;A strategy is guided by fundamentally a geographic cast. It's not. It's guided by trying to find companies that are &#x2013; or product opportunities &#x2013; that have the kind of characteristics that BioVex does. Sometimes those will be in the United States, sometimes otherwise. But we're trying to buy the right product opportunities here. And, Jon, you might comment on the percent cash offshore and U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think without giving you specific numbers, the large majority of our cash is clearly held offshore, and we try to use our U.S. cash efficiently to both return cash to shareholders and to reinvest it in the business. I think you should assume that the large majority of the cash that we retain on our balance sheet is offshore cash.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Another question for Jon. Psychologically, how do you view utilization of free cash flow beyond 2011? Concomitantly, is it safe for us to use Amgen's five-year average historic utilization of free cash flow for share repurchases as a ballpark proxy for a return of shareholders &#x2013; cash to shareholders going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we have done in the past is to maintain our balance sheet within the constraints of an A rating, a single A rating at least. I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future. And, you know, we'll maintain our cash to ensure we have the flexibility we think we need to make acquisitions like the BioVex acquisition, but we'll also within the constraints of the single A rating, we'll continue to return cash to shareholders. So, you know, the form in which we do that we'll review and get back to you in due course on that point of buybacks and dividends, but overall the mix between reserving cash to retain strategic flexibility to grow the business in a good way and the balance we return to shareholders, don't expect a major change in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I want to reiterate what Jon just said. We seek to use our balance sheet flexibility to grow the company by making intelligent acquisitions when they become available. It's not that the money is burning a hole in our pocket. It is not. But obviously the highest and best strategic use of that cash is to redeploy it in the in-license, M&amp;A and the pipeline-enriching and top-line growing sphere. The facts are that those kind of opportunities are not many in number, and they happen in lumpy kind of ways.</p>
          <p>But I want to assure all the shareholders that we are more than thoughtful and aggressive in trying to be in that mode. And I think BioVex is relatively small, but significant as an indicator of the kind of thing we're trying to do.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a question about Prolia. Could you talk a little bit about what changes you might anticipate in the marketplace after you get Medicare Part D reimbursement? Specifically, would you envisage that either pharmacists would be able to administer the drug or that you could change the label such that patients could self-administer the drug and also how do you think it will be distributed to the patients, through a traditional retail pharmacy or specialty pharmacy? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff. This is Jim. Geoff, we would imagine that the vast majority of patients who receive the product under Part D we would pick up Prolia at the pharmacy and bring it back to the physician's office for administration. That's the way that the product has been studied clinically, and we think that's the most prudent way to administer.</p>
          <p>Now, as you indicate, we do have several large retail chains who are interested in administering Prolia at their facilities, and we're working very closely with them to enable that. But in terms of the major change we expect to see from Part D coverage is greater expansion of primary care prescribing. As Bob indicated, we have 9,000 total prescribers, about 6,000 of those are primary care doctors, and we would see Part D offering opportunity for more primary care physicians to make Prolia available to their patients.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, question is on R&amp;D spending. If I follow the guidance for bottom line earnings appropriately I'm looking at an increase in spend in R&amp;D. I'm wondering, one, if you can provide some brackets on what spending might be in 2011; and, two, it looks like 2011 may be the first year in maybe the last five or six that Amgen is actually increasing spending. Can somebody talk about broadly your thoughts on R&amp;D investment relative to other things you can do with cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk generally, then I'll turn it over to Roger specifically. That's pretty good quick math, and you're right from an intellectual and factual point of view.</p>
          <p>First of all, highest level, we have a belief that if you don't invest enough money in R&amp;D, you can't succeed in this business. We'd also say that simply investing money in R&amp;D doesn't guarantee anything either, but not investing enough will put you in a bad spot. So that's first.</p>
          <p>Second, we have had a very productive, over the last ten years, research and development function any way that we want to measure it, numbers of products, innovation, number of molecules advancing into human subjects. We also noticed that after we had the challenges of 2007 and ESA, we have tended to leave the discovery research area a bit less well funded than we otherwise would have given the amount of money that went into clinical trials.</p>
          <p>And Roger and I both believe that we need to make a meaningful increase in discovery research. It's not &#x2013; it's not the major part of the R&amp;D line item, so a relatively small amount of money can make a big difference. So we're absolutely committed to innovation and R&amp;D is the heart of the company. And we're going to continue making strong investment. Roger, you're the guy who is going to spend it. That was just the banker's view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The banker's view is pretty close to the R&amp;D guy's view, I'd say. Eric, an important thing to remember is that we've had some pretty large Phase III studies that have delivered important results, but those studies don't immediately go to zero. There are open label extensions associated with these studies. They're large pharmaco business programs. So we continue to support those products for which we have already gained registration while we are also advancing a number of really important Phase III programs, new molecules that I highlighted a little bit on the call and that we'll talk about more in April.</p>
          <p>So that adds quite a lot to the expense. We think it's extremely well justified. We're doing the right thing in terms of trying to really make meaningful impact on patients with &#x2013; who suffer from grievous illness. And as Kevin mentioned, it's important to make sure that discovery research is adequately funded so that we'll be in a position to pursue a next set of important clinical trials some years down the road.</p>
          <p>So that's where we stand. There is a significant increase this year, we're pleased to be able to do it, and we think we can really, really use that investment.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just wondering in terms of XGEVA and its current utilizations, can you say whether bone scans are being required in advance of XGEVA use? We've heard that that isn't always being required, and just wondering whether the 147 data could position the drug under the current label for patients in terms of SRE prevention if there is not a requirement of a bone scan. The short question is really patients with rising PSAs where you presume there are micro mets, could they be encompassed within the current label?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the &#x2013; you tend to get &#x2013; from a regulatory point of view, you tend to get of course exactly what you studied in your Phase III trial. And what we studied for 147 were patients who were at high risk but did not yet have clinical metastases. Now, any patient who already has evident metastases judged by bone scan or whatever the criteria, is at risk for skeletal related events. And in that population, we have already demonstrated that we can dramatically reduce these skeletal related events and there's already an indication for that. So the sense is that the 147 data, and again it must be reviewed by the agency, will simply expand the group of patients for whom XGEVA is an appropriate therapy. Obviously there are a lot of &#x2013; both regulatory and peer groups that need to opine, but that's the general sense that one gets from looking at the total set of data.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. The reimbursement landscape for XGEVA is outstanding on the Medicare front, 100% of Medicare carriers have confirmed coverage on Part D. 91% of commercial lives have coverage. We have reports of only three plans with prior authorizations that are more restrictive than the label, and that is a failure on an IV bisphosphonate and no reports of requiring the bone scan, although that would not be a huge barrier to access to the drug.</p>

So we don't see anything so far which is different from what we have embraced in the guidance we have provided you and in the comments that we have made in the past about bundling. So we're expecting a further modest decline in dose.

          <p>Joel, it's Roger. It's hard to control these kinds of studies, because it's kind of &#x2013; it's almost a procedure. I mean, you inject the virus directly into the tumor. In part, the Phase III study was designed to address that problem by controlling with (GM-CSF) systemic administration. Remember, the virus has a (GM-CSF) expression cassette embedded within it.</p>
          <p>In terms of confidence, well, again, the BioVex Group has had the opportunity to present a lot of their data in a number of different public forums including most recently at the J.P. Morgan meeting in San Francisco. I think when you look at patient responses there, these are not tumors that go away by themselves. What we can't know is the magnitude and durability of the effect over a long-term, and that of course is what is being addressed in Phase III. I'll tell you my sense is, I'm extremely optimistic, and that's of course an important part of why we proceeded with the transaction.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Bob, your comments on XGEVA, that it's going to be a meaningful contributor in 2011. Just wanted to get your comfort level relative to Street expectations for the drug? And are there any lessons we can learn or apply from the Prolia launch, or are they just completely different settings and markets?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to comment on the street consensus at this point for XGEVA, but I think it's important to note that the very different disease states, very different clinical profile, we're very pleased with the label that we have for XGEVA. We're delighted with the clinical results, which Roger alluded to earlier. Superiority demonstrated in three Phase III pivotal clinical trials, and we're very encouraged with the reception so far in both the oncology and urology communities.</p>
          <p>So again, I know there's a lot of interest in this topic, and we look forward to being able to give you a little bit more detail when we're together in April, but off the back of very few days in 2010, it's probably premature to make too many claims for XGEVA at this point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Just quickly we saw that you had recently changed the co-pay assistance program for Neulasta. Could you help us understand what drove the decision and how &#x2013; what impact you expect from it going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Actually, we based the co-pay assistance program for Neulasta, Nplate and XGEVA where we have capped the patient out of pocket at $25. We think that's the right thing to do to ensure broad access for very important products.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I want to come back to XGEVA. So from your current market dynamics, can you tell if the use of the drug today is mainly in breast cancer or prostate cancer? If it is use for prostate cancer patient, are those mainly given by urologist or mainly still refer to hematologists? Because typically urologists don't really treat SIE, I wonder whether because of the drugs, the administration, whether urologists have started to embrace this drug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still very early days, so again at this point it's probably premature to get into too much detail. But I tried to give you a sense from my remarks that we're pleased by the reception in both from the oncologists and the urologists, and you're right to note that urologists haven't had an alternative like this available historically, and I think that's part of why they have embraced it as readily as they have. But again as we get into the business review in April, we look forward to providing the appropriate detail on what we have learned by then in the first four months of the launch.</p>
