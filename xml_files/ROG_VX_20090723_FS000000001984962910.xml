        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, real pleasure to be back here in London, especially on a day where we could publish such excellent results as this morning.</p>
          <p>Now what has been really the drivers for the results in the first six month?  First of all it is due to the momentum we have in the underlying business. Second, and very importantly, we have closed the Genentech transaction faster than we probably anticipated when we met the last time at the year end at very attractive financing conditions. And we have progressed very well on the integration and I will come back to it.</p>
          <p>We also had some tailwinds from Tamiflu, but let me put it into perspective. The Tamiflu impact on the sales growth is only three percentage points on a Group level. So even if we take Tamiflu out of the numbers we would still have grown substantially above the market in both divisions.</p>
          <p>Also Tamiflu is only one of 11 products in our Pharma portfolio, which achieved now more than one billion Swiss francs on an annual basis. Yes, Tamiflu is important for us, but it is by no means the main factor for the good results we could present to you this morning.</p>
          <p>As we have seen, both divisions outperforming their respective markets, both divisions twice as fast as their market, Pharmaceuticals 11%, if we correct for Tamiflu, 7% and the Diagnostics Division up with 7%.</p>
          <p>On the profit side we posted a 20% increase in operating profits before exceptional items and likewise a 20% increase on core EPS, again, at constant exchange rates. You see that the net income has come down by 29% due to exceptional items.  Erich, will cover those in more detail, but they are primarily related to the Genentech integration and again primarily related to the fields of manufacturing and administration.</p>
          <p>Now, let me spend a couple of words on our strategy, then come back to the Genentech integration before I hand over to my colleague. As you know, our strategy is firmly focused on innovation. It is firmly focused on our two core businesses, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, and we remain convinced that this is the right way to go forward.</p>
          <p>First of all, as we all know, there's a huge unmet medical need out there. We know that two-thirds of the diseases cannot be treated at all today and we know that those diseases which can be treated, often the therapies are mediocre. There's a huge medical need out there.</p>
          <p>And I have no doubt that if you are able to come up with innovative medicines, innovative diagnostics, there will be a demand for it.  Society will also be willing to pay for such solutions.  There's a potential for us to capture this value. There is a future for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
          <p>Of course, it only works out if we actually come up with those innovative solutions. That is and will remain to be the backbone of our industry and that is very much at the core of what we stand for at Roche.  And we believe that with our decentralized management approach we have the right management model to increase the chances for such scientific breakthroughs.</p>
          <p>It has a lot to do how we deal with our external partners, the external innovation we bring into our Group and it also has a lot to do in terms of how we organize our sales within the Group.  And I think a big part of the good progress we made with the Genentech integration is actually due to the fact how we manage research and early development at Genentech now being part of the family.</p>
          <p>Whilst we believe in diversity as to research, early development and as we believe in a decentralized management approach, this early part of the value chain, I'm equally convinced that we need to be very productive, very efficient if it comes to the worldwide execution at a later stage of the value chain. If it comes to late stage development, if it comes to global marketing, manufacturing and commercialization of our products in the various markets worldwide.</p>
          <p>Now let me just touch on the U.S. since there's so much talk about the U.S. healthcare reform, what impact does it have on us and what areas are less of a concern for Roche.  Now, first of all, if we talk about the declining rates of growth in the U.S. and if you look at the underlying reasons for that if we look into the future, why the growth rate in the U.S. is coming down as it is, it is very much related to products coming off patent.</p>
          <p>One of the key drivers for the slow growth in the U.S. is generics replacing brands which come off patent and then I think it is important to realize that Roche has a long patent protection for our key brands and you see a number of them on the slide on the screen.  Now what is really crucial for us in the U.S. is how the legislation on bio-similars will turn out because we are and I cannot stress this enough, we are now as an integrated company by far, by far, the biggest biotech company in the world. And as such, legislation on bio-similars and follow-on biologics is crucial for the long-term prospects of this company.</p>
          <p>It is less relevant actually in the shorter term because our patent life are protecting us for the near and the medium term future. But it is very important for us if we think into the long-term.</p>
          <p>Now, as you know, there is no legislation yet, but our view is clear, bio-similars are not generic. They are similar, they are different and as such clinical trials are required to ensure the safety of American citizens. We believe that we need reasonable exclusivity periods to protect IP and we are also of the firm opinion that there shouldn't be any interchangeability with bio-similars as soon as those products come to the market.  Now it's difficult to predict where we will land, when we will land in terms of the new legislation, but from all the discussion I follow at that very moment it's going into the right direction.</p>
          <p>Now, the U.S. certainly remains the biggest market for us for years to come. At the same time and that it's not different in the picture versus our peers, emerging markets are playing an increasing role. Perhaps, on the U.S., just surprised by my own slides here, let me also make a comment on Medicare. It's so irrelevant for us that I forget to talk about it, but since I see the slide now let me spend a word on it.</p>
          <p>As you know, there is a discussion between the authorities and the industry on discounts. There is a discussion on how big will the price pressure be in the Medicare/Medicaid system and you have to realize that this discussion is really about part b.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at our portfolio, about 50% of our products in the U.S. are under Medicare, but only 10% are administered through part b. The rest is part of part b injectables, infusions. So that means that the potential impact on any discount price pressure, whatever there may come, is literally of no relevance for us. The impact is immaterial.</p>
          <p>Back to the emerging market, as for the whole of the industry, also for us, emerging markets play an increasing role and you see here the relative share of the emerging markets relative to our business. And you can see that this share has increased over the last five years and it accounts today already for 20% of our business. So that is pretty substantial and an even over proportional part of the growth is spanning from the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to point out at this picture is that it is relevant also for our peers, but I would say our approach is distinct. And whilst it is a matter of volume, many of our peers, in our case I would argue it's a matter of value.</p>
          <p>And you see here with the example of Herceptin that actually the crisis in the E7 countries, in the E7 emerging markets, it's very similar to the average of the prices in the most developed countries. So it is not only in our view about volume.  If we talk about emerging markets, it's very much about value and it proves that it's focused on innovation, on true medical differentiation that not only play in the developed market, it's very much also plays to our benefit in the emerging market.</p>
          <p>Now, let me shift to Genentech. As you know, we have closed the transaction end of March and we have made enormous progress in only a very, very short period of time. In only three months we have completed the integration planning.  That involves the design of the new organizational structure, that has involved the announcement of all our key positions.</p>
          <p>And very importantly, we also designed the decision process for those functions which are now organized on a global level, in particular in global marketing and global development, so that we aligned the two organizations in those specific fields. As you can see, we will complete and we are on track for completion of the integration by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a quick summary on the key functions as we integrate Genentech into the Roche Group. And let me reiterate again, that it is a very specific situation that those two companies are coming together in so far is that our two businesses has been very complementary. As you know, Roche has focused outside of the U.S., Genentech was focused in the US. We covered within the U.S. different franchises.</p>
          <p>And as a result of that we said from the onset that we would not have any disruption on the U.S. commercial side, the sales force was untouched. It helps a lot on the integration and it also proved to be a very important factor of keeping the business momentum during this time of the integration.</p>
          <p>Equally and that speaks to this decentralized management approach I touched upon and that speaks to our belief in diversity, we kept Research and Early Development of Genentech as an independent unit. Richard Scheller, the head of Research and Early Development at Genentech, is today with us and I think he's directly reporting to myself. And I believe that this approach is one of the reasons why we could retain the key talent and basically continue business as usual.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned for global development and global marketing, we had to align the decision making processes across the two organizations.  That was probably the most complex part of the whole integration.  That was probably the area where we spent most of the time to come up with a new portfolio, a governance structure.  This process is completed and we're already working along the new decision making processes.</p>
          <p>The two areas that we really looked out for cost synergies has been manufacturing and administration. Bill will cover this in more detail, but you will see that we have streamlined our operations both in the U.S. and worldwide and also on the administrative side by putting together our U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, closing down our headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey. We have an opportunity to increase our productivity, to increase operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>As we go forward into 2009, as we look into 2010, what are the key priorities?  Certainly the Genentech integration as we enhance innovation, as we leverage the commercial source in the U.S. and as we deliver the synergies.</p>
          <p>On the product side the aim is to remain unchanged. We will maximum our oncology portfolio and we will grow inflammation, in particular, with launching Actemra in the U.S. and driving it in Europe where we already launched it in the first market.</p>
          <p>On the financial side it is very much about driving operational efficiency. It is very much about implementing those potential cost synergies which we gained by streamlining the two organizations and to deliver consistent EPS growth and a strong cash flow as we go forward. That brings me right to the outlook for this year and for next year.</p>
          <p>For 2009 we expect in spite of the expiry of CellCept in the U.S., you know that patent has expired in May, in spite of the CellCept expiry we expect a high single-digit growth for both Pharma and the Group as a whole. And we expect Diagnostics to continue to perform well above the market.</p>
          <p>On the synergies side we are particularly ahead of our original hope on estimates. And we realized those synergies considerably faster than we would have originally expected. We see 300 million already coming through this year, 800 million next year so that we then have synergies of one billion Swiss francs on an ongoing basis, on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>Core EPS growth is expected to grow double-digit both for 2009 and into 2010 and very importantly from a cash point of view we will return to a net cash position by 2015 and we will also maintain our dividend outlook.</p>
          <p>Genentech has been our top priority during the first six months and I've already touched on the importance of innovation.  I have touched on the importance of Genentech Research and Early Development and since Richard Scheller, who is a former Member of Executive Committee in Genentech and who was responsible for Research Discovery at Genentech, is today with us in his new function as Head of Genentech Research and Early Development and as a member of the Corporate Executive Committee.  Richard, I thought it would be a good idea if you just take this opportunity to say a few words and introduce yourself. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, Severin mentioned I'm head of the new function Research and Early Development at Genentech. And as the transaction was proposed it was extremely interesting to us in research at Genentech that many people spoke with tremendous authority that if the transaction closed all of the terrific scientists would leave.</p>
          <p>These people were not associated with Genentech or Roche and I don't know in particular why they thought that, but since the transaction has closed we've created the new unit that Severin mentioned.  We call it GRED and I'm happy inform you that actually none of the scientists have left and that people are at home working. They're extremely engaged and we hope to continue the terrific tradition that Genentech has had in bringing innovative products to the market.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact there's actually two things about the new structure that are very exciting and energizing for us in research at Genentech. The first thing is now research and Phase I and Phase II are now under one roof. So this has brought the early stages of clinical development with the research group, which provides us terrific opportunities to exchange between the clinic and the research labs in a way that's even closer now than it was in the past.</p>
          <p>The second thing that's very exciting to us is that we share at Genentech the passion that Roche shares for personalized healthcare. And the fact that Roche has the Diagnostic Division brings us opportunities to make sure that we are able when necessary and when the opportunity presents itself to launch a diagnostic along with our new molecular entities in a way where there are greater opportunities now than there were in the past.</p>
          <p>So the simple message is the Genentech research and innovation engine is intact, it's functioning, it's vigorous and I'll do my best to bring new products to the market in the near future as we would have as a standalone company. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, Richard. It's a pleasure having you with us. Also a pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, to take you into the first half results.</p>
          <p>I hope some of you have now had a chance to read the copious charts and information that we've shared with you as has become traditional, but let's try and bring some of that alive and just if we highlight some of the key dimensions that are playing out here. I'll cover the results, a short update on the integration and then a bit of an outlook.</p>
          <p>Starting then with the overall sales as you've seen, quarter one outside of Tamiflu, 7%, quarter two outside of Tamiflu, 7%. So the momentum, the underlying momentum of the business and the key brand continues.</p>
          <p>We are at well above market and when you add in Tamiflu it's twice world market, so we're growing out at the present time. What you will have seen from the results is that eight out of the top ten products are growing, 14 out of the top 20 products are growing. So it is a strength and breadth and in depth. It's not a one horse race.</p>
          <p>We've also clearly established ourselves as the number one in biotech and some of you may or may not have seen though it caused a little bit of a stir when we actually announced in the United States that we would move out of pharma and we would just concentrate on the bio organization as the industry trade association for it because with 65% of our revenues now from strictly pure biotechnology, that is our more natural home and our more natural partner. So a number of things that have also been happening here that are behind these figures.</p>
          <p>Good growth around the world and our colleagues in Japan have been announcing also excellent growth outside of the government sales of Tamiflu in that country. They're growing at 11% and this is really a result of some of the new interventions from Tarceva, Avastin, growing, Actemra, growing nicely.</p>
          <p>So they're also doing a good job there and really a very satisfying first half all around. The results of that sales revenue increase, together with the continuation of many of the underlying cost containment programs, efficiency programs that we've had running, the back office that we've been creating in Budapest for Europe, some of the data center consolidations that we have underway, that all continued.</p>
          <p>And it's result of that underlying cost containment issue, together with the product mix and with good cost containment in areas like marketing and distribution that have resulted in the 19% operating profit growth that you see in local currency for that six month period.  Now, again, if you take the governmental sales of Tamiflu are achieved really without the need for marketing and distribution costs, we're seeing 7% growth in the underlying business and 5% growth in M&amp;D, so good control there.</p>
          <p>As we did signal to you at the beginning of the year, we would have more being invested in late stage development, which is why what you do see is a 7% growth in R&amp;D, which is in line with the underlying sales growth.  One thing we've been very keen to achieve because we can't predict how Tamiflu plays out, is not to have the cost structures growing out of proportion just from a transient sale of Tamiflu to governments.  So we keep looking at that underlying business and making sure that that foots in good shape.</p>
          <p>So I think very satisfying also there. If we start to take a look at some of the key brands, 55% of our revenues now actually come from oncology.  That group of products grew by 12%, so still strong double-digit growth that we're evidencing there.</p>
          <p>MabThera, the adoption rate, if anything, growing at 10% in the rest of world, international a little bit higher than the 8% overall.  Similarly with Avastin at 29% overall, a little bit higher growth in Europe, rest of world, but we've got good strong adoption in the United States in colorectal cancer, starting more in breast cancer and lung cancer and in Europe it's principally colorectal cancer and breast cancers. Lung cancer, if anything, we've still got more work to do to unlock the value there.</p>
          <p>For Herceptin, a 10% growth, there is a much strong adoption still to be achieved beyond Europe and the United States. We've achieved a very high percentage of the target patient population there, but it's a credit to the strength of the clinical performance that this product is growing so well.</p>
          <p>We have initiatives, for example, in Brazil to try and improve in the quality of the HER2 testing to try and get it to the broader reach into many more cities. This is one of the E7 programs where we're trying to unlock more value for patients and that people get that benefit, that's a typical example.</p>
          <p>For Tarceva, what you see is a product that's getting stronger as the clinical news flow develops. I hope that you saw more recently the overall survival benefit from the SATURN study. This was a pre-prescribed secondary endpoint for that study. And that what we've resulted with is we called it a maintenance setting. We'll have to find a new word for it because clearly what's happened in this setting is people got chemotherapy and first line and then we thought we would move them on to Tarceva for maintenance.</p>
          <p>If you improve an overall survival in that group, it is no longer maintenance, it's benefit. So it's more of a sequential therapy and this is something we've learned with Tarceva over the years, so when you use it with chemotherapy you tend to lose some of the signaling and some of the efficacy. So sequential use seems to be the way to use the product.</p>
          <p>So we're now learning more and more, we see that for our first line use there's a sub-cohort that probably should get Tarceva alone with a very high result, we have a Spanish study that's running for that.  For others that they should receive in first line chemotherapy followed by Tarceva in monotherapy and we've got an overall survival benefit for them there. So the story for Tarceva gets more complex, but we're beginning to understand better how to unlock the value for the patient.</p>
          <p>And for Xeloda, also 11% growth, pretty wide spread and again, I hope you saw the more recent results where Xeloda, plus oxaliplatin, delivered a better survival for patients in early colorectal cancer than the use of 5-FU intravenous and leucovorin.  So again, a lot of a good news flow on oncology. And I know I met a number of you during ASCO.</p>
          <p>Just for those that were not at ASCO, I think again a strong performance for us.  We accounted for about 15% of the scientific and medical input at ASCO this year.  We had the problem or the failure of the C-08 study, but I think it was put into very good perspective,  We're still learning and understanding what plays out here. What becomes more and more clear to me is you have to start with Avastin and stay with Avastin.</p>
          <p>The Bright study in the advance setting, the metastatic setting, that is showing us that this is what plays out. We have some studies now running in multiple lines and we are still working with the rest of the adjuvant program.</p>
          <p>What I think we'll see there is that in colorectal cancer nearly 80% of patients get a three year outlook before the cancer progresses. And this one year or six month period and there's a follow up with Avastin, we saw the benefit of the one year, but maybe we need to keep going longer.</p>
          <p>In some of the other cancer types that we're studying it's a much shorter time to progression. So those studies are still in good shape from a scientific point of view and have recruited so many of the patients that the study groups do not want to alter the design at the present time.</p>
          <p>So we'll continue with those programs.  We'll be thoughtful on the outcome of the advance study, which we should have early next year and that may reconfirm the C-08 finding or it may add new dimensions to it and we'll digest that before we come back to colorectal cancer.</p>
          <p>So a strong performance, the ToGA study in gastric cancer finished a year early and presented at ASCO because of the stunning results that it gave. The poster child for personalized healthcare, which we were able to evidence with BRAF, Phase I study patients with this mutant form that causes malignant melanoma and even in Phase I you can see such a dramatic response.  We know we're on the right journey for patients and for a companion diagnostic through Roche Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>Also the progress on TDM1, then it moving into Phase III in late stage breast cancer on hedgehog in basal cell carcinoma, so the story gets stronger. I would also say that probably out of ASCO the only new dimension on the competitive front that was intriguing the audience were the PARP inhibitors and there in Phase II they're evidencing a rather similar signal to what we've evidenced with Avastin in node-positive breast cancer. So how that plays out in Phase III remains to be seen, but there is still very strong data set on the role of our various medicines in cancer.</p>
          <p>Turning to inflammation/autoimmune, on the down side CellCept patent expiry in May, as predicted. We had a rather bad month in shipments into the wholesalers. In June it was slightly more tempered. It's still rather early to know what is happening at the patient level. We always expected that in the regular or the non-labeled autoimmune diseases that we may see a more rapid erosion in areas like lupus that were being used with CellCept.</p>
          <p>For patients whose transplant was stable, we've always been more circumspect that people would not move away from the product too quickly. Now that's still our hypothesis.  What we don't know is whether with the underlying economic weakness in the United States whether people are being more encouraged into substitution or not.</p>
          <p>A bit early to say, but so far maybe a few weeks early in the hits, but nothing that's dramatic from the company point of view. We just have to be ready that that continues to wash out in the second half year.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, the story from MabThera/Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis gets stronger. The data we were able to share at OILAR, very good data, the X-ray data, the continuation of the benefits that we see with MabThera/Rituxan and also with Actemra.</p>
          <p>A very fast response for patients on Actemra and a benefit that is building over time. There's more data to come on the follow-up of the X-ray, the live study and I think you'll be encouraged by that data that shows the longer the patients are on the product, the more differentiated the results are becoming.</p>
          <p>So off to a good start in Germany, off to a good start in Japan, pricing negotiations in France, pricing negotiations are nearly complete in Spain. We're under discussion in Italy and the United Kingdom here. We have held back from launching in one or two of the smaller European countries where the local currency has been particularly weak. And we're trying to get the European pricing in the major markets established before we launch into some of these smaller markets.</p>
          <p>The third area, virology, clearly what you can see on the right-hand side of the screen, the way in which, I don't even know whether to call it seasonal sales of Tamiflu any longer. Interestingly enough in the United States during the month of June an average of 100,000 prescriptions per week for Tamiflu, totally atypical. You don't normally expect influenza in the summer months.</p>
          <p>The one thing about this swine flu, it has a longer latency period, it has more gastrointestinal disturbances, it is still a miserable flu. The good news is that it has not been too lethal.  It's much less lethal than a regular winter flu. But my goodness, it has tested the planet and I don't think the planet is doing awfully well in its preparedness.</p>
          <p>We have seen a number of governments and in fact it's most of the governments that are well prepared, like the French government, the British government, the American government, the Australian government and the Japanese government, that are increasing their level of preparedness and we still have countries which are not well prepared at all.</p>
          <p>So there's lots of learnings that have come out of this first round. The big question is what happens in the second half of the year, what happens in the Southern Hemisphere, does this mutate, does it have a sting in the tail when it come back into the Northern Hemisphere?</p>
          <p>This is one of the reasons why governments are continuing to get prepared and while we give a guidance that with one billion under our belt at the half year, we expect another billion of sales of Tamiflu in the second half year. Those are based on firm orders from governments at the present time.</p>
          <p>On the Pegasys side, strong performance and a full credit to my colleagues in the United States that given the uncertainty of the last few months as we bring the two parts of the family together, they've continued to progress in market share build. We're at 75% market share in the United States in the treatment of hepatitis C.</p>
          <p>Japan is also increasing its market share and also in the international market we've seen some particularly good results around the Mediterranean Belt and some of those are with governmental programs, the Egyptian government, the Moroccan government and so forth. So still Pegasys with 10% growth doing nicely.</p>
          <p>This has been the tracker that we shared with you at the full year results and as you can see. a lot of the data flow has come through.  I've mentioned that on Tarceva for non-small cell lung cancer first line maintenance that data, the overall survival data is now through. This will thoroughly enrich the interactions that we have with the regulatory authorities. We had submitted the data, but we're now in the question time with the Europeans. So this overall survival data will enrich the discussions that we have there.</p>
          <p>For our filings with MabThera, chronic lymphocytic leukemia first line in United States and relapsed U.S. and Europe, the good news I can share with you is we've just had confirmation from the FDA that the U.S. filing will have a fast track designation. So our PDUFA should be in November of this year. This, I think, also narrows to a very small margin, the difference between ourselves and the first upstart in this area that is going to try and come into the market, being the GSK Genmab of ofatumumab.</p>
          <p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was probably our undefended flank on the label in the United States. The use of Rituxan in the market is very regular because the role of the drug is so strong. However, we will be getting that on the label. And maybe the other thing to say is that at the bottom, Xeloda with the adjuvant colon cancer, that is still now filing for this year with oxaliplatin. And we would add to the list of filings Herceptin in gastric cancer.</p>
          <p>Update on a couple of the dimensions to do with our new organization around the world. Clearly, when you try to bring together an organization that has more than 300 projects in research and exploratory development, you have to have a different way at managing this.</p>
          <p>And you saw us a couple of years ago move more into these five disease biology leadership teams within the legacy Roche organization.  With Richard's organization there is another group that are placing bets and wiring these assets through to try and get the hypothesis for late stage testing that these have some real clinical differentiation to bring to the market.</p>
          <p>For the late stage pipeline and here we're handling 49 Phase III programs through Phase III registrations and there's 10 new molecular entities within this program. What we've done is to take &#x2013; we've had one committee, which was this dark blue and at the top traditionally and we've decided that we will delegate more to the clusters of oncology, virology and inflammation and have that late stage portfolio managed out of San Francisco and the metabolism and central nervous system where the two disease biology area &#x2013; leadership teams are in Basel, but it will be led out of the Basel site.</p>
          <p>This will still involve colleagues around the world that are responsible for these programs, but it's just trying to make sure that we've got the right management team in the right time zones managing the late stage portfolios. So just to give a flavor of how we're bringing the family together.</p>
          <p>Another dimension would be on manufacturing and this is particularly germane because of the one-time hits that we've made for restructuring. Two-thirds of the restructuring charges are connected to non-cash items and it's to the book write-off of assets.</p>
          <p>And in particular, I draw your attention to the CCP2 facility that was coming close towards completion in Vacaville, just North of San Francisco. I go back a few years and when we sat together in a meeting like this just after ASCO 2005, the only question in the room was given the stunning data on Herceptin, given the stunning data on Avastin, can you guys meet the demand for these products? Have you got enough capacity?</p>
          <p>And at that point Vacaville 2 was being built, the new facility in Basel was being built and the expansion of the Herceptin facility in Penzberg was being built. The Vacaville facility started off earlier and was very large &#x2013; 25,000 liter vessels .</p>
          <p>What's happened in the meantime is we were able to benefit and buy the Oceanside facility from Biogen Idec. This was a dedicated facility linked to TYSABRI, never really utilized. And we knew from the technology exchanges we'd had this could produce Avastin and we are producing Avastin licensed from that site in Oceanside.</p>
          <p>The other thing that happened is there's been such an improvement, particularly in our research activities on the tighters and the yields that we can get in manufacturing, that the 10,000 liter that we have as a traditional unit Oceanside, Basel, Penzberg, this was a more workable configuration for the future.</p>
          <p>So we've bitten the bullet and we're not going to complete the Vacaville facility. By doing it now, it also means that it's relatively painless on the people side because we didn't recruit the people that were going to be running this facility.  So that's where the principle hit has come in us realigning these facilities.</p>
          <p>We've taken the opportunity also in some of the rest of the network, but what I'd draw your attention to is we have now five chemical installations. That will be four in a couple of year's time. We have six biotech facilities and 14 galenicals.</p>
          <p>This manufacturing footprint is the envy of many in our industry now. We've closed  between 40 and 50 facilities or sold them in the last five to ten years and this is a very competitive footprint and highly efficient for our needs. In addition to that, I should say we've got a small footprint in Japan with two biological installations and one chemical and galenical site.</p>
          <p>So those yield improvements are helping in manufacturing. We're aligning, consolidating and enhancing those activities and as Severin mentioned on the infrastructure, making sure that we are as tight as we can be.</p>
          <p>We have in Pharma 17,000 colleagues now in the United States, 2,000 involved in the field forces, running a more than 14 billion full strength operations. And in addition to that a self-standing GRED, worrying through interesting signs to become major molecules, to become differentiated medicines. And we have global development and global technical operations on both seaboards linked in with the global network.</p>
          <p>So from that, let's just touch on again the outlook. As you can gather, there's probably two primary calls, clarion calls, within Pharma Division. We need enough clinical differentiation in our molecules to be able to get the right price, which encourages a virtuous circle of an above average spend in R&amp;D and a good return to our shareholders and great outcomes for patients.</p>
          <p>When we have such a molecule the only other key thing we have to do is change the medical textbooks and be a leader where we've chosen to play. And that's the translation of that great science and making sure that the commercial organization gets the textbooks rewritten.</p>
          <p>As you can see from this chart, we do believe we're starting to rewrite standard of care in a number of areas: Avastin, MabThera, Herceptin. For Xeloda we are at least the equal of historic injectable 5-FU and some of the more recent data, like the adjuvant colon data, shows we do have a survival benefit for some patients.</p>
          <p>We have Tarceva in the second and third line and I would argue with what we're learning it will have an increasing role to play in standard of care in first line and so it goes on. It's a pure play pharma and diagnostics approach. And also, again, just to reinforce the point that Severin made because several of our competitors are talking about the emerging markets, I guess they've discovered a new vegetable.</p>
          <p>We've been there a long time. We've been working with our colleagues around the world a long time. We're in 150 different countries. And I think it's just interesting as a snapshot for you to see on the right of the screen we're globally number five and this is in the &#x2013; those audits that are built upon our ex-factory sales, not on IMS, we're number six, nine and that's number five on the ex-factory sales.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics the clear number one. But look at the relative position, we may still have some work to do in Turkey and in South Korea, but my goodness there's a good representation there. And the other thing to notice is on the left of the screen that there's first top selling, second top selling and third top selling products are modern high-tech products making a real difference in medicine. We are not look to license in other people's tail end products and pretend it's our strategy.</p>
          <p>And on the other side, sorry, but it does confuse. On the other side of it as we look at the products that can lead us forward into the next decade and we've known this for a while, we have to get more than an average share of these products jumping these clinical hurdles that are high to make sure that we're in as good health in the 2000 and teens.</p>
          <p>What we have is these ten, in dark blue the ten new molecular entities that are in later stage studies where there is good proof of concept. The only one that you could argue is by analogy would be dalcetrapib, raising HDL and that's having an influence on outcomes in mortality morbidity as a cardiovascular risk factor, there is evidence with the fibrate. There is no evidence as yet with the CETP inhibitors. We are in the lead by probably a margin of a year in our Phase III studies and they're on track.</p>
          <p>For the rest, there is some proof of concept in the role that we've chosen to pursue and in the clinical differentiation that we've set as the hurdle for the molecules. So I do believe that at the half year mark and as we think out towards the year end and beyond that we are well positioned for growth, that we are pure play for real clinical differentiation with a diverse approach to drug hunting and to converting that into major medicines.</p>
          <p>And we do not give up either on the efficiency within the development organization and I know this came up after the year end with a number of you when I saw you in smaller meetings.  We do continue to look to run those studies in the most efficient way that we can.</p>
          <p>What are the markets we must recruit in because they're major for us commercially and we have to get starting changing the medical textbooks. Where are we in markets that are fast to recruit, the lower cost and fast to recruit? So we are trying to drive that operational efficiency right across the piece. It's not just within the back office, but to be efficient right across the division.</p>
          <p>So that's how I believe we'll still meet our obligation to you that we're signaling as guidance of high single-digit growth for this year and then we'll talk again about the time ahead.</p>
          <p>And with that I'd now like to hand across to J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer to take you into the Diagnostics Division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentleman, I'm pleased to present the results for the Diagnostics Divisions for the first half of 2009. Roche Diagnostic recoded strong sales of 4.9 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 7% in local currencies. This is roughly twice the world's IVD market, estimated to be growing around 3%.</p>
          <p>Professional and Tissue Diagnostics were again strong contributors. Molecular Diagnostics and Applied Science showed solid growth with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Diabetes Care grew 3% with growth in all major markets, despite the negative impact from current economic pressure.</p>
          <p>I'm particularly pleased to report that the division's operating profit increased by 28% to 644 million Swiss francs. The operating margin advanced 2.3 points in local currencies, 4.9% in Swiss francs with 13.1%. This increase was due to tight cost management across all areas, along with the absence of some one-time expenses from the Ventana acquisition, which helped the G&amp;A line.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales increased primarily due to costs associated with launching the new diabetes meters and higher period costs from depreciation of the increased installed instruments base. As mentioned at the full year results, we have initiated a number of measures to improve profitability by reducing overall costs and improving efficiency.</p>
          <p>We are well underway in centralizing global functions, such as HR, IT, distribution and procurement and harmonizing processes, such as quality and SAP systems that started establishing regional calls and service centers.  To reduce cost of sales we are looking at ways to decrease both production and servicing costs of our instruments through increased streamlining of processes and redesign. We are also actively phasing out old or low selling products, particularly in Applied Science.</p>
          <p>As mentioned, each business area continues to grow sales while stepping up the rollout of new product. Immunochemistry continued its impressive growth of 18% due to menu expansion with such test as anti-CCP for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.  In Diabetes Care all four new blood glucose monitoring systems are off to a strong start in the first markets where launched.</p>
          <p>And in Molecular Diagnostics we won new blood screening accounts in EMEA and Asia Pacific, fueling growth. In terms of how the IVD markets is developing in the economic downturn, we are starting to see a small slowdown in Europe and rest of world's markets. In the U.S., this slowdown is more pronounced due to less people visiting their physicians, so less tests are being performed.</p>
          <p>Additionally, co-pay constraints are impacting the diabetes testing market. Despite this, Roche Diagnostics is maintaining its strong growth due to our large installed base and broad menu and also customers preferring large companies with sound financial strength.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the proposed healthcare reform in the U.S. may help drive the Diagnostics business with potentially more people insured and then visiting the physician, combined with a push towards preventative medicine and personalized healthcare.</p>
          <p>In the meantime we are focusing efforts in the area of personalized healthcare. We have the people, processes, tools and technologies in place and we established a diagnostics biomarker group to directly collaborate with the Pharma teams to bring personalized healthcare forwards.</p>
          <p>Currently we have 100 different biomarkers in various stages of validation partnered with drugs in development.  Only a handful of these novel markers could eventually become a companion diagnostic test. However, they may also be vital in drug target discovery or clinical development.</p>
          <p>Oncology remains the most promising area, however, we have PhD programs actively ongoing in all of Pharma's disease biology areas.  Finally, as you can see from the green tick, we are well advanced with our key launches for 2009. These, in combination with products recently launched, will help drive our growth which is expected to be well above market in local currencies in 2009.</p>
          <p>And with that I'd like to hand over to Erich.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, J&#xFC;rgen. Ladies and gentlemen, it's good to be here after several months and looking at the Group development on a divisional level, I think a nice development on the operating profit margin situation.</p>
          <p>At the same time, if you dig a little bit into these figures, you see also the complexity from the forex side. If you compare for instance the &#x2013; if you compare local currency growth and Swiss Francs growth for the Pharma Division, you compare 19% to 13%. If you do the same comparison for the Diagnostics Division, you compared 28% to 11%, so you see exactly that both divisions have totally different exposures to the various major currencies.</p>
          <p>And I understand that you would like to have a short answer for me how will this develop in the second half of the year?  We try to give you some figures in our financial reporting and you have all these charts about currencies had developed in the second half of last year and you will see the euro had a huge swing from August to November, December and the dollar had a huge swing.</p>
          <p>So I can tell you it is very difficult to predict anything how this will go on, but in general you can &#x2013; rule of the thumb for Roche is if the dollar is strong, it's good for Pharma and if the euro is strong, it's good for Pharma too. And it can be a challenge for Diagnostics and Diagnostics thing, one of the partner is producer in Japan. Diagnostics is also quite sensitive to the Japanese yen.</p>
          <p>If we now try to move under the operating profit and, of course, we start at the top line with the excellent 20% which the underlying business has generated, but now we go in to a transaction year.  And if you remember, of course, you were asking us where would these one-time costs be approximately?</p>
          <p>And I think we always told you as a rule of the thumb, again, if you have the total synergies achieved, you have to count between two-and-a-half and three times the final synergies as a one-time charge. And I think we will come into this ballpark.</p>
          <p>The major part definitely, you know that we have taken first provision by the end of last year for all the activities we had already taken on the Roche side with regards to Palo Alto and Nutley.  And now you have here the major part, this 1.942 billion.  Of course it's a large amount, but as Severin has already pointed out and Bill, 1.6 billion of this is not cash relevant, so 85% of this 1.9 billion here is not cash relevant.</p>
          <p>We have about 400 million, which are employee related and then about 1.2 billon, which are factory manufacturing related and the rest is impairment of intangible assets. But you can be assured that my team who is running the accounting workshop, for those of you who are really interested in this, it will be their pleasure to take even much deeper and to give you all the details here.</p>
          <p>So for the half year for the big part, 85% is not cash relevant.  If you then take everything together which means what we have already charged last year to the 2008 results, what we charge now and what we think overall will come through the end of this year, you have then around three billion and of this three billion about two-thirds will not be cash relevant.</p>
          <p>If we go into the detailed P&amp;L and also here we try to be as helpful as possible for you to really understand the underlining business and to be able to eliminate the one-time effects. So if you go into the financial income you have a line, exceptional financing cost, what is this, this 365 million?</p>
          <p>I think you would agree that if we would have had a bridge financing up to the closing of the Genentech transaction on March 26, the cost of this bridge financing would be prior to the transaction and therefore a one-time cost.</p>
          <p>So we agreed with our auditor and that's totally in line, that all the interest which incurred on the bonds we had raised prior to March 26 go into this line. This is about 130 million. But, of course, from the day of the closing all the interest rates related to the bonds we have offered are regular business. That's now how our Group is moving forward.</p>
          <p>And the difference between this 132 and 365 is actually that in January, of course, we were not sure yet whether we would be able to raise all these bonds. So we have also liquidated some of our bonds we had in the Roche portfolio and, of course, at this moment it will not surprise you, by liquidating bonds in January of this year we have incurred certain losses. And these are together in this line totally transparent.</p>
          <p>If we come to the tax line, you may remember that I was standing here and telling you, be careful, the tax rate will go up because 2008 we had some extraordinary items, non-recurring items and therefore I gave you a certain warning. And I, of course, also said with the increased profitability of the U.S. business just by definition the tax rate will go up. Now the good news is that overall the tax rate went down.</p>
          <p>But it's very obvious, all the debt for the Genentech transaction was raised from a U.S. legal entity and is, of course, charged in the United States against the profit, which means it brings the profit of the U.S. down and therefore the overall Group tax rate down. How will this develop over the next years? I mean you can calculate very clearly what the financing costs are in the next five years.</p>
          <p>All our bonds are public, all our interest rates are fixed. So you can make a very good assessment and then it's your assessment of the U.S. profitability of the U.S. business. And then you see overall I would say the Roche Group tax rate step-by-step will go up with two effects, by the increased profitability of the U.S. business and the repayment of the debt.</p>
          <p>So this brings us down to a detailed schedule where you see, of course, that &#x2013; and that's the good news, that the net income attributable to Roche shareholders already has gone up and with this, of course, reflecting also the core EPS. And this chart I think is also quite interesting.  In discussions with some of you I always said, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you agree this was a very clever share buyback because look at this on the left side, just taking Genentech private by itself is extremely accretive.</p>
          <p>What you can see is that we have from March 26, we are buying over approximately 1.4 billion of profits, which prior to this time point went to the Genentech minority shareholders.  They now flow to the Roche shareholders. At the same time, of course, we have financing costs in the range of 1.7 billion, but you see also the positive tax effect of 650 million.</p>
          <p>So the left side is just the transaction by itself. The right side, of course, is that this very intelligent share buyback has synergies, which is very rare, and of course, you have the one-time cost which is now the biggest charge this year and then a minor part, as you can see. But at the same time the synergies kick in, so if you combine the two of them and that's what's done in these dark blue bulk down there, you see that this transaction is even quicker accretive than we had promised.  We had always promised you that at least one full year after the transaction, it would be accretive.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, you see that in the first half of this year we were able to generate operating free cash flow of 6.8 billion and we have used 4.7 billion of this because Roche pays the dividend only once a year, which is always in the first half year.  So we were able to cover the dividend and taxes paid and still generating free cash flow and then, of course, the proportion, yeah, are a little bit distorted against former times with the payout of this 52.8 billion, which brings us into a net debt position, which you also have mirrored here as a group.</p>
          <p>But also here I think you see a certain good news. If you go into the line long-term debt on June 30, you find 38.337 billion. This is the long-term debt, by definition longer than 12 months. But what you also can see, the good news is short-term debt is 13.4 billion and this will go very quickly, not even nine months.</p>
          <p>In nine months this will be all be gone and if you look upwards to the liquidity level, we have absolutely no concerns at the moment that we can cover the demands of our buyback by the liquidity we already have and by the liquidity we are generating over the next months.  So if we look at, this is just the maturity level of our debt which you find more or less in our financial statements and you have on the one hand private placement to Swiss franc bonds. We have, of course, also taken over a certain existing Genentech bonds, the yellow.</p>
          <p>Then we had some bonds, minor bonds outstanding from Roche, then the European medium term notes program and the 144A, but I think the beauty, as you can see here, is that we very quickly this year in September already 13% of the debt is gone and these figures are cumulative, so which means next March 25% of the debt is gone and in 2013 53% of this debt will be gone.</p>
          <p>So without any refinancing and at the moment I can also tell you we would have huge freedom to go into commercial papers, but with this liquidity you have seen we have we don't need to issue any commercial papers. So we even have quite attractive reserves.</p>
          <p>This financing, I think in hindsight and please, if I put it up here, this is not for any kind of show that's happening, this will be nonsense. But you have to understand when we were last standing up here early February, I mean one of our major peers had just announced that they were forced to have a bridge financing for half the amount we were using in the range of seven to nine percentage cost.</p>
          <p>So can you imagine we were standing up here and of course showing poker faces and hoping that we would get this financing much cheaper and, of course, that we would get the 44 billion we needed.  And at the second time, everybody forgets so quickly. I mean it was not sure when this transaction will close. We had very tough discussions with Genentech shareholders. We said we will never sell and I would tell you that this financing was suddenly changing the dynamics of the moment.</p>
          <p>I remember I was together with Karl in a meeting just when we had raised $38 billion all together and then we went out of the meeting and I said, "Did you see the dollars signs in their eyes?" and Karl said, "Yes, now it will go".  And then within two weeks more or less, the dynamics came. So this financing I think was also very crucial and then suddenly the deal moved from a base case planning to the best case.</p>
          <p>I tell you frankly, we never believed that we would close this deal so quickly and at financing cost, which in the first year now for everything, is 4.5% before U.S. taxes.  This also brings me now to a forward-looking statement, which you have seen in Severin's overall chart. I mean we have two partners.</p>
          <p>We have our long-term shareholders, equity holders, of course, whom we very much respect and we also respect our bond holders. They took a risk by giving us the money prior to closing such a transaction and I think what we now can really make very clear messages to both of them we can serve you.</p>
          <p>We, on the one hand, we have our dividend commitment which we are not changing for the next two years and on the other hand you have just seen we see no risk, of course, barring unforeseen events here, that we cannot fulfill obligations towards the bond holders.  And this has, I think hopefully also for you, changed a little bit in a favorable situation of the overall Roche Group.</p>
          <p>We have now a more positive view into the future than we just had several months ago. And again I also want to repeat here, this is by far not just because of Tamiflu, this is the underlying business which is doing well. This is the Genentech transaction, which is actually very much getting a grip and just to finish here from my side, I mean, yes, we are still investing a lot into R&amp;D. And according to our research we have just done at the half year results, we are defiantly amongst the top three companies in all industries with our innovation spend.</p>
          <p>And I understand your immediate reaction that you say, just spending absolute amount in R&amp;D is no guarantee that anything comes out.  I agree with you. I have 23 years in the pharma industry. I respect very much that absolute, but can you image if we would just be average and would spend the highest absolute amount, I mean the average outcome would be better than our peers.  And please, with having Richard Scheller running GRED and having our five EBAs and having Tugai and having Shanghai, I think we are not average.</p>
          <p>And with this I hand over to Severin for the Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Just a few questions please. Firstly on the synergies, assessing of 300 million set this year is predominantly second half although I didn't  get a comment on the first half results for any synergy there.  Just clarity on the extent that those synergies in the second half will help mitigate the lower margins usually you see on the second half of the year? Secondly, a question on GLP-1 program, just any updates as to how the FDA is thinking on thyroid, any change to the trial programs that have been required? And then thirdly on the tax rate, Erich, you very kindly discussed a lot of moving parts there, just one additional discussion point that Genentech had been an potential purchase of the Singapore manufacturing facility as potential changes, any?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we have one question answered.  If I may take the one on the synergies and then hand over to you, Bill, on the product side. Now, actually as you know, we have already taken some of the provisions in the context of the closure of Nutley and of the closure of LOI. And we started this part of the integration already in the first part of the year. So the 300 million which you have seen on the top for the full year of 2009, that's partly already coming through in the first part of the year because we started with some integration activities already on the Roche side in the second half of 2008. But we wouldn't give you an exact split of how much is in the first half and how much is on the second half.  And as far as the margin is concerned for the full year, to disappoint you that we would not provide you with an exact margin, but we do stay to our commitment of double-digit growth for the full year. Bill, on the product?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one program, a couple of points. Yes, I think as everyone is aware, there was a question of the thyroid and the expression of computonin in rats and mice which we know is a higher expression there than you would see in man. This became a question at the advisory board for liraglutide from Novo Nordisk. What's certainly in our mind is that although we know we've seen this in rats and mice, as I shared with you before, but we did not believe it was relevant to the outcomes in man. Now we've also been doing more work in the background just to understand and take some samples of thyroid tissue and looking at it and we are thoroughly satisfied that this is not a key issue. It needs to be handled properly. It needs to be put into prospective properly. But I guess you've also seen that play out in the approval in Europe of liraglutide.</p>
          <p>So I think it was just something that got into a glitch with the FDA. We're comfortable that we are on the case already within the Phase III program. We knew that we should just collect that as a backgrounder in a number of patients to have a right perspective on it, but not a worry.  In terms of the program itself, just to reconfirm, we should see the first of the Phase III programs towards the end of this year. We are initiating, given the preoccupation of the cardiovascular risk, which again, we don't believe is an issue because of the weight loss that we get, but we are recruiting 2,000 patients into another study that is a higher cardiovascular risk population so that we do have that as an enrichment of the data set. And we're still on track for a submission by the end of 2010. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A little maybe if I can give you a more detailed answer here. If you remember, this whole discussion came up when the so-called long range plan, which was developed by Genentech together with their financial advisor, was of course pushing the value up this famous November plan. And if you go into our answer, which we had in the tender offer document, we already then challenged two things fundamentally. We said this whole tax concept we do not believe in and especially with Mr. Obama's administration having now explicitly said that they won't tolerate this kind of concept. And the second element was the long range growth rate. So therefore I think you can assume that we haven't changed our position which you find very detailed in our tender offer document in the public domain.</p>

          <p>Danny from Goldman Sachs. Three questions, if I may. Just coming back to the guidance, I just wonder whether you could provide a little bit more clarity on what double-digit means in terms of '09 as it relates to 2010 in particular. I guess as we think about '09 what might be potential weights on the second half of the year in terms of what might way on performance?  And then two product questions, just in terms of pertuzumab, I think we're due an update in terms of ovarian, a decision on Phase III, I just wonder what the timing horizon was on that? And then just lastly, I noticed ocrelizumab for MS, I thought we were due a proof of concept study at the end of the year, it doesn't seem to be on any of the charts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the guidance, as we go into 2010 I think we've given you one important additional information and that is that we have a planning assumption of 400 million sales on the Tamiflu side. So what that indicates to you is that the momentum on the improvement on the profitability comes on the one hand from the strong momentum of the business and the synergies which kick in from the Genentech integration. But I wouldn't go further than that, double-digit is certainly below 100% and it is higher than 9%. On the second question, Bill, can you take over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'm just trying to also find on pertuzumab ovarian, Karl?  No change to what &#x2013; on Page 94, I think you must be, that's what you're referring to, we're looking for &#x2013; the Phase II study has been completed. I'm waiting to see the final data from and a proposal of how we would develop it forward into Phase III. Normally we only announce when the first patient in on the program. So it's still in the cooking phase for our understanding of that.  The Phase III program in breast cancer going well.  For ocrelizumab, what is running is the dose finding in multiple sclerosis. By the end of this year there's different sets of data that really has to come together, ocrelizumab role in rheumatoid arthritis, Phase III study is running. We should have the first results by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The dose finding in multiple sclerosis and maybe just let me open a bracket there to those that follow us closely, you would see that in the settlement or the advice from the arbitrator between Biogen Idec and our U.S. colleagues that what was said was we're free to go on rheumatoid arthritis, but Biogen Idec had the right to stop the work that was underway in multiple sclerosis. So post that it has been agreed with Biogen Idec, they see that we recruited all the patients into the Phase II study. We'll look at the data and that also gives us time to sit with Biogen Idec and discuss the right way forward here. So I think the final quarter this year will be important in determining the programs and the way forward either for registration or the Phase IIIs for multiple sclerosis and of how we work also with Biogen Idec.  Okay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Alexandra Hauber from J.P. Morgan, three questions. Firstly on Pharma R&amp;D, you said at the beginning of the year that we will see double-digit increases this year and next year. And we've seen 7% in the first half. Are we all going to see &#x2013; is it still going to be double-digits for this year or is it all going to be pushed out next year because some trials are starting later?  I noticed that aleglitazar is starting next year. Second question on the alignment of the manufacturing side, I think you showed closures of three galenical sites and one chemical site. I was wondering given that should be technically outside the Genentech situation, but that is accounted for in the synergy number? And thirdly I seem to remember that there was an interim analysis on the AVAGAST study, which is no longer mentioned.  Has that passed and the study is continuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think we always said, yes, there would be a high invest late stage portfolio.  And what I see at the moment is that, yes, the second half year has planned for more expenditures than the first.  Don't ask me if it's double-digit, but it is usually more expensive in the second half year. There is, as you rightly mentioned, we've taken the decision on aleglitazar, but the patient recruitment will be right at the year-end or the start of next year. So that's not a major burn rate this year.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the year the plans for the CETP inhibitor where we wanted all the patients in this year, that we're going to get the thick end of it, but there's not everybody recruited. So that's an easing back that has also had a financial consequence, if you like, benefit in this year if it's put into next year.  But I do think that you should plan that the investment level is higher in the second half than the first half. I wouldn't say double-digit. For manufacturing alignment, yes, what we have done is to accelerate a number of the programs that are outside of the Genentech footprint and we've taken that acceleration into account in the integration planning. Is that right, Erich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, of course, the fact that we now can shift production seamingless between all biotech production sites definitely has an impact on galenics side because it gives us much more freedom to actually move the production task to the best site.  And it has led to elimination of certain backup sites we had on the Roche side and this I think is in the overall efficiency of a company transforming transaction. You can be aware that we really went through all these steps also in a check and balance with our auditor explaining the whole interlinkedness of this and it was seen in the overall context of this transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you perhaps a specific example, which is a major part of in the numbers and that is the Nutley side. So you can argue, yes, Nutley which had galenical  manufacturing kind of is standalone and not directly related to the biotech manufacturing. But, of course, it is very much linked to fact that we closed down the whole site and keep it as R&amp;D site only. And as part of this overall restructuring we said, okay, if we reduce the footprint in Nutley, if we move the headquarters, all the commercial functions and many more administrative functions down to South San Francisco, there has been also the right moment to get rid of all the infrastructure related to the manufacturing and streamline this if you like as a result of the overall restructuring, which we do in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So you're right, technically, obviously there is a much stronger link between Vacaville, Penzberg and biomanufacturing production in Basel. That is kind of directly linked on a daily planning level, if you like. But I would argue that in the context of the overall restricting, there are indirect links between the types along the value chain. We had a third question on the AVAGAST study I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Avastin, AVAGAST is due to read out in 2010. We're still encouraged just to carry on and that's also I think on the chart.  There are studies like first line ovarian, like the prostate where again it comes through the safety checks and we're just encouraged to carry on. So the summary on the attachments would be the latest stage of play for all of these programs.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you. Amit Roy from Nomura. Three questions.  Firstly relating to the 1.6 billion non-cash charge, is there any associated relief from depreciation therefore that would have otherwise been seen in the P&amp;L if that that charge hadn't been taken?  And if so, how much would that be? Secondly, question on Tarceva, obviously we've seen the headline results on the overall benefit of Tarceva in the investor comment maintenance I think.  How do you see that being provisioned against the strong data from Alimta?  And also of Avastin's inherently sort of use in settings, how do they all fit together. And lastly, just an update on the penetration rate for Avastin in the European markets in the breast, lung and colon? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first question, yes, indeed you also have included in the synergies then a depreciation effect as we go forward. And I'm referring to the accounting virtue of which takes place right after the planner session here where we can discuss this in more detail. As to the second question, Tarceva, Bill, could you comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Alex (sic) [Amit] , there is &#x2013; some of these are pretty open questions at the moment, but from my windows or the way I would describe it at the moment is that if you took first line the role of Tarceva would be such that in the EGFR mutant population, about 10% of the patient, very strong case to use Tarceva first line. And that's still work in progress with the Spanish study and we'll bring that forward in due course. So the other 90%, some form of a chemo regiment and then use Tarceva as a sequential therapy in monotherapy. And that's the data we're learning of and we'll share the full set of data at the upcoming conference. That's how I would see that.</p>
          <p>Alimta, really I think the key question that we're now getting asked then we've got some studies that are starting is what would be the role of an Alimta plus or minus Tarceva plus or minus Avastin. As this story unfolds I think that's still to be defined. There's no doubt the Alimta results are good and therefore you've got doctors trying to choose between the two. If you were to take in later stages of lung cancer without the strict biomarker, you'd have to say that the people who were absolutely going to benefit most would be Asian female non-smoker, right, clearly a sort of trending in that direction of that. So there are some of those clinical points which I think will also play into how the doctors choose between them. And, yes, we are profiling and we've seen what some of the studies are doing. So there is a role for Avastin plus or minus Tarceva here and it's a different role because what's actually &#x2013; you got different mechanisms playing out here.  Starving the cancer cell of its blood supply I think it's going to be something that should be a baseline and then you look at some of these other things on top. I don't know, Richard, do you want to add anything to that, that's more your sense of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly what the adjuvant trial showed us is that Avastin is a cytostatic agent. So as the long as the molecule is there, the tumor has trouble growing and when you stop treating then the tumor can begin grow again. So that's giving rise to the notion I think in the community that a long-term treatment with Avastin and that it is more appropriate and that by the way it makes complete sense with this animal studies that we've done over the last ten years is exactly what we see in model systems. Work in progress, <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo Walton, Credit Suisse. Three questions please. Looking at the synergies, you say that they've come faster than you expected, I wonder if they'll also be bigger than expected, do you think in a year's time you'll be saying like a billion really, we can be doing a billion two or more? You've also highlighted that a lot of it is non-cash in terms of the operational, presumably that means some of the benefits are non-cash as well. Can you tell us how much of the ultimate billion is just a reduction in your annual amortization charge that would normally go against that division? Secondly on yesterday, Glaxo made a big thing about being the first to produce a PCR diagnostic for pandemic flu. I was wondering why that wasn't you, given your experience? And finally, on Tamiflu itself, surely you'd be very, very disappointed if you had only 400 million of sales next year.  That's just more or less what you sell in a year in a non-pandemic, non-government type of set of sales. So could you give us perhaps not your planning, but a broader range of what you think would be acceptable because otherwise I suspect we're just going to have a big write-down of Tamiflu facilities next year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now let me make a comment first on Tamiflu. I think what is important for you is that we give you a guidance in terms of what the numbers mean so that you can put it into relation and in terms of your guesstimate, it's as good as my guesstimate and I then handover the crystal ball to you, Bill. Now what is important, however, is in terms of our manufacturing network. What we do is we work together with 19 partners in our &#x2013; it's almost a virtual manufacturing network which we have build up and we can of course build on the experience we had at the avian flu. So there was a kind of dormant network out there and we are starting this up again. So we don't have to invest into factories, we can do this with this virtual network of partners to allow &#x2013; which allows us and to get up to the capacity of up to 400 million packs in case this is really needed.</p>
          <p>But if it is not needed then we let it go down again, as we did the last time that avian flu and where we didn't have write-offs on assets which we didn't build up in the first place to start with. Now on the synergies, yes, they have been faster for two reasons. One is because we closed the transaction very fast, and second, because the operational integration has progressed so fast and so successfully. So we could immediately go into implementation mode and that is why we reach already 300 million this year and 800 million next year and we did already increase the amount in synergies slightly from the 750 to U.S. $850 million, which guided you top down at the beginning of this process to one billion Swiss francs as we go forward. So it is faster and it is more than we originally expected. And you see it's also reflected in the outlook which we have given you for this year and for the next year. In terms of the non-cash cash relationship, since it comes up the second time, perhaps, Ian, if you could directly comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the non-cash, the synergies are about 10%, so 90% of the synergies are cash approximately.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we do others and and Tamiflu and then...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then <mark type="inaudible" />, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Jo, I think that's the differentiation between ourselves and what you were hearing yesterday.  If you have a disk tailor that has a unique delivery system, you have to make the investments yourself into your own propriety technology. We have the enormous flexibility and benefit with Tamiflu of it being a capsule, which we can as we just described scale up both the chemical manufacturer with a virtual network and also some &#x2013; we've got in-house competence, which we keep. But we can expand or contract in a very flexible way.  Now just to again put some prospective into this.</p>
          <p>Over the last five years we've sold just under 300 million treatments to world governments cumulatively. The last time around with avian flu we took that virtual network up to 400 million treatments per annum capacity. At the same time as having licensed somebody in India, for India and two people in China, for China. And that virtual network had a unique supply chain in the United States and another unique supply chain in Europe. So we have hedged also within the network the right geographic presence because if a flu breaks out, we may not be able to move a number of things across continents.</p>
          <p>So I think it's been intelligently pulled together. It's an intelligent response. Now then when this epidemic started, having tested the system through to 400 million treatments, we were sitting on an inventory of 100 million. And we viewed that as an intelligent level of insurance policy, a half to a third of what world governments had ordered historically as a response, most of it held in bulk, most of it with a 10 year plus shelf life. So again, we've been able to respond quickly to the demand from world governments and to be shipping. We are also at the moment reactivating that network because the demand <mark type="inaudible" /> work with the governments and see what's the level of demand and how further we need to keep activating that supply chain.</p>
          <p>So again, done in a very orchestrated way. And that's I think one of the ways that we're trying to manage this and it's also one of the reasons why governments particularly in the Northern Hemisphere wish their addition orders fulfilled before the outbreak of this winter or the winter season, which is one of the reasons, Jo,, why it's absolutely right not to try and get you or me excited about what could happen next year.  But to say if governments want the deliveries now or even if there're more seasonal demand in restocking the trade, it's likely to take place this year.  And it would seem imprudent to just dream about there being a wash-over into next year. If we see this is happening we'll update you and give you the guidance.  But from where we sit today the demand is there for delivery this year and it's only prudent to put in place as a placeholder the 400 million which would be a typical winter demand for next year. It could be half that number, it could be 50% more. So that's a right sort of ballpark figure. Now maybe for the final de numo, J&#xFC;rgen, when did you launch your test?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Approximately 12 weeks ago. So we were not the first, but one of the first. I think it was one week later when the WHO raised this level to, I think it was number five or six. I don't remember exactly, but within I would say six weeks due to the fact that we already have on stock or in our programs an avian flu test and so with our partners, one of our partners, we could immediately within one week put together the reagents and we could launch it and we are sending it. In the meantime, in the meantime means a couple of days later, I would say two weeks, three weeks, we have been asked by political and semi-political organizations to do some additional work and we are doing so. And so we hope that we can launch some additional things in, I would say, a couple of weeks.</p>

          <p>Vincent Meunier from the pharma team at Exane BNP Paribas.  The first question is on the guidance in Diagnostics and the top line growth.

The second question is on Actemra, can you please make an update regarding the timing in the U.S. on the resubmission and the approval?  And lastly regarding TDM1, do you expect to file in 2010 or '12 because in the slides it appears somewhere the filing will occur in '10?</p>

          <p>First, market growth of Diagnostics, we are expecting a market growth of 3%.  This is based on the figures which were published for the first quarter and the figures two of our competitors published the last week, was Johnson &amp; Johnson with a growth rate of 1.3% for the first half year and Abbott with 3% for the first half year. And we are expecting that some of our or two of our bigger competitors will publish next week and in a range I would say again between totally flat and maybe in the range of our two competitors.

First of all the requested animal study data and some of you have clearly heard me say that this request is more a matter of process and form, usually applied to small molecules rather than the large molecules about whether it can, whether the proteins can transmit into rat's milk of the baby mice. We've done all that work.  As absolutely predicted, no signals, no issues at all, hopefully we can tick the box. The second is for the risk evaluation mitigation scheme.  This is the new activity in the United States essentially to accredit doctors to be able to prescribe a bit of a registry, more data for the patient and for the administrators and it's something that we've seen across the number of the products, including, for example, that there is late stage discussion on one of this schemes for CellCept, even although the product is being off patent.</p>
          <p>So this is a new dimension in the United States.  The preparation by our colleagues in New Jersey has gone extremely well.  It will be complex.  What I think I'd advise to you is that once we've satisfied the FDA this may mean that it's not a traditional take off curve.  It may take a bit longer to build the doctor's experience, his knowledge, his trust, his preparedness to go into some of this educational program. Ultimately we will get there, we'll prevail because the product is stunning. So that second part is ready and the third part is a safety update, which we would do in the normal course of duty anyway and that safety update has said there are absolutely no new signals. So what I'm waiting to hear is if you like of an interaction and a follow through with the FDA and once we've had an acceptance of a dossier by the FDA, then we'll confirm for you that that has now started the clock again.  But everything in good shape as to on plan to go back into the United states.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  We have still time for one more question, perhaps here?</p>

          <p>TDM1, it's late stage breast cancer.  The target in that niche audience would be for a submission in 2010. That is the faster market approach.  There is a huge amount of potential work that would lay behind it to unlock it into earlier lines of treatment, but that's the faster market approach.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Jeff Holford from Jefferies.  You guys have issued having organic growth, emerging extracts, a strong late stage pipeline and you appear to have some strategic flexibility with cash when looking at your debt repayment schedule over the next few years. So what's the next big settle change in direction for this Group? And do you see new opportunities for diversification or growth given that many assets are now disappearing within the industry? This is assuming you're not going to send Bill out to find a new vegetable?</p>

          <p>Well we said from the onset already in July last year when we announced our intension to take Genentech fully private that we would continue to look out for smaller and medium size acquisitions, that we will continue with external partnerships, with licensing agreements, et cetera.  And as you've seen over the last months, we did a number deals both in Pharma and in Diagnostics and we will continue to look out for such opportunities. Yes, you are absolutely right, the liquidity planning, the planning and the scheduling of our reduction of the debt, that's allows for this very strategic flexibility and we will keep watching out and seize the opportunities if they come along.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much.  With this I'd like to lead into the breakout sessions. We have the strategy finance session, which takes place here. Erich will join me here and Richard will join me here. For Pharma we have the room Bishopsgate with Bill. For Diagnostics we are in Moongate with J&#xFC;rgen and also both people from Diabetes Care. And we have the accounting workshop which is lead by Ian Bishop in French Church.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. See you next time.</p>
