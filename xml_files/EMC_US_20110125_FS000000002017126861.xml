          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010. Today we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; and David Goulden, EMC's Executive Vice President and CFO. David will provide a few comments about the results that we released this morning. He will highlight some of EMC's activities this quarter and discuss our outlook for 2011. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy, and how EMC is positioned to help customers on the journey to the cloud. After their prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions.</p>
          <p>We would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today, in our press release, supplemental schedules and the slides that accompany our presentation.</p>
          <p>All these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of EMC.com. As always, we have provided financial tables in our news release and on our corporate website. These include a lot of financial detail. So we do encourage you to take a look at them. The call this morning will contain forward-looking statements and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And lastly, I will note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter to finish off a year of excellent operational and financial results. Q4 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow are all new quarterly records for EMC.</p>
          <p>We also achieved a record breaking year in 2010 with revenue of $17, billion an increase of 21%, non-GAAP operating margin for the full year of 22%, up 460 basis points, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.26, up 40% from 2009 and free cash flow of $3.4 billion, up 31% and 27% higher than non-GAAP net income. 2010 revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow are also new annual records for EMC as well.</p>
          <p>Clearly our vision and strategy are on target. The market is primed and ready and we have the right assets to help our customers on their journey to cloud. As a result, in 2010 we executed on our triple play to simultaneously invest meaningfully in our business, take market share and improve profitability.</p>
          <p>First, looking at the investments we made in our business. We stepped up investing in research and development by 16% or approximately $2 billion including software development costs that were capitalized. We invested $3.2 billion on key acquisitions targeted at high growth areas, and invested substantially in our go-to-market capabilities, including our international sales infrastructure and expanding our channel network.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the market share gains we achieved were impressive with faster market growth in areas like virtualization, security and storage, with especially strong share gains in backup and archiving and in the high-end. For the full year 2010 we grew 21%, almost twice what the estimate was the growth for our total available market.</p>
          <p>Finally, even while investing in our business for growth, and achieving sizable market share gains, we were still able to deliver substantial leverage to our business in 2010. Products designed to deliver greater value, services delivered more efficiently, and faster growth in our higher margin businesses all contributed to a 340 basis point gain in non-GAAP gross margin over last year.</p>
          <p>The improvement in non-GAAP operating margin was even greater, up 460 basis points to 22% for the full year, due to the operating expense efficiencies we also achieved. Let me point out that these are also very strong gains over 2008.</p>
          <p>As we head into 2011, we're even better prepared to seize the potential in front of us than we were in 2010, as we have expanded our market opportunity with the acquisitions of Greenplum and Isilon. We've extended our reach down market with addition of the VNXe family of storage systems and we've put an even greater distance between ourselves and our competitors across our storage portfolio with a newly refreshed and unified midtier storage family, new and enhanced products in our backup and archiving offering, and valuable new software offerings for our flagship VMAX to name just a few.</p>
          <p>By building out the strongest product portfolio in our history we've positioned ourselves at the intersection of two of the most sweeping trends in IT, cloud computing and big data. This is why we expect 2011 to be another record revenue year with continued improvement in profitability. We are confident we can grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion, expand non-GAAP operating margin by about 100 basis points to approximately 23%, grow non-GAAP net income 20% to approximately $3.25 billion, grow non-GAAP earnings per share 16%, to $1.46 and continue to meaningfully grow our strong free cash flow.</p>
          <p>This is remarkable growth, particularly for a company of our size. And also considering the very high bar we set ourselves in 2010. We also remain committed to double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the next several years.</p>
          <p>In addition to the continued growth of enterprise data, our progress is being driven by the convergence of two major trends in IT, cloud computing and big data.</p>
          <p>Cloud computing can also be described as IT as a service. Leveraging an on-demand, self managed virtualized infrastructure to deliver IT as a service, cloud computing is more efficient, flexible and cost-effective. And while customers are eager to deploy cloud architectures so they can begin to capturing the efficiencies cloud computing affords, this is not a transformation that happens overnight but happens in phases.</p>
          <p>Phase one is the virtualization of smaller departmental often IT-owned applications. Frequently with simple, efficient, VM integrated mid-tier storage. Cost efficiency is a primary benefit here and we saw a large number of customers passing through this phase in 2010.</p>
          <p>On average, customers have virtualized about 30% of their applications and are now entering phase two. Phase two is the virtualization of business critical applications. Ideally with more resilient infrastructure that meets demanding SLAs for performance, availability, workload mobility, recoverability, and security. More and more customers are entering into this phase heading into 2011. Well over half of a company's applications will have been virtualized once a customer has completely passed through this phase of the journey to the cloud.</p>
          <p>Phase three is when a customer is finally leveraging all the power of a fully virtualized environment to provide IT as a service with automation, provisioning and chargeback, and drawing on compatible public cloud services where it makes sense.</p>
          <p>The early adopters are only just starting to get here. And as a customer's cloud infrastructure develops, they look to build in technology that will secure and protect their operations whilst achieving better business agility than ever before. This means best-of-breed and well integrated capabilities for things like security and backup.</p>
          <p>Such transitions to the cloud are becoming the norm. And the vast majority of customers are at some point in their transformation to IT as a service. What is important is that whether customers are entering just first phase or well into the third, we have the product portfolio and the services expertise to accompany them every step of the way.</p>
          <p>The second major trend that will drive our results in 2011 is big data, which is a primary contributor to the staggering pace of data growth. When we talk about big data, we are referring to the enormous repositories of corporate and external data including unstructured information created by social media and other Web repositories.</p>
          <p>We're also talking about the associated analytics that unlock the value contained within these massive amounts of data. Big data differs from the transactional and small-file data and applications that have traditionally characterized a company's data center. It tends to be more sequential, less transactional, and much, much bigger, measured in petabytes rather than terabytes.</p>
          <p>The tools and platforms surrounding big data require new approaches and capability to handle these data sets. With the investments we've made through the acquisitions of Isilon and Greenplum as well as in our own Atmos offering we are now squarely positioned to capture much of this large and growing incremental market opportunity.</p>
          <p>Overall, given our strong base of technology assets that is both broad and deep, with virtualization and optimization that is second to none, we are becoming the partner of choice as customers consolidate and build out new data centers, either for their own private clouds or to offer cloud services to their customers.</p>
          <p>Now that I've given you a sense of what's driving our success in 2010 and going forward, let's look at our Q4 numbers in greater detail. Overall storage revenue growth accelerated to 17% as we continued to gain share by enlarging our footprint in the data center as well as through new customer acquisition. Customers choose EMC storage because they want efficiency, simplicity and performance and EMC delivers.</p>
          <p>We deliver efficiency through features like FAST VP software which stands for fully automated storage tiering with virtual pools and which automatically optimizes systems vastly lowers TCO. We deliver simplicity exemplified by our advanced, yet easy to use Unisphere interface in our mid-tier storage. We deliver performance with unparalleled VM integration and virtual provisioning across our portfolio, and as this recent survey indicates we continue to stand out as the storage vendor of choice in virtualized environments. These differentiators, along with product quality, service and support that are consistently the best in the industry, helped us extend our storage market leadership position in Q4.</p>
          <p>Our Symmetrix product revenues grew 19% in Q4. There are a couple of key differentiating features here that make our VMAX line so popular. The first of these is its x86 based scale out architecture purpose built for virtual environments. This evolution of our architecture to incorporate industry standard processors enables us to very quickly leverage the improvements made to processors to deliver faster, more reliable and more efficient performance.</p>
          <p>The second feature that sets us apart from alternatives is our ability to fully leverage solid-state drive and enterprise storage. We were the first to deliver the value to be had from solid-state drives in enterprise storage three years ago this month. And we continue to add value with our fully automated storage tiering software. The latest of version of which automatically optimizes systems and delivers up to 40% more application performance and 40% lower cost compared to single-tier systems. EMC alone is able to deliver this value with solid state drives and customers are embracing this value with penetration rates of solid state-drives and FAST on VMAX climbing once again in Q4. When you add these two features together, the end result is a powerful, trusted and highly efficient high-end platform with a value proposition that customers love.</p>
          <p>This demonstrated ability to innovate in ways that respond to customer needs is translating into market share. In fact, we think that when all the numbers are in for the year, we will have registered our biggest annual share gains in the high-end in at least 10 years, which is a testament to the power of our offerings here.</p>
          <p>As customers consolidate disparate data centers into new environments meant to support cloud deployments either public or private, they choose VMAX because of its highly scalable usable protected capacity and the smaller footprint made possible by cutting edge efficiency technologies.</p>
          <p>We had numerous examples across the globe in Q4 of customers selecting VMAX for their virtualized environments because of these advantages. With sizable wins in all verticals of all types including at a healthcare authority in British Columbia, telecom providers in India and Israel, an energy company in the UK, a government in the Middle East and a large manufacturer right here in Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an example from this past quarter that illustrates why VMAX is the high-end platform of choice. One of the largest plastic manufacturers in the world recently consolidated to three main data centers globally and was looking to replace their entire storage infrastructure in Europe.</p>
          <p>Because they used VMware for server and desktop virtualization, VM integration was a chief consideration for the storage they selected. Our ability to provide highly reliable and scalable storage solution, tightly integrated with vCenter was key to displacing Hitachi here. Moreover, our robust backup offerings and our integration with VMware's virtualization development API enabled us to become this customer's global backup standard as well. They're now using Avamar, NetWorker, and Data Domain to meet their backup requirements which like many customers vary throughout their global environments.</p>
          <p>Mid-tier product revenue grew 23% in Q4 and was up 20% from Q3, representing a healthy acceleration from the sequential growth of 5% last quarter. This was especially encouraging as our product refresh coming in Q1 was hardly a secret. While we continued to have customers purchasing EMC for traditional network storage requirements, we also saw a strong growth from customers working through early phase or departmental deployments of virtualization.</p>
          <p>Our long list of mid-tier competitive takeouts in virtualized environments in Q4 attests this is happening across the globe, in just about every vertical, with customers ranging from healthcare, tech and Internet to manufacturing, government and transportation.</p>
          <p>As customers virtualize their data centers and standardize their consolidated environments onto a small number of trusted vendors, EMC stands out as the best-of-breed and best VM integrated information infrastructure provider. This is winning us new customers who need a vendor who can do more than just phase one storage. EMC consistently stands out as the best candidate for consolidations like this in the mid-tier because of our affinity with virtualized environments, because of the simplicity of our unified systems, and because our market leading backup solutions that span customers' backup requirements.</p>
          <p>A great example in Q4 of a win due to these advantages came as Momentive Performance Materials. This large silicone producer standardized upon VMware and View across their enterprise and was looking to standardize infrastructure for their remote data centers as well. With our simple, efficient and VMware integrated mid-tier unified products, as well as Avamar in our arsenal, we were selected as their storage standard globally.</p>
          <p>We expect cases like this to become much more prevalent in 2011 with our refreshed and expanded mid-tier product set. Having earned the trust of thousands of mid-tier customers with platinum storage products and services in their main production and disaster recovery environments we are focused on expanding our footprint into departmental and remote offices. Our VNXe line will be important here as well as in reaching down market into the SMB space.</p>
          <p>Our Backup Recovery Systems division which includes Data Domain, Avamar and NetWorker continues to fire on all cylinders. Our resounding success here stems from our differentiated deduplication technology and also from the EMC effect, which is our ability to leverage our brand, our focus on research and development and our global sales infrastructure to maximize the ROI from our acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The aforementioned customer examples are a great illustration of this effect. Our market leading dedup technologies sought after by customers frustrated by antiquated backup approaches. This challenge is now so common that our backup offerings have become a natural additional solution in accounts where the initial engagement was something entirely different.</p>
          <p>The same approach is being applied to our acquisitions of Isilon and Greenplum, our model is to select differentiated technology that adds clear value to customers in rapidly growing adjacent markets that are complementary to our own and then broaden this reach through exposure through our global sales channels, the backing of EMC brand, and other investments to maximize value.</p>
          <p>This strategy augments our portfolio to meet the challenges of big data and helps to solidify our position as the cloud technology provider of choice. Early indicators of the success of this strategy are all good. Greenplum did very well in Q4, and we're especially pleased with the fast ramp of the Data Computing Appliance.</p>
          <p>Built on Greenplum technology, the Data Computing Appliance combines leading innovations in workload management, fault tolerance and advanced analytics with the fastest data loading on the market today, which is important given the vast amount of source data needed to run analytics. Customers value all this plus the fact they can get the DCA up and running very quickly.</p>
          <p>Isilon's momentum continued with record revenue in Q4 on a standalone basis, well above the company's expectations prior to the acquisition. In its sixth generation, Isilon's scale-out technology has matured and is mainstream, enterprise ready, and meeting the big data challenges that characterize today's IT environments in a growing number of vertical markets.</p>
          <p>This is great momentum. Even before the benefit of the EMC effect. On a going forward basis, Isilon will be included in our mid-tier storage number though is not included in our Q4 revenue as we closed this transaction very late in the quarter. Complementary to Isilon is our Atmos offering which uniquely focuses upon globally distributed environments with object interfaces to data. We remain confident the two together will reach a $1 billion annual run rate during the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our services organization is definitely benefiting from the transition to cloud architectures, as cloud-related consulting engagements increased over 40% in Q4. As customers build out private cloud infrastructures and even begin to bridge towards utilizing the capabilities public clouds have to offer, EMC's trusted advisors are pulled in to help customers architect the foundation for delivering IT as a service, a trend which further even increases EMC's relevance in next generation data centers.</p>
          <p>One of the fastest and easiest ways to accelerate the transition to a cloud architecture is with a Vblock and the strong VCE momentum we experienced in Q3 has only accelerated in Q4 with the number of deals closed more than doubling quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>As expected, deployment spanned all use cases and verticals and happening globally as converged infrastructure is universally appealing. Vblocks enable customers to get cloud infrastructures up and running on best of breed technology in a fraction of the time required by traditional deployments of competitive technology stacks. Reference architectures or technology alliances that purport to compete with Vblock are still do it yourself assemblies and lack the very advantage that make Vblocks popular, one SKU preconfigured with a single management interface and ready to deploy. A Vblock is best of breed technology that dramatically simplifies cloud deployments and customers are embracing it.</p>
          <p>Vblock customers in Q4 include service providers like Sonda Brazil, our first official VCE partner in Brazil who will be offering new cloud computing services to its customers based upon Vblocks. And Harris Corporation, which is investing in its fiber integration center to offer trusted enterprise cloud solutions to its customers.</p>
          <p>Corporations building out private cloud architectures are standardizing on Vblocks as well. With Vblocks, customers can efficiently deploy highly secure cloud based applications for business innovation whilst reducing the capital and operating expenses associated with procuring, deploying and maintaining IT. The benefits to EMC of VCE are important, the majority of VCE deals are incremental to EMC. In addition to our traditional best of breed storage solutions we now compete with the integrated players with a best of breed converged infrastructure. Now we're positioned to win both ways.</p>
          <p>Our RSA Security division finished 2010 with all-time record Q4 revenues of $209 million, up 28% year on year driven by strength across product lines and geographies. RSA achieved excellent growth in 2010 with revenue growth accelerating every quarter this year. This strength stems from the fact that security continues to be foremost priority for CIOs, and also from RSA's thought leadership and product leadership within security.</p>
          <p>Part of our competitive advantage is that many of our offerings span both physical and virtual infrastructures which is ideal as customers build out their clouds. As cloud environments grow in popularity the built in security RSA provides is increasingly relevant. RSA will continue to stand apart with offerings that enable IT departments and cloud providers alike only to ensure compliance and security but to prove it as well.</p>
          <p>Revenue from our Information Intelligence group was roughly flat in Q4, as customers transition from purchasing enterprise wide content management solutions to applications centric solutions with Documentum xCP. We believe we have a lot of the right assets to address the enormous opportunity to be had in the capture, management and governance of unstructured data. Information governance is increasingly a focus for corporations today whilst industries like insurance and healthcare are demanding case management solutions like those built on our xCP platform.</p>
          <p>VMware grew 38% in the quarter to a record $835 million, as customers are eager to benefit from the efficiency and agility the VMware's product set enables. VMware is making good progress expanding its market globally. We're expanding footprint within the data center as well. Approximately 30% of a data center's server applications on average are virtualized today. We expect this figure to climb over 50% within the next two years.</p>
          <p>VMware will continue to leverage its unique base of technology assets to expand the technical and market leadership position we hold today. With a three layer strategy focused upon modernizing infrastructure, applications and end user computing, VMware is positioned at the core of the movement to IT as a service.</p>
          <p>Looking more closely at our financials, it is evident that the strategic combination of our technology assets, which we've been assembling over the last several years, is resulting in clear value for our customers and for our shareholders as well. Overall, we grew revenue in Q4 19% to $4.9 billion reflecting solid double-digit growth from all of our geographies and especially our BRIC+13 markets which grew over 30%.</p>
          <p>The higher value we're delivering to customers is translating to better profitability for us. Non-GAAP gross margins increased 140 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points year on year to an impressive 61.9%, driven by volume and mix shift towards higher margin products. This expansion coupled with ongoing efficiency gains in our operating expenses drove non-GAAP operating margin up 300 basis points year on year to a very solid 25.4%.</p>
          <p>These improvements drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.42 up 27% from $0.33 a year ago. We ended the year with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. Partly driving this cash balance was the 31% growth of free cash flow in 2010 from last year, to a full year free cash flow of $3.4 billion. This is well above non-GAAP net income for the period, and a very good result.</p>
          <p>We've also been investing some of this cash in our future, including $2.3 billion on acquisitions in Q4, with a 2010 total of $3.2 billion. This investment in key technologies, products and businesses adds to our portfolio and drives growth. In the consolidating IT market the strength of our balance sheet to make these investments is very important.</p>
          <p>We have also been returning cash to our shareholders via share purchases. In Q4, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of EMC for approximately $200 million. In 2010, we returned a billion dollars to shareholders via our repurchase program. In addition, in 2010 we spent a small amount of $399 million to purchase VMware shares while VMware spent $339 million themselves on share repurchases. Given VMware's position as the cloud data center operating system of the future, we believe our relatively small purchase to maintain our ownership level are an excellent long term investment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to 2011, the global economic outlook while it could be better is certainly a bit brighter than it was last year at this time. Joe will give you some more color about what we expect. What is clear is that the vast opportunity available to us at the crossroads of the mega trends of cloud computing and big data. EMC is particularly well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity with a refreshed product portfolio that meets customers' needs for efficiency and simplicity, a services organization that's one of the most trusted in the industry, one of the most advanced and capable go to market organizations in the industry, a strong and growing partner ecosystem and our expanding role as the trusted cloud technology provider across the globe.</p>
          <p>We have never been better positioned. This alignment of IT trends with our capabilities gives us a high level of confidence and strong momentum as we look ahead. As a result, in 2011 we expect to grow revenue 15% to $19.6 billion, to expand non-GAAP operating margin around 100 basis points to approximately 23%, this is on top of the significant improvements we made in that 2010, to grow non-GAAP net income 20% to approximately $3.25 billion, to grow non-GAAP EPS 16% to $1.46 and to increase our buyback of EMC shares for a billion dollars in 2010 to $1.5 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>There are additional assumptions and expectations in our earnings release but I'd like to take a moment and point on a couple here. First, I'd like to point out an accounting requirement that has an increasingly meaningful impact on our fully diluted share count and therefore on our EPS calculation. The impact comes from the accounting for our outstanding convertible debts. As the EMC stock price goes above the $16.08 exercise price of the convertible, accounting rules result in an increase in our calculated fully diluted shares. In other words, the stock price going up is leading to the accounting calculation for the number of fully diluted shares to also go up.</p>
          <p>You will probably want to be mindful of this impact as it can be quite large whilst the debt is outstanding. For example, assuming an average stock price of $25, this would result in approximately 75 million shares added to the fully diluted share counts.</p>
          <p>Based upon our non-GAAP net income expectations for 2011, this would equal $0.05 per share. This $0.05 is pretty meaningful compared to the 2010 impact of only $0.02 per share. Taking this example a step further, the comparison of non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 versus $1.26, which represents 16% growth in 2011, would instead be $1.51 versus $1.28, or 18% growth, i.e. higher EPS and higher EPS growth.</p>
          <p>I believe this is very important for you to understand, because while this accounting impact has a significant impact on diluted non-GAAP earnings per share, the impact will be going away upon maturity of the convertible debt due to the hedges we have in place.</p>
          <p>In other words, if the debt had already reached maturity, these accounting shares would not be in the calculation. So this is an important factor to keep in mind, and we've included a table in our supplementary schedules that illustrates the impact of share price changes on our diluted share count due this accounting treatment of our convertible debt.</p>
          <p>One other consideration in regard to your modeling for 2011 is the non-operating expense line. We expect to increase by roughly $25 million from $75 million in 2010 to $100 million in 2011. The primary driver of this increase is our additional investment in VCE.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, with our commitment to continue our triple play of reinvesting for growth, gaining market share and delivering leverage, we head into the year with a major focus on reinforcing our position as the provider of choice for cloud infrastructures. So, while we expect to continue our excellent track record in 2011, more importantly, we are also establishing EMC strategically for the long term. There's no shortage of market opportunity and we've never been better positioned.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Joe who will give you more color on the outlook, the quarter, and the vast opportunities that lie ahead.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. I would like to begin by adding my welcome to everyone who has joined us for today's conference call. Thank you for your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q4 and I am proud to report that Q4 capped a truly strong year for EMC in 2010. A year marked by rapid growth, market share gains, financial leverage, and significant investment in technology innovation. Even more important is the fact that in 2010 we positioned ourselves very well not only for 2011 but well beyond.</p>
          <p>I would like to publicly congratulate the 49,000 people of EMC and VMware on their many accomplishments and thank them for their leadership, their laser focus on our customers and for their dedication. And on their behalf, I would like you to know that they are charged up and excited about our future prospects.</p>
          <p>For sure, EMC and VMware are clear thought leaders with compelling technology that will help our customers on their journey to private, public and hybrid cloud computing, which will enable the massive benefits that IT as a service has to offer. Namely, increased agility and significantly lower costs.</p>
          <p>Today I will not talk much about our cloud strategies or our innovative products services or partners, as in exactly two weeks from today we are hosting a strategic forum for investors and analysts. Paul Maritz and I would like to invite you to join us for this event in person in Boston or via the Web.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make a few comments on the 2011 macro environment and contrast this outlook with what we saw one year ago as we began 2010. Last year at this time we said we expected IT spending to grow 3% to 5% in 2010 and we said EMC's TAM, or total addressable market, would grow considerably faster, in the 6% to 8% range. We also said on that call that EMC's plan for 2010 was to gain share and we set our goal to grow faster than our TAM, our 2010 target was $16 billion, which represented a 14% growth.</p>
          <p>We now believe IT spending grew in the 7% to 8% range in 2010, EMC's consolidated TAM grew 10% to 12% and EMC grew 21% or to be totally fair a little over 19% on an apples to apples acquisition adjusted basis. For 2011 our forecast is for EMC global IT spending to increase 5% to 7% and EMC's TAM to grow in the 8% to 10% range. And as David has said, our plan is for 15% growth to $19.6 billion, while growing non-GAAP EPS to $1.46 per share, an increase of 16%.</p>
          <p>As is our custom, the outlook we provided you today of $19.6 billion in revenue and $1.46 per share is exactly the same numbers our Board of Directors has approved for management's plan. Additionally, EMC's board will also approve a free cash flow goal for management at our upcoming board meeting which we will share with you in our proxy.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we will focus on growing faster than the markets we serve, thus taking share, provide financial leverage and continue our investments in innovative products and solutions, and as always we will strive to meet and beat our plan.</p>
          <p>So, what gives us confidence in our future? First is our belief in our cloud/IT as a service vision, which is tightly coupled with a very developed strategy for private, public and hybrid cloud computing. Second is the incredibly rich and I do mean incredibly rich, product lineup and road map we have going for us in 2011.</p>
          <p>Third, the timing of that product road map. For starters, the fact that one week ago today we launched a record breaking 41 new and enhanced storage products. This gives our sales force and channel partners virtually an entire year to sell these high value products. And, by the way, we are far from done, there are many more exciting products which we will launch throughout 2011.</p>
          <p>Fourth is our preparedness to take those products to market and delight our customers via our well trained and motivated people, via technology and service partners, via our channel and distribution partners, via our programs and via our VC coalition with Cisco which is now 700 people strong. Our best of breed convert infrastructure products and message is resonating very well with customers as VCE continues to outperform its plan by a considerable margin. And fifth and very importantly is our momentum and our will to win.</p>
          <p>With that, I now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call. Tony.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. Just a question around the March quarter, historically the quarter tends to be down about 9%, 10% for you guys. Do you think it shakes out any differently this time given the fact you have a lot of product refreshes that I believe will generally be available later in the quarter and how do you think margins will shake out in the March quarter as well?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Amit, let me comment on the seasonality of the year. We don't give quarterly guidance but what I'll tell you is we expect the contribution of each quarter from a revenue percentage basis to the full year to be relatively consistent with the historical averages. And if you look over the last six years and you kind of draw on an average of that, we're expecting roughly similar contribution to total revenue from each quarter.</p>

          <p>Thanks and congratulations on good numbers and guide. David, could you give us a little bit more color on the impact of Isilon on the top line and how accretive was it to your annual earnings guide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we're obviously expecting Isilon to continue to grow nicely from what was a very strong 2010. I pointed out to you in my remarks that in the fourth quarter they did better than the guidance they gave on a standalone company, so that's a good sign going into it. Not going to give a specific number for the overall 2011, but I'll tell you it will be nice growth from 2010. As we mentioned to you, when we announced the acquisition, it's going to be marginally accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2011. It's a big investment year for us in 2011. And we also said by the time we get to the back half of 2012 we get up to that billion dollar annualized run rate between Isilon and Atmos, at that point in time it will be contributing at a level more commensurate with our overall operating margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Congratulations, guys. My question is on free cash flow generation, I know that you guys give a number target in your proxy but over the last couple of years you've been running 19%, 20% roughly of revenue from free cash flow or about a rate that's about 30% higher than non-GAAP earnings. So with that as we look forward given what you've talked about in guidance, is there anything that changes that trend or how should we think about free cash flow generation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aaron, you're right. We've done a very good job. We continue to expect to do a good job of driving our free cash flow higher than our non-GAAP net income. At the moment we're still kind of finalizing, or fine tuning all those details. We have a conversation coming up with our board. So at this point in time I'll tell you that we're confident that we'll continue to show healthy growth in 2011, and we should be well above our non-GAAP net income, but beyond that we just need a bit more time to give you a more specific number.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on defying the law of numbers too. The growth is impressive for 2011. I wanted to get greater color, if I could though, David, around the operating leverage. You've made some significant investments in R&amp;D in 2010 and you are taking up your 2011 operating margin target above what the consensus is expecting. But I want to get a sense in terms of R&amp;D. How much wiggle room do you have there? Could that drive another point or so of operating margin improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Mark, when we look into 2011, and we've given you roughly 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin leverage, the biggest piece of that, over half of that is going to come from continued improvements to our gross margins. And the gross margin improvements come from a couple of areas, obviously volume helps, but we also pointed out this year the mix shift, particularly within storage towards our higher margin products is a good thing. We expect that to continue into 2011 as well. So expect a little bit more than half of the operating margin leverage in '11 to come from our gross margin, and then within OpEx, expect probably a little bit more from SG&amp;A from &#x2013; than you'd expect from R&amp;D.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. As we know, everyone in tech is dealing with tough compares going into 2011. But in light of the 41 new products you announced last week, do you think you can maintain or maintain close to the 17% growth you saw in the storage business, particularly in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Katy, you're right we are facing tougher compares and we've given you an overall growth number of 15%. So if you think about that and you obviously think about what VMware's growth numbers are, then we're expecting a little less than 15% for the overall ex VMware business so not at the 17% range. But I still think that we'll be &#x2013; we've given you a growth rate for the year that's going to maintain significant share gains, and we're very confident about the competitive position we have. We expect to gain shares in all the major segments in the storage marketplace this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Katy, we'll talk to you more about this in two weeks. But we really think that we're on to the future of storage when we &#x2013; kind of the vision for both enterprise data and what we call big data, and we think that is definitely going to help us propel our growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on that last question. So if I strip out VMware's guide and I strip out about 500 million for Isilon, the implied growth for the rest of the business is about 10%, which is in line with what you said the market growth would be around 8% to 10%. So considering the product refresh that you just had, is that conservatism or is that an expectation of the market growing slower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Rajesh, first of all, we gave you a TAM which is for the overall of the business, so the TAM, the total addressable market growth we gave you 8% to 10%, is what we believe the weighted-average growth rate will be of all the markets which we're serving including the <mark type="inaudible" /> marketplace, including the VMware market. So you can't really take our overall growth and then strip out those two pieces and compare it to our overall TAM because now you're comparing apples and oranges. Obviously the addressable TAM, if you took out Isilon and VMware would also come down from a growth basis as well. And you've picked a number for Isilon, we're not going to comment upon the specifics but that would be exceptionally high growth for Isilon in 2011.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I was just hoping you could spend a little bit of time talking about the impact of the VNX and VNXe transitions on midrange gross margins in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well in terms of gross margins, we're expecting the combination of the two to be relatively gross margin neutral. We are expecting to get a little bit higher margins on VNX. I mentioned to you before that if you looked at our traditional mid-tier business, our NAS margins for the Celerra line were a little stronger than our SAN margins on the CLARiiON line and the converged infrastructure has a stronger software stack and we expect to get slightly higher margins there. We expect VNXe on average to be slightly lower margins, obviously we're into a more competitive price point down there but in total we expect the two to be relatively neutral to our overall gross margin profile compared to 2010 in the midtier for those two segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add a bit of color, our margins in the midtier, even on the older products, are pretty good. Our focus is not as much on getting more margin percentage in the midtier, it's getting a lot more growth and a lot more margin dollars in the midtier. And that's going to be the real brunt of our focus.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>It sounds a little trite, but it was pretty much what we expected. I mean, for sure the recovery is broad based, big financials and the financial sector is certainly strong, Telco's are showing good signs of life, the manufacturing base we have, retail. It was pretty broad based. So we're very pleased. And the growth in storage is significant. And obviously we've got to give our customers tremendous value.

          <p>Hi. Thanks guys. Just a comment on the call about I believe cloud related conversations or engagements growing 40% in the quarter.

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ananda, I gave you a couple of data points relative to that. One, I think the one you're referring to is we talked about the number of professional consulting engagements we're getting in terms of helping customers define their cloud architectures or their journey to the cloud up 40% compared to Q4 of last year. And this is kind of at an all time record level for us. Quite honestly, if we had more people with our consulting skill set we could be doing more &#x2013; even more than we're doing right now. There's certainly a huge opportunity and a great appetite amongst our customers to help them lay out those road maps. So we think it's a very good leading indicator for how quickly people are going to move their technology forward as well.</p>

          <p>David said it right. The interest is incredibly high. Probably as many people as we could possibly free up to consult and talk with our customers on the cloud subject, whether it be private side or public side, for sure we could absorb. So the interest is high. Customers are planning, and we expect 2011 to be the year that this really starts picking up and continuing on to 2012 still on a pretty good upward trajectory.</p>

          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. Joe, I wanted to ask about VCE. It seems like field commentary has improved recently. There were some changes made to the structure last week. But any additional metrics you can offer up and how big of a deal is VCE long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean, the biggest thing we changed is part of what we did with VCE was funded by the four founders of EC, a company called Acadia and that caused a lot of confusion because the initial concept there was that we would build these converged infrastructures, private clouds and public clouds out for our customers, run them &#x2013; help our customers run them and then eventually turn them over.</p>
          <p>And what we turned more Acadia in is a real kind of systems house which basically is helping customers spec out their needs and doing old fashioned selling. And that's been well received, and of course Michael Capellas is the Chairman and CEO of that. I said it's 700 strong on its way to 1,000 this year. So it's &#x2013; neither Cisco nor us are giving any specific data points but we did set out what I thought was a fairly aggressive plan, and again I said we were considerably ahead of that plan. So it all points to good things ahead.</p>

          <p>Let me do it this way. For sure our relationship with Dell has moved from strategic to tactical. For sure it's now mainly competitive. To give you some evidence of that fact, our OEM, the Dell OEM business with CLARiiON, our CLARiiON business to Dell that they OEM was down to approximately $55 million in Q4. And kind of as a reminder Q4 has been historically our largest quarter of the year with Dell. So the Dell driven revenue now, which is their OEM business, the one they drive by themselves, is actually getting quite small now. And I might add that our other channel &#x2013; midtier channels grew over 44% in Q4. So obviously you can see we're a major focus.</p>
          <p>Now that being said, we have thousands and thousands of joint customers with Dell that we sold together or Dell sold using our products. And we will &#x2013; and many of those customers expect us to work together. And for our part we are most willing to work together and there are discussions underway. So while it's highly, highly unlikely, almost impossible that they'll sell VNXe, there are some considerations that they will resell the VNX and those discussions are undergoing. But I want to kind of end it where I started. It's a tactical partnership. But again when we partner in front of customers, we'll partner strong. And if we give our word that we'll go together with a customer, we'll go together and help our customer. So that's kind of where it is.</p>

          <p>Okay great. Thank you. Last quarter you talked about the three different phases of virtualization, the first one being IT-owned apps and business critical apps and then finally IT as a service. Could you just give us some thoughts as where it is, has it changed much quarter to quarter and maybe as you look out to 2011 we get to year end where do you think the customer mix might be for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first phase is mostly, virtualize everything you can. IT took the lead, CIO took the lead in the applications that they were in control of and tier three, tier two apps are the ones that moved first, and the results were nothing short of fantastic. With the advent of vSphere, customers started then getting enough confidence and most customers now are in phase two where they're now getting those same kind of benefits by moving their mission critical apps and that's going quite well. And that's the phase we're in now and probably will stay in most of the year, all the year, in my opinion. A few leading edge customers and getting into next year customers will want to move to true, more IT as a service, self portals, giving users more agility, giving users more control, making applications run under a set of metrics that are policy and service level based. And kind of that's where this journey is headed. So I would say we're just in the beginnings of step two.</p>
          <p>Two interesting data points, right now there are more, as server shipments go, more applications are running on &#x2013;  or not as servers &#x2013; as applications go, more applications now are running on virtualized servers than they are on physical servers. So that kind of chasm was crossed actually in 2009 and that trend is continuing to grow. That being said, of the potential that customers could virtualize, they're about 30% there on that journey. So again, pretty healthy data points, the ROIs are fantastic and the quality of the virtualized infrastructure from VMware is fantastic and customers are going to continue to invest there. And also as you know that has a tremendous impact on security and storage and protection, which we take care of from the EMC side of the family. So all signs are good.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. If you look back at 2010, clearly the two of you have seen much faster growth when you look at the product revenue indicating share gains and presumably from the more traditional larger IT vendors. As we look into 2011, can you just talk about your 15% growth target and understanding that the only &#x2013; product is only a portion of that, but is there more share to gain or to be had from the traditionals, or is this now a zero sum game with share battle between kind of the pure plays or maybe we're underestimating kind of the overall market again given some of the key secular trends, can you just give some color on the balance of that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll go back to an IDC study which came out last year where they said and they predicted that information that's stored on disk arrays will grow 44 times from the end of 2011 through 2020, 44 times. So information is still growing. And like always that information needs to be protected, that information needs to be secured, it needs to be managed and it needs to have intelligence added to it. And those are all things that we are &#x2013; that EMC is focused on. And so we see great potential and so it's not a zero sum game.</p>
          <p>Obviously our plan is to take advantage of the expansion and new features the customer wants. We want to take share, and of course, expand into new markets. An example of a big, big new market is this video based big databased side of the storage equation, which is going to be huge. So we're very optimistic, and again we'll chat a lot more about that a lot more in two weeks.</p>

          <p>So again I want to just thank everybody for joining us. It means a lot to us that you have this great interest in EMC, and we thank you for that. Hopefully you got out of today we have a good plan, and we are very excited about our prospects, not only for 2011 but beyond. And once again I'd like to close by inviting you all to join us for our strategic forum on February 8th. Have a wonderful day, everyone.</p>
