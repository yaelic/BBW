          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss First Quarter 2010 Results. We have simultaneously webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english. Before proceeding, I would like to draw your attention to the slides 2. We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras management on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS and Brazilian Legislation. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues related to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter and he will be available to answer any questions you may have. Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss first quarter results. As compared to prior quarter, net income and EBITDA increased 4% and 5% respectively. These results reflect the combination of greater sales volume, higher realization prices for our exports and for products sold in Brazil, and stable operating costs.</p>
          <p>Investment spending grew as we continue to expand on our integrated basis. We began the Extended Well Test in Tiro and S&#xED;don, discoveries made only in 2008 and we continued to find more oil both in frontier area and new horizon in developed fields. Our Board has approved the range of capital expanding during the next 5 years of between 200 billion and $220 billion and has authorized us to continue these plans to increase our capitalization. I will discuss the capitalization later during the call.</p>
          <p>Next, in the first quarter, total oil and gas production was 2,547,000 boe per day, up 3% over year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Our total production in the first quarter was reduced by shutting off 78,000 boe daily of gas capacity due to winter domestic demand. In April, we set a monthly production record for Brazilian oil of 2,033,000 barrels per day, and a single day record of 2,084,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Next please. The next slide is a review of units to be installed into 2010. You may add them to 375,000 barrels per day of new oil production capacity and the 33.2 million cubic meters per day of new capacity as well. Tiro and S&#xED;don gives a promising light oil discovery in our postsalt sandstone reservoir located in the shallow waters of Santos Basin. We are beginning a test of this reservoir less than 3 years following the discovery. Our ability to produce so quickly from our new reservoir is an example of the flexibility of our operations and the breadth of our resource base.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight that we will install Brazil's 2 major non-associated gas system this year, in Mexilh&#xE3;o and Urugu&#xE1; Tamba&#xFA;. Together, they have a combined capacity of 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This year, we are also completing our natural gas infrastructure, which will be capable of delivering offshore gas production anywhere the Brazilian market demands. All that we will be needing now is gas demand currently restricted by above average rainfall, which has limited the need for thermal electric power. Over time, as the Brazilian economy grows, we fully expect non-associated gas to play an important role in Brazil's energy metrics.</p>
          <p>Next please. In the pre-salt, we continue with activities we had previously announced. Results continue to meet or exceed our expectation. We are now drilling 5 appraisal wells in Santos pre-salt. We will begin an Extended Well Test in Tupi Northeast using FPSO-Cidade de Sao Vicente, which is being relocated from Tupi.</p>
          <p>The pilot production system for Tupi will begin production in the fourth quarter this year. We recently signed a letter of intent to charter a unit for Guar&#xE1;, the first chartered units will be built principally in Brazil. The ANP has made promising announcements about the Franco well drilled by us outside our own concession and we recently spud in on a second stratigraphic well to increase knowledge of this area.</p>
          <p>Let me move now to volumes and prices, which are the key determinants of our results. As one can see from the graph on the left, the average price of Brent was virtually flat quarter-to-quarter, while the continued narrowing of light/heavy differential increased the value of our oil by $3 per barrel. Year-over-year, the price of our oil has increased from $32 to $73 per barrel. The increase in value placed on our heavy oil is reflect in higher exports revenues.</p>
          <p>From the graph on the right, one can see that average realization price for products sold in Brazil increased slightly due to those products that adjust bi-weekly to international prices. You can also see that the difference between our average realization price and the international price continues to converge although we still benefit from higher margin.</p>
          <p>The fact that our realization price in reais was higher during the first quarter of 2009 than it's to-date, while the price in dollars of our own crude oil has more than doubled has led to important shifts in the earnings of our upstream and downstream segment. For the company as a whole, our pricing policy has stabilized our cash flow and highlights the importance of our integrated model.</p>
          <p>Next. Lifting costs remained stable. Despite the price of our oil increasing by $41 per barrel in the past year, lifting costs increased by less than $2. Even though the small increase is largely explained by the strengthening of the real against the dollar.</p>
          <p>Next please. Brazilian GDP growth bottomed during the first quarter of 2009 and has rebounded sharply since then. Diesel has increased due to GDP growth and an exceptional harvest this year.</p>
          <p>Gasoline consumption is at 25% because of higher price of sugar reduced ethanol supply; thereby increasing ethanol price and reducing demand from flex fuel cars. The reduction of anhydrous ethanol from 25 to 20% in regular gasoline also contributed to higher gasoline sales. Natural gas consumption by the industrial sector has recovered in line with GDP, but demand from thermal electric sector continues to be limited.</p>
          <p>Net exports have increased year-over-year due largely to growth in oil production exceeding internal demand. This trend should continue over time. During the first quarter of 2010, planned refinery shutdown led to higher export volumes and lower import volumes of crude oil. The decline in refinery output and the growing demand for diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, and LPG was met by increasing imports.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year, the company has swung from a financial debt to a surplus in trade balance due to higher net volumes as well the reduced differential between light and heavy crude oil, as well as lower crack spread between the products we export and the products we import.</p>
          <p>Next please. Turning to financial results, net revenue increased due to higher sales volume in Brazil and slightly higher realization price. The 3% average devaluation of the real against the dollars and the reduced light/heavy differential contributed to higher exports revenues. The increase in cost of goods sold was largely the result of higher volume.</p>
          <p>Operating expense declined by 9% despite provisioning of a series of judicial claims of nearly 1 billion reais. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating expense were higher due to expensing of dry holes and impairments, primarily Pasadena Refinery.</p>
          <p>The combined results of these factors led to an increase in operating income of 20% from the previous quarter. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher financial expense. In the first quarter, real weakened 2% against U.S. dollar versus a strengthening of 2% during the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>During the past year, the net liability position of assets and liability subject to exchange variation has increased from 12.7 billion reais positive to 32.3 billion reais negative due to an increase in debt that is denominated or linked to the U.S. dollar. Because of this increase in net liability subject to financial variation, our financial expense in reais has become more volatile, although our income in our U.S. dollar financial statement will not reflect this volatility.</p>
          <p>Taxes increased as a result of higher operating income and less provision for interest on capital in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in minority interest expense is a result of improving gains from consolidated subsidiary, mainly in financial results. Net profit for the quarter was reais 7.7 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Next please. Higher international prices primarily from the reduction in the light/heavy differential contributed positively to our Brazilian exploration and production segment's earnings. Stable lifting costs and excess of dry hole expenses and other impairments typically taken in the first quarter also contributed to the gain in operating income.</p>
          <p>Next please. Operating income for our Brazilian downstream segment was reduced as realization price in Brazil moved closer to international levels. Higher sales volume and a small increase in average price did not pull up set increased costs due to high international price for crude oil end products.</p>
          <p>For net cracking spreads, our average still exceed those of the Gulf Coast as they have done since November 2008. More programmed maintenance during the period led to reduced throughput also contribute to higher per unit cost. Programmed maintenance reduced the utilization rate from 94% in the prior period to 90 in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Our remaining business segments contribute positively to earnings. Gas and power continues to increase earnings despite limited thermoelectrical generation. Greater supply of natural gas and more developed gas infrastructure permitted higher sales of contract energy. Increasing natural gas consumption from industry also contributed to the improvement.</p>
          <p>The international segment earning increased primarily because of higher pricing during the period. The international segment also benefited from absence of write-offs that are typically recognized in the first quarter. Our Distribution segment continued to generate reliable end-margins, generating R$566 million in operating income as they grew market share from 38.6 to 39.5.</p>
          <p>Capital spending increased to 17.8 billion reais during the first quarter of 2010, an 22% increase from the same period a year earlier. Most of the increase was concentrated in refining. Our capital expenditure for upgrade and for regulatory requirement actually &#x2013; while construction of the Abreu in Lima and comparison to refineries has began. Spending was supported by our strong EBITDA of 15.1 billion reais versus 13.5 billion reais during the period a year earlier.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flow during the quarter was 9.7 billion reais versus 13.7 billion in prior quarter and 12.4 billion reais from the period a year ago. The sequentially lower operating cash flow occurred despite higher EBITDA as higher cash generation was offset by an increase in networking capital as a result of increasing accounts receivable, inventory credits to suppliers, and reduction in short-term tax liability.</p>
          <p>Despite the reduced operating cash flow and increased CapEx, we have maintained our comfortable liquidity position with 27 billion reais in cash and equivalent at the quarter end.</p>
          <p>Next. As a result of our increased capital spending, net debt to net book capital increased to 32%, while the net debt to EBITDA analyzed was 1.35 times. Both these ratios are comfortably with the financial target set by our board of 25 to 35% net debt to net book cap and 2.5 times EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Next. Now, let me discuss the capitalization, which I assume is what everybody has been waiting for. I would like to first note that we have made effort to keep all our shareholders informed of our plans and our thinking, but since the form of capitalization does not depend entirely upon us and certain elements depend upon information that is still not available, we have been limited in the guidance we can provide.</p>
          <p>The next step would be for our board to convoke the Extraordinary General Assembly of our voting shareholders. The convocation mails occur at least 30 days prior to the assembly as customarily done in similar public offering related transaction in Brazil. The convocation will request authorization from our shareholder to grant the authority to our Board to increase our voting and no-voting stock up to a certain limit and determine a final size in terms of the capitalization and to take all other necessary steps that's required.</p>
          <p>We do yet not know where the capitalization will be with or without the Transfer of Rights. The valuation of corresponding barrels has not been agreed nor had we yet finalized our business plan for our 2010, 2014. Therefore, the amount of capital increase that the general shareholder meeting would authorize our Board of Directors to approve would be for a maximum that should accommodate all reasonable outcomes. If we are to meet our deadline for completing the capitalization during July, we would need to file in the first part of June the required documentation as well as the first draft of the Brazilian prospect with CVM and the prospect supplement with SEC.</p>
          <p>As per CVM regulation, CVM would have 20 business day periods to review and make initial comments. On the final documentation and related Brazilian prospects, the information that needed to CVM and the SEC will be public. Although, it is not expect to include final details of the transaction such as the evaluation of the barrels or other terms &#x2013; of the terms they operate. Once the CVM has reviewed and agreed to the disclosure within the Brazilian prospect, we would be able to begin marketing the transaction, aiming at completing the transaction by the end of July marketing would need to begin in the first half of July.</p>
          <p>Just to review some key elements, the timetable, and when we hope to have additional information we may share, first, as customarily done in similar public offering related transactions in Brazil, our board would cover up the Extraordinary General Assembly of our voting holding shareholders. The Extraordinary General Assembly towards the end of June would grant powers to the Board of Directors to approve the capital increase as it is the standard fair requisite for the preparation of Brazilian private offering.</p>
          <p>The market will know at the same time as Petrobras whether or not the transfer operate is approved by the Congress. A vote is scheduled for the next week, but we will have to wait and see what happens. The 2010-2014 business plan is expected to be approved and released by the Board of Director in the first half of June.</p>
          <p>Finally, if the capitalization is within Transfer of Rights, they are both of corresponding the value of the corresponding barrels, the methodology applied to reach that valuation and the terms by which the Transfer of Rights may be revalued will also be disclosed before or simultaneously with the marketing of the public offering. There are a number of other details not mentioned here, but are detailed in our prior release. What I had tried to focus on here is the general timetable and our best understand of when information will become available. Thank you.</p>
          <p>I would be happy to answer any question that you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Gentlemen, have you decided whether it is going to be a value offering or a normal secondary offering? And also, the time line you are talking about May, the announcement of the extraordinary shareholder meeting. When the report is going to &#x2013; I presume you already have a date when you are going to actually announce it. Can you give &#x2013; I know you went through that, but can you give a little bit more definitive time line in terms of which week that were you expecting that is going to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The convocation of the general assembly maybe addressed through the Board soon. We don't have yet a date, but as soon as they approve, we will be releasing information of that. We hope before the end of the month we'll have some news on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, before the end of the month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have for the first question that you had, we have announced already that we have decided to go for our public offering and no longer rights offering as we have announced back in the beginning of this process. So the decision and the indication that our Board has given to us is to go ahead with public offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Almir, can I just ask &#x2013; split a quick one in here, with the uncertainty on the Transfer of Rights and how much do you end up have to pay or with the Presidential election coming up in October and depends on who is going to be the winner there, even if the oil law being passed this year that they may get resubmitted at the Congress I presume potentially next year. With all the uncertainties, is there any particular reason why it's so important that you get this equity offering done, let's say, within such a short period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe first of all, we have time enough to do this offering and to conclude it by July. We don't think we are short in time at this moment. By all the measure, all the timetable we have put in place here and are looking at, we have time in that, what of course we are gaining is the approval of the Congress and this is more difficult item to control. We have no control at all. We hope the bill that has been sent to the Congress is going to be voted before the end of the month.</p>
          <p>As I said, we &#x2013; there is an announcement that they are going to vote next week. We hope we will be concluding &#x2013; they will be concluding this process by then. If so, we have plenty of time. We can do it in these 90 days or 75 days that we have up to the end of the July. And this is the best we can do because we have a large budget. We are executing this year 88.5 billion reais. And as you have seen, our leverage has increased 1% in the course of the first quarter. And as we can project keeping this high level investment and compare with our EBITDA, operational cash flow, our ratios would be going towards some stress. And we prefer having such deep plan ahead of us with such a large company and so successful in doing all the operations we are carrying on to keep the best way the financial of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Production of bio fuels in Brazil, either the sugar cane or the biodiesel, and it requires not much money as well. So we are keeping our strategy. We are not &#x2013; I understand we are not diversifying from what we had said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Maybe just a follow-up question on Portugal, it also looks like you're getting interested in evaluating Portugal from an exploration point of view, and so maybe you could go into that plus also is there any relationship developing with Galp? There was some market rumors number of months ago about the potential of swapping your ENI's interest in Galp with yourself. I don't know if you have any comment on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far regarding Galp, we have not established yet, yet there have been many rumors. We are always looking for opportunity. Galp is a company that is &#x2013; that it grows to us their main asset are here in Brazil. So &#x2013; and we have the opportunity here to develop these biofuels, but this is the only deal we have in place so far. And we are doing exploration offshore Portugal. We are in deepwater's offshore Portugal associated with Galp as well.</p>

          <p>The next question we have comes from Frank McGann with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good day. Just 2 very mundane questions actually. One is the gasoline sales were very strong in the first quarter. I'm just wondering what your trends are so far in the second quarter and how you see that developing? And lifting costs, do you see any reason that the level that we saw in the first quarter for pure lifting costs would not be continued as you go through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gasoline demand, it is going to reduce in the second quarter, because end of April the mix between gasoline and our Enel's ethanol has changed to 25% again of ethanol, and new crop of sugarcane is starting now. So more ethanol shall be offered to the market and the demand for gasoline is expected to go back to the normal volumes that we used to sell. And lifting costs, we are working in different ways to keep it as well controlled as we can. And as has been shown, we are about 2 years or more than 1 year is about the same level of lifting cost, but we have here our colleagues from E&amp;P <mark type="inaudible" /> Costa, would you like to add something regarding the lifting cost please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there just is last &#x2013; during the last year, the lifting costs, we've been able to keep the same level based on both the reduction on material and services, the improvement in the scale of the operations and also helped with the exchange rate and the performance of the entire operation at Campos Basin. That's it.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Ricardo Cavanagh of Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. Well, good morning and thanks for the call. I have 2 questions that relate to association between investments and well the equity capitalization. The first question, if the capitalization is done in the next few months, I assume certain cash disbursements are likely to accelerate. Could this mean that in upstream there could be an acceleration of the investments in developments to augment production, and in downstream, could it affect the base of planned investments for the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question also on investments, under a scenario where capitalization might have to be postponed until 2011, would there be any flexibility to reconsider planned investments for the year or rather Petrobras will allow to temporarily operate close to maximum leverage levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting from the final question, I'd say that we had rather decided to go for the capitalization in this next quarter, July. And this is decision not to postpone it to next year. We are aiming to keep the level of capitalization, the ratios of the company in a sound basis. So there is no &#x2013; at this moment, we don't consider the other alternative to do it in 2011.</p>
          <p>The first question was regarding the adjustment of our CapEx, we do not &#x2013; so there is no possibility of adjustment of CapEx this year because of no capitalization. We had a certain level of flexibility to adjust the CapEx, but we are not considering it. Of course, as further in time is our project more flexibility we have, if we consider the current year we have left to adjust, even though we are not taking this into our account because we are considering to do it in June, July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thank you for that. And then on the first one, well, assuming the capitalization go through, are we &#x2013; can we see an acceleration of investments in, let's say, in upstream or downstream or we are going to keep, I mean, the company is already investing at the pace you would like to &#x2013; you would be investing for the rest of the year, meaning in other words what if the capitalization provoke on acceleration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the same way, we are not considering to reduce our budget for the year. We are not &#x2013; there is no possibility to accelerate as well. We have done our budget, it considers the best we can do for the company at this point in time. And it is a challenge to do all these investments in an year. The first quarter was 17.7 &#x2013; 17.8, it means that 4 times that is not 88.5 as we are aiming at. So, with time we normally grew the volume third quarter of CapEx, but acceleration is almost being possible. We are doing it in a very high speed and very high level and doing the capitalization would not change this program. It's part of our program to do the capitalization and to realize what we have announced.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I have 2 questions. The first one on the capitalization process again. I would like to understand, Barbassa, what exactly is the approval that you guys will be seeking from the shareholders meeting, meaning, is it going to be a range kind of a minimum range which will probably be &#x2013; will match the follow-on with no barrels and the maximum range that will match the inclusion or the acquisition of those barrels? And also, if the approval touches on the structure of the capital increase or if it's even though it states that it has to be a follow-on or if there is any move that can be used to go ahead with the capital increase in any other way? So that's question number one.</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do a little bit with the valuation of the barrels and the adjustment mechanism, be it once AMP gets its report from its consultancy firm or that 2 years, 1 or 2 years scheduled review, do you &#x2013; could you take us through a little bit on the &#x2013; at least on the thinking of how this reevaluation is going to happen in the case of AMP, if the idea is to do with barrels, how does that affect the potential size of the capital increase, so I would like to get a little bit more color on that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What we are looking from our Board and from our General Assembly is to increase the authorized capital, capital authorized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the company. By doing though we have to say how much we went and the total we are looking as a ceiling and the capital increase can be done inside that ceiling for any amount. For example, if there is no rights transferring, we can do only the capitalization that would be much less than Board's transaction together. This is what we are aiming now and this is what we need, just opening space to do whatever we are going to do. And doing 1 or 2 transactions depends first from the Congress and then the &#x2013; as the capitalization is a decision, we are going to do it. And this is what we are going to look for the shareholders assembly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the original idea, I guess, is that the government subscription would somehow match the valuation of the barrels, meaning, so that the government would contribute with the bonds and then pay the barrels with those bonds. So is there is a situation where you go for what we call the drive follow-on, the follow on with no barrels now. And in the future once the bill is approved, you can use cash to buy the barrels or then you would call for a second capital increase and then the government subscribes with the bonds, is that the idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm supposing that if the transfer of rights is not approved now, it's going to be rejected. So what lasts in the table is the capitalization only. I don't count on a situation where the deal that you used in the Congress will remain there forever with no voting, they &#x2013; I believe the Congress is going to go vote.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the revaluation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the revaluation. Revaluation, that shall be happening 1 to 2 years after the transaction. It is going to be based on a formula that shall be in the contract, because this &#x2013; the transfer of rights from the Brazil, the union in Brazil, the National to Petrobras shall be regulated by a contract. And the contract we are already discussing with the government, we had read the first draft of this contract and we start discussing it. And 1 item of this contract is the item that will bear the formula for reappraisal of the price of the barrel.</p>
          <p>And we hope we don't have yet this formula final &#x2013; in the final formula, but we are aiming to have it in a way that there is no difficulty to apply whether 1 year or 2 years later. Just looking to some indexes or prices or whatever it is going to comprise for and apply it and adjust the numbers. How it's going to be set if we are going to pay back to government or receive more from government, but I don't know yet how it is going to be establishing the contract also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There is no way to agree. We &#x2013; this is going to be the main discussion on where we are going to establish the price of the acquisition that shall be in the &#x2013; shall be using the right transfer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And presumably this information will be made available during the road show or whatever, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If we have it done by then. If not, it's going to be at least by the road show. We hope to have the reports from the engineering company that is under contract with Petrobras. And we hope they are going to produce their report in due time. So we hope to make these &#x2013; with these to the shareholders and informing them what is the price we are seeing. And considering the situation of this transaction where there is no risk of reserve. So we expect any other appraisal on that value would not defer much from the figure we are going to have. That's what we believe would give more information and give to the shareholders the comfort of the transaction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think it is too early to evaluate the consequence of the &#x2013; and really to understand what happened, really happened in the Gulf of Mexico. But Petrobras applies the best knowledge, the best technology, and the best practices in all of our operations, and we work with the best companies in the world like Transocean and all the drilling and servicing companies. And based on these, we are not considering any change in these procedures. And we will keep following the API, the American Petroleum Institute Standards and the best practice recognized by this institute. Then today we think that we have to wait until we best understand of what happens there and to reconsider any of these procedures. Okay?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I had a &#x2013; I guess a more general question, it's an easy one, Almir. In listening to your sort of sending the message that it's full steam ahead, but clearly the market in the world has changed and continues to change, it's amazing. The dynamics for a deal like this have weakened and continue to do so. If oil prices or euro crisis this new offshore thing with BP and of course your sort of tabled with the elections in the fall. Petrobras has clearly shown that it has access to capital all different forms and those loans from the Chinese a few years back were a good proof of that.</p>
          <p>And I continue to believe that they are still around. But pricing of this deal of course has to be always enough to motivate investors to participate. And as you pointed out you don't want to get into the summer month of August, you need as many folks to be participating and given the size of this to be motivated to participate. So, it brings to me to the question of price, you're going to have tons of advisors helping you make this decision, but how much is price a consideration here in terms of moving forward with the public offering?</p>
          <p>And then I sort of move back if you're not satisfied with price, it seems to me that you still have an option on the table and that is to form down some of your positions with those same other folks that are always happy to give you money. Has that been brought up as a consideration in this period in order to raise those equity dollars I bring that up because all the investors that want to participate in this capital increase and I imagine want to buy the E&amp;P side of the story, they don't want to buy the downstream, it's always been the case, but they have to buy it as a package deal. So I guess the question is, might you consider if the pricing erodes, if oil prices are $60 tomorrow and the euro is about to explode and Greece is about to fail and you still want to get this deal done, what is your backup plan? I know you've said you don't have a backup plan, but -?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And what I guess I'm, what I'm also trying to address here I mean Almir is, well, I don't think anybody wants to see as you, and you can easily do this, get another 10, $15 billion loan or short-term loan from another export deal or even a &#x2013; even an asset-back deal because of the impact that would have to the ratios, you could do that same deal with those same parties for equity, I guess is my question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not explore these alternatives. We are &#x2013; we've been successful in accessing many different sources of financing in terms of debt and this is one of the characteristics of Petrobras. We've been successfully raised last year $42 billion what is an amazing amount. And this year, we had some extra debt as well. But we did not explore this alternative of, let's say, strategic partner. We would like much better to go to the world market, and to have well spread base of shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just as a technical thing because this is now viewed as a public offering as opposed to a capitalization. There is no preferential right given to existing shareholders. Is that right, so there is no record date or issues as it would relate to a traditional rights offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but there is no rights offering as we were doing if we were to conduct the rights offering. But we are going to give a privilege, a priority to the current shareholders. They would be the first one to get the opportunity to make their proposals.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. A number of quick questions, Almir, I think in the past the assumption is that the government will serve as a back stopper for any amount that you want to raise in the event that the minority shareholder don't subscribe they're going to come in and fully subscribe for that. Did we gain any expressive guarantee from the government that or understanding from the government this is what they are going to do here?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The government would &#x2013; if we do only the capitalization with no transferring of rights, the government is not going to be diluted. Their decision is to follow with the proportionate share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but &#x2013; I am saying that in addition to not only diluted if the demand because of all the uncertainties running with those companies as well as in the macro environment in the event if the market condition is top end that we don't have sufficient minority shareholders subscribe to it, their corresponding share or their capital structure if the government have any kind of expression that they would come in and fully back stop this transaction for you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't have this information from the government. If there is a right transferring, yes, they are going to &#x2013; they have said or read &#x2013; they would like to increase and they are there to buy the offering in a large proportion than they have shares. But regarding only, the capitalization experience only one transaction recapitalization, I don't have any information. The only thing that I can tell you is that they will not be diluted, they will fall at least on the ground of their proportion on the total of share.</p>

It seems like it still pretty aggressive number. What are underlying field decline curve that you are assuming in here and also if there is any major maintenance in the first quarter that have made the first quarter production to be lower than otherwise it will be?</p>

          <p>Hello everybody. I have 2 questions. One, if you could give us your current estimate even if it's raw about how much money do you think you would need just to cover any budget deficit to finance the existing business plan as we know it. And whether &#x2013; you know just for us to know how much you would need to raise from either from the equity markets or from the debt markets combined?</p>
          <p>And the second question would be if you could talk to us and give us more information about the Franco discovery whether &#x2013; I think ANP has said that it is comparable to the Tupi find or to the original estimate of the Tupi find, but I don't know you could elaborate on that like what is the &#x2013; whether these 4.5 billion barrels that has been estimated, if it's a P-50 number, what is the range, and whether there is an implicit recovery ratio associated to this number that is comparable in fact to the Tupi discovery?

          <p>Okay. I guess related to the Franco discovery, should we expect that at the time of the road show if this deal is approved should we expect at the time of the road show, this information should &#x2013; will be made available to shareholders?</p>
          <p>And second, yes, Almir, I was referring to your estimate on the 5-year business plan whether you had an estimate of the size of the budget gap that you would need to fill? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't have it yet, but I hope by mid of June we'll have it, the business plan approved after the Board review and approval. Before that any number I would give you would be a speculation and I cannot provide this figure to you.</p>

          <p>The next question we have comes from Jeffrey Grossman with Hudson Bay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Just going back to the public offer mechanism, could you just confirm that your PBR holders will get priority rights as well in any offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they order &#x2013; of course, the priority has to be exercised, they have to place their order at market price. If they can do this, yes, they will be granted the right, the priority as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Through JP Morgan, the depository?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know the &#x2013; yes, it's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Yeah. So there is a depository although I think that, the question of the priority is how &#x2013; there is still a lot of details to work out. I think we'll leave it at that, but just to answer your question, JP Morgan is the depository.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any difference between a Brazilian right and a U.S. ADR holder right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no &#x2013; we can give the same right to everyone. It is a matter of local legislation. If they &#x2013; they allowed to place an order, for example, subject to a price that shall be established by the book building later on? I know that in Brazil, we can do that. I'm not sure if there is a way to do this same kind of proposal or place an order in the United States and an order that will be subject to a future price, if they can do this in one or another way they will have the same priority</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the event if there are leftover shares, will existing holders get priority to take those up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be different rounds. In the first round, the current shareholders would place the order and can tell if they will be prepared to take some shares that are not sold &#x2013; the excess not sold. So they can increase the participation. So &#x2013; they can &#x2013; this part of the first proposal, they are going to offer to their book building.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify was it that, if there is no transferables, was that the government did not express its intentions yet is that what was said in terms of dilution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the government is going to participate at the same time as every other shareholders. So I don't know what they &#x2013; how they are going to manage the shares. If they are going to increase or not, if they are going to candidate themselves to buy more shares, if there is no right transferring this is a subject that will be dealt by the government, I don't know.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Gustavo Gattass of BTG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, Jeffrey just asked my most important question, let me just ask you one very quick question on &#x2013; in the basket of ratios that the agencies look at for investment grades, I just want to understand how important is a net debt to reserve ratio, is that something that you guys think is relevant for the decision-making process or is that one that's not that relevant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe the rating agents, they don't follow only one ratio. They have many different ones. And I believe that net debt to EBITDA is maybe more important than net debt to net cap, but -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wasn't even thinking about net cap &#x2013; I was thinking about reserves, net debt to proven reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, they look at that too, but that's a very good &#x2013; we are not concerned on that. Petrobras is a very cheap company at this moment regarding this index and that tends to keep this ratio, because as you well know, we have a very nice potential of new reserves to be incorporated as proved reserves.</p>
          <p>And as I said, we are going to receive another 7 rigs for ultra-deep waters during the course of this year and we have 7 operating now. So imagine how many new wells we are going to do and how would be the speed of new reserves incorporated in the group reserves and then this is not ratio that concerns us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for being with us in this opportunity to see the results of the first quarter of this year. They were very good, you are &#x2013; we're much more interested in the capitalization and I understand that it's very important for us and for all the shareholders. We hope we will be adding information as soon as we get them regarding this capitalization process and hope to have you soon here for the next quarter results. Thank you very much.</p>
