        <plist>
          <p>I guess I am wired up now with the &#x2013; all the technical. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and also for those who are following us with the webcast for &#x2013; ready for the takeoff of the Results Presentation '07. Joining with me Ren&#xE9; Hooft Graafland, our CFO, who, most of you or all of you know, I hope. I'm feeling here like in a cockpit of an airplane with a radar screen and joysticks and what have you.</p>
          <p>Going to the &#x2013; I hope I got the right button, now, that it works. That is to &#x2013; as a test, of course. It said, "Next." So normally, the thing should work, I suppose, when I push "Next." Can somebody help me out? It's not the first time then, thank you. And let's try it again. No, it doesn't work from my side. So, I will continue to say next and next, again.</p>
          <p>All right, thank you. We had, in 2007, an outstanding year, as we published this morning. We delivered on what we promised, with a 23% net profit increase, BEI, before exceptional items, as you all know. Back on the 7% of our volume increase, 10% increases of Heineken in the premium segment, again. And we proposed a 17% increase of the dividend per share bringing it to &#x20AC;0.70 per share.</p>
          <p>Now, this is &#x2013; and it still doesn't work. So, I would like the next slide. Yes. The &#x2013; to arrive on how we did &#x2013; how do we did achieve this &#x2013; these very good results in 2007. Now, for sure, in the first half, as you remember, we had &#x2013; we enjoyed very mild winters in most of the parts of Europe, especially in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. But it is not, of course, the winter who made up for the biggest part of this great year. We, once again, enjoyed great volume increases in Central and Eastern Europe, in Africa, and in the Asia Pacific regions. We were able, again, to pass on the input price rises that we had to face in '08 that was around 8% into our sales prices. We could, again, improve our mix, pushing the high end of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We developed the Heineken brand and the innovations, which go with it, another 10% in the last year. For doing so, we have been increasing slightly on the ride of higher sales. We have also been increasing slightly our marketing expenditures behind our key brands to sustain that growth.</p>
          <p>And on the other side, we have been able to deliver, and a bit faster than envisaged, on our Fit2Fight plan and bringing down the fixed cost ratio from 33.1% to 30.7% in '07. Now, this all resulted in a structurally improved EBITDA margins, which increased from 13.3 to 14.7. This is the engine of the profitability, and a lot of efforts on our side goes into that.</p>
          <p>Well, that is all the results of voluntary action of a determined attitude of our organization and our people, and that is just to say that Heineken is in a good shape. And the proof of that is, perhaps, in the next slide, and I think it now works. As the key metrics of revenue, EBIT, BEIA, and net profit split-up on a period of &#x2013; every time on average of two years. The first period in yellow from '04, '05 in the second from '05 &#x2013; '06, '07 and you really see as a result of all the actions that we have undertaken in '06 and '07, the step change in the kind of growth that we are able to produce on all of that &#x2013; our key metrics of results. Now, I guess, I'm really not lucky with this thing. No. Want back? Thank you.</p>
          <p>That is based on, once again, a higher an acceleration of the growth of the volume of Heineken in the premium segment. We saw a kind of growth of slightly above 4% in the first period and above 10% in the second period. But also our overall portfolio volumes in our consolidated beer volumes grew from 1.1 to 6.8%. So, really an acceleration. And the last thing and Ren&#xE9; will detail more on the Fit2Fight program. But on the other hand &#x2013; on the other end of the business, we have invested a lot of efforts in our Fit2Fight program and that brought down over from 2004, where the ratio was still 35.4%. We brought it all the way down to 30.7% in '07.</p>
          <p>The Heineken brand delivered &#x2013; next slide please, the Heineken brand in '07 delivered again 10% growth. Across all regions, a fairly good growth, 2.2 million hectoliters of extra Heineken sold in the premium segment this year. 400,000 to 500,000 hectoliter in each region, noticeable, as the growth of Heineken brand, again, in Western Europe, in markets which are not known to be really booming. In terms of absolute volume, you see here again that in the premium end of the market, we could gain market share and increase our sales. A very good growth and I will come back to that also in Central Europe and Africa, the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Now, I will now take you to a tour of our operations across the five continents, starting with the largest one on the next slide please, which is Western Europe. Now, Western Europe is accounting for 40% of our total EBIT profit pool &#x2013; operating profit pool and only 27% of the volume. So clearly, in Western Europe, when we speak about mature markets, we speak also about a value game and not of volume game for us.</p>
          <p>Now, I have said it in the presentation that I gave on the 25th of January when we announced our intended acquisition of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, what is interesting for us in Western Europe, which is mostly reported as being mature. And frankly, lots of time associated with decline. Now, this is not the case for Heineken, because we associate Western Europe, first of all, the southern region of Western Europe is still growing for the category in most of their markets. Again, had a bad year, but overall, you see still a growing trend of the consumption of beer in countries like Italy or Spain or Portugal or Greece. So, the southern belt of Europe is still increasing. And overall, in Europe, even in Northern Europe, the beer is &#x2013; the bear as a category is not really increasing in terms of volume. The name of the game is premiumization of the market, the appetite of the consumer for new propositions for innovations for specialty beers. And this is why &#x2013; where Heineken plays its role and its year-after-year engineering growth in the top end value of the market.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we did well again. You see that the volumes, the overall volumes went down 0.6%. Now the mild winter gave us a first half, a strong first half year was plus 1%, and the rather poor summer overall, and particularly in North Western Europe, may that the second half year was 2% down the year before. But the whole game of premiumization, innovation, pushing that &#x2013; in our portfolio the brands with the higher margins that let to a revenue increase of 1.8%, nevertheless, across the region, that combined with efforts on our Fit2Fight program and you will see that a lot of half of the whole Fit2Fight program comes from that region, has been able us to show still a growth of 5% of our EBIT over the last year.</p>
          <p>Now as I said, the Heineken brand grew 7% in the region. The Heineken brand as a premium proposition is already 24% is close to a quarter of the total sales we do in the Western European region. But also, other brands like Pelforth in France, which is a mainstream brand, which we are currently upgrading, and France is growing 11% with a good pricing, Cruzcampo, in Italy &#x2013; in Spain, sorry, and Moretti in Italy are also growing. And we are really attached of always making the higher end of our portfolio growing. And it is not necessarily a volume gain per say. I gave already that example, I think in the half year figures that, for instance, in France, where the market was level in the pressure in 2007. We have also deliberately let a contract with legal go, because the profitability in those kind of contracts was not anymore what we expected to be. So, we prefer for going some volumes with very low profitability, but go for the value end of the market. That's really the name of the game in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>I turn to the other region of the Europe. And I ask for the next slide, which is Central and Eastern Europe and there the picture is reversed. It is 40% of our &#x2013; 42% even of our total volume and only 24% of the EBIT pool. This is though a region with a much stronger growth profile, of course, it's Western Europe, that's starting from a lower base in terms of profitability per hectoliter, but it is growing quite fast. In the first place, because in most of these countries, the category is still growing, but there again, even if we play a game with larger portfolios, we cover typically a bit more mainstream than we would do in Western Europe. But there again, the name of the game is to be sure that we are over present or we have more than our fair share in the higher end of the market.</p>
          <p>Now, we have been strongly increasing in practically all the countries where we operate, 15 different companies with the noticeable exception of Germany, which was really under pressure this year. But which has a very low impact on profitability on the whole region. But overall, we saw excellent performance everywhere, with big numbers in Russia, Poland, Greece and Romania.</p>
          <p>I mentioned here that the input cost increased substantially in the second half. This has been a special feature of this region as we have been &#x2013; having higher sale growth as expected. And by and large due to the very, very mild winter in Russia. The problem was very visible in Russia, where we have no entry though. So there was higher volumes in the &#x2013; than predicted or than budgeted for us in the first half.</p>
          <p>We had also to replenish our stocks and our raw material. So, we have had quite hefty increases in '07, which were not planned and not covered for, where usually we tend to always start the year with a full coverage in terms of pricing and quantity we know where we go. So in Russia, we have been experience a kind of a &#x2013; lot of difficult period with that concern, because we have to scramble to find some additional malt to just follow the demand and that has &#x2013; that came at a cost, because as you can imagine in Russia, we are not the price leaders. So, we have also to fix our pricing a little bit in function of what the other players are doing in a fairly competitive market.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have been increasing also our footprints. You have been seeing that especially towards the second half of the year, where we have made a step forward in the Czech Republic, building on, it was the acquisition of Kru&#x161;ovice, which is not only giving us Musketyr in the Czech Republic, but which is also a very good &#x2013; what we think is a very good export, a very good Czech export brand with some allure and that we will &#x2013; we intend to exploit in other places than only to Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>We have been entering Belarus, which for us is still a virgin territory, at the end of the year. We have been entering Serbia, which also for us is a virgin territory in Central Europe.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, we have signed a JV agreement with Efes Brewing International, where we have basically merged our business in Serbia and in Kazakhstan, whereby, we take the lead in Serbia and EBI takes the lead in Kazakhstan, where we are much smaller. And we go for a venture together in Uzbekistan, but where clearly EBI is in the lead of management. But in all countries, our Heineken brand will of course be represented and present and developed.</p>
          <p>Now, that is a little bit an overview of Central and Eastern Europe. Now, I go to the Americas. The next one. Now, in Americas, the game, it's all about the Heineken brand. The volume of the Heineken brand is &#x2013; that is 16% of the total consolidated volumes we report. Now, we had, yet again, a good year. I'll start with the USA.</p>
          <p>The U.S. market overall grew with 1%. The import market grew with 2.5%. And our portfolio of premium imported brands grew by 6%. So, we took clearly the lion share of the growth of the imported beer segments in the U.S. in 2007, and that is good news, with a contrasted picture, though. On the one hand, you see the Mexican brands, which enjoyed the highest growth rate with 14% year-on-year. You see on the other hand of the spectrum, and we have published that Amstel suffering 11% decline in our loss. But still growth was the Heineken Lager and Heineken Premium Light.</p>
          <p>So, overall 6% growth from the total portfolio, a good performance, a solid performance, and the USA remains for us a key market and for development, for attention and for profitability going forward, even with a weak dollar, that has to be underlying that the effect of the &#x2013; of the dollar or the decline of the dollar towards the euro has been fairly limited for us as we have been hedging on average only 1.27 to the euro. So that has limited the impact of the dollar for this year. We were happy in the United States to renew our contract with FEMSA for another 10 years, starting on the 1st of January of this year '08. We have been also happy to renew our contract for Brazil with the same FEMSA Cerveza do Brazil. And we enjoy albeit from a small base, we see that in Brazil a premium proposal like Heineken is really start to take off and to make sense.</p>
          <p>We have renewed our contract with Molson Coors for the distribution of Heineken in Canada, enjoying also there &#x2013; two digit growth and good results. And finally, our joint venture in Chile and Argentina through CCU has performed in an outstanding way, sales growing double digits in Argentina, single digits in Chile. Operating profits growing double digits in &#x2013; for the CCU group and the Heineken brand alike. So, really a very, very strong performance of CCU.</p>
          <p>Now then I turn to the next region, which is Africa and the Middle East. Now it ranked after the U.S., it could have been ranking before or the US, the Americas. It could have been ranking before the Americas, because this year, in terms of a profit generation, Africa over took the Americas for the first time.</p>
          <p>It has been &#x2013; by this &#x2013; the strongest or the fastest growing region that we have in our portfolio. Of course, this strong performance is first &#x2013; in first place based on the overall political and economical climate, which we enjoy on the continent, which is much better than five, six years ago. And &#x2013; but on the other hand, it should be underlined that in all countries where we operate, we gain market share. There is no one single country where we do not gain market share. So, it's really a very, very strong operation.</p>
          <p>We do that with a lot of local champions, like you see Star in Nigeria but also in Ghana or Primus, which is a common brand we have in the DRC, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi. All these brands are really developing on a fantastic way and also Heineken grew by 38%. And it's now representing 10% of our total sales. But it also indicates that we still have a lot of ground to go. Noticeably is &#x2013; I think if you look at the picture, the margin improvement that we realize in Africa, a jump of 340 basis points in our margins. Typically, here you find the kind of margins that you enjoy in the emerging markets. Africa is not without risk, but bear in mind, that we operate in the African continent since the mid 30s and that Heineken has always kept in its midst a &#x2013; an expertise on how you have to operate in these countries. And we have also been constantly investing in these countries and keeping our assets and our people at the level required in order to make our market leadership a true story and also a very profitable story.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to underline is to &#x2013; of the South Africa market and you will remember that in the beginning of the year, we have been regaining the control over the Amstel brand, which was licensed to SAB since the mid 60s. We have been enjoying a growth and a good business together with SAB. But as I said earlier, situation have changed, from good partners we have become world competitors of course. And we have had the occasions to take back our brand and to build it to take our own destiny in our hands back again.</p>
          <p>The brand was put on the market fairly rapidly after the end, the termination of the agreement with SAB. So, the agreement was terminated end of March, if I recall well, and early July we were back with cans import from Europe, and as from September, with the full range of bottled products. This has been a huge and big logistical operations to organize that because we sourced that all from three different countries. And I must say that the organization has performed very well. We are very happy also to distributor markets. Amstel in the Republic of South Africa through Brandhouse, which is a joint venture we have with Diageo, and which works on a cost sharing basis and which basically sells the beer brands Heineken and Amstel, Guinness, the RTDs and the liquor brands of Diageo.</p>
          <p>And there has been an excellent commercial and sales instrument to get Amstel on an imported base, fairly quickly back on the ground in South Africa. And we are now considering to build, of course, a brewery to revert back to local production. As this is, as you can imagine in terms of margins, slightly more attractive than continuing sending it from out from Europe.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, as Africa, we have believers in the African continent. We have been investing in January of this year in the new brewery, the Tango Brewery in Algeria. We have been &#x2013; we are building a brewery in Tunisia. We are building extra capacity in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Central Africa at large. So, it's really a booming continent business for us.</p>
          <p>I turn to the last region, which is the next slide, which is Asia Pacific. As ever Asia Pacific has delivered a steady growth. Here again, our story with Asia Pacific, it is again all about Heineken. Heineken is 40% of volume and even more of value in that region. It's a story that we started for the Heineken brand some decades ago. But it's a story of growth and success that is still going ahead.</p>
          <p>We have had very strong volume growth, essentially in Vietnam, Cambodia and also in New Zealand. And the Heineken brand grew again 11% in the region. And we have been expanding our footprint through APB in Vietnam, India, China, Laos and Mongolia. Some have been acquisitions like in Vietnam and India, but we have also engaged into new sites like in Laos and Mongolia and also in India, where we build new plants.</p>
          <p>So Asia is a story of development. The bulk of this development comes of course from APB. But we have also our own operations, which should not be neglected, and which also are on the rise. That is Indonesia and the export operations that we have in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, which we do for ourselves, and last but not least Australia. So everything is on green and going the same direction in Asia.</p>
          <p>This completes my tour of the world of the existing business of Heineken, and I end up with the profit outlook for 2008 which is on the next slide. All of this is pointing to the fact that we are still able to drive a better sales mix through our business, market by market, with a portfolio of champion brands, which deliver the highest share of the value in any given market where we operate. And a concentration of ours on a world scale on the Heineken brand, because that is the premium &#x2013; the undisputed premium brand of the world.</p>
          <p>Remember, this is 20% of the market share of the international premium market for beers in the world and it is twice as big as the immediate followers being Carlsberg and Corona. So we see going forward our ability to engineer that growth in &#x2013; for the Heineken brand and to engineer the growth in the mix.</p>
          <p>We see a further increase of the consolidated beer volumes, very nice story about Asia and Africa, and we are also convinced that we are able to fully pass the higher input cost that we face yet again this year for '08 in most of our markets with noticeable expectation of the USA, where we did not plan for a price increase. But otherwise, that we are pretty confident that we can pass on the hefty input price increase that we got from the markets on our commodities this year. And our further ability to finish off the Fit2Fight plan delivering the last 150 million of gross savings to complete our 450 million planning and that leads us to make the outlook that, yes, Heineken expects 2008 to be yet another year of positive growth in our organic net profit.</p>
          <p>Now, I will proceed your question why don't you give them a precise guidance, and then I would revert back to the part where I said that we're able to pass mostly fully or fully in most of our markets the input price increase for us. It's extremely important that in the context where we face a structural increase of input costs we're able to pass that on to the market, because we have problems in place to save on energy, to save on wastage, but it's never going to compensate the kind of rises you have on the energy, on the barley malts, on the aluminum, that is not going to do the trick. So you have to pass that on to your consumers. There is no way, and we go for the maintenance, or say to keep the margins, that is for us the most important thing to do. It is looking forward is that we are not losing our margins going forward. The only uncertainty, which I think the whole industry after all, is facing, but all people, all industries which are using these kinds of raw materials that are on the rise at this moment in time. This provokes a more inflationary environment for these type goods than we ever had before.</p>
          <p>Now the effect on consumer demand is something that at this time of the year so early, we cannot really predict with accuracy and hence, we leave that a little bit open. Though, I want to repeat that we see growth definitely for the year to come.</p>
          <p>Having closed remarks on the 2008 outlook, I would like to give a few comments on our anticipated acquisition of Scottish &amp; Newcastle. I don't think I have on the next slide to repeat the key metrics of transactions they were all published and you have all studied them.</p>
          <p>Just to repeat, for us the acquisition is immediately earnings per share accretive and in principal will be also value-enhancing in year four. We will do that by &#x2013; and at this moment, in the identified program of synergies estimated at &#x20AC;162 million, and we are pretty confident that we will be able to realize that program going forward. And on the other hand, this is of course optimizing our capital structure, because we have been able to finance the whole acquisition by debt, and still leaving us with a very acceptable, indefinite level if I may call it that way.</p>
          <p>Now on the next slide, you see the compelling strategic rationale for the deal, the name of the game is the part that we take over, we contemplate to take over in Europe is aimed at leadership in Europe. The pro forma combination of our operations in Europe and the operations of Scottish &amp; Newcastle in Europe makes that, in terms of revenues we would be twice the size of the immediate follower. And I exclude Russia from our definition of Europe, but you would have a company, which is twice the size of the immediate follower, which happened to be Carlsberg by the way.</p>
          <p>It gives us leadership positions in the UK, an undisputed one, and very good challenger's position, solid number two positions and Portugal, Finland, Belgium and reinforces our own already strong position in Ireland as a number two. This is a strategic rationale. It's &#x2013; all these markets except Ireland where we have already brand Heineken, but Portugal, the UK, and Finland are certainly target markets for the Heineken brand and to engineer a higher growth than we have currently on the &#x2013; on our current business model in these countries.</p>
          <p>We see also in the portfolio of Scottish &amp; Newcastle some strong brands that we can use, that we can continue to develop in their own markets, but also outside the home markets and think about Syabar or some of the Ales those are certainly the propositions that we want to use going forward. Newcastle brand really is the most known to you, which will reinforce definitely in a very good way our portfolio of Heineken USA.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and last but not least, it's the key to India, next to very strong operations in Europe and I think that Scottish &amp; Newcastle has still so far also demonstrated that as operators in any given market, they are good also in the game of creating value in Western European market. They understand also what premiumization is, they understand what segmentation is. They also devote a lot of attention to innovation. So, we find here a kind of common ground and culture in how you have to work on the market to engineer value leadership, and that is very good news for us. And then I come back to the other part of the deal, which is the access to India, the stake of 37.5% in UBL, which is the market leader is of course a great entry for the Indian market, which albeit relatively small at this moment in time, is certainly if we look 10 to 20 years ahead, is certainly one of the most promising beer markets to come for the industry.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, and I said it in my presentation on 25th, and I really do believe that S&amp;N has great people. And in our business after all, you have two great assets. That's the brands, which you build over time and generation. But it's generation of great people who build these great brands. And I think that we came across a lot of really good, high talent in S&amp;N. And I'm looking forward that we can join forces, because not only are they able to operate their markets in a good way, but they will also definitely reinforce the Heineken Group as a whole.</p>
          <p>Now, the next slide is just giving a little bit an overview of where they are. I will, as a matter of time, not dwell into this chart and as it has been presented in great detail on the 25th of January, and some of you attended that presentation.</p>
          <p>And then I go to the next one, which is a time scheme just to say that we expect to completion of the whole process somewhere between mid-May and end of May. And one important moment in the whole process will, of course, be the general meeting of shareholders of Scottish &amp; Newcastle and when the acceptance of the offer will &#x2013; would finally flow through.</p>
          <p>I end up here my presentation. And of course, I'm looking forward to the completion of this deal. I end up the presentation here by a commercial about South Africa. It's an Amstel commercial this time, not a Heineken one, and it's just a commercial that tells that Amstel is back in South Africa. Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>Good. We go back to the figures. As Jean already said, 2007 has been a very good year in terms of organic net profit growth 26.5 or 20 &#x2013; no, 22.6% is the level we haven't seen for many, many years. And what is very positive is that it is driven by an organic EBIT growth of 20%. So it is really business related, this performance. And that is the result of, on one hand, strong top line growth, on the other hand, the effect of a very strict execution of the Fit2Fight program.</p>
          <p>If we look at reported EBIT and reported net profit, you see they are down, as they are heavily influenced by exceptional items. In fact, in 2007, we took exceptional charges of &#x20AC;307 million before tax, and that mainly relates to, on one hand, the EU fine. We got, secondly, the restructuring charges linked to Fit2Fight. Whilst in 2006, we had a benefit of 273 million before tax, and that was the result of the sale of the land in Seville. And so these two things make a big swing factor on the reported figures.</p>
          <p>But if &#x2013; as you are used from me, I will focus in my presentation on the figures before exceptional items and amortization of brands, the so-called BEIA figures. Dividend per share up by &#x20AC;0.10 to &#x20AC;0.70 per share, and that equals a payout of 30.5% and that is in line with our new dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Revenues, pretty strong in 2007. We added 700 million additional revenues and 7.3% organic revenue growth. The contribution from new consolidations was limited and clearly, this year we would expect to see a different picture when we include S&amp;N. That 7.3% organic revenue growth was build up over 4.2% volume effect and a 3.1% price mix improvement. Clearly, that good price mix improvement higher than what we have seen in the recent years is partly driven by the good performances of the Heineken brand with plus 10%. But it also shows our ability of increasing prices and upgrading the portfolio and that is very important in today's environment of rising input cost.</p>
          <p>When you look at our consolidated organic volume growth of 6.5%, that is mainly realized, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was explaining, in Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia where the overall beer prices are slightly lower than what we have in the Americas or Europe. So, you see that the effect on revenues is slightly lower with just over 4%.</p>
          <p>2007 has been very heavily impacted by weather conditions and in this slide you can clearly see that. Consolidated volume grew double the level in the first half compared with the second half and clearly, the mild winter and good spring in Central and Eastern Europe had a major impact on that. But it is very good to see that also in that second half with much average weather conditions we realized very solid organic EBIT growth with plus 14% or &#x20AC;119 million additional.</p>
          <p>Looking at EBIT before exceptional items and amortization of brands, EBIT was 277 million higher. Currencies had the negative effect of 36 million and that is mainly due to the Chilean peso, the naira, the ruble and the Singapore dollar and to a lesser extent the US dollar. The effect of the US dollar was relatively limited, as said, thanks to our hedging policy. In your presentation in the backup there is a slide on our current hedging position, what we have hedged.</p>
          <p>For this year 2008, we are covered for 85% against the rate of 133. Overall, organic EBIT growth was 20% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Here you see the development of our EBIT margin, very important for the operational performance of the company. As said, it's clearly the result of the combination of top line growth and cost reductions. We have achieved in 2007 an improvement of 140 basis points in our EBIT margin and it reaches now, or it stands now at 14.7%</p>
          <p>Looking at the EBIT and the EBIT growth and the volumes per region. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois made the tour around the region, but what I would like to stress is that in every region we had profits growth. Clearly, the biggest improvements were made in Central and Eastern Europe. And in Africa they accounted for two-thirds of the volume improvement. And Africa is now indeed our third biggest profit pool or profit region in the company. But also Western Europe again grew by 5%. This is by far our biggest profit pool and also on relative terms, it's very profitable and the profitability per hectoliter in Europe is very high.</p>
          <p>The 665 million EBIT we get out of Western Europe done with 32 million hectoliters that makes Western Europe a very, very profitable region. We are able to grow that year-after-year despite all the stories about, it is a mature markets. No, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was explaining, there are different segments or different opportunities and we are able year-after-year to increase value into these markets. And this is based on the premiumization of the market for which the Heineken brands we are benefiting from that. Price mix improvements year-after-year and of course, strong cost reductions, and these skills to manage mature markets we will certainly also apply towards the new markets which we hopefully get once the S&amp;N acquisition has been completed.</p>
          <p>Words on the head office, we discussed that extensively during the half year figure presentation. I repeat that this is an exceptional positive development due to a combination of elements, which played very positively in 2007. And that is mainly much higher royalty income and because of the growth of the volumes we have less losses in our central unit beer systems because now DraughtKeg and the other beer systems are really starting to become business, and so the support we have to get from this center in subsidizing certain prices to get them in the market is not needed anymore.</p>
          <p>We have to shift from marketing costs and from the center to local operations. So in total, marketing costs, we have an increase with where it was located. There was that shift. We have good results with our maltery in Belgium of course and we have lower cost at the head office due to also Fit2Fight program in India's office. So this improvement at head office is not sort of an accounting trick, no. it's all linked to the business but it is only reported in a central &#x2013; on a central level.</p>
          <p>Looking at net profit grew over 20% to over &#x20AC;1.1 billion. First time consolidations and currency for a limited effect and the organic part of the net profit as said many times was 22.6%.</p>
          <p>Investments, we have invested a lot in 2007. We have the gross CapEx of 1.1 billion and that is more than what we had the year before, and it's also more than the guidance we have given you. And on this chart, you can see where it has been spent on. 56% was in the production area. On top of the usual replacement investment, we needed to extend production capacities in the fast growing markets, markets which were growing much faster than what we would have thought. So, in markets like Russia, Romania, Poland, Nigeria, Central Africa, we have expanded production capacity. Of course, that cost CapEx, but it is good news.</p>
          <p>After that we finalized the brewery in Seville. And we finalized the brewery in Mongolia. And we are building greenfields in Tunisia; in the DRC, Lubumbashi; in India and in Laos.</p>
          <p>The strong demands in markets like Nigeria demanded as well acceleration in the investment in returnable packaging materials. And in 2007, we have invested 160 million in that category. In wholesale/commercial, accelerated investment in the rollout of coolers, the rollout of Extra Cold beer systems. And the last category, the category others was 8%. That includes IT investments, as you know, we are busy in getting the whole company on common systems, centralized the whole IT functions, and these investments are also reported in that column, "Others."</p>
          <p>Looking forward, looking at the programs we are running, looking at the projects we are executing and looking at the big project of the new brewery in South Africa, going forward, for 2008, we think that the gross CapEx level will be around &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the balance sheet. You see very strong net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.75. And that ratio will stay okay, even if we include the 6 billion additional debt to finance the acquisition of Scottish &amp; Newcastle.</p>
          <p>We have taken the Scottish &amp; Newcastle transaction on a pro forma basis in this 2007 figure and then you still get at an net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.7 times. And that leaves us comfortably within investment grade.</p>
          <p>The reduction of the cash conversion, you'll see here, has obviously to do with the high CapEx we had in 2007. The EU fine has a major impact on that cash conversion and the fact that we paid out, out of earlier made provisions, for the restructuring in relation to the Fit2Fight program. But as a business, you know we are focused on cash and we are a very strong cash generating business.</p>
          <p>Input costs, hot issue nowadays. This is a familiar picture for you where we compare the organic growth in input costs compared with the organic growth in consolidated beer volume. Raw and packaging materials together, up over 14% clearly that is partly linked to the volume, but the price effect of that in 2007 was 8%, fully in line with the guidance we have given you before. Raw and packaging materials represent around 20% of revenues. So if you look at our 3.1% price mix improvement, which we saw on the revenue slide that easily covers the increase in raw and packaging materials we have in 2007.</p>
          <p>If we look at 2008, the situation of the pricing is certainly not getting better. We have covered the vast majority of our requirements and we expect to have an increase on a per hectoliter basis of around 15% and that is the mainly the result of the raw materials, specially, malt, but also hops prices are increasing substantially already over the last two years. But we are absolutely convinced that based on the strengths of our brands we can pass on these input costs in our prices with the noticeable exception of the USA; USA, where we had very strong price increase in 2007, which was not effectively followed by the mainstream brands. So, the price gap has increased, and therefore we haven't planned any price increase for 2008.</p>
          <p>Past the check I would like to share with you is Fit2Fight, our cost program. As you can see on this picture, that is, progressing very well. We've realized 191 million gross savings in 2007, that brings to total of the two years up to 305 million and that is 68% of the total program. 2008 will be the last year of the program and we are fully committed to achieve this &#x20AC;450 million by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And as a result of that you see that we have achieved a strong decrease in the Fit2Fight fixed cost ratio, it stands know at 30.7%. And that means that in two years time we have big decreased that ratio by 400 basis points. And this program is clearly an important driver of the good results of the company.</p>
          <p>Looking at the geographical and functional split, not much changed compared with the update we gave you at half year figures, still Europe accounts for the majority of the program more than 80% is coming out of Europe. And of that of course, the majority Western Europe, but also Central and Eastern Europe is contributing heavily. It's a combination of many, many projects. It's a program going across the whole organization, and it ranges from projects like we reduced in the supply chain in Russia by more than 800 FTEs in that organization or the closure of the Bydgoszcz brewery in Poland announced end of 2006, but executed in 2007, the realization of shared services in France and The Netherlands, general head count reduction in a country like Switzerland with 65 FTEs or in Italy on the wholesale, closing depots, merging them, upscaling other depots, and by that reducing cost and headcounts. And so, there are many, many more examples.</p>
          <p>The Fit2Fight program, as said, will end at the end of this year. But you can be sure that the cost focus will remain in the company. Cost reduction, cost management is now an integral way of how we run our business, and we will certainly keep that going forward also after 2008.</p>
          <p>So, let me conclude. If you look at where we stand today, the company is in absolute good shape and you see, in fact, a different company now than what you saw in 2005, two years ago. 2007 was a good example of that. It was a very good year, 23% organic and net profit growth, strong volume growth, especially in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa, very important good price mix improvements, over 3%, able to pass on the increase of input costs, and we will do the same in 2008.</p>
          <p>Heineken brand continues to perform very strong, plus 10%. Fit2Fight, fully on track, 191 million savings this year. We will finalize the program in 2007, and we will finalize it this year and reach the 450 million. Strong combination of top line and cost reductions improved further our EBIT margin, now 140 basis points further 14.7%. And again for this year, we expect another year of positive organic net profit growth. And, of course, to end, we expect to enlarge our footprint and reinforce our global position via the acquisition of S&amp;N. That is what I would like to share with you.</p>
          <p>Before we go into Q&amp;A, you get a nice commercial from me, also not a Heineken commercial this time, also not an Amstel commercial, but one of our other brands. And it is the Corgo&#x148; brand in Slovakia, and it's a commercial for the introduction of the 1.5 liter PET bottle. As you know, in Central and Eastern Europe, PET is a very strong growing pack in markets like Russia. It's almost half of the market. But it was not yet existent in Slovakia. We as a market leader took the task to create that segment and we did that with Corgo&#x148; brand. And you see here the launching commercial. It's very much based on the functional benefits. It's light, it's unbreakable, it's closable, but we do it as it is beer in an emotional way. Let's have a look.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's Simon Hales from Dresdner Kleinwort. Two questions, please, both on input costs. Can you talk about the 15% increase in input costs you are facing this year? Maybe, if you could be a little bit more specific in terms of the way you are seeing that. You talked about raw materials and packaging, could you actually break it out a little bit more, do you think, Ren&#xE9;, in terms of what's malt, what's hops, how are you seeing that developing? And in terms of the price increases, you are going to put through towards PET-glass. Any recent examples of where you have put pricing up in the last few weeks, and the competition has perhaps followed suite or not in some markets? Any detail you can give us there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, what I said is it is much more on the raw materials than the packaging materials, and malt is the big driver and if you just follow the wheat prices, which is a thing you can follow on your screen, you'll see that in 1.5 years these prices have almost doubled. That doesn't mean that our prices will have doubled, but clearly there is the bulk of the increases coming from malt and hops, and much less from the packaging materials. Although in bottles you would see for instance a higher increase, because that's very much energy dependent, 30 to 35% of the cost of a bottle is linked to energy, so you can see that there. And the impact will be bigger than on things like paper or cartons and cans. About price increases, we have now in Western Europe where it is the easiest to compare, because in other higher inflation countries first of all it's easier to increase your prices, because it's right off everyday, and people are used to increasing prices. But if we look at Western Europe, you would see that in most countries we have announced the prices increases, and that to a great extent they have also been implemented. With some of the retailers in some countries there are still discussions, but across the board we expect to be able to increase our prices with around 4%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, we do. And first, still one in the room, and then we go to the people who are on the wire.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi. It's Chris Wickham from Main First. Just two quick ones. One, I was wondering just on the balance of Fit2Fight, I mean, it looks like you did 115 in year one and it goes to 191. Does it have to come crashing all the way back down to 144 or 150? You are saying, I mean, is there scope for an overshoot in 2008, so therefore you end taking more than the 450 gross and 200 net on Fit2Fight? And then, I was wondering on that sort of progression then where we are left in terms of your vision for 2009? I mean, should we think ongoing of Heineken as a company that's looking to take somewhere between 100 and 200 million of these kind of costs out on an annual basis?</p>
          <p>And the second one, I think, this is just partly in relation to S&amp;N, but in relation to how your various small diversified competitors in terms of brands. Since you always have a number of very good brands other than Heineken which are very strong in their local markets, I mean, Birra Moretti, &#x17B;ywiec, Cruzcampo, the fancy brands in America. I was wondering, perhaps you would give us a bit more flesh in terms of their pricing performance, their market share performance, and the amount of marketing spend you are putting behind those kind of brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the Fit2Fight. Clearly when you accelerate the program everybody is saying hey can you do more in the last year. Let's just go back to the beginning of 2006, where we started this program of this size in a three year timeframe, but as we execute a part of it in the last year, you will see an overflow in 2009. Clearly what we are saying now we will reach the full amount within the three years. That is an acceleration of the program. The program was a step change within the company to look at cost savings and cost reduction. It was a cultural shift in the company to get different mindsets in how to work on costs. We strongly believe that, that is now embedded in the company and that people all across the organization are looking at opportunities to further decrease costs. It's for sure that when you start a program like that, you will have more opportunities. You will have low-hanging fruit. But certainly we will continue to drive down the cost. But at this moment in time, we won't give you any figures. And it will be just a part of the way how we do business going forward.</p>
          <p>To what the brand portfolio concerns, obviously we are not going to disclose the kind of spending levels we put behind the growth of our &#x2013; what I call the blockbuster brands. Those are these brands which are positioned rather mainstream in the market but which in terms of pricing tend to be above mainstream. And the whole strategy relies on building a strong appeal, a strong emotional appeal for the brand, which allows you over number of years to move slowly by slowly, not in a very kind of bang way, but in a very gradual way, it allows to increase pricing on these blockbuster brands.</p>
          <p>Now I think the perfect example would be in Western Europe, Moretti. Now I am saying Moretti, because I worked in Italy, so that is it. And I would say that 10 years ago, Peroni was the undisputed leader in the Italian market. Moretti was a challenger. Now the strategy of Moretti has been to build a distinct strong image which the consumer liked, recognized, over time slightly increased above the mainstream kind of price that Peroni had and finishing off with a price level which is 10% above Peroni, and finally being bigger than Peroni. It took us 10 years to do that, but it's 10 year of consistent work on both the brand, the pricing, the value chain.</p>
          <p>And that is what we do. That is a concrete example of what we do with these, what I call blockbuster brands in all the markets where we operate. That's how we do it with Star in Nigeria, which in terms of value is certainly a brand which is clearly above the 100 index. In fact, the Star brand in Nigeria has an index 140 that which is quite a hefty price premium, if you think. It is still growing double-digit every year, and that is not something that you take out of the blue, brand building you do over quite long periods of times. And that discipline is what we try to reproduce in all our key markets, but that also takes time. So, when we enter a market, it does not happen overnight. That is what we will try to do in Romania. That's we &#x2013; what we will &#x2013; what we are currently engineering in Romania, in Russia, in these markets. But of course, if you take in the maturity of the business in our portfolio, Poland is ahead of, let's say Romania, and on par with Russia. But this is the strategy to what we work.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we always consider to have a portfolio strategy in which we are more and more able from time to time to have competing brands, so distinctly positioned. Again, I revert back to Nigeria, the Gulder brand and the Star brand, which in pricing don't differ a lot, in positioning they differ a lot. And we are able to engineer growth for both brands. Not easy to tell to marketers and salespeople, but that is what it is all about, about portfolio management. And that is what we try to do in most of our markets and typically, and sorry for being long but to be exhaustive on the subject, typically in the emerging markets we would be more present in the lower end of the market, avoiding the lowest end, whereas in more mature markets we will &#x2013; we move out from that lower and even in the index 100 that we try to move up the index 100 in the markets where we operate. There is where we put the money.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have got one question on the higher selling prices as well. You mentioned 3 to 4% growth in '08. Could you elaborate a bit on how negotiations are going with the big retailers, and it looks like they are getting away &#x2013; they are giving away some gross margin, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will not enter into disclosing the details of our negotiations with so many trade partners, if you allow me. What Ren&#xE9; has said just previously is that in the vast majority of our markets or with the vast majority of our clients we have already agreed on the price increases, and implementing also the promotional schemes across the year as we do every year with retailers. I am not excluding that here and there. We are still in tough negotiation with the retailer left and on the retailer right. But on average, it is going in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Gerard Rijk from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good. Good afternoon. Two questions about deteriorating trends. The first deteriorating trend is in United States. The trend in the Heineken brands continue to weaken in the second half while we are already 12 months after the serious price increase, normally that should have improved. Maybe you can elaborate on what's happening there, and what's wrong in that market with your own brands? Secondly, it's the deteriorating trend in the profit developments in Europe, Western Europe, as well as in Central and Eastern Europe, it's in Western Europe. We even see lower profits in second half versus second half. That &#x2013; while at the moment, that &#x2013; the cost phase &#x2013; the cost phasing has been &#x2013; has gone to 2007, so more cost savings have been in the second half of '07. And can you elaborate on this weakening trend, but it is certainly not only the weather conditions? Maybe it can be explained by delay in rising price &#x2013; raising prices or something like that, it probably needs some explanation? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel a little bit &#x2013; practically, a sense of a judgment in the question, but let me first answer on the USA part. The USA, the market in '07 increased by 1%. The imported segment by 2.5%. We operate with a portfolio of brands, and that is our strategy in the USA of premium imported brands in the USA, we increased our sales by 6%. That means that we got the lion's share of the growth of the premium segment &#x2013; imported segment in the USA in '07 our way. Now second, you come now for the development of the Heineken brand, it developed 1%. You will ask me, if I am satisfied with 1%? No, of course, I am not satisfied. What do we have to do about it? I have said it already in the half year's figures, we certainly have to beef up with, I would say, bringing back the wow image of the Heineken brand, which it always had in Unites States through better, more insightful, and excuse me using the word, more sexy advertising campaigns. We are currently working on that. The new team that has started of at the helm of Heineken USA is doing the work. We have hired a new agency, Wieden+Kennedy to work on that. More stuff is going to come up.</p>
          <p>So on the demand side, we are certainly geared to improve the situation. Though look that the increase of the Heineken brand is also a very patchwork of &#x2013; it increases more in one region than another. We were a little bit weaker with the Heineken brand in the Southeast this year. And a little bit stronger in the Northeast, which is counterintuitive and still growing well in the Central regions and in the Western regions. So overall, we are still in &#x2013; on the good way there. But your question about, are we doing the right thing? We can do better and we are addressing that. But this is what it is not to be called a weak performance, that I would not cross that line. On the other hand, we have a good increase on the Heineken Premium Light, which increased year-on-year 27%. We are still putting the money where our mouth is, which is we still have a lot of work to do for Premium Light. We recon that the Amstel brand is still in decline, again this year. So that is not good news for us. But I will confirm again that we will not let the brand go. And that there also fundamental work on the brand &#x2013; let's put it, brand advertising is currently underway. But on average the portfolio has delivered 6% growth. And the last comment I want to make about Heineken, it is &#x2013; we have to engineer growth on an already extremely big position. You don't have to forget that. Heineken is a big brand in the United States. So when you say well Mexican brands are growing 14%, yeah, but on a much lower basis. You have also to see the starting point where we get, so overall we are certainly not dissatisfied, but our teams on the ground are hard working to make it even better.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Then on the trends between H1 and H2 in Western Europe. First of all, you said it can be only weather related, but clearly if you look at volume development, which is &#x2013; was plus 1% in the first half and minus 2% in the second half, mainly caused by Q3. That is a market development you see that also in the reports of our competitors, and of course, that have an impact on the performance. Similar you see in similar pattern with the Heineken brand growing very healthy even in that not growing market Western Europe. But the Heineken brand on the yearly basis plus 7%, but if you again look at the first half and the second half it's plus 9 in the first half and plus 5 in the second. That had an impact. And the third thing is that we have an acceleration in marketing costs overall this year, but that was very much geared towards the second half of the year. A couple of reasons. First of all, based on the good results in the first half, we allowed our regions specifically the Western European region to invest in longer term brand building activities. We said that is important for the longer term sustainability of our markets to do that, and so they have started a number of programs where we should see the benefits going forward. Secondly, we have the Rugby World Cup in the second half of the year, which also played in the marketing. So you see a shift in marketing costs between H1 and H2. And that is mainly driven in Western Europe, so that gives the overall trend. But we are absolutely convinced that within Western European environment, we can continue to create value as we have done on the year, and don't get too much focused in on the first half, and the second half, because timing differences play a role in that. Similar picture, you see in Central and Eastern Europe, where yes also the volume, and the very strong first half played a role, but there it's not so much the marketing cost, but it is the input cost which as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois was explaining in his presentation played much stronger in the second half because we had to buy additional raw materials because of the strong volume development in the first half.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Sorry. Just first here on the cost again, in your statement fully passing on higher input costs, does that imply you will be passing on the absolute dollar amount of the costs, which mathematically means gross margins would be down? And secondly could you elaborate what's the situation with the fixed costs, what is the inflation you are experiencing there, because when you raised your cost savings targets to 450, it was on accelerated fixed costs?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>And just in regard &#x2013; the second &#x2013; following that is, you are experiencing that total beverage alcohol in South Africa with Brandhouse. Could you maybe give us your views on total beverage alcohol into the future especially with the key accounts in Russia consolidating, et cetera, what is the prospects for that in the next five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's a vast question. On the first, on the variable cost, the response is pretty forward, at least we have the cost to cover the cost of the material. I mean, that's the bill you have to cost, so indeed arithmetically you will have a slowdown of your gross margin. If we can do better we would, of course. But that is not something which is automatic. It's extremely depending on the competitive situation. We are not operating alone, but what you are faced with is essentially a bill with an increase of your input cost, and that is what you want in absolute terms to pass on to your customer. And Ren&#xE9;, for the fixed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the fixed cost, we keep our guidance for the inflation. You see that in some countries, and certainly in the new entrants in the EU that there is a tendency to increase of especially labor costs increase a bit more. But overall, it is within framework, which we have set out. So the gross savings, we keep that as an amount of 450. We &#x2013; the way, and I explained that many times, how we manage to program is that you want operating companies to come up with savings proposals, and with concrete projects where they save an X amount of money. That is what we manage and we don't want each time to say, "Hey, inflation is slightly higher or it's slightly lower." Now you can release a bit more or you should do a bit more, and we want to have it. It is a very stretching program for the company. We have set the target, we have after 6 months adjusted the target. But because we saw that we were much too optimistic in the inflation, we have addressed that at that time, and now we will just finalize it as it stands.</p>

          <p>Distribution in Russia was the last question. It's a vast subject, but you can perhaps sum it up in the fact that brewers have been choosing in Russia for historical reasons, which has mainly to do with the difficult line between the grey economy and the declared economy, if I can say that. So, not to go into distribution activities unlike other &#x2013; unlike in other regions. It means that we go through distributors and there has been a process of consolidation of these distributors going on, in some regions more than in others. The most extraordinary case is of course Moscow, which is served by four very powerful distributors. And so the name of the game in Russia is of course to have a compelling portfolio for a distributor. It's a little bit close to the model we have in the United States. But as in the United States a distributor is protected by law, this is not the case in Russia. And the business case goes on the same thing, it is margin times velocity, that's how it works. If you can provide margin and velocity that is what is going to make you going through a wholesale and access to the market. In a few cases, we operate distribution ourselves, but they are very, very marginal and in secondary cities. Russia is a very vast country, and so also our distribution situation is &#x2013; differs from region-to-region. It is clear that in the Northwestern region around St. Petersburg, with the business we have there &#x2013; that we have there, we have a strong distribution and stronger access to distribution as we would have in Moscow, where we concentrate essentially on the premium end of the portfolio. But if you go in Nizhny Novgorod, again we have very &#x2013; a comfortable market position, and we have a virtual circle of access to distribution. So, you have a patch work, but that's how it works. And if you look down into the future, I do not have the crystal ball, and I would certainly not be pinpointing to something that I would say today because in emerging markets situation can evolve quite rapidly. But this is the business model going forward, and so the name of the game is to provide for the right portfolio to the distributors and engineer that magic equation of margin times velocity is good sales.</p>

          <p>Could you comment please on what would happen to your bid for Scottish &amp; Newcastle in the event of a higher counter bid coming from somebody else, and is it possible for you to join that other alternative consortium? And on the second question, you said in your statement this morning that, the weakening economies basically makes it difficult for you to give volume estimate for 2008. Can you give us some indication of whether that means that your forecasting model, however you are looking at it, is that now broken or is it just &#x2013; is there some other kind of refinement that you are now looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, I am going to be extremely brief. I will not comment on speculations, and I would make absolutely no comment on your proposition. I accept your question, whether you will accept for me that I will not respond on that one. And on the second one, it is about the forecast. I think going through re-explaining why we are not giving a precise number, what we are confident with is we have our marketing plans. We have our Fit2Fight plan. We know what we do with our brands, and I hope that we have been able to demonstrate that. We are able to pass indeed the price increases practically everywhere. We are recognizing that in the United States, it is &#x2013; at this moment in time, we have not foreseen for that for the reasons we have explained. And of course we have budgets and business plans, and we have people aligned with targets, and they provide for growth or profits. What we can not say is the impact of higher inflation environment overall on consumer demand, and also for our category at this moment in time. And that is why we don't give a precise number. So, on one hand, you have a confident organization and a confident company going forward and looking in the future. On the other hand, it's difficult to pinpoint that. And why, because Ren&#xE9; was already pinpointing just to give it a practical handle. If you are in Russia, the beer &#x2013; the selling prices of beer in Russia are half what they are in Western Europe. But the impact of raw materials is in principal higher as what you would have in Russia. Of course, you have other components which are lower, but on average the impact will be higher.</p>
          <p>Now on the other hand, you are in economies which are in a booming mode. You are in an environment where salaries are also in a very booming mode. It could be well so that with higher consumer inflation that will generate a higher wage inflation at the end of the day, but the thing will still work. We don't know. I think, to the reverse, if you come into Western Europe, those are &#x2013; the proof of these is in very, very trivial things. If you go in the on-trade, and you are confronted with diminishing purchasing power if that would be so, would the on-trade location being the first sacrificed, or is it because the on-trade is raising the prices because I do raise the price. But the on-trade might not raise the price, because the price increase he will receive from the producer will be at the end marginal, and on the other hand, his profit multiplication factor is something like 3 to 4 times it's price, and it will swallow the kind of. So all of these things, they have to come together market-by-market and the picture is not clear. It is not clear for nobody. That is what will unfold. But that is not doing justice to strength of your company and its competitive behavior in the market, and that is why we say that we are confident in being able delivering growth. But we are not putting a precise number on that growth in this moment of the year. And in back of the &#x2013; yeah. Because they do like, you know, we never get the microphone.</p>

          <p>Hi. Chris Pitcher from Redburn. A couple of questions. Firstly, I don't want to dwell on the profit guidance again, but just to understand the variables that you are weighing up, is that the difference between single digit and double digit growth or is the difference between low double digit and high double digit? And then on the US, could you give us a feel for the outlook for profits in 2008, without a price increase with input cost inflation, and with the currency hit, should we expect profits downs in euro terms in the US? And then finally can you talk a little bit about the Efes arrangement you put in place, and in particular why that wasn't extended to Russia, and the important Moscow market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the profits forecast indeed it is between and between, so that's what it is. And secondly on the US there are sort of elements, which will play against us, currency, although the effect is still limited in 2008, and the 133 compared with the 127 we have in 2007. Not a price increase, but on the other hand the organization is working on a number of efficiency measures. They further optimized their whole supply structure. They have closed one demand point, and made it further efficient. You'll see that there will be volume growth in USA, because we believe that the imports market will continue to grow, so to have things to offset it. And we are not going to give a specific guidance for any individual market. As well not for the whole company by the way, apart from that we are growing in a positive way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On Russia and Efes, your observation will not do injustices to your analytical observation of course. And that we have chosen Efes International and ourselves to concentrate on Serbia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to develop business commonly, that's what we are looking forward to. And we remain competitors in Russia going forward. That is the situation. But I look very much forward collaborating with EBI on the three countries that we &#x2013; that I mentioned before. Yeah. You are first, because you kind of &#x2013; yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Michael Bleakley from Credit Suisse. Two questions, first of all on the Africa regions, where you have been meeting with some success, can you just give us an idea of where the international premium segment's share of total consumption sits in your major markets, and what do you think the kind of blue sky projections there might be? And then the second question is back to this pricing issue. If you look at the historic experience you have had with pricing up, have you found the consumer sensitivity in the on-trade more or less than what you find in the off-trade? And then can you just remind us for the European region, what percentage of your business in total is going through the on-trade versus the off-trade? And then what percentage of your Heineken brand business is going through the on-trade, through the off-trade in the European region as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part of your question is a fairly detailed question that I am afraid if I wouldn't have the table I couldn't respond. I do not have top of mind what in Western Europe the division is on-trade, off-trade, because it varies from country to country for sure. The share of the Heineken brand also between on-trade and off-trade, that also is a different story. But there is not something which is fundamentally different. Where we are &#x2013; we have a nice and good presence with the on-trade, we would typically have it in the off-trade also. So that is not a distinct feature of how we operate the Heineken brand. Historically though, when we were in early building up phase in countries like France or Italy, we have been building indeed the brand in the on-trade. If you look now, we still do that. But the off-trade is from time to time a better and an easier route to enter the market. So there is no general rule for that. And your first question was about, why is &#x2013; about the potential of the Heineken brand, and how far can you grow premium brands? That is a huge question where we don't know the precise answer, but we have countries like Greece which is the market where the Heineken brand has the highest position build also on a good price premium, its market share there of, I would say, over...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's over 20% even. So if you look at that, and you compare that then to other markets where we operate, with France for instance already at very strong position with only 10% of the market, and the main, major markets even below that then there is ample growth for further premiumization in our industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's more of an arts, than a science, due to experience what the limits are. And as Ren&#xE9; was pointing out about our price policy in the US, there is also a limit of where you can go with a premium brand in terms of pricing. And when you can start to have these propositions, where you have an 18 &#x2013; 24 pack of domestic at the same price of 12 pack of an imported brand like Heineken, that starts to be difficult thing for some consumers to grab. So in terms of pricing you have really to follow very closely how that is. But in a market like China we have a price premium of 400, 500% above mainstream. Mainstream brands there retail &#x2013; the factory price is &#x20AC;25 per hectoliter and we sell Heineken at &#x20AC;125, so five times the average price, which we have to do because if we would sell Heineken with even 100% premium, we would find Heineken made in China all over the place, so we have to keep a very hefty price premium in Chinese market, and still with such an extraordinary price premium which is quite unique, we are able to engineer growth. That's all. But you have to test these things. But we see most of the markets always, there is way going forward, and I think the Heineken brand has a very big reservoir of growth in front of it. Go ahead, Dennis. Nicole? Do we have a question from Nicole? No question from Nicole. Mr. Shackleton. He always comes.</p>

          <p>It's time the right wing had a question here. Ian Shackleton from Lehman. Just coming back on the guidance from a slightly different angle, when do you think you will have confidence? I know you talked about implementing pricing now, could you even have confidence by the AGM, or is that further out, in terms of giving us more concrete guidance for the year? And secondly on the Fit2Fight really I think historically you have implied you might not get the full year benefits through the whole 450 this year, can I confirm whether some of it might flow through into '09 in terms of the impact from the P&amp;L? And the third question is on South Africa where, if what we hear in the market is true, you actually had very a successful re-launch of the product there. Where are you in terms of market share, and where can that go to even before you open the new brewery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the guidance, it's not so much comfort, but it's more clarity on the situation. Ultimately, we will share that with you during the half year presentation. If there is another reason to do that earlier, we will think of that. But normally, the logic moment would be the half year results presentation. Fit2Fight, as I have said, we are expecting that we would finalize the 450 in 2008. That doesn't mean that there won't be an overflow of other programs and because we start in this year, again, a number of activities that they will then generate additional savings in 2009 and further on. But the 450 will be achieved in 2008. And South Africa...</p>

          <p>Clearly, our position with the Amstel brands was the leader in the imports &#x2013; no, in the premium segments. On an import basis, we are a little bit hampered, because we have only one-way packages, whilst a big part of the volume was in returnable. We are taking back a substantial part also of the returnable volumes, but it will really take off and you can talk about gaining share only once we go to local production, which is foreseen by the end of 2009. At the same time, the Heineken brands, let's not forget about that, in South Africa, again very strong growth this year with over 70% growth on the Heineken brands. And so clearly there you see that the whole Brandhouse construction where we combine different portfolios and really get clout into the market, and are also helped by the volumes of Amstel, imported Amstel, and that is really taking off?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect it to get back to around from what we had in 2006, so the 12.6%. Well, we are now at 12.9, and clearly, we have invested additional marketing funds in a number of long-term brand growing projects. We had also the marketing costs in the second half to re-launch or the return of Amstel into South Africa. But for this year, we expect to go back to the level of 12.5, 12.6.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one other question. Assuming an obscure scenario of a competing bid for S&amp;N doesn't happen, you have pointed to I think around &#x20AC;50 million of sales synergies that you hope to get out of that deal, which sort of looks like something around 3 million hectoliters of incremental volume. Can you give us an idea of where you expect that to happen, which countries, and which products?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the revenue synergies that &#x2013; which is in euros, 47 million over this timeframe of four years. There are a number of opportunities where we can cross sell brands in the portfolio. An obvious example always is, of course, the Heineken brand which gets a huge platform in the UK, but also in countries like Portugal and Finland, but you could also think of &#x2013; what?</p>

          <p>Yes, Newcastle Brown Ale in the USA. We are looking at the site of opportunity not only in the UK, but also outside of the UK. There will be combinations, where we use each others' platforms to further build the brands. And that is how we came to our revenue synergy amount.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where there is cannibalization, we have taken that into account.

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>The second question relating to transport costs &#x2013; really, there is substantial increase of about &#x20AC;70 million, partly due to increased road transport rates, but also partly due to shipping to South Africa for Amstel. With about half &#x2013; less than half a year of shipments to Amstel in the '07, can we expect a similar order of magnitude of increase in transportation costs in '08, partly again to load rates, partly due to the Amstel shipping costs for the full year?</p>

          <p>Damien Caucheteux from Petercam. On the price mix improvement, you said 3.1% positive impact on your revenue. Can you detail the price and the mix components? And also you said that in 2008, you have already implemented price increase with your partner. Can you &#x2013; and I think, you said 4% price increase, is this only price or is this also price and mix? And also maybe a last question on the &#x2013; you said in your press release that you expect probably some weakening market conditions, and an impact on the beer consumptions. Do you think this can have an impact on the premiumization of the Heineken brand, thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To split price and mix is very difficult because price is often disguised in different packaging sizes, et cetera, and that's the way how you can increase prices, so is it then price or packaging mix. So in that respect it is difficult to split. If you look at what we have said about the 4% price increase that is an average, and this 3 to 4% is an average. You will see that it's also different between different brands, different packages, is it a full malt or a less malt. We play that differently, but overall we expect a 3 to 4% increase.</p>
          <p>And what will be the impact on the premiumization of the beer market. We expect that premium beers continue to outperform the overall market. That is a trend which is not going away and how it in the end completely will work out, that is one of the things we would like to have more and more clarity. You will see that the input costs will hit the bottom end of the market harder than of course the top end. But the general inflation not only in beer, but which we will see across the board in consumer products will probably also have an impact on consumer behavior and shopping behavior. So I think it is a bit early to say what exactly the impacts will be, but we are very confident that the premium part of the market will outperform the overall market.</p>

          <p>Christopher Gower, MF Global. How much of the growth in Premium Light has been driven by your customers' trading up from the Heineken main brand? And secondly, can you explain which countries you'll find it difficult to put through price rises this year?</p>

          <p>On the second question, it is the USA as we explain earlier for the reasons, which were explained already.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a choice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a choice. It's not that we can not. We could do. But we don't think it would be wise. So it's perhaps the only market situation where we do accept a decrease of nominal margin for safeguarding the potential of volume increase. Whereas in all other markets, we would do the reverse choice in saying what we have to maintain is our marginality. It's always easier to do it on the premium &#x2013; the top premium end of the market than on the lower end. But the USA is the expectation by and large. So that would be it.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on trading up, it's not trading up from Heineken. Heineken and Heineken Premium Light are line priced. But what you will see in the regular market where of the markets, around 20% or slightly higher than 20% is in the premium end of the market. You see that in the light market that part is still very small. Now with the launch of Heineken Premium Light, you see that upgrading from domestic mainstream light drinkers into what we call in the USA, the luxury light segment that is happening. Other brands are benefiting from that as well. But we are clearly the big winner in that game.</p>

          <p>Ari Pattanayak at Deutsche Bank. Just a question on your longer term capital structure. You have given guidance of a pro forma of 2.7 times net debt to EBITDA. What would say is your longer-term target? Is that sort of a number that we should be expecting, or do you think it will be down to a lower level of leverage as we have seen historically? And the second question regarding the committed funding that you have in place. I am not sure how much detail you can give but perhaps even more important than the pricing of that debt. What is the actual maturity of that debt, and trying to gauge at what point would you have to come back to the market given the current volatility you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the capital structure after the transaction, it will 2.7 times, that is in our view quite aggressive knowing the conservative stance of the company. So going forward, we will go back to a certain extent, but certainly not sustainable to levels where we have been in the last two years. It's a bit similar story we had after the BBAG acquisition, where we took on for the first time substantial debt. We said that is bringing out as a little bit further than where we would like to be, so we pay that down, but that will be a fluctuation over time. So it is certainly not as conservative as we have been in the last two years, but it will certainly also not stay at the level which we will style off after the transaction.</p>
          <p>Yes, finances, fully committed are two tranches. One tranche of one year of 1.1 billion sterling, and that tranche will be refinanced in capital markets. We have the option to prolong that with another year, so it is in principal one year but we can extend that to two years. And the other part's 2.85 billion sterling is on a five year timeframe but that is a bank loan which will stay a bank loan. Next two debts, that depends a little bit how much we want and have to refinance of the existing debt in Scottish &amp; Newcastle. We have of course our revolving credit facility available of &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. First of all, on input costs again, given what we are seeing with inflation at the moment, how much of it is &#x2013; how much of a concern is it for you to go and try and fix supply and price as much as you can for 2009, right now? And how much of a risk is there that we would see another big increase in cost perhaps related to 2009? And then the second question is on tax, Scottish &amp; Newcastle yesterday were seeing very confident that the 20% tax rate they have is sustainable going forward, and is there any reason why it wouldn't be sensible for us to build in a blend of their rate and yours, going forward, or other reasons why it could be higher or lower than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the raw materials, and packaging materials typically, you have a range of things where you can do multi-year contracts, I will cite hops for instance has a multi-year contract. If you go to the serial markets that starts to be much more volatile and much more complicated they go from harvest to harvest. And a good harvest and a bad harvest that can mean a yield from half to double. So, it's very difficult to ask for &#x2013; at the end of the day, you have a farmer and he has to commit for a price, and some do it, but not all. So, you can not ask for let's say hedging that kind of risks in this market. And beer brewing barley is a specific type of barley, and that is again a very small part of the total barley market. It typically represents 10 to 15% of the global barley markets. And it's more &#x2013; there is no liquid market for that. There are no forward contracts with all the options you have for wheat or what have you. So it is not so easy to fix that down, because you have two different angles. On the one hand, you have the structural pressure on the demand, which comes from Asia for feed barley and cereals in absolute, you all know that, and the second thing is demand for biofuels with the first generation biofuel and the second generation biofuel, but that plays &#x2013; that gives us structural pressure on the demand on the commodities that we use. And that is there for stay, and then you have the second element, the harvest, and you know that consecutive draughts in Australia have been kind of are taking a toll on these kind of markets, and that is very difficult to hedge.</p>
          <p>Now when you come to the supplies of let's say aluminum, in the old times we were kind of making a contract with an aluminum can manufacturer. Now you have to buy yourself the aluminum, which you need and you have to bear that risk, because there is no can manufacturer who will take that risk anymore in the world. So, we have to play on the metal exchange to have this comfort. So there also on the positive side you have more amplitude to hedge yourselves going into the future in that kind. The glass market is yet another game, that's a market where capacity is very determining of what prices are. To make glass, you need an oven, and an oven is flowing glass seven years consecutively day and night without interruption. So those are very the most inflexible plants in the world, it's even more inflexible than a steel mill, and that makes that &#x2013; the capacity supply is really determining what the price offer would be, and for 35% is the price of the energy, which then again is difficult kind of fixing well into 2009. If you ask me a number of these things, we fixed already for 2009, but also a number of our supply we can not fix into 2008. So, it's difficult to give clarity on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And on the tax rates, and the lower tax rates of Scottish and Newcastle of 20%. It's very much related to the way how they deal with France, and there is a double dip in the interest deduction between France and UK, and clearly by the break-up of the company that will be lost. So, you can not just take their tax rate and ours, and start making a blend. Your have to go back to the individual tax rate of the individual countries.</p>
