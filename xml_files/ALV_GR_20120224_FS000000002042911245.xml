          <p>So according to Oliver's Blackberry, it is actually 11:30 right now. So welcome, everybody, here in the room in Munich, as well as online or all those other people who are willing to look at this in a time-delayed fashion on the net.</p>
          <p>I have the honor to do all the important things, like welcoming you, asking you to turn-off your Blackberries so that we won't be, or other handiest in case that somebody doesn't use a Blackberry, and to actually also assure that you all understand that whatever we say cannot be held against us, i.e. no forward-looking statements, and all the other disclaimers that are in the back of the brochure that you have in front of you.</p>
          <p>Oliver tells me that I can make my annual joke for the last time about the USB stick that you have that contains the buyer order of Allianz stock. Please use it freely as you go forward. And that really is all I have to say before handing over to Michael, who will tell us why Allianz is in good shape.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Paul. Most of you will not be able to read the German newspapers, but those ones who have, I think have seen quite a mixed reaction yesterday. A lot of the journalists are questioning the dividend proposal, but I think at least here we are all on the same page that that's probably the right one.</p>
          <p>Anyhow <mark type="inaudible" /> (01:58)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So high right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah too high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to make that they understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>You could actually ask yourself, I mean in good shape was the net income, are we all in the same movie and we all lost in translation. I would say, after 2011, well we really had quite a difficult time start in January and right up to December 2012 looks good to me. Feels good because I think we spend a lot of time in preparing ourselves for 2012 and hopefully we can spot that with a couple of arguments here.</p>
          <p>And I'm not talking so much about financial crisis and asset base, but what I'm talking about is operational improvements.</p>
          <p>Now, let's start a couple slides here. Oliver doesn't work. Can you do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Doesn't work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Nope. Good. I don't think I need to talk too much about the environment, and this is fast. I mean, the gross has changed just from nowhere, would have started this couple of years ago profit storm. Now, it's &#x2013; I think he is calling this the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:35) and hopefully we get some relief on that for 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, when I look at my dashboard, I'm really not happy with two KPIs, that's the growth. But I think we have good explanation for that and obviously net income comes in little week. We'll talk about that as well, otherwise, I think all the KPIs are okay. Not great, but okay.</p>
          <p>Now the best thing is that we reached our outlook on operating profit that was in the first half by far, not as clear as in the years before. So we think that's really good, lot of things to the performance and asset management, and I think when I look at all the NatCats we have seen on the P&amp;C side, the result is okay as well especially supported by the performance in the fourth quarter. Now I think the good thing is, and hopefully, we'll get this from Oliver today as well that the operating asset base in all business segments is growing, despite premium being a little weak.</p>
          <p>What I like to show always is the underlying stability of the operating profit over all years. I think that's a real strong characteristic of the Allianz book. And as you see, the cash generating units, P&amp;C, and asset management are increasing their share, so that's good for financing of new business in Life, but also to be able to pay out what needs to be paid out.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to the dividend. Has been quite a discussion and getting away from the odd policy of 40% payout ratio, but all our tax which our investors have confirmed the sort of unusual payout ratio of 80% plus. We wanted to stick to our word and if you look at the payout ratio from operating profit point of view, nothing much has changed. But I don't want to leave you with the wrong impression. We will go back to an accrual policy of 40% in 2012. So please don't hold the 80% against us in our discussions and we'll come to Frankfurt, we'll come to London probably discuss this in every detail going forward.</p>
          <p>Now the last year, I mean wherever we work especially in Asia and in the U.S. the sovereign debt crisis was the dominating topic. And Paul probably had three quarter of talking time this is why I leave this topic to him as well. But I understand from an investor point of view, you won't understand what is a tail risk. And just want to make very clear that we don't believe in a tail risk that's all about Italy, we think and that's was our statement right from the beginning, Italy is a totally different case. And I think that's supported by the good progress that the amount of government is making.</p>
          <p>Now, again, we don't believe in this case, but I would like to take you jus through the GIIPS sovereign debt exposure and that's including now, Italy. Around 7% of assets are invested there, they're of 20% &#x2013; 72% are matched with domestic liabilities. And if you look at the unrealized losses at the year-end, you'll see that on the lower end of the left side, this makes about 46% off an annual operating profit, and this is &#x2013; and that's the last point before policyholders and tax, so 83% of these assets are held in Life.</p>
          <p>Now from operating exposure, you see that we produced 14% of revenues, 4% in the GIPS and 10% in Italy, and operating profit at 7% GIPS and 10% in Italy. So even from operating point of view, I think it's a very manageable exposure.</p>
          <p>Now, the next point, and this is systematic slide now, is where is Life going. We've given you the current yield 2011 of 5%, against the minimum guarantee of 2.7%, so that leaves us 230 basis points spread. If you look at the reinvestment yield 2011 that has gone down to 4.2%, guarantees have gone down to 2.1%. So the spread has reduced now to 210 basis points. Now the next question will be where is the reinvestment yield going in 2012. And we've planned for 3.8%, and the guarantees are going down to 1.7%, so the spread remains at 2. &#x2013; 210 basis points.</p>
          <p>We have a couple of topics that we are working very intensively on. I've given you some global programs we are running. I'm coming back to some of them later. Very important is to draw all the conclusions out of arrangements. Experience we made in 2011, and there's a lot of things that we're doing on internal reinsurance and external reinsurance, and also on our program. The reorganization of P&amp;C in Germany and U.S., we have a very interesting tested program now for our agencies. And obviously, in these times, we need to work on productivity and margins on the bancassurance side, which we are doing very intensively with our partners.</p>
          <p>Now, automotive is one of our global lines that has developed very nicely. We've seen 50% growth over the last two years. We have a combined ratio in 2011 of 98%, and we are constantly putting on more business, and I myself very much involved here in the acquisition of new businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, digital is a program that we have come back on for the last 20 to 25 months. We have seen some very interesting results here. And I'm going to show you one that's on the retail product transformation. We do have architecture now in place that addresses retail product. And we are constantly improving the quality of our data, which obviously is very important in this new environment. And we are trying to get our customers used to digital context because that's obviously part of the usage of all our tools and the distribution access.</p>
          <p>Now on the back of this, there is a lot of progress going on, on the IT side. We finally do now consolidate IT platforms. So we have concentrated on three that we take. We have this one from the Spanish platform that we used for Latin America. We have OpEx programs that we use for emerging markets and we have the ABS system that we're using for Europe.</p>
          <p>Now I've just put this asset management chart up because there were a couple of speculations that the real reason for splitting and separating below asset management PIMCO and Global Investors was to prepare for divesting. That is definitely not the case. The reason is more focus on the distribution side and less complexity in coordinating the activities. And I think, going forward, we will see good progress on that because as you know whenever you focus, then the results are getting better. And just to make sure that this is really happening. We've sent one of our best guys as CFO into that unit and that's Mr. Norman who you may know from many other companies.</p>
          <p>German business. I was a little bit reluctant to put this chart up because it gives the impression that there is a broken business that needs to be restructured again. I would definitely say that's not the case. What we are doing right now is a lot of fine tuning. So we do have modular product design of our retail clients. We put a lot of emphasis on the productivity in our distribution channels. We do have some work to do on the claims side and that is directly related to first-level process optimization that is in place now.</p>
          <p>And we, for the first time, put a Board member of the German team with central claims responsibility just to make sure that the focus is there. And we'll do quite a couple of activities on the P&amp;C expense side. That's not only reduction of central costs, but also support costs on the distribution, which is a little bit top-heavy.</p>
          <p>This is one of the modular products that we have put in place. It has been a larger success on the sales side than we expected. The difference to our old product design is just on our old product, you would get the complete product and that you could deduct certain coverages. Now, we give you the base cover and then you can add on certain other covers, and the success of this, and by the way, this is supported by evidence that we see on modular product in France and in Italy, is that given the choice, transfer more. So the average premium goes up by 6% and the modules are individually priced, so I think that is a real, real good success and by the way that fits very nicely with the digital back offices as well because this is a fully industrialized product.</p>
          <p>So, when we look at our expectation at the German business, we see at least a &#x20AC;500 million improvement. 2014, so we'll target a combined ratio of 95% and this is a combination of growth 5.8% and combined ratio down 7.9%. And Oliver will give you more details on Germany later.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget that there is not only optimizing business model in Germany, we have the very, very strong Life business. Market share on new business has increased continuously over 25%. And from total premium, it's now grown over the last 10 years by 4 percentage points market share. And you see, I think, the operating profit development is quite nicely with very healthy new business margin.</p>
          <p>Now, coming to the outlook, we will focus very much, obviously, on what's happening on the external side. But internally, the German P&amp;C, the U.S. P&amp;C and thirdly, annuities and I assume we're going to have a couple of discussion points on that one, distribution, very, very high on our list, further development of our global lines and obviously capital management.</p>
          <p>Now, we do have four new Board members that's basically half the team is new, and Dieter Wemmer will join us for lunch. You may remember him from other companies. I was very happy that we could secure him for Allianz. I think that's just as good as getting Max Zimmerer and Gary and Helga on the team.</p>
          <p>Now, operating profit outlook. We target &#x20AC;8.2 billion plus/minus &#x20AC;500 million. And as last year, everybody will say, that's a bit light and conservative. I can't tell you whether it's conservative, yes or no. I will tell you at half year because God knows what's going to happen this year. But we are pretty confident on P&amp;C. Life obviously is more challenged in these times. And I think we have a very solid outlook on asset management where we always have to make a question mark on performance fees whether they come or not. And I think performance fees, Oliver, this year we're at &#x20AC;455 million, so that's the thing that's next wins it yes or no.</p>
          <p>Now, this is my darling chart, but I won't take you through that today, I will do this in our individual meetings, just to point at the potential. And with that, I will stop and say, we think, we know we're going to have a very, very interesting year in front of us, especially, and maybe we talk about the weakness of some large, local competitors in major European countries. I think this will offer a very interesting opportunity, and I'm not only talking about acquisition, I'm talking about organic growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will pass it on to Oliver.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good morning, everybody. Since we have had the document out since yesterday morning, I propose that I don't bore you with going through every slide, and leave a little more time for Q&amp;A later, just pointing out to some of the more important items.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there is obviously some repetition between, in my deck, what Michael has said on the environment, and what has been driving the numbers. So I'll try to be brief, as requested, and focusing on the key questions that you might have, actually anticipating a few that I've seen coming in yesterday.</p>
          <p>Now, as Michael has said, we've been operating in a very, very difficult environment. I've been reading the analysis of an industry observer recently and say, what's so problematic about insurance? Well, it's everything, particularly if you are in Europe.</p>
          <p>It's the sovereign debt crisis, the banking exposures, it's the low interest rates, it's the high volatility in the equity markets, it's the NetCat, it's the inflation of claims and there's no growth. Now so we are operating in a very difficult environment and given that environment we believe been delivering very good numbers. Revenues are at &#x20AC;103.6 billion, P&amp;C on track in terms of growth. I've separated out for you the growth of the underlying primary insurance business.</p>
          <p>In the segment, you often have the mixed effects with reinsurance which significant part of it is internal. And if you look at that, we have after two years of shrinkage actually for the first time significant growth almost 4%. Asset management continues to grow slowly and our Life and Health revenues do in fact reflect significantly also focus on margin. We've said before that in the past, the margins fluctuated but the top line would always go up. We really would like to get the right balance here.</p>
          <p>Operating profit at &#x20AC;7.9 billion. This is important to also say, we've been following a very strict impairment policy. I remember some discussions with many of you around the Greek impairment last year. Things turned out to be very good and on track and just to preempt one question based on what we heard three days ago we will not be forced into additional write-downs. We've actually put the mark exactly where the compromise has come out except for a few line items.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains resilience and it's &#x2013; and our dividend power even despite these impairments. You see the three-year trend on page number five. I will not spend a lot of time on that, but go rather into the details also on dividends. It's very important to see on page six that we've continuously increased our capital distribution and, as Michael said, on dividend it's very important to note that we wanted to deliver on the promise. If you are operating in a financial environment, many of our investors do expect reliability on capital distribution and that's why we, for this year, have decided to stick to our promise despite the volatility in net income.</p>
          <p>Now, the capital position, this is the IFRS view on page number seven, is very stable. The capital is now at roughly &#x20AC;45 billion, some movement in the unrealized gains and losses and the increase in the retained earnings. There is &#x2013; if you ask what the question has been in addition to the net income and what we had some gains of around &#x20AC;340 million in FX. Gains offset by a change in shadow DAC of around &#x20AC;700 million and obviously the dividend we paid last year of roughly &#x20AC;2 billion that explains the movement in the capital position. The right-hand side shows you the most important exposure is to interest rates sharply up and equities down.</p>
          <p>Now if we move to the conglomerate solvency which we know is going to be around for a while. We have very strong numbers in the 179% that is all still a deduction in there for Commerzbank of &#x20AC;300 million, so that number could have been bigger. And as you see, since it's not sensitive to interest rates, it hasn't moved as you would see in comparison to the economic number. So it's very, very strong on that basis.</p>
          <p>The economic solvency, we &#x2013; for this time, as we're moving in the first quarter of 2012 to a more Solvency II consistent regime with a confident interval of 99.5%, I provide you with both numbers, both the new one and the existing one. And it's very important to point out not just the level changes, what also changes is the sensitivity to shocks of course because at a 3 basis points level, the sensitivity is a lot higher.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, even in the new environment, the exposure to combined shock of low interest rates and equity markets down remain the most important. As always, I look at that almost daily in terms of probability last year and equity down and interest rate down shock was about 17% to 20% probability, the CDS' and the options to delta means around 5%. So markets are much calmer at this point in time on the outlook relative to these numbers.</p>
          <p>Now there would be a question coming up that I'd like to also address upfront. So why haven't the numbers since the third quarter moved more? And I'd like to explain that to you because we also had almost an exact 133%. Now the number is actually a few basis points different. But the first thing is that, despite the market movement our risk capital was fairly stable declined by &#x20AC;300 million. And the first thing is, while we had a significant increase in risk charges, we also had a &#x2013; particularly for market risk, we had a decline in underwriting risk by around &#x20AC;400 million and a significant higher tax relief in shock scenario because the risk has moved to the Life house segment where we can take the burden of the increased risk.</p>
          <p>The risk-bearing fund, funds decreased also by &#x20AC;700 million to &#x20AC;49.2 million and that's due to the lower PVFP, not accounted for an IFRS &#x20AC;1.2 billion offset by a higher equity values and a lower goodwill deduction because that's what caused some of the misses in the forecast. We took out some goodwill in at the group. We'll be talking more about it. So that explains the stability in the numbers. There is no magic, no changing in illiquidity premium or anything like that just offsetting effects on those numbers.</p>
          <p>Now capital will remain a core focus for this year and we have four major levers to pursue. The first one is, further de-risking of peripheral counterparties and sovereign exposures. Everybody looks at governments. Obviously, right behind the government, are the banks, and we've been doing a lot in order to de-concentrate and de-risk our exposure.</p>
          <p>The net exposure to financials, overall, we are de-risking, and either through hedging or other mechanisms, and that's not just in equity, but we're doing this across all asset classes. And we need to really continue to work on our interest rate and spread sensitivity. We have had huge exposures, particularly in Germany that we are addressing the length and duration, and in particular, we're also working on life product design, and in-force management, because a lot of people say you can do anything about it. Well, we can do a lot. So for example, moving credits from the products to the end of the product life, and not continuously crediting has a huge, huge impact.</p>
          <p>And as said last year, there is a lot more focus on cash and cash returns, one of the consequences has been the closure of our Japanese Life business, more focus on P&amp;C and asset management growth, and further reduction in exposures that we have to misprice markets, NatCat markets, by the way, regardless of what the reinsurers say, are still in some areas underpriced and we need to take the exposure out. The same is true for options and guarantees that are mispriced in the market. I'm still amazed, given where interest rates and volatilities are, what certain companies are offering as benefit, that are not being charged for on the consumer side.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to the group section, and their growth numbers that's on page 12. The total internal growth, minus 2.1%, basically driven by lower Life and Health sales, we'll talk about that, 6.9% on an internal basis, that's by and large, foreign exchange. P&amp;C, on average, 2.3%, and asset management continues to power ahead with 14.6%.</p>
          <p>The operating profit development on the following page, actually a significant improvement in asset management also in corporate would have been higher. We had some one-off in writing down OLB in the non-operating side and the operating side, we had higher losses on the bank side this year that we don't expect to repeat themselves so that should be shooting to &#x20AC;800 million for going forward. Life and Health, heavily hit by impairments in particular, also the Greek government bonds at &#x20AC;2.4 billion, still in the middle of our forecast range. It's actually better than I expected. And the property casualty business significantly hit by NetCat, &#x20AC;600 million more than budget where we had a budget of &#x20AC;1.1 billion to &#x20AC;1.2 million depending on how you run that. You factor this out. It's at &#x20AC;300 million relative to where we thought we would come out.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, the low point is the non-operating items on page number 14. There's nothing to be discussed here. The first line is the realized gains and losses and impairments of investments. That has moved by &#x20AC;1.8 billion down. The right-hand side gives you the movements. Two comments here; the first one, last year on the equity side, we still had around &#x20AC;164 million of gains on the sale of ICBC. For 2011, that number was only &#x20AC;315 million and there are no more left. That's one item and the other one is, of course, given the market volatility, significant impairments on equities and that &#x2013; securities on the impairment side.</p>
          <p>Now, in addition, there are two items that need explanation. That's the amortization of intangible assets and that's the income from managed financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value. Let me start with that. The vast majority in the <mark type="ph" /> latter (31:07) position is &#x20AC;316 million from the Hartford warrants and that's a net income impact after tax of &#x20AC;275 million. That's the vast majority of the movements here. And the amortization we're going to talk about as well. I have the separate section on what we're doing.</p>
          <p>There are impairments of goodwill. It's a significant component around &#x20AC;338 million. The biggest ones are banking, Germany then we have a write-off in Korea Life because of very low interest rates on the back book. You know all about the back life books in Asia. And we have taken &#x2013; the other large one was, we've taken the remaining goodwill down on Fireman's Fund given the results development that also should not come as a surprise. On top of that, we have amortization of intangible assets that is within the regular schedule, and particularly around distribution agreements that we have with Commerzbank and <mark type="ph" /> Comm investors (32:05), also Commerzbank.</p>
          <p>So these are the major items that I'd like to explain on this page. Reduced expenses of <mark type="ph" /> B units (32:15) drive the acquisition related expenses. Last comment is on the interest rate expense. It's up because we issued the subordinated and that was a wise decision, so that's money well spent, at least from our perspective.</p>
          <p>Exposures to sovereigns, I'm not going to talk about it; a lot Michael has talked about it, Paul will spend a lot of time on it. The only thing I'd like to mention is the volatility. And as you see the unrealized gains and loss position at the year end, and I've added the numbers for the end of January and you can see the huge movements in the spreads and how they affect the unrealized gains and losses that we see both gross and net of policyholder participation has come down by more than &#x20AC;1.3 billion just within four weeks, and that &#x2013; it shows you the movement in the numbers. I'd also like to mention that Greece, Ireland and Portugal and Spain are really small numbers if you look at that relative to our portfolio and relative to our earnings power.</p>
          <p>The net income development warrants only one comment beyond what I just said. That's the margin or the effective rate, sorry, of 42%. Two comments; the first one is, we had a number of special effects last year that drove this number far from we wanted it to be. The first one is that a lot of the losses we take on equities, we take in Germany in Luxemburg, where we basically have no capital gains tax. So the moment these losses happen, there is no tax protection.</p>
          <p>Second, a number of the NatCat claims, the large ones, have happened and we're booked through Singapore. Singapore has a 10% marginal tax rate and that's not going to happen again ever, because we have a stop-loss on that now. So it transfers the losses back into Munich. And then trade taxes increased that had a few points also. So there are three or four items, special items.</p>
          <p>Now, the tax plan rate for 2012 for those that want an orientation is planned at around 33.7% that can oscillate under normal circumstances by 50 basis points up and down. Now that's again assuming more normal markets going forward.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to leave the Group section, please, and move to page number 18, which give you the highlights and the key messages for the Property and Casualty segment, please.</p>
          <p>The primary insurance portfolio had growth both from prices and volumes. I think that's' very important. In many mature markets, people see only price growth that's not good, particularly not good for productivity. We need to have both. It was at 4%, not just positive, but the highest number we had in quite a number of years.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance is down by 15% driven by the discontinuation of our Munich-Greek quota share agreement around &#x20AC;500 million negative, and that will be little more on third-party, because we've been cleaning the third-party reinsurance portfolio upon renewal of this year. Overall growth at 2%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit at &#x20AC;4.2 billion. We have some very good trends on the underlying accident year loss ratios. We're going to look at that in a second. And that's despite continued weaknesses in Germany and the U.S. NatCat claims at 4.4% of the combined ratio and the asset base has been growing, and we had some one-off in the investment income of around &#x20AC;100 million. Now, with declining interest rates, a lot of people are expecting the investment income to <mark type="ph" /> going (35:42) down. Please also bear in mind, we are targeting to grow the business and we are targeting to grow the asset base.</p>
          <p>Page number 19 give you the view of the markets and the gross numbers and I think it's very positive. Even Germany had a slight growth on a local basis and adjustments and that's almost back to &#x20AC;9 billion. Primary insurance, you see on the left hand, lower left-hand side after two years of shrinkage, now 3.9% growth. That's a strong message and we'd like to see that continue again both from volumes and from prices.</p>
          <p>Page number 20 give you the usual movements in the operating profit. Investment income up &#x20AC;176 million, underwriting down. There were some questions about what has happened to run-off at the end of the year where there are huge items and we had earlier in the year, two or three items here. We basically have across the OEs a number of reserve reviews and there's no specialty, no big hit. However, it's fair to assume that over the long run, we'd rather stay between 2.5% and 3.5% run-off, yeah. So the higher run-off that we had, you cannot expect. We continue to strengthen our reserves. So we'd like to see and have the capacity for positive run-off. Now we've &#x2013; I think I'm not &#x2013; don't have the number, but like 26 quarters was positive run-off. That's pretty impressive.</p>
          <p>Now 21 gives you an overview of the combined ratio movement. Expense ratio is slightly down and the productivity overall is flat. In the portfolio, we have NatCat of 4.4 points that I mentioned. Now, when you look at the numbers, to be clear, if you exclude NatCat in a fair way that is also look at NatCat for prior year, you would have had one market that had a combined over 100. That's a pretty impressive portfolio. I haven't seen that anywhere else, and this is seriously core strength of Allianz going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, NatCat loss development, I provided an extra slide this year to say what have been the big events and where have we taken the losses. The left-hand side gives you always our local businesses. OEs is supposed to mean operating entity, and where we have been taking them in Allianz Re, that includes the vast majority of that is internal sessions, and then some third-party business that only mattered in Christchurch and in Japan, all of &#x2013; most of the rest is internal, adding up to the &#x20AC;1.8 billion in total.</p>
          <p>So what is the message here? It has been an incredible NatCat year across the globe. So it's not two or three small items here in Germany, or in Japan, and we are taking measures everywhere, and you see that for example in Australia, we've been bringing the prices up, Germany, the prices are going up, and we are at the same time changing our exposures quite considerably having absolute aggregates, for example, in order to limit NatCat losses going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, page number 23, the most important message is in the upper left-hand side, accident year loss ratio development ex NatCat down from 71.2% to 69.7%. That trend has to continue going forward, and we need to see what we saw last year, that frequency and severity increases are outweighed by price increases. The run-off I have commented and in the interest of time I'd like to move on.</p>
          <p>Page 24 give you the usual development of the expense ratio. It's stable. We don't celebrate 20 basis points. That's actually within statistical variances. Key message is, we're working on the admin side and the issue is the mix we need to strengthen, less expensive channels, and we also need to make sure that our traditional channels become a lot more productive, because if we only grow through price increases we will give a lot of those price increases forward to the cost base in terms of higher prices and commissions.</p>
          <p>Now investment portfolio, 25, the average asset base has grown to &#x20AC;96.3 billion. That supports investment income. The return we had as the current yield on equities was 6%, again &#x20AC;100 million one-offs due to private equity distributions in Italy and in Germany that are not repeating themselves all the time. And the yield on debt and cash is slightly by 5 basis points from 3.78% to 3.73%. That's a part.</p>
          <p>Now we are working very hard on the asset side to find better sources for risk returns and yields. And I think the teams are doing a very good job here. The operating investment income difference to life a lot less sensitive of course to market shocks. Investment expenses are stable; interest and similar income is up 3.6% to &#x20AC;3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The pricing overview for 2011. We took a lot of price. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to talk about this, because that's history. Very important is that what is going to happen going forward. We have a number of pricing actions going forward in the plan. It's already 2.8%. I'm not sure that's going to be all of it. We need to take price wherever we can. We have a number of markets, the U.S. and Germany that are moving on the uptick and we need to use the pricing opportunities more strongly.</p>
          <p>Now in some markets, for example, in credit insurance, we have actually reduced prices in order to grow market share, because we operated at extremely high levels of profitability. And, as I said earlier, we need to also grow the client base and that has been hugely successful in credit. And we also have in some pockets in Italy the opportunity to now grab share, because we have extremely weak competitors and our profitability is superb now in Italy. So we'd be going and grab clients that are profitable wherever we can.</p>
          <p>Now, there's a lot to do in P&amp;C still, the usual stuff. We would like to grow the globe Allianz, in particular South America and Asia Pacific. And as Mike had said, in some areas there might be selective bolt-on acquisitions in target markets where we have strong management teams and the capability to integrate. We need to improve reinsurance effectiveness further. We have really in detail reviewed the third-party business, particularly the NatCat exposed business, and need to optimize internal sessions.</p>
          <p>We often take exactly the market rate, but if the market is taking too little price, we need to make sure that we get the appropriate rates even on internal reinsurance, and we have redesigned the group retro program to include some top perils and for certain tail risks to protect ourselves better.</p>
          <p>Accelerated prices; I've been talking about in Germany, for example, we had 4% to 5% effective price increases for the in-force for 2012. And there's a lot to be done in commercial lines, particularly in Italy, France and the U.S. of course.</p>
          <p>Enhanced claims execution is not just a German issue, it's a particular German issue, but in Italy, in France and we are rolling out a group wide anti-fraud program. In these economic times, fraud detection is really important.</p>
          <p>The last, but not the least is certainly productivity. As I mentioned, it's not just back offices because this becomes an ever smaller part of the cost base is getting agency productivity up growing in direct getting digital to actually work on productivity as well will remain very important.</p>
          <p>So that's the P&amp;C segment. Now let's please focus on life insurance. Page 30 give you the overview and the key messages. We'd like tom point out that we had positive net flows in a very tough environment, the asset base has continuously grown and that has been supported by stable revenues from core products with very sound new business margins. Rates are down, new business margin is up.</p>
          <p>Margin discipline and lower bankassurance sales are a key driver of the reduced revenues and the operating profit has been fairly resilient. Now MCEV, we'll talk about a lot. It's &#x2013; I've put it politely reflecting high sensitivity to government's spreads and volatilities, we can spend a lot of time on MCEV later. It's my favorite subject.</p>
          <p>Now, page 31 give you the revenue developments and here it is to point out that revenues by the way down doesn't typically mean something bad. We've talked about it particularly if it protects margin. But for example, even in the case of Germany where the numbers look down, we've actually grown market share and we're actually growing not just market share in terms of revenues, but certainly even more in profit pools. We've moved more to recurring premiums that have higher persistency, higher margins. So the trends in our core market very strong.</p>
          <p>Switzerland, not noteworthy. France is down because margins are significantly lower than they were in 2010 given the product in particular because of the benchmark from the banks. The banks are offering unbelievable depositing rates and we don't want to get in these types of competition.</p>
          <p>Italy is most importantly hit because of UCI; Unicredit had other challenges than selling life insurance product in 2011, but we have very clear agreements with the bank of how we're going to get that up to where it needs to be. The Benelux is performing very well. Spain, and in Asia Pacific, there are two special effects, the first one is the closure in Japan that accounts for about half of that. We've decided to stop the business give the margin outlook and last year we had a special and positive effect in Taiwan that was another &#x20AC;890 million of positive flows that didn't repeat themselves. If you compare the numbers for Asia to 2009, that's why we have the table in, we still have &#x2013; would have had almost 20% growth in the numbers. Now the 2010 spike is a little bit of the wrong comparison.</p>
          <p>Now, the operating asset base on 32 shows you the net flow numbers that what we really look at relative to market effects and interest in similar income, The French markets, I've mentioned before there have been a lot of maturities. Eastern Europe is flat, and Asia Pacific, we had &#x20AC;400 million in outflows; Italy is minus &#x20AC;1.2 billion, that reflects the channel &#x2013; the banking channel. And we need to make sure that we protect our margins there.</p>
          <p>Page number 33 give you the new business margin development, 2.3% up. Mind you, these are beginning of quarter numbers. We'll talk about that more later. The trend will be down, given the fourth quarter numbers. So we are constantly re-pricing products now to balance the decline in interest rates or increased volatility, while in the past we had about six months to do so; now it's done to six weeks in many markets. So you should see a temporary dip in new business margin, maybe in the first quarter, but the margin should be coming back.</p>
          <p>Now operating profit on page 33 &#x2013; 34 &#x2013; excuse me, please, shows the effect of the lower investment income. What has driven the technical results up, &#x20AC;78 million. We had a few one-offs due to adjustments on assumptions, nothing &#x2013; particularly in two or three markets, the U.S. and in France in particular. The interest investment results net impact of impairments is reflected here for the vast majority of the numbers. And the expense results shows a deterioration that's also a one-off. The liability adequacy test in Japan, when we closed the business, required a &#x20AC;60 million write-off of debt, and that is reflected in this number, otherwise it should have been on target with zero.</p>
          <p>Asset base growth and yields, just if you compare the number, why is it 4.4%, this is the number on the assets; Michael had the number on the reserves. It's fully consistent, of course, and the operating investment income development you see on page 36.</p>
          <p>I think that's very important to see here are the impairments visible. They came back to a level of 2009 with &#x20AC;1.7 billion. What comes on top, unfortunately, is the movement in the fair value options and in trading, but the vast majority happened here in France and in Easy Life, and we had a foreign exchange hit in this function of &#x20AC;500 million as well. So that has been driving down the operating investment income to this level that, however, remains fairly resilient if I can compare that across the industry.</p>
          <p>Last description is the MCEV development, the &#x2013; in order to prevent some nitty-gritty question, I've added the &#x2013; what has been causing the movements in the economic variances. You see all of the information on what you want on the MCEV and the backup on variances and what is really free surplus required. And this, we stick closely to the principles. Hence, therefore, we show you that all of the movements has been coming out of the value in-force with &#x20AC;8.6 billion down.</p>
          <p>There you see a negative number for the free surplus at the end of the year with &#x20AC;549 million. This by the way number today is a plus &#x20AC;550 million. We've had a movement of &#x20AC;1 billion just in one month. It basically was the reaction to the fact that in some smaller markets, you had economically sort of negative capital that has cured itself at the Group level that is obviously nonsense, because we don't need to send cash and lock it up into individual businesses. Normally that number should have been logically deducted from the diff.</p>
          <p>Now, what do we do going forward? Three major leaders; protect and enhance new business, value efficient management of the in-force book, and protecting the capital base by improving ALM effectiveness. I spare you the detail. Very important is dynamic credit rate adjustments, particularly in Germany, U.S., Italy and in France. Getting cost into focus here; we've always talk about cost in P&amp;C; in Life it matters as much, particularly with record low interest rates and we were very closely looking at lapse movements and liquidity of course and have, in every market, a program around it.</p>
          <p>Duration management is another one. And particularly for Germany and Korea, de-risking equity exposure where we can't afford it is very important and focusing sovereign risk in domestic units is what we have been doing. So that's the Life and Health segment; probably more questions to come later.</p>
          <p>In the interest of time, I'd like to move on the asset management segment. We had another outstanding year in asset management despite headwinds. It's fair to say that the net inflows that we had, with &#x20AC;39 billion, are no small feat. Many of our competitors saw significant outflows. And we're now managing &#x20AC;1.7 trillion in assets.</p>
          <p>The operating profit is very strong at &#x20AC;2.3 billion and I still remember, ever since even when I was COO here, the nagging questions, will you ever translate that into cash coming to Allianz? Well, the cash came to Allianz last year and it was &#x20AC;1.3 billion, almost 47% of net income. And it shows the very nice strategic hedge that we have between the investment result, particularly in Life and Health, and the power that gives PIMCO, because they actually hedges other when interest rates are down.</p>
          <p>With an outstanding investment performance still, and I'd like to report on January that we've had significant positive flows, particularly exceeding our targets, and operating earnings are also positive relative to plan. So the machine is humming. To be precise, we had almost &#x20AC;6 billion inflows, &#x20AC;4.5 billion in PIMCO and &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the AGI pillar.</p>
          <p>Now, page 41, assets under management. I've described growing both from our own assets and third-party. The flows are on page 42. 3.4% of beginning of period's AUM; strong message, of course, not the same in 2009 and 2010, and that cannot be assumed to be a regular movement.</p>
          <p>More importantly, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:02) development and net fee and commission income, it's not just up 11 percentage points. I'd like to pay &#x2013; and get your attention to look at the third-party assets under management driven margin. We have crossed 40 basis points margin, which is a very, very strong number. So it's not just about the size. A lot of people worry about, when we get bigger, the margin gets smaller. It's not true. We get bigger and the margin gets better. And that's also despite the fact that after record performance fees in 2010 with &#x20AC;514 million, this year the number was &#x20AC;455 million. Congratulations in particular to our friends in asset management. This is no small achievements.</p>
          <p>Now, at the same time we've been investing in the business. The operating expenses that you see moving are basically there to make sure that we have the technology and we have the people that can support these enormous amounts of assets and we're supporting future growth, and particularly on the PIMCO side as Michael has said now, unleashing them, both of the pillars to have their own distribution should really help growth going forward.</p>
          <p>Page 45 give you the core numbers for fixed income. I think they speak for themselves. Over &#x20AC;2 billion in operating profit from the fixed income segment, and page 46 give you the equity numbers. Here, I would like to point out that, when the volatility started in the third quarter, I did not expect operating profit to be stable. That was a lot done by management to maintain stability and profits, and personally I believe this also a no small achievement.</p>
          <p>The item on net income contribution, I mentioned before, it's on 47. I really enjoy this picture and it's great for shareholders as well. Now, even with all of that, we have a few items to watch. The first one is investment performance, really positioning the investment portfolios to cope with the very low yield environment and high market uncertainty.</p>
          <p>We have therefore reviewed the expense budgets, strict cost containment to ensure best-in-class cost income ratio. In my mind, PIMCO is not just our best unit in terms of growth but also as the best cost management base, and we'll need to expand that. PIMCO will now focus on leveraging the distribution globally for continued asset diversification, and now we have AGI under one global structure that can leverage their scale for growth and efficiency.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to come to a close on page 50 and summarize 2011. At serious shocks for our industry, we were fairly resilient in our performance and we are strong in contributing our profits and sharing that with shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fittingly to the &#x2013; in good shape theme, we come to the section fit; financing, investments and transactions that you know from previous years.</p>
          <p>Let me start and give you an overview of some of the most important transactions that were done in the last year. I think if you look at the top of this chart in terms of the financing, we probably had a pretty good sense of timing last year, which meant that we tapped into the subordinated bond market at a time when that market was still open in March of last year, and placed a 30-year Solvency II compliant subordinated bond. We are probably the only ones that have issued also a contingent convertible from an insurance company in the middle of the year and we have just issued a senior bond note that actually carries a coupon of 3.5%, which for a 10-year note is also, I think, quite a good achievement.</p>
          <p>A little bit less fun we had on the investment side where frankly our investments in CPIC and particularly in Commerzbank were obviously nothing to cheer about given the market developments also for financial institutions. We are enjoying, of course, the fact that our participation in the Unicredit capital raise earlier this year. At least, to-date, it shows something like 76% return, but we're not counting before the end.</p>
          <p>This is just to say that if you are working with partners, strategic partners in the financial services sector, you are sometimes called to help out in certain situations and some of them work slightly better than others, but the important element, of course, is the overall cooperation and what the results are. And in that context, I'd like to positively also mention our cooperation with Popular in Spain, Banco Popular, that is a very good contributor to our performance and continues to be so.</p>
          <p>Our capital structure, I think it can be called sound and if you look at the debt-to-equity ratio, I think its trend is in line with a world that is going to continue to deleverage going forward. We do this with a reasonably high quality of capital, I would argue, and we are actually in the comfortable situation that there are no pressing reinvestment requirements that are forcing us to go to the market at a time where we might not find it particularly attractive to go to the markets. This does not mean that we will not retain the flexibility to buy back or pay back existing debt whenever we find debt attractive for us given the markets &#x2013; market environments.</p>
          <p>I don't have to say anything to the dividend policy. I think it's been largely stated. Having said that, I think for the first time we're showing you the payout ratio relative to operating profit, and even though that is not a KPI or a benchmark commonly used in the industry, I think it is nevertheless a remarkable stability and sense of stability that one should take note of.</p>
          <p>In terms of the investment side, despite the rather difficult capital markets environment that undoubtedly 2011 held, I'm, of course, very pleased to report that once again the investment side contributed 2.3% &#x2013; sorry 2.3, yeah &#x2013; two-thirds of the operating profit altogether. Allianz Investment Management that is responsible for the global investment activities of insurance funds actually holds some &#x20AC;460 billion under management.</p>
          <p>The performance, if you look at that is, if you sum it all up, 4.2% across that portfolio. That is based on a rather conservative, and I'll come to that portfolio, which actually is 90% bonds. And it is actually despite the fact that we hold 6% equities, if you &#x2013; and we all know that 2011 was not exactly particularly attractive year for equities. Despite that very fact, if you compare the 4.2% to the Barclay's Euro Aggregate index very broadly, that stands at 3.2%, a significant outperformance vis-&#xE0;-vis that index despite the fact that you actually had a drag on the performance through the allocation to equities.</p>
          <p>Let me go through that, and I think &#x2013; in terms of why and how that has been achieved. Before I get to that in terms of showing you the portfolio, let me also give you a little bit of an outlook in terms of the ongoing investment yields and the reinvestments that we have done and taken, which sheer coincidence are actually at 4.2% on the Life side and 3.8% on the P&amp;C side, difference of course being due to the maturity and the length of the investments that we have taken.</p>
          <p>I think you will see here, and I will also later point out in more detail of what kind of allocation we have taken so that we can hopefully also dispel the notion that this has been done by excessive risk taking, that is not the case. You can see here also in terms of what allocation we have in various government bonds, and we actually look into individual spreads particularly also on the corporate side, and I will take you through that also in a second.</p>
          <p>I think the one point that is important here to say is that for us, rating is only one parameter in the investment decision. We like to make our investment decisions on a single name basis and a single investment decision on the underlying credit.</p>
          <p>Now, this is another attempt to actually show to you that the new investment yields are in line with a conservative investment strategy as I just claimed; because that's easy to say, but I think it's more important that you can actually follow that based on what we're doing. What you see here is over the course of the last year, the performance yields, okay, in emerging markets if you want to on the top, we talked about fixed income portfolio, and the German Bund at the very bottom.</p>
          <p>And what you see is in between the various large asset classes if you want to call it that on the fixed income side, at least how we look at them, and then you actually see the reinvestment yield that we actually have achieved on Life as well as on P&amp;C. And what you can tell is that this hasn't been achieved by going very much to the extreme, or if I may put it differently, and we have discussed this many times here before, Allianz is a liability-based investor. Our benchmark are our liabilities. That's the single most important thing.</p>
          <p>Against that benchmark as every investor, we have two risks, the risk to lose money and the risk to miss an opportunity. It is very clear that we are much more willing to miss an opportunity than to risk losing money in terms of our investments. And that's the fundamental philosophy under which we are acting, and I hope that this slides helps you to actually confirm that this is the approach that we are taking, and I find it positive and gratifying that despite of that approach, we can actually achieve the type of results that I can report here in terms of the investment side.</p>
          <p>Now, rightfully, you will say an important element of this liability-based investor question is duration management. And yes, there, we actually have a challenge if you want to because of the pure calculus of how you actually calculate the liability side of duration management, which is based on swap rates, and as these swap rates actually decrease, very obviously the duration increases. So as we have kept our asset on it on a duration-based de facto stable, from a pure mathematical point, our duration mismatch has actually increased.</p>
          <p>Now we are obviously trying to address that, but at the very same point, it is important that one doesn't break out and hyperventilate about every change in swap rates when you talk about something that is as long-term oriented and as important as liability management for long term &#x2013; or asset liability management for long-term liabilities that we actually have. Therefore, we are working on this. It is very much on the focal point, but here very clearly, the last year has shown that the duration gap actually increased.</p>
          <p>There is a minor gap increase that is due &#x2013; or a minor part of that is also due to a model change which is that frankly we're now scaling duration to the asset side whereas in previous years we scaled it to the liability side. The reasoning, of course, is that you can steer the asset duration much more actively, and this is a consistent way that we will be using going forward to display this. Fact is, yes, duration gap has increased in the past year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me come to the investment portfolio and the quality of the investment portfolio. First of all, the &#x20AC;460 billion are actually 90% held in debt instruments, 6% in equities and then 2% each in real estate and other.</p>
          <p>What I'd right off the bat would like to draw your attention to is that never mind what we all believe about individual ratings and rating classes and rating migration and anything else, only 3% of that fixed income portfolio is actually held in non-investment grade securities, 3%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's get into more detail. Sufficed to say on the overview slides here, we have an overall realized or unrealized gains in this portfolio, which actually has increased in the last year. We have good diversification over all sectors, but let me go into that in greater detail. 36% of our portfolio is actually invested in an asset class that didn't merit any discussions a couple of years ago but will now draw a lot of focus and that is government bonds.</p>
          <p>The government bonds that we actually have also have an unrealized gain position, and that is despite the fact that unlike what some people may think, we do not have an excessively large position on German Bunds. As a matter of fact of what you saw before, we're not investing at this point in time in German Bunds. Of course, we have an existing position in German Bunds, but all together Germany accounts for only 20% of the total allocation in that context.</p>
          <p>France, Italy are almost at par in terms that may give you comfort or not, but I'm happy to discuss Italy at greater detail, and we'll come back to that in a second.</p>
          <p>You'll find on the next slide a totally detailed description of our investments in these individual countries, in these individual sovereigns, so that you can draw &#x2013; also broken down by Life and P&amp;C, so that you can draw your own conclusions, and of course, Oliver Schmidt and his able guys are always around to answer questions, if you have particular issues on certain of these positions in questions that are allowed.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mexico, that's a very interesting question we will take up during lunch. The best thing is during lunch. No, but seriously, let me actually &#x2013; as I was encouraged before, maybe pause a second here.</p>
          <p>What Michael showed you before was the total exposure to what is called PIIGS, okay, to avoid the acronym, but its two Is. It includes Italy, and the only reason that we did that is to give you a comfort level that Italy, even though it is a very important and very significant market for us, from a purely accounting point of view if you look at it, okay, is the situation that would be manageable if the disaster happens. We attach an almost zero probability to that. We do not believe, okay, that Italy &#x2013; Italy is a wealthy country, it is a rich country. It can handle the debt loads that it has and it can deal with the issues and challenges that are associated with it. All you have to do is look at Italian companies, Italian wealth as well as the ability that the current government has shown to address a whole lot of the issues that this country has been dabbling with in the past.</p>
          <p>So we are firmly convinced that Italy will actually perform well going forward, and that the issues there will be solved. By the way, I think we're being very unfair to some of the other countries in terms of what kind of changes are happening there. If you look at what Portuguese are doing, if you look at what Ireland is doing, and yes also if you look at &#x2013; not to mention Spain where there's some very radical moves and changes that are currently planned and in the works.</p>
          <p>But please, if any one of you guys would just pause for a second and look at the changes that are being asked for people in Greece, you bring that into bearing. You can say that's all deserved and all necessary and so on and so forth. But keep time horizons in mind. I find it mind boggling that we actually for 30 years mispriced capital by applying too much leverage. For 20 years, totally mispriced capital for allocation in countries like these based on the euro benefits that we had in addition to the over-leveraging that we all indulged in. And that means that we have mispriced capital, which means by definition that we have misallocated capital, and we now think that that can be solved in 30 months. It cannot be solved in 30 months. It takes time.</p>
          <p>And I think, if you actually look at the situation of what needs to be done, it's actually pretty straightforward. It is like in any other restructuring. What do you need for a good restructuring, a corporate restructuring? You need three things. You need an acceptable and credible business plan. You need a capable management team that can pull it off, and you need financing that allows the management teams to pull off the business plan.</p>
          <p>And increasingly, we are having all three of them in place in Europe in general, as well as specifically in the individual countries that we're looking at. All management teams have been replaced. The financing is starting to be put in place, and I think everybody starts to know what they need to be doing in terms of an acceptable business plan in order to restructure things. We just need to give the management teams, if you want to call it that, the necessary time to implement.</p>
          <p>Does that mean we should just lean back? No. We need to continue to watch that they're doing what they are required to do. But the basic layout and the basic foundations are in place. And therefore, we are by far not as excited, hyperventilating or whatever as many people tend to be when they get caught up because of the scare of the day or the excitement of the statistic that they have just discussed and so on and so forth. There are other statistics. If Greece would have had the French tax system in 2010, it would have had 6% budget surplus. So there's one for you.</p>
          <p>Now with that, we go to covered bonds because that's much less exciting. As a matter of fact, there's really nothing to report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we talk about the French tax rate after the election?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that should increase the Greek surplus in that case. So not a lot to be said frankly for the covered bond portfolio. Maybe more important also the corporate side, because yes we have a significant allocation to corporates. We think that that is justified largely based on the experience and the capabilities of PIMCO because these corporates are not being bought based on global ratings, but they are based on individual credit analysis of one-by-one, title-by-title, company-by-company, issue-by-issue basis. And we have fared very well in that context and you can see that we have also not inconsiderable unrealized gains on those positions.</p>
          <p>A little bit more challenging is the fixed income portfolio in terms of banks. Now, I'd just like to highlight that while it is a very significant amount that we actually have invested in fixed income in banks, it is less than 10% of our total portfolio because yesterday in the press conference we were faced with all kinds of scare numbers in terms of how much that is for the insurance industry in total. In our case, it is less than 10%. Nevertheless, it is a position that warrants very significant attention and something that we are managing with great care. It is also clear that we are reducing the subordinated debt that we are subscribing to. We have reduced it by &#x20AC;2 billion in the last year and we will continue to see how we can manage our way down there also based on redemptions that occur based on the fact that not all of these sub-debts are actually eligible for the new regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>A little bit of a legacy is the reporting on ABS, which I would refer in more detail to the back up where you see a total breakdown of CMBS, munis and others. We had introduced that into our presentation when ABS were the excitement of the moment. There is nothing excitement here &#x2013; nothing exciting to report. All the details are there, you can look at it, and we're happy to actually answer whatever questions you have on that.</p>
          <p>Always the winner is the question of equities and the equity portfolio. Yes, of course, this equity portfolio last year has suffered like other equity portfolios have, albeit we still have unrealized gains position of some &#x20AC;2 billion by the end of the year, and obviously at this point in time, that looks better.</p>
          <p>The main decrease, of course, was triggered by the stakes and the investments that we actually had in some of the financials, including the banks and particularly Commerzbank which you are of course aware of in this context.</p>
          <p>In that context, here is an ever green slide, which I think my successor may no longer have to put up, but I couldn't face the idea of leaving the stage without putting up the slide. Those of you who have been with us for that long may remember that when I started here, we started actually with an equity gearing of 3.0, so I'm particularly happy to report today that we've an equity gearing of 0.3. I don't think I need to say a lot more to this slide. It is one of those legacy things that maybe a year from now you won't have to bear through anymore, but I think we are in a comfortable, in a clear-cut situation. I will say that I continue to be of the opinion that an appropriate small part of equities should be part of such a liability based portfolio, and I think also from a capital and regulatory capital point of view, it still makes sense.</p>
          <p>Another favorite topic are alternative investments. I again will not bore you with this greatly, except for saying that I think increasingly people are realizing that alternative investments, particularly in renewables and infrastructure are very attractive for the likes of us, for long-term oriented liability based investors. We have a situation where we have been investing in renewables for quite a while. At this point in time, we actually have some 700 megawatts of solar, and more importantly, wind generation capacity which actually would provide electricity for 1.2 million people, and that's not something we have discovered now. We've been investing in this for a while.</p>
          <p>And also infrastructure, where last year we invested some &#x20AC;800 million in a Norwegian oil &#x2013; sorry, gas pipeline that actually transports gas from Norway down to the Norwegian fields down to Continental Europe. If I cut through all the chase on this transaction and the situation, this is a running yield of between 8% and 10%, which of course in the totality of the thing leads to a rather attractive situation for us.</p>
          <p>Equally as important and equally as attractive, I would argue going forward, will continue to be real estate. Real estate is an important asset class for investors like us, not only because of the long term stability and the lack of volatility, but also given its implied inflation hedge from a longer term point of view. Now, obviously, you need to understand what you do in that area so that you don't go into the boom and bust, but I think our track record in terms of selling at the height of folly and reinvesting as we go forward is actually quite good.</p>
          <p>We have also in the last year invested in a whole range of very attractive new properties or so we believe, while at the same point in time also engaged in a lot of divestments. We can easily see that we invest a lot more in real estate as we go forward. But as you know, we do not incentivize our investment managers by meeting targets in terms of how much they do invest, because we think that that leads to the wrong type of incentives. We are looking at each investment individually and each of them are being &#x2013; their job is to provide us with opportunities and our job is to decide if we actually want to take those opportunities or not.</p>
          <p>A clear opportunity in our view is the debt business in terms of real estate. We &#x2013; there are easily generated headlines about, ooh, Allianz wants to enter into commercial real estate debt business. Let me point out to you, we've been in this business for 30 years. Allianz Leben has a mortgage platform of about almost &#x20AC;13 billion that it has actually managed very well for the last 30 years.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we have about &#x20AC;6 billion invested in largely more corporate commercial real estate. So it is a business or an asset class that is not new, and we will continue to take advantage as the pricing becomes attractive in the context of deleveraging and in the context of new regulatory constraints also on banks and others that actually provide us with an opportunity to invest at attractive terms and the spreads in Germany now are something &#x2013; are between 175 and 250, and if you look into Italy, you find them at 350. So we actually look at that obviously with a critical eye to the implied risks, but nevertheless given our long-term investment orientation, we believe that this is very important.</p>
          <p>That is why we also decided to actually fund the Deutsche Bank Towers in Frankfurt with a &#x20AC;300 million loan, because we want to make sure that they have adequate facilities for the supervisory board. I'm making no sense. I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>Now, where does this take us? Allianz will continue, as I said, to look into direct lending activities into selected corporates. We are reducing our subordinated exposure to the banks, as we have told you, and we will continue to push the alternative space including real estate.</p>
          <p>I don't think there's anything particularly new on this slide. I would maybe like to use the opportunity to thank those of you who actually have actively helped and encouraged us to pursue and push in the last year that the European institutions, i.e. the EFSF and now also the ESM, will actually be able to issue credit protection on sovereign debt, i.e. the insurance &#x2013; credit insurance solution. And I find it reasonably remarkable that this has now been implemented by 17 parliaments and the EFSF is actually capable of issuing this insurance going forward. And I'm personally convinced it will play a role in the overall funding and rescue mechanism, and I know that many of you, as we had many discussions during the course of last year of how meaningful it is, what can be done, how it should be shaped and how it can be changed.</p>
          <p>As this instrument has evolved overtime, changed and morphed in order to become what it now is, maybe not 100% ideal of what everyone of us would've liked, but nevertheless I find it quite remarkable that we have achieved this jointly, and I'd like to thank those of you who actually have been involved and have helped and pushed on this.</p>
          <p>Allow me to also use those last five minutes to make a few personal remarks, because I will have to leave at 3:30 sharp and I don't know if I get the opportunity to make those at the end of our event.</p>
          <p>Given the fact that this is the 12th time that I'm sitting up here, it means that this will have been 12 years and have been challenging years, stormy years. But 12 years ago, Allianz was a confederation of national insurance company with an attached German investment &#x2013; domestic long only investment fund. Today, under Michael's leadership, we are arguably the leading global insurance and investment company.</p>
          <p>I am personally convinced that Allianz will be a true winner in this new normal, footnote, a term that has also been coined by an Allianz affiliate. Why do I believe that we are a clear winner? Because unlike many other financial institutions, Allianz does not have to reinvent its business model. We have a sound and solid business model that will work well in a new deleveraged environment. Allianz has capital strength. It has a very well balanced portfolio where you could view P&amp;C as a sleeping giant. You could see the life insurance business as something where we actually have the potential for clearly distinctive value propositions also on the risk life side, and we have arguably one of the world's best investment asset management franchises anywhere that is the envy of many and is highly cash generative.</p>
          <p>All of these businesses meet a growing demand, a demand that is fulfilled by our products, be it in the risk averse or increasingly risk averse graying parts of the world or in the performance hungry growth parts of this globe. And I think we are well positioned to take advantage of this, because we also have a very strong global brand, which in a world where there is a lot of clutter and noise, brands matter.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, Allianz has an incredibly strong culture and strong people. It's a culture that is based on team work and it is a culture that can be summed up with, always be more than you appear to be. That means that we sometimes do a pretty bad job in selling ourselves. Others sell themselves much more aggressively. But don't be fooled, I think our strength is also obvious in terms of the people challenges &#x2013; challenges, yes, but changes that we are currently experiencing, that Allianz is experiencing.</p>
          <p>If you look at the type of responsibilities that Joachim Faber, Enrico Cucchiani and also myself are taking on, I think they attest to the strength of the Allianz team. But also if you look at the new guys joining, it tells you how strong the bench is. Helga and Max who will split my responsibilities are two hardcore Allianz growth &#x2013; internal growth guys who have a lot of respect wherever you look in the organization and outside. They have both proven themselves. Gary is one of the most respected U.S. professionals in the industry. And Dieter Wemmer, I don't have to explain to any one of you because you all know him, respect him, but let me just say it won't come as a big surprise to you that he clearly had the choice of where he wanted to go in this world and the fact that he chose Allianz should also tell you something.</p>
          <p>So for those of you who are in an old-fashioned way still willing to take qualitative criteria into your investment decision, all I can say is Allianz is a definite buy.</p>
          <p>Finally, thank you for the &#x2013; personally to all of you for the professional interaction that we have had in the last 12 years even in times of strength. I've always enjoyed it. I've also learned a lot, and before this gets too teary eyed, let's have some lunch. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So 2:00 sharp. Dare I say, shoot. Ladies and gentlemen, please. We are open for business. We are open for your questions. Who wants to take the first shot? Nick Holmes. Why am I not surprised. Go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Holmes, Nomura. I wanted to ask two questions on the low interest rate environment and particularly how it affects your German Life business. Firstly, are you looking at limiting the duration of interest rate guarantees to something that is match-able? And I think the French have done this quite successfully. And the question is, are you looking to do something similar? And if you're not, why not?</p>
          <p>And the second question is looking at sensitivity to low interest rates and the use of the RfB to offset the effect of low interest rates, I wondered if you could give us some sort of guidance on really the sensitivity to low interest rates, and whether for example the RfB will preserve your profit margins, your spreads in your German Life business for the next few years or whether there will be pressure coming from the very low German Bund? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Oli.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I always get the fun questions. First of all, it's very important to understand that we &#x2013; analysts often like to look at the risk-free rate, and as we've said earlier, we don't buy Bunds at 190, but we have many other options given our capital position. And the new business money is significantly over 4%, that obviously reflects that we are buying French and others. So it's very important to understand that the actual asset yield is much higher than the guaranteed one. We have on the page 5 that we provided also under Michael's scenario with a detail on how this works.</p>
          <p>Second, we are indeed lengthening duration. We're having a program on there that has been in force and works over longer periods of time given the amounts of assets and how prices move, that's sort of a 12 to 18 months program to lengthen the duration, and of course, the RfB position will be used. The issue is that we have the strongest in the market place, so it's not so much only about what Allianz does but what happens in the market place.</p>
          <p>Now on top of that, there are a few regulatory changes coming that are supporting the preparing for lower interest rate environments. So for example the industry is being forced to support the so-called additional low interest rate environment reserve, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:34:56) it's called, and that has to make sure that whenever the earned yield falls below whatever the highest guarantee is, there have to be additional reserve happening that goes against policyholder benefits, that's very important. So before policyholder benefits are being credited, this reserve needs to be built. This in fact leads to the fact that when we said in the last presentation last year we can sustain 18 years of this environment, I'm a little bit exaggerating but by now we can sort of sustain that &#x2013; our policyholder promises with this additional reserve forever. So it's very, very important in terms from a risk perspective, we've been doing a number of things.</p>
          <p>The other thing that is being discussed, of course, is how the &#x2013; and I'm expecting that question so I'm addressing it already that currently we are participating our policyholders when they leave on the unrealized gains on the bond portfolios and on equities at the same time and on real estate. While that might make sense for equities and might make sense for real estate, it doesn't make any sense for bonds, because nobody would then envision if these unrealized gains turns into unrealized losses as interest rates go up, so there has to be a revision which will also support the industry and its sustainability. So at this point in time, I'm fairly relaxed particularly for Allianz.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>What was it? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you believe higher <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:28) or is it guaranteed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course, the guarantees are always modeled completely fresh given the changes that we have, and we are also working by the way on new product designs. I think one of the things we are looking at and have been looking at is how do we credit policyholders and differentiate between concurrent credits and final bonus payments. We, for example, have been moving a lot of the policyholder credits to final bonus payments that has those positive effects on lapsation, because it's less attractive for individuals to leave and &#x2013; sorry if I may say that bluntly, speculate against the collective of the people that save until maturity and it also makes it more attractive in terms of capital consumption.</p>
          <p>And going forward, I personally &#x2013; that's my personal opinion across the board, I believe there will be product redesigns that will make life insurance less susceptible to credit spread risk, i.e., against sudden increases in lapsation. That certainly has to happen because it's a significant capital movement that we've seen in the last two years when we recognize that government bonds are no more risk-free. And that then has certain risks attached to it. And the &#x2013; I think &#x2013; personally believe that spread risk will become an focus, and those companies that have both the opportunity to prevent mass lapses to happen at the product level and at the portfolio level and are having higher liquidity on the asset side should get benefits both in terms of economics but also in terms of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just following up on the guaranteed duration, why is it that you're reluctant to put, say, an eight-year limit to guarantees on your capital <mark type="ph" /> recurring type (1:38:16) policies? I mean because that would eliminate much of the interest rate risk with reinvestment risk. I'm just curious as to your strategy in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not illegal. You can do that except for so-called <mark type="ph" /> visitor (1:38:33) products where you have to give a guarantee upfront that you also have to have, but I personally believe in the long run in this environment, you will see a re-pricing option for annuity products upon annuitization, because that will save huge amounts of capital and that's normal. I think the &#x2013; giving a 50-year guarantee is going to be difficult to sustain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thomas Jacquet from Exane BNP. Can you come back on the operating profit guidance on the non-life side? Because if I'm correct, we have the same mid of the range guidance for next year, but we have higher volatility which means in fact a lowering guidance, despite the fact that this year we had a lot of NatCat, you have a turnaround story in Germany and you probably expect to maintain financial income, so what's wrong with the guidance and is it really as conservative &#x2013; as disappointing as it looks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean when you look at the high level of NatCats, we also have a pretty high level of run-offs, and that has been addressed. So we are actually looking at a midpoint of 96.5% combined ratio. And that compared to the current combined ratio, I think, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:40:01) a little decline in the interest income. So, I don't think it's un-ambitious when you look at the midpoint.</p>

          <p>Fabrizio Croce, Kepler. I have two questions. The first one is about growth. Growth is actually &#x2013; you're making &#x2013; giving me some headache, particularly the fact that in P&amp;C reinsurance, you have actually this minus 15% while we saw for several companies, particularly on the Chinese market huge growth, actually bombastic growth due to big transaction. And here is &#x2013; so the question is, is Allianz actually missing on the reinsurance side in emerging markets or are other companies simply working with lower hard rates, which means ROE of some 8%, and therefore writing business that you would not write?</p>
          <p>And the second one is about the dividend. Given that you get the press criticizing you about the size of the dividend, it's important also to mention that there are plenty of people very happy about the current dividend decision. And so here if you could give a clear message going forward for the dividend being at least at the level of this year or even higher given that you are doing all this improvement from operational point of view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should probably take that last question. It will be easy for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, I mean we have this dividend discussion now every year. Let me just stick to the 40% payout ratio. That is something that is sort of commonly agreed with all the other people involved in this decision, and I don't want to mislead you by opening that up again. We will see capital situation is always very, very important. So in February 2012, to talk about something that will happen in 2013, I wouldn't open it up at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Now on the reinsurance side, we are not a reinsurer. If we talk about third party reinsurance here, that is a very, very small part of our book and basically it has a strategic meaning. We've always made good money on third-party reinsurance, but it was basically to support companies in emerging markets where we have strategic interests. That was purpose of our reinsurance. We don't want to compete with the Munich Re's and the Swiss Re's. Now we've drastically reduced that third-party re-insurance because we've seen that especially in the emerging markets, the Cat loading was getting higher and higher, and we didn't want to put that on top of our Cat exposure on our direct books. That's the <mark type="ph" /> 15% (1:43:27) reduction in premium, as basically that goes for the overall book, and that is the cancellation of the quota share with Munich Re, which I think we cancelled already 10 years and now finally we don't have that any more.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But are Chinese risk actually not diversifying your risk that you have for Allianz, because your exposure in China is totally negligible, so potentially from a NatCat perspective, it should even be accredited?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do a little bit of reinsurance in China. I'm not totally happy with the pricing there. So I don't think diversification would be a good argument.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Michael Haid, MainFirst Bank. Two questions. The first question on Solvency II and the value proposition in Life/Health. Obviously, the new business is huge value driver in life insurance and &#x2013; but Allianz is the agent of the policy holders and should act in their best interest. I doubt that it is in the best interest for life insurer &#x2013; for policy holders to buy or to be invested in government bonds in an inflationary environment. Solvency II is an institutionalized way to force you into government bonds. To my understanding, the risk of devaluation of paper money is completely disregarded in Solvency II, is it also disregarded in your internal risk model, and are you happy with that and shouldn't you do more lobbying here?</p>
          <p>Second question also on life insurance, Germany, obviously Allianz Leben is a very strong player &#x2013; the strongest. Since 2004, we know that the health or the strength of the industry is also in your &#x2013; is also a concern of you, the <mark type="ph" /> key vote here as the rescue company protector (1:45:50). How confident are you that within the next the next five years, protector is not going to be used?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:46:05) the internal model and sensitivity to interest rates. I will decline to answer on the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, on the modeling, there are various items. Of course in the standard, I think the background for everybody, it is not in the detail is that government debt is considered to be risk free in the standard formula, but of course it's not risk free as we've been seeing. Therefore, even if you weren't applying huge amount of capital charges insulated in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:46:35) and also you have to demonstrate to your regulator how you're dealing with the factual risks, and the factual risks we are dealing with so therefore we are managing government risk, therefore the asset allocation to the standard &#x2013; between the standard formula and if you have an internal model is, of course, different.</p>
          <p>And Paul mentioned that there is a reason why we're not buying government bonds in Germany not just because of the yield, and that's why and I would like reiterate something that has Paul in his section, about we having also excessively high charges for real estate and other asset items that are modeled on the most volatile markets. But the funny thing, just to give an example, if you apply risk charges that you have for the UK market that also offers higher returns to the German market, that offers lower risk but also lower returns, then the insurers that wouldn't have an internal model would have to stop buying real estate. This is how drastic these things get and we are obviously not as dumb as the standard formula suggests.</p>
          <p>So we are doing it based on our internal model, and therefore actually have the inflationary trend environment in mind. That also is a part of the explanation for why we will not perfectly ever match, particularly not at this point in time, the assets and liabilities. So we have to reduce the duration gap, we have to make it less interest rate sensitive, but it would be not very clever, let me put it this way, to lock ourselves in it at the current interest rate levels.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Could just zoom in a little bit on the U.S. property and casualty business, Fireman's Fund again, because obviously the combined ratio remains fairly poor, and I guess there's two parts to the question. The first part is, what are the near-term challenges? What are the steps being taken? When can we expect the combined ratio to return to below 100%? But then the second part of the question is, I guess this kind of topic has come up a few times over the years and are you still completely convinced that the U.S. P&amp;C market is an attractive market to be in, longer-term?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just on capital; you've presented two of the three very important views, the Solvency I and the economic capital. Could you give us, maybe even qualitatively or preferably quantitatively, a view on where the capital sits on an S&amp;P type of view? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Let me take this Fireman's Fund question either way since I'm on the board, this comes up on a cycle. Right now, we have a real problem in the expense ratio, and that's because we have done quite a lot of investments on the IT side and operations side, and at the same time, been pruning the portfolio to a degree where we now just need more support from markets when it comes to volumes, meaning the company is currently a little to small for the investments that were needed in order to get us back into distribution.</p>
          <p>Now that is partly self-inflicted, and one tends to forget that, because three years ago, we've separated a very profitable book of the Fireman's Fund and passed that on to AGC&amp;S, because it was in line with our strategy to pool our marine business. So there was quite a little bit of redundancy that we'll need to work out of the system.</p>
          <p>Now unfortunately, the U.S. market is not very good when it comes to re-pricing. We see now some price trends on private lines and we still miss them on the commercial lines. That's one side of our book. That brings me to the question of, when are we going to see normal combined ratios? So I'm not talking about 100%, I'm talking about something that is in line with the rest of the book. Today, I'm not confident with the pricing trends in the market, that we will return to a normal combined ratio before 2014.</p>
          <p>Now, attractiveness of the market. We've been in a similar situation about 12 years ago. We've then really trimmed this company for performance and we got a lot of cash dividends out of that. I think it's, over time, one of the most cash accretive businesses we have in the portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spencer, your question on the S&amp;P level, please look at the S&amp;P report because we are not supposed to comment. We are currently trading at an A level with &#x2013; like many others, according to what their capital model is. Second and that's very important, they've changed the model a number of times last few years, always on the same risk, asking for more capital than this &#x2013; before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is Vinit from Goldman Sachs. Just Paul mentioned the partnership, that Allianz sees itself as a reliable partner for other financial firms. Now on the theory that banks will not be rolling on the debt and you have <mark type="ph" /> 145 (1:52:31) in covered bonds and you certainly find yourself with a lot of cash to reinvest in this year. Are you starting to think about that possibility, is that why there's this conversations around alternative assets and real estate? Is that part of the plan? So that's the first question &#x2013; or is that even a probability you're considering, first question?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the asset management, if I may say so, the fourth quarter had a good bit of the luck factor on the performance fees. So when you're going forward, what do you think about the performance fees when you do this projection? I do remember that you talked &#x2013; Oliver talked about the quality of inflows a few quarters ago, which was helping the fee margin on the nonperformance side. So that we can see coming in, but on the performance side, how does management think about that when you set this target? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I start on the asset opportunity side, if I may call it that? I don't know when you last talked with a banker where it took more than three minutes before the term reduction of risk-weighted assets entered the discussion. So it is obviously very clear that there is enormous regulatory pressure, okay, in terms of disposing of risk weighted assets. It is also clear that, as a long-term investor, Allianz actually has a "different risk and investment profile". So if I take an example, if we could buy assets that, for example, help us close the duration gap that we talked about, you might actually get a capital relief by buying those assets, rather than an additional capital charge, okay, on a net basis.</p>
          <p>So therefore, we are definitely looking to buy attractive assets as part of this overall risk-weighted asset reduction process, and it's just a question of timing before we, or Allianz, thinks that the timing is right, that the prices become attractive, because so far those prices have not been attractive enough to bring us to the conclusion of significant trades, even though we have looked at a number of these opportunities, because not surprisingly, banks look to divest the less attractive risk weighted assets before they go into the stuff that we considered to be attractive. But again, given the different interests in terms of also the duration, I think it is rational to assume that there's going to be a time when the two meet.</p>

          <p>On the performance fees, I think I've answered the question already, but I'll take it up again. I mean we have, in good years, around &#x20AC;500 million of performance fees. In our calculations, plans, we plan with less than half of that, which I think is prudent.</p>

          <p>Jon Hocking, Morgan Stanley. I've got a few questions on the German Life business, please. You've given color and information on the reinvestment rate for the overall Life business. Could you give us some color please on Germany specifically, in terms of what the current back book yield is? What the reinvestment rate is? What the average guarantee in the back book is?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the mix of assets you're investing into, is that similar in Germany as it is in the overall book? And then just finally on the &#x2013; I think, Paul, you mentioned the fact that you are investing in French bonds. So are you basically investing in French bonds to back German liabilities, and how does that sit with the comments about domesticating the balance sheets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you just look at sort of similar picture that I've given you for the overall book, the German book right now has a 5.5% total yield. The average guarantees, 2011 has 3.2% so we have the same spread, 230 basis points. On the reinvestment year 2011, we have 4% and so we're seeing 2.25%, and that goes down now to 1.75% in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now the allocation for the reinvestment yield is: covered bonds 33%, 29% is corporate bonds and government bonds, 37%. Out of that is 7% France. Now the cross border restriction is really more related to those, let's say, <mark type="ph" /> terrific (1:57:56) debt that our investors find critical, and I haven't seen that that relates now to funds as well.</p>

          <p>If I may, in terms of adding to the sovereign exposure, if you look at that, what we did last year; out of that, &#x20AC;5.4 billion came from France Life, another &#x20AC;1 billion from P&amp;C Life in France and then you actually have &#x20AC;1.3 billion that came out of German Leben activity. So you can calibrate that we're talking about less than 20%, okay, being, actually coming from outside of France. So it's not that the group is taking large bets there.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Andy Broadfield from Barclays Capital. Two questions, one on M&amp;A. And you, I think, might have opened up a little bit more to the &#x2013; it seems, anyway &#x2013; to the prospect of M&amp;A for Allianz. So I was just wondering whether you can give us a sense of what you have in mind really, and I guess where there's limits or parameters where you feel you don't want to stray out of what you're particularly interested in? I think in the past you talked about P&amp;C, not Life. So just, if you can give some color on that, it would be really helpful. And there's obviously one or two names out there which you have strategic relationships with, or financial relationships with, just any thoughts on that or not?</p>
          <p>The second question is a question which I started talking with Oliver, the break on leverage, and we talked a little bit about &#x2013; I think you said, Paul, about leverage being too high for many of us over some time, but we look at your business model, and particularly the life business model, as a leverage model. So what are you doing and how do you think about that within your relatively conservative views on leverage, generally? What are you doing to transition it, or are you trying to transition it? And do you set parameters where you'd like to get to on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the M&amp;A side, you've seen a couple of companies now in the newspaper, okay? The market has really opened up. So we have seen a lot more that you don't read about. What we are interested in is P&amp;C, and I think Paul has alluded to that. We'll only consider that in those markets where we have a machine that is really functioning and the management that is able to deliver, because most of the benefits we're going to see are coming from the expense side, and not from the growth side. That's at least our assumption on this. Now, we will be very, very careful, because we think there's more assets going to come up over the year, and I certainly don't want to make any comment on our financial investments that you call strategic investments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to follow up on that briefly, the &#x2013; would you consider coming to market for acquisitions at all, or was that the sort of thing where you'd say, in terms of size, would like to go the self-funded that, with &#x2013; plus debt or whatever <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:01:59)?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would advise Michael not to answer that question. I think, look, as you know, I think we've been very conservative, and we will continue to be very conservative on that front, and what is very difficult to answer at this point is generically talking about these type of situations, because it will depend on the individual situation, if that is something that you would find attractive or not. And to kind of make generic statements where you then have to come back and say, yes, in general, that's it, but here specifically maybe it's different, isn't going to serve anybody's purpose.</p>
          <p>So as somebody who will not have to have the responsibility for that at the time, I would just advise that the answer is no comment, without it leading to one or the other conclusion. It's a time of change in the industry and we as an organization are, as Allianz, are very well positioned to take advantage of it. And if there's right opportunity, we should take advantage of it. And then let's cross the hurdle when we get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll make one more comment on this one. Totally, it's a part of our growth policy. We do have some very interesting approaches now where people discuss with us, what would it take to take their books on our platform, okay? So we see that smaller players are getting under huge pressure on the IT side. It's a little bit the situation in Fireman's Fund, where we had to overinvest just to keep up with the IT developments and the requirements from the distribution side.</p>
          <p>Now we see a similar development on the asset management side. We see that small companies without distinctive investment capabilities are now approaching us and asking us, can we take over the investment function. Now, that is a pretty new development. By the way, we've already hinted at that four years ago when we did our large investments in to our Allianz business system, which is our European IT system.</p>
          <p>You've seen the expense ratios; you've seen that we've had to invest quite heavily in getting these machines up-to-date and so I think we're going to see a staggered approach of people trying to get an advantage by lining up interests that don't necessarily are an acquisition right away. And I think these are very, very interesting opportunities going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if I may. Andy, I'm not sure I agree with you that the life insurance is a leverage play, okay? We, in the way that we look at our Life business, let's not forget the risk business has the RFP buffer, for example, that we have in Germany is about &#x20AC;17 billion, which people easily forget.</p>
          <p>Secondarily, it is a question of the duration i.e. of the liabilities, the length of these contracts, that actually allow you to take "certain risks." So in a world even where you are de-levering and I think that the value proposition of having a business or a product that offers de facto a capital guarantee and then yet a little bit of interest, is actually something that is a valuable proposition to be part of the savings plans that individuals actually have. And if you want to go for performance, you take and buy businesses or products that we offer out of our asset management division, as opposed to out of our Life and Health division.</p>
          <p>So I do believe that there are some very significant opportunities to straighten out and really design products that are targeted at different customer requirements, and that's why I'm personally of the opinion that the unit linked space is much less attractive, because it's de facto an asset management product and it should be serviced as an asset management product. Yes, please. Go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thorsten Wenzel, DZ Bank. I would appreciate if you could provide a little more insight into the German non-Life business. If I remember it correctly, this business was extremely profitable, say, five, six years ago and certainly more profitable than the market. Since then, I think the combined ratio has deteriorated more than 10 percentage points or so, and this probably less profitable than the average in the market by now.</p>
          <p>And I think you repeatedly mentioned claims handling as a reason. But my question is, is that just the reason, or is there anything else that needs to be fixed in this business? And then, related to that, you target I think a combined ratio improvement of 8 percentage points or so in the next two years. Is that completely to come from internal improvements, or to some extent from expected market improvements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, see the German business again, it's good to have a little bit of historic perspective like with Fireman's Fund. During those times when it outperformed, the German insurance business was full of capital gains. It carried a lot of excess capital that we've reduced over time and rightly so. And we didn't have this fierce, fierce competition on the <mark type="ph" /> motor (128:03) side, yeah?</p>
          <p>So the reserve level has got very high. I don't think that you can compare the German business today, German insurance business in total, with the German insurance business 10 years ago. We've just talked about average premiums on the <mark type="ph" /> motor (128:22) side, yeah? The average premium on the <mark type="ph" /> motor (128:25) side is at the level it was 10 years ago, yeah? Now if you compare that with Spain or Italy, this is about 60% to 70% of the units in Southern Europe. So it's a very &#x2013; it has turned into a very, very competitive market.</p>
          <p>Now the claims, let's call it restructuring that we have to do, has a lot to do with the restructuring methodology that you have to apply in Germany to large restructuring projects, where you have about one year of discussions with your workers counsel. During that discussion, no negotiation, you cannot approach individuals. So individuals are getting approached by other companies. So you lose good seasoned claims <mark type="ph" /> and lesser (129:27) managers, and that is something that we have to build up. It doesn't work as fast as getting an underwriter up to speed who has tariff models and then so on.</p>
          <p>So again, it's not only claims, it's also very heavy expense load especially on the sales side except we're going to address that as well. And then let's not forget, we are looking at a company with declining volumes. We've lost about 1% market share over the last couple of years. Now I think with the product initiatives we have in place, with our distribution initiatives, we are addressing that in adequate way and maybe in more general terms. What &#x2013; sort of when totally unnoticed is that we have to sort of reposition the agency business from after 2008, after the sale of Dresdner quite considerably. Because, at that time, we were implementing a bank agency model in order to drive frequency into the &#x2013; or contact frequency into the agencies.</p>
          <p>Now with the sale of Dresdner, obviously that has changed. So we had to reposition the whole agency channel, which is still the major sales channel for the P&amp;C business in Germany. But, frankly, on Germany <mark type="ph" /> I'm the least contract (02:11:17), I think that's much easier to get back on track than any other OE. And I'm very, very happy with the turns we've seen in the French business and the Italian business. They take a little longer, because these entities are quite complex and large. But, once you've started them, it's like a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:11:46) model, very, very hard to stop again.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Few questions. One I was wondering if you can quantify the loss on the VA side in Q4. And if you can tell us what was policyholder behavior? What was volatility charge? And what we should expect in 2012?</p>
          <p>And the second question is it fair to assume that the non-operating profit in a normal year should be roughly &#x20AC;1 billion negative? And my final question if you can quantify the liquidity premium impact on your life embedded value and the &#x2013; and if you can tell us what the new business IRR was? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Can I get some <mark type="ph" /> speed? Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:13:11). Liquidity premium impact, you always have by the way I believe that's right to be there. It's about &#x20AC;5 billion to &#x20AC;5.5 billion on the MCEV. The liquidity premium impact on the new business value is around &#x20AC;500 million. In terms of the VA legacy block is you asked for the operating profit impact, therefore the VA legacy block was &#x20AC;417 million loss for last quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to ask a bigger picture question, which is where do you see Allianz in five years time and I'm thinking in two respects in particular, one is growth. You said that growth is one of your concerns, looking at recent performance, and one of your large competitors is targeting double-digit growth out to 2015.</p>
          <p>I wondered is this something that you would see as possible with yourselves. I mean you've got this big German P&amp;C program, which could drive that. So firstly, what is your feeling about growth over the next five years? And then secondly, where would you like to see the business go in terms of product and geography? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically, I'm looking back last 10 years. I think that's realistic to look at the growth between 3% and 5% for Allianz. Now that is because we don't give any growth targets on the P&amp;C side I think for very good reasons. We do have a couple of segments within the P&amp;C where we do have growth targets, but that's more on few business like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:16:48). So we don't want to confuse our underwriters on that side.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on the Life side, it totally depends on your bancassurance. I mean, all the swings you've seen are really coming from despite this year the &#x2013; especially effect of our Japanese business, you see the swings are basically coming from our large distributors on the bancassurance side. Now that is also the least profitable business. So I'm really frankly not too worried about that.</p>
          <p>The only thing I'm worried about is when I have expense overruns on the Life side, okay? I think that's very helpful to put on some volumes. The &#x2013; I think the whole and that's not the first time I'm seeing that. I think the whole bancassurance relationships need a very clear commitment from both sides of our quality service levels about margin levels and volume, and this is what I meant with restructuring bancassurance agreements where I think, for instance, in Spain, we've done a very, very good job to do that.</p>
          <p>We are in discussions with Unicredit. I think we've done a good job on Commerzbank. So I think we are on good way there. But, again, the volatility on top line and bancassurance will always remain if there's a competition on liquidity and saving deposits <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:18:33). Now I think the Life business especially in this situation where, yes, there's pressure on margins, it is very helpful for supporting your own type distribution. I think there it really creates synergies and value and we watch very, very careful line by line, country by country what is the contribution from third-party Life business.</p>
          <p>Now the &#x2013; where do I see Allianz in five years? I think I've always said &#x20AC;100 billion premium volume of loss is so much switching and really driving the business where it's profitable and getting less pressure on growth in those markets where profitability is down that I think it doesn't matter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:19:35) &#x20AC;110 billion, &#x20AC;120 billion book. If there will be an opportunity to get there, yes, we'll get there. If that is only at the cost set a serious margin decline, we'll not go there. Is that covering your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a little bit more quantification about whether you see growth perhaps the higher end of single digit, I mean does that same sensible to you with your business mix in a normal environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely not, because if you want to &#x2013; see, if you look at the growth patterns, I'll give you a couple of numbers. Look at the world market share of Allianz 2001 to 2011, okay? So the world market share and P&amp;C has gone down from three-point something to three points. On the same time, the Life world market share has increased from 1.9 to over 3, yeah. So that's the trend in the book.</p>
          <p>Now if you go back to one of my first charts, we are very much managing this company now for cash proceeds. So we are putting more emphasis on the P&amp;C side and on the asset management side, yeah, which I think is the right thing to do. So we are rather on the control side for Life growth.</p>
          <p>Our Life growth over the past two years has been double-digit, low double-digit. I think that was an exceptional situation for Allianz, because the real growth is coming from couple of markets, especially on the emerging markets side. China is one where you see double-digit growth. Our representation in China is minor. So even if we have 50% growth in the Life side year-on-year, that doesn't change the needle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you have to conclude in terms of product mix, you would see a significant shift towards P&amp;C over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what is a significant shift there? I mean, we are pretty much on a 50-50 basis. We've been &#x2013; maybe we've moved that from 60% P&amp;C, 40% Life when I started in our small the other way around. But if we can pursue organic growth on the P&amp;C side at profitable trends that would be our preference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Two questions, please. The first one is just on the investment margin part of your life insurance earnings. You've shown us slides where you compare the current yield to the minimum guarantee, which is the three used to like particularly from a risk standpoint, but it doesn't really help figure out how much money you'll earn. And so the question is how do the &#x2013; the way in which your current yield will progress compared to the way that your crediting rate will &#x2013; sorry, the question is how your crediting rate progress? What is your ability to bring that down or to bring it down, when I say ability, I suppose I'm speaking million from a marketing standpoint and what does that mean for how well the investment margin for the shareholder can hold up? That was the first question.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on non-Life pricing, Oliver, the slide you showed if I read it correctly, you achieved a 3.1% price increase last year and you're targeting 2.8% for the coming year. I think there's a number of examples of markets out there where price momentum is improving. I guess there must be some market share in &#x2013; where price momentum is decelerating so that your overall expectation is down in 2012 or maybe you're just being conservative. Can you just elaborate on why your own pricing is decelerating in the coming year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, obviously on the crediting rates, we have all flexibility because that will move the volumes <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:24:38) for next year. And I mean all I tried to explain when Nick was asking for growth, you know, we are not very keen to write a lot of new business when margins are unsatisfactory. I think the situation in Germany is totally different, because there we have an additional competitive advantage, which is very low expense, yeah? By the way, this is what we measure on market by market, how much we have on the crediting rates because of our low expense in the system.</p>
          <p>Now, if you follow for instance the German situation, we have never been at the top of creditors, never. And still the market share has increased by 4 percentage points, which I think is more related to brand and security than to, you know, are you crediting 4.2% or 4% et cetera. So we've learned that. And I remember, when I took over in 2003 that we were talking a lot about crediting rates and I want to put that and ask my friends, are we mutual or are we a shareholder company?</p>
          <p>And if you look at the profit development from thereon, I think that's showing pretty clearly that we've sort of found a balanced way how to include shareholders and our policyholders. So short answer to your question, I think we have more flexibility than anybody else in the market when it comes to crediting rates at least in Germany, it does not apply to each and every market here.</p>
          <p>So I have a little chart here that is 2011 and 2012. I don't think you have that. But, you see the good news on this one is there's very little red and a lot of green. So the overall pricing trend for 2012, we see in the range of 3% and it's a little heavier on the personal lines side than on the commercial side. Now outstanding again are our Anglo-Saxon markets, also UK and Australia, very, very strong in France and in Germany as well.</p>
          <p>And the only &#x2013; there's only two countries where we have slightly decreasing prices or rates. That is in Italy on the motor side and where we've taken a lot of price quarter-on-quarter over the last 12 quarters and where we have a high profitability and a slight decrease on the property and liability in Spain where the market is just turning to be really, really competitive on this one. But again, I think we have the highest profitability in Spain. So there's room for redevelopment.</p>
          <p>So we, basically looking at 2011, 2012, I think with the exception of commercial lines in the U.S. and large industrial books that are not exposed to cat risk, everything else is happening. So we finally see what we've been waiting for, for quite some time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So back to the first question on the life margin, should we then assume that going forward over the short to medium term that your life operating profit can grow in line with your life AUM or should we expect to have some natural drag on margin because of these lower interest rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should expect a drag, yeah, but I don't think that that's significant. In the end, the capability of that book to produce shareholder profits even in this environment is quite exceptional.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andy from Barclays again. I wanted to understand a little bit about your thoughts on &#x2013; I'm trying to square away your thoughts on the scale and your sort of industrialization of many of your businesses with your limited ambition for growth on P&amp;C this is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (02:30:02) your limited focus on growth targets in P&amp;C?</p>
          <p>And then squaring that away with there is clearly pressure for a number of your competitors, a number of your key markets. Now your scale advantage is really emphasized or accelerated if you grow, because your fixed cost base is leveraged yet again not trying to put that pedal down, particularly in those markets where you got competitors on their &#x2013; nearly on their knees at least?</p>
          <p>Then is that just a missed opportunity? So how are you thinking about that you're targeting certain markets clearly Italy is an interesting one in that context and one or two others. How are you thinking about taking those advantages, bearing in mind, you arguably suffering on the other side in the U.S. on some of your actions that you've taken on expense and profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we have a misunderstanding here. We don't have a limited ambition on the gross side in P&amp;C area. What I'm saying, I think, this is, was 25 years of experience. If you get gross targets to your P&amp;C businesses, you will suffer badly couple of years later, no question. Now, as I said, there are a couple of business lines that we find quite interesting where we do have gross targets. The expense synergies I've mentioned except when we look at P&amp;C opportunities, we'll look at them more from expense synergy point of view than from a gross point of view. So, in a way, I'm just circling back to you and saying the same that you did.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Back again. So, on the M&amp;A question that Andy already poised. I mean, you have this growth problem. And the growth problem can be solved in two way organically, which seemed difficult for Allianz for the time being. And the second one is, of course, through acquisition and then the story with the conservatism.</p>
          <p>I mean, in the past, Allianz did acquisition at &#x2013; from 1.3, 1.6 even at 2 time book value, and this was not enough conservative. And then, in these days we have actually distressed asset which are trading at 0.2, 0.3 time book value or tangible. And then, even if you would reserve this asset, we would end up maybe at 0.6, 0.7. So my question is, where does conservatism stop and where does fear actually block action in some sort of irrationality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The good news is you'll have a new guy or a new lady in charge of M&amp;A. So therefore that points to opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I would answer that in a different way. You show me one asset that after the results in pace comes at 0.6 net asset value, and you're on. Show me one.</p>
          <p>You know, it's very nice to sit at that side and come with there are targets out there at 0.2 times book, da, da, da, da, da. Unfortunately these targets only exist in a fantasy and not in reality. Or they are not clean targets. Then we are not talking about P&amp;C then we're talking about the combined book of Life and P&amp;C where you may have a great P&amp;C opportunity and a very shitty opportunity on the Life side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a technical term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me come back to another point that I'm always making, the history of Allianz M&amp;A buying high and selling low. The only two acquisitions that we've made at very high prices and maybe bad timing, was Italy and France. Now Italy and France had a totally different M&amp;A background. The M&amp;A background was to get minorities out who were blocking all activities that we needed to get our global business model in place.</p>
          <p>Now we would not see in AGC&amp;S business without having bought out these minorities, yeah because it meant lifting out parts of the book. We would not see and aim today. We would not see a reinsurance operation as we have and we would not see a lot of other things, platforms and blah-blah because we were totally blocked in every global activity by solid low minority things.</p>
          <p>Now, one could say you could have managed your business without getting Italy and France involved. But unfortunately, a lot of the other operations were indirectly helped by these minorities as well. So our Spanish business was half had, our Credit business was half Allianz in France and so and so. This was a preconditioned in order to be solved to create the Allianz that is today compared to the one that Paul has referred to, sort of conglomerate of loose affiliates who were only coming to Germany to set more cash when needed. I don't think that it's a very fair point to make to always come back to these two acquisitions.</p>
          <p>And I would love to talk about the acquisitions that we've done in Australia, which is one of the real great assets today that was a very underperforming company as well. We did great acquisitions in the U.S. was the <mark type="ph" /> Mech eBook (02:35:49), marine book that is now part of the AGC&amp;S. So I think this sort of signaling out these two acquisitions and maybe another one that was another segment is, maybe we should carry that in the past in our judge management on the new acquisitions we're doing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, one question, Atanasio Pantarrotas from Cheuvreux. One question regarding your capital position, you showed your solvency ratio according to the Solvency II calibration. And I wonder if we must consider this one as new target, new &#x2013; sorry, new framework. And I wonder what is your target, in terms of solvency capital? I don't know if it is according to Solvency II or your internal economy solvency capital?</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding the Solvency II final outcome, what is your feelings about the final outcome in term of timetable, in term of final rules regarding, for example, illiquidity premium or inclusion out of the value and force as tier 1 capital? So, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll do it very quickly. We are doing further changes to the internal model in the first quarter of 2012. A number of things will come on that will both increase and decrease some of the solvency components. So we are not final yet. And we're steering our risk capital on the model. We're looking it as a risk management tool but we're operating under Solvency I and that's the boundary condition for now, and that's the one that matters most. And before we see finally Solvency II implemented whenever that's going to be 2014, 2015 or someday later, we'll know.</p>
          <p>In the &#x2013; on concrete question you had around what the final rules will be, they're all up in the year. As you know, the industry is negotiating with the parliament that's now on stage and the commission in order to propose a countercyclical premium and a &#x2013; what we call SAM, a Spread Adjustment Mechanism, both at the same time in order to reflect appropriately the illiquidity of our liabilities and the appropriate matching on the asset side.</p>
          <p>What will come out? We don't know. At the moment, there's a little bit of a mess between the commission IO part in the parliament. We will see at the end of March. March 21 is expected reporting date from the parliament and then we will go into the trial lock that will begin before the summer, is it unlikely to be finished before the summer. So we'll probably have to wait until year-end to get a view on the Level 2 rulings. And by then, we will know the vast majority of the items. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you it's clear. Unfortunately, it has a lot of movement.</p>
          <p>Now, the key items that are being asked is, again, how do you model the illiquidity and how do you take care of the fact that when many of the in-force books were created, there was no saying that you should account for government spread risk which we don't do in the standard formula as I mentioned earlier, but in the <mark type="ph" /> interim announcement (02:40:24) certainly it is part of the AFR computation, Available Financial Resources, because the assets get discounted as the actual spreads, yeah. So you already have it in there when people say there is no accounting for government risk, it's not true. It's already in the AFR calculation.</p>

          <p>And secondarily, Hartford, as you point out is a Life situation on the public or a US company. So you do not really expect us to comment on that. Hate to disappoint you.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much, again, how long, I gathered a mismatch in terms of the duration at the moment using up about &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;1.5 billion of capital. How do you &#x2013; over what time do you think you're going to look to address them? I had a word with Tom earlier, but basically how would you look to address that over what time period we'd be looking to address that, is that more serious for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a more serious question. The, I think first of all, you have to ask yourself the question if that is a meaningful allocation of that capital because I don't think it's a question of just simply deciding that you eradicate that and therefore the capital charge goes. It may actually be an investment decision to stick with some of that on the risk return type of consideration. So I don't think this is an automatism. Now I'm not saying that our direction is not, okay, to actually move into a duration matched type of situation, but depending on what kind of product you have that may not be the optimal value proposition and you then is simply have to take the capital charges into account when you actually make your calculations of the product or the product features that you want to have, for example, on the Life side.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think there's an automatism to that. Okay. And I think the other aspect that I'd like to highlight is that if you actually have "erratic short-term changes" as we are indicating here in terms of swap rates simply changing, then that doesn't automatically mean that you're going to throw the switch from day one. Okay, because that may change tomorrow, half a year from now while you actually talking about value propositions that have a multi-year type of investment horizon and planning horizon.</p>
          <p>So, I'm afraid there is no easy answer in terms of how quickly is it going to be eradicated. It is clear what the direction is that AIM is working out together with the Life operations because it's particularly a Life mismatch type of thing. And Oliver, of course, in this case B&#xE4;te is on the case of everybody to minimize the regulatory capital requirements on this, rightfully, as is his job. But the real question is, what's the right trade off and where do you best allocate the regulatory capital? And at the very least, it's a meaningful discussion to be had rather than automatism that says, "Give it up." Jean-Francois.</p>

          <p>Jean-Francois Tremblay, RBC. I think you've acknowledged the pressures on Life operating earnings for the next few years, since we can expect stable earnings at best. Considering the limited growth opportunities in P&amp;C and the fact that we're potentially at a peak in the fixed-income cycle and considering this net contribution that's doubled from the new asset management business total operating earnings, how confident are you? And what makes you confident you can deliver earnings growth over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very confident.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I gave you the explanation already. I mean, at our outlook, I was talking about the potential in P&amp;C. I was lining out the potential until 2014 on the German business for instance. And I think we've given quite an attractive outlook for the asset management business was being a little cautious about the performance fees. Yeah?</p>
          <p>So, I don't think &#x2013; I think it would be a wrong impression if you take out of the meeting today, that we have a growth problem. We never have a growth problem. If you want us to grow, we can grow as fast as you want to. We can be &#x20AC;150 billion company in almost in two years. I think it's very prudent that we don't have this target in this period of time. So I'm not really getting the notion we have a problem in growth. We are not really ambitious on the growth side. Growth, we can deliver as much as you want to.</p>
          <p>Earnings growth. You were talking about. I pointed out earnings growth is going to come very clearly from the P&amp;C side, very clear.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Vinit from Goldman Sachs. Just two qualitative questions. Now on this slide which is C-9 from Paul Achleitner's, the 65% coming from the asset management or investment income side. I'm just wondering, how much do you think the impact has been from ownership of an asset manager. So were you not &#x2013; I'm not asking the question that I &#x2013; you answered &#x2013; I'm not asking that question.</p>
          <p>Just wondering, what is the benefit of owning an asset manager, would this number look like significantly different, slightly different, and this is more a qualitative question and I'm not asking whether you're going to do sell or not?</p>
          <p>The second thing is that, you very consistently communicated on commercial versus personal and your preference is very clear. Now in the last few months in the U.S., for example, there has been some upward pricing. Is it just your view that it's not enough and that's why you're not looking in that or is that something else there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now what we've seen in the years is clear pricing or the right activity on personal lines business and on commercial, if there is a cat exposure, yeah, but not on the normal commercial business, which I think is at least underpriced by 5% plus. On the benefit of owning an asset manager, I think it's a little difficult to say, but I would apply at least a 10% of our investment results to having input.</p>

          <p>Andreas Schaefer, WestLB. I just want to come back to the German market. I mean, you made clearly that you have a very competitive advantage in life insurance and this pays off in increasing market share and very good earnings. I think on page A-20, you gave a very concrete outlook and very ambitious outlook in my view for the non-life market. I think the first question is do you agree that some of your competitors especially the one in Northern Bavaria have the same competitive advantage in non-life than you have in life?</p>
          <p>And the second question, I think the combined ratio of 95% and what does it mean for the market? How much has the market to improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The competitive situation on the Life side is probably working better in our favor than on the P&amp;C side. You're right because here we are the clear market leader in all respect and the brand and solidity comes more than on the P&amp;C side as an advantage. I'm not so sure whether there's competitor that you're talking about is really in a situation where we can't catch up. I think we've made a lot of improvements in our systems and I think we've come to terms with the direct approach. We are still careful because we don't want to grow into a channel that still doesn't have the profitability at least in Germany of the other channels. And certainly, we'll need a market recovery in Germany. If you look at a German <mark type="ph" /> motor (02:51:14) result of 112% combined and I think that has triggered the pricing activities in all that's all under competitors. So clearly the 95% needs a little drive from the market as well.</p>

          <p>Third round, Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three quick ones, I promise. Andy from Barclays. Just on the capital, two questions, one is on investments and particularly the alternatives and the capital charges, which I think you rely reasonably heavily on internal model charge calculations versus a standard model on the Solvency II which really makes some quite an attractive asset class. And just sort to think, if you were to put yourself in an investor's shoes, and an investor in Allianz's shoes, particularly, and how you look at across the insurance sector and you see the unlevel playing field between who can charge what for what it's sort of investment.</p>
          <p>How do you think we should think about this because you can invest in wonderful and probably right, well, I believe right, infrastructure deals and to make sure liability payouts but for us looking in, you can and another guy can't because he's using the standard model or he's using an internal model that disagrees with that. I'm not quite sure how we should think about that is in terms of the risk reward on those investments, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is, you've done a model on the sensitivity to interest rate moves and equities combined on your economic Solvency, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:52:50) I think it was economic solvency takes on to 138%. And I was just, we had another &#x2013; one of your competitors did a similar thing and frankly, it was on a slight different scenario but they went passed it in the second half, because there's nothing like as bad as a scenario that modeled. So I was just trying to get a sense of your feel how comfortable you are that economic sensitivity model, would actually work in that scenario given this &#x2013; you miss other variables you have to consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before I let Oliver B&#xE4;te answer question number two, I'd like to assure the risk guys in the room that I did not ask Andy to ask this question on terms of how to look at the alternatives and the capital charges and risk charges associated with that. But I have to admit, it is a little bit of a hot button and let me, for me &#x2013; let me tell you where at least, personally I stand on this not to say that I ever got away with it with the risk guys but it's something that I think one notes to think about.</p>
          <p>If you actually look at these "capital charges" that are being applied, then you're going to ask yourself why if you compare public equities and for example, private equity. Why is it that public &#x2013; that private equity should receive a higher charge than public equity?</p>
          <p>And the answer that people will give you is because it's illiquid, okay? And therefore it is quite appropriate to have a higher capital charge. That, of course, is an answer that is absolutely true. If all you look at is a trading book of a bank, for example, where the question of having to liquidate on day one. The very essence of the investment model of an insurance company is that you actually have a large investment portfolio and a large and long-term investment horizon.</p>
          <p>So if I actually hold 90% of that portfolio in fixed income, liquidity is not exactly the prior the primary concern, okay, in terms of having the ability of pay you something off because by the time that I get to the question on having to "liquidate out of necessity" a private equity holding, all kinds of things have happened before that make it very unlikely that I have to get to that "risk layer" in my portfolio to be liquidated immediately and today.</p>
          <p>So I therefore would argue that the, a internal risk model that actually takes the specific situation of that very liability based long-term investor called Allianz inter account, should take &#x2013; should reflect that and should actually enable us to invest in those assets, footnote, of course, the individual pick of the asset needs to be good one and the investment decision needs to be a right one. But we're talking about the general asset or capital &#x2013; risk capital allocation.</p>
          <p>And therefore, I would maintain that illiquid alternative assets have a very important role to play in a long-term portfolio of an insurance company such as Allianz in light of the portfolio that you actually have in the liquidity fact or the liquidity characteristics of such a portfolio. Unlike what the standard model would suggest, which of course looks at a private equity investment on a standalone basis, and says, oops, this is equity and illiquid on top, very, very difficult, very high capital charge. But that's one man's view and my guys on the risk side have a lot of fun debating that with us on an ongoing basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can make one comment, that's right. We distinguish between what we call strategic asset allocation where we would like to be and tactical asset allocation where we are fast more or less to be and what are the degrees of freedom that we give Paul for the new alternative investment.</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; and we've said that before as well. I mean this is very much a question of political will. And we're spending quite some time with government talking about other consequences of Basel III, Solvency II, rating models very important because doesn't matter. We have an internal model and the rating model that's different and they don't approve our internal model then we'll have to take into consideration what is the business model change from a rating point of view. But we are very active in lining and pointing out to government what are the refinancing needs, what are the financing needs on infrastructure for instance going forward, what is the capacity to finance, where does it come from.</p>
          <p>And in the end, they will have to make a couple of political decisions as well to drive the regulation in the way that they think fit. Now it's not in the end only regulation and the rating agencies, it's also accounting. Yeah, but we frequently heard from, back from the accounting Boards that they don't feel responsible for the economic impact. And so it's right now quite an interesting conflict and one that get sort of mirage in the company when we talk to our risk managers and I would give them all the credit for holding up and saying while the world <mark type="ph" /> said services (02:59:13) and it's not what it likely to be. That's the situation but I think we're going to see movements under regulations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>By now, I've forgotten the second half of your question. Would you repeat that?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The sensitivity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The sensitivity doesn't make sense to economic Solvency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, it makes sense, otherwise we wouldn't have it. And then we're really looking at that. If you actually look at what last year we've set out. When we talked in the second quarter and let me remind you, I gave you the &#x2013; and with the help of some capital markets expert who always look at this weekly and the probability of that combined scenario happening was around 17% as price in the day for the combined scenario and it turned out to be for real. So we are obviously planning with certain confidence intervals, and the second one is we are obviously planning for when the event happens, how do you protect yourself in the tail event. So, therefore, this number gives you only an indication of which risks we need to manage and that has two components. One, how much leeway do we have if the situation happens because we'll obviously not be sitting then waiting for it to happen, we'll be reducing equity exposure, and we'll be addressing the risk once the center market turns. So, sorry, it's a risk and it's a great risk management tool. We need to watch it and we need to work on it.</p>
          <p>The issue is, again, having enough levers in your hand to address this. So, for example, if we haven't really addressed the interest rate position early enough, it doesn't make sense to buy a lot of swaptions when you might find out that your counterparty will not be around to settle a swaption at the time you need it, number one and by the way, that the instruments need to be available. And the second one is on the equity side, you also need to move. And need to be able to move. That's why Michael mentioned that it's very important on the financial stakes that we have that we can either hedge them or we can adept them to whatever our risk appetite and our risk capital is. And also, we're working on both and also monitoring at being able to move. By the way, many can't move. We can move.</p>
