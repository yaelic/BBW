          <p>Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sean Boyle. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2012 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak, our CFO. We will be available for questions after our prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2012, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our second quarter financial results. Trailing-12-month operating cash flow was $3.22 billion, compared with $3.21 billion. Trailing-12-month free cash flow decreased 40%, to $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital was 11%, down from 21%. ROIC is trailing-12-month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter-ends.</p>
          <p>The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 468 million shares, compared with 468 million shares. Worldwide revenue grew 29%, to $12.83 billion, or 32% excluding the $272 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection, and shipping offers.</p>
          <p>Media revenue increased to $4.12 billion, up 13%, or 15% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $8.16 billion, up 38%, or 42% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 59%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 43%. Active customer accounts exceeded 180 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units were 40% of paid units, compared to 36% of paid units in Q2 of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $9.49 billion, or 73.9% of revenue, compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&amp;A combined was $2.99 billion, or 23.3% of sales, up approximately 307 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.3 billion, or 10.1% of revenue, compared with 9.2%. Tech and content was $970 million, or 7.6% of revenue, compared with 6.3%. Marketing was $521 million, or 4.1% of revenue, compared with 3.3%.</p>
          <p>Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 36%, to $7.33 billion. Media revenue grew 18%, to $1.87 billion. EGM revenue grew 41%, to $4.94 billion, representing 67% of North America revenues, up from 65%. North America segment operating income increased 61%, to $344 million, a 4.7% operating margin.</p>
          <p>In the international segment, revenue grew 22%, to $5.51 billion. Adjusting for the $269 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 28%. Media revenue grew 8%, to $2.25 billion, or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34%, to $3.22 billion, or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues, up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91%, to $16 million, or a 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%.</p>
          <p>Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7%, to $360 million, or 2.8% of revenue, down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47%, to $107 million, or 0.8% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense was $109 million, a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter, and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of the Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income was $7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities decreased $1.39 billion year-over-year, to $4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36%, to $4.38 billion, and inventory turns were 10.1, down from 11.3 turns a year ago, as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24%, to $7.07 billion, and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our Q2 2012 capital expenditures were $657 million. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions.</p>
          <p>Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling inter-company balances in foreign currency amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a material effect on guidance.</p>
          <p>Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, or settlements; record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.</p>
          <p>For the Q3 2012, we expect net sales of between $12.9 billion and $14.3 billion, or growth between 19% and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between $350 million loss and</p>
          <p>$50 million loss, down from $79 million income in the comparable prior-year period; this includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
          <p>We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense, to be between a $75 million loss and $225 million in income, or between 129% decline and 14% decline. We expect capital expenditures, including capitalized software development, to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion.</p>
          <p>These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of continued business growth, consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.</p>
          <p>We remain heads-down-focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question on Kiva in a couple parts, Tom. Now that you've closed the acquisition, can you talk about how you'll deploy the Kiva technology? Is that for new fulfillment centers only, or can you use that in your legacy fulfillment centers, and perhaps what type of operational efficiencies that could gain? And then last part would be is there any impact on your 3Q guidance from the Kiva acquisition specifically? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of Kiva itself, we're very, very excited to have Kiva as part of the Amazon team. We're looking forward to getting great productivity over time through the use. But again, it's very early, and you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of the plans. In terms of the impact, you mentioned Q3, let me just provide a little bit of data on both Q2 actuals and Q3. In terms of GAAP operating income in Q2, it was negative $25 million. For Q3, it's approximately negative $35 million. And then on net income for Q2, it was a loss of approximately $65 million. So those are the numbers for Q2 and Q3. But again, we're very, very happy to have them part of the team, and we look forward to working with them going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, great quarter. Question on the gross margin, continues to climb up, and I was wondering if you could give any commentary there around how agency versus wholesale in e-books is contributing to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the bigger issue is not that. It's related to overall 3Ps. There's a number of different factors, certainly, driving the improvement in the implied gross margins that you're referring to. But as it relates to 3P, it's on the broader 3P, so if you take a look at from a units perspective, third-party was 40% of our total units in Q2. That's up from 36%, so it's an approximately 400-basis-points increase of percentage of total units, which is certainly one of the factors that you're seeing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, great. Thanks for the question. This is Deepak sitting in for Herman. So the question I had was on the hardware business. So how important do you think is the hardware strategy to you for the digital content, now given that Kindle Fire has been out there for a while, so could you discuss about the strategy on the business and how it's driving the digital content?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We're very excited about both the hardware and the content side of the business. We think, if you take a look at our devices, certainly, it's very integrated, which is great for customers, so we think it's an incredible experience. And so we've been very excited about the progress we've made so far from both the device and content standpoint, and we're super excited about the roadmap that we have. So, again, we're very, very happy with what the team's doing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura Equity Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and thanks for taking the question. I noticed &#x2013; this is Aram Rubinson sitting in for Brian Nowak. I noticed that shipping costs were lower as a percent of sales for the first time in nearly three years. The driver, it looks like, is shipping cost per unit, which fell about 10%. Can you talk about how much of that might be attributable to proximity of distribution centers to metro areas, lower fuel, more favorable carrier pricing, et cetera? And whether or not you see anything on the horizon that would change that course?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're seeing &#x2013; there's a number of different factors, but certainly one of them is we're getting closer to customers, and that's just with our wide multi-node fulfillment network, so it's certainly having an impact on that. And again, we have a lot of opportunity to improve that over time, but again, the team's making good progress, and you're seeing that reflected in the results so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Paul Bieber for Justin. Just going back to the gross margin question, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the relative impact of a few different things; category, maturity, advertising, 3P &#x2013; and maybe digital content on gross margins. Which ones are impacting gross margins more than others?</p>
          <p>And then just a quick question on the taxes; what will the impact of sales tax collection in Texas and California be on gross margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your question on gross margins, we're not breaking that out, but certainly, 3P is having an impact. Mix of business is having an impact. We continue to try to work with our partners to get even better prices on the goods that we provide for customers, which is certainly impacting it. Mix of business, things like AWS is certainly impacting that as well, given the growth rates there. So, again, those are things that are impacting it.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales taxes, any impact that we certainly would expect to see would be included in the guidance that we're giving for Q3. But one thing to keep in mind as it relates to that is, right now, approximately 50% of our business around the world we either collect sales tax or value-added tax. We have very good businesses in those jurisdictions. And so keep that in mind as you think about any upcoming changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug, just have a couple of questions. Can you discuss the international media deceleration? Looks like it decelerated from 22% to 12% on an ex-FX basis. And then can you just give us an update on the fulfillment center plans for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of &#x2013; I'll take international in total first, and then the same is true for media. And really the &#x2013; I'll even start with the total business. Total business grew 32%. That's on a local-currency basis. One thing to keep in mind is, for both the total business, international growth, and international media, we had very, very strong growth last year Q2. In fact, our total growth rate last year was 51% for the total business, and on a local-currency basis, that was 44% growth. That's the highest growth quarter we've had in over 10 years.</p>
          <p>And so when you look at that, when you're comparing ourselves in Q2 this year, we had very good growth, given that compare to last year. And that's some of what you're seeing also in international media, as you mentioned. So international media was up 8%; on a local-currency basis it was up 12%, and certainly it's a challenging compare.</p>
          <p>Also, there were some things just with &#x2013; some timing things as we've launched, with the unfortunate events in Japan last year. We certainly did have some releases that were scheduled for late in the quarter that obviously didn't happen that moved into Q2, just from a supply standpoint. Those are certainly impacting that region and some other things. So it's &#x2013; again, think of it in terms of the comparison point to last year, is probably the best thing to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Rohit Kulkarni filling in for Mark. A couple questions; can you talk about or disclose anything about mobile, how that's affecting your business? eBay talked about mobile as affecting their growth rates quite materially, and perhaps even by a few percentage points, and accounting for almost 10% of their revenues maybe. And, second, can you talk about the broad philosophy of management about short-term profitability versus long-term growth? Probably this is the first time in a while that you have bracketed negative pro forma operating income in your guidance. How should we view your short-term investment or the short-term profitability outlook? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First, in terms of mobile, clearly, smartphones and tablets are significant tailwinds for our business. Although we're not breaking out the numbers, it's a big tailwind on our business and it's going great, so we're seeing a very nice impact from that. And again, it's a tailwind that we expect that will continue. In terms of short-term versus long-term, we're all about trying to make sure we do the right long-term things for both customers and shareowners.</p>
          <p>But more specifically around Q3, Q3 is similar to Q2 and other previous quarters in that we're investing certainly for the long-term. Yet on the flip side, keep in mind, as you look at Q3 specifically, we're getting ready for our most seasonal quarter, and we expect, given the growth that we've had, we're seeing very strong growth, so we're investing heavily to get ready for that.</p>
          <p>In terms of capacity, for example, we've announced 18 new fulfillment centers so far this year. We've actually opened eight of those already this year out of the 18. And we're looking at potentially opening even more than that. And I'm sorry, six opened so far this year out of 18. And so those are certainly something that are impacting across so far, and you'll be seeing that heavier in Q3 as we get ready for the most seasonal quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I was hoping you could share some perspective on your URL expansion strategy. I'd like to know, get some sense for the growth you're seeing there and how material it is in your overall numbers, and should we expect to see further expansion in those sites?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's not a lot I can help you with there. We're certainly looking, as you'd expect us to do, ways to continue to grow, and certainly that would be part of our strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Tom, I was just curious, we've had a few quarters here where operating income has far surpassed the upper end of your guidance range, and we had a quarter here where OI definitely seemed to weaken as the months went by. Just wondering what you think is causing that divergence between expectations at the beginning of the quarter and how things are playing out. And then just as a quick follow-up to one of the other questions, looking at the fulfillment center network, just wondering if you are satisfied with the fee increases that were put in place in February, that that business is now matching the margin for the rest of the business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Could you elaborate on the months going by? I wasn't following your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, it was just on operating income, we've have a few quarters here where the numbers have come in far better than guidance, and we actually had a situation where Europe actually got worse as the quarter went on, so wondering what is driving that out-performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Got it. Certainly, as you look at &#x2013; I'll talk to Q2 since it's the most recent quarter, but we had a lot of strength across many different areas. One of the ones I mentioned that certainly help our operating profit as well as our gross margin was our third-party business continued to be very, very strong, and certainly that was a factor. Again, there was a number of factors. One thing, too, you do see some timing differences to some extent between Q2 and Q3 in terms of our prep for Q4. You see that not only in our operating results, but you see it in our CapEx. In the last &#x2013; 90 days ago, we said that we would spend approximately $800 million to $900 million of CapEx for Q2. We spent a little less $700 million. You see that number for Q3 being $800 million to $900 million as well. So, again, those are things that you're seeing that's just a little bit of a shift between Q2 and Q3 there.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my question. So wanted to ask you a quick question on 3P, and given it's around 40% of sales this year &#x2013; items sold, what point do you believe the customer experience on Amazon is at risk, given the rise of third-party sales? And any insight in terms of adoption on FBA by third parties would be very helpful. And then one quick follow-up just on your comments, Tom, on CapEx, I think you said came in lower in 2Q; guidance is for another $800 million to $900 million. Is that guidance sort of consistent maybe going out, going forward, or is this sort of a one-time build around technology? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in terms of the third-party units, certainly FBA is having an impact on that. That's one of the drivers, certainly, that's helping us have that percentage of total units go up. And we've looked at and been working very hard over a number of years on improving the experience for both customers and for sellers, and FBA is an example of that. And what ends up happening is FBA sellers, once they're part of the program, those units that are FBA in our fulfillment network are eligible for all of our programs, including free Super Saver Shipping, Prime. So, again, certainly, that's a great program for our customers, it's a great program for sellers, and it's a great program for investors, and so we think of it &#x2013; I don't think of it as a bad thing at all. I think of it as a good thing.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of retail units that we send directly to customers. We're offering a great experience on third-party units, which includes FBA and a number of other programs that we have. So, again, we'll continue to try to make that even better for customers and sellers over time. But it's working very well, and again, the benefit of having third parties on our platform is we get to add great new selection. We also have competing offers directly on our detail pages, so when customers come, they get to choose in terms of who they want to purchase from. So it's a competitive environment on our platform, so we think that that's great for customers and for us.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious about LivingSocial. It seemed to be a bigger loss than usual. Can you give us some color on what happened, perhaps? And secondly, can you talk about the kind of traction you're getting with LOVEFiLM, given all of the exclusive content you're getting there? Thanks.</p>

          <p>LOVEFiLM business is doing very well. It's growing nicely. As you mentioned, we continue to add content there, and we plan on adding more content there over time; very excited to have that business as part of Amazon, and the team's doing great. In terms of LivingSocial, there's not a lot I can add to it other than what we've disclosed.</p>

          <p>Thanks. This is Andy McNellis in for Ken. Somewhat related to other questions that have been asked, could you provide any update to your same-day shipping efforts and how that relates to sales tax and fulfillment center investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In terms of delivery speed to customers, we're certainly trying to get geographically &#x2013; always trying to get closer to customers. That's something that's not new; it's something we've been doing for some time. But in terms of same-day, we don't really see a way to do same-day delivery on a broad scale economically. But again, we'll continue to work on behalf of customers to try to figure out a way to serve them even better by getting product faster, but in terms of same-day, we don't see a way to do that on a broad scale economically.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we do collect in several states within the U.S. We do collect in a number of geographies that have an equivalent value-added tax. Approximately half of our business we actually collect sales tax or value-added tax. We do very good business in those geographies. Those geographies are reflected &#x2013; for the most part, if you go back over the last several years, most of them have been included. We've certainly added some new geographies or new jurisdictions that we collect during that time period, but you see that we've seen very, very strong growth, even while collecting. So we're very supportive of collecting. We think the best way to do that is through a federal solution, and we keep working with Congress and others to try to get that passed.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Kind of hitting on the sales tax issue again, Amazon's signed a lot of bilateral agreements with several states on the collection of sales tax, and I know there's a federal effort also going on. Can you talk about, if a federal sales tax is passed, how does that impact your bilateral agreements with these states? Does that supersede it, or does that kind of have to continue to go on with those particular states and build those fulfillment centers and things in those states that you've agreed to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's not a lot I can add to that. Sorry I can't be that helpful with your question. I apologize. But again, you're right. We do support federal legislation. We're working very hard at that. One thing to keep in mind, too; we price our products irrespective of what sales tax is. That's a customer obligation, and so we're pricing products very well. And so that's not something that we just started doing. That's something we've been doing for a long time. And that's why we have a good business in those geographies and jurisdictions where we do collect, and because customers are coming to us because they want to have value, which we offer, irrespective of tax. There's been a number of different third parties that have certainly reported on that. They come because they want great convenience. They want, obviously, great service. And those are the things we're focused on, and those are the things that we believe customers will still want over the long term, and that's why we focus on those areas.</p>

          <p>Yeah, hey, Tom. The international segment operating income has been under a lot of pressure. Is that primarily related to existing markets, growth in new markets? And then would that be on the merchandise margin side of the P&amp;L, or is it more of an operating cost issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind, with international, it's a mix of geographies. And certainly there's some that we're investing in. We mentioned, certainly in other calls, China's an area that is growing very fast, but we're certainly in investment mode there. In recent years, we've launched Italy and Spain. We're certainly investing in those geographies and like what we see there. Those are certainly impacting. We're also adding a lot of fulfillment capacity. And so those are things that are certainly impacting those numbers</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I have two questions, one on guidance and the other one on Prime members. Can you give us some color on guidance, what you're baking for growth in international versus domestic? And guidance implies there is some compression in margin. Is it, again, mostly the function of the sales mix, or is something else going on there? And then second, on Prime members, can you remind us the profitability of Prime member versus non-Prime member, and longer-tem, where do think the penetration of Prime members within your overall base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of revenue, we don't break out the segments in terms of the split. But if you take a look at our guidance, it's to grow between 19% and 31%. And if you look at the impact of exchange is a little over 400 basis points, and so rounded, it's just under 36% on the high end and 23% on the low end. And so that's the range of guidance. And so we're certainly pleased with what we saw in Q2, and we're certainly giving, as we have in past quarters, a wide range &#x2013; appropriate wide range for Q3.</p>
          <p>In terms of the bottom line in terms of operating income and CSOI guidance that we've given, as I mentioned earlier, certainly a number of different factors; like the last several quarters, as we've been talking about, we're certainly investing a lot in the business. But one thing to keep in mind is, for the guidance in the upcoming quarter, it's Q3, and we are certainly get ready, given the growth rates we've had, for our most seasonal quarter. That's certainly impacting the bottom line in terms of our guidance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're opening a lot of fulfillment centers, we're adding a lot of capacity for both our Web service business as well as infrastructure support our retail business. So, again, we're investing across the business, which is like other periods, but again, we're getting ready for Q4.</p>
