          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or re-broadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Bob Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as several members of our Executive Management team.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on page 10 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, BNYMellon.com.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, July 20, 2010, and we will not update forward-looking statements. This morning's press release provides the highlights of our results. We also have the quarterly earnings release document available on our website, which provides a quarterly review of the total company and business segments. We will be using the quarterly earnings review to discuss our results.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. EPS in Q2 was $0.55 or $668 million. We booked good growth in securities servicing fees and in Asset Management and Wealth Management and posted our third consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset flows. That's equivalent to $12 billion for the quarter and $42 billion over the last 9 months.</p>
          <p>Continuing on the new business front, we had new asset servicing wins of $419 billion in assets under custody. In broker-dealer services, we had really nice success in winning new collateral management business, particularly in Europe.</p>
          <p>Pershing had some big wins that we will be converting in the third and fourth quarters, but with a lot of expenses in Q2 in advance of that. Depositary Receipts are continuing to win new business and overall we're maintaining or growing our market shares.</p>
          <p>Net interest income was up slightly compared to last year and down about 6% sequentially. Now, this decline was primarily due to our risk management strategy in both loan and bank placement portfolios and we're going to be looking closely at strategies to replace this revenue in the third and forth quarters.</p>
          <p>Credit improvement continues. It reflects what is clearly now a very clean balance sheet. Sequentially, our provision was actually down 43% and non-performing assets were down 12%.</p>
          <p>We also went from having an unrealized pre-tax loss on the investment portfolio in Q1 to a gain of 292 million at June 30. We continue to generate capital: TCE, Tier-1, and Tier-1 common all strengthened.</p>
          <p>Service levels remain excellent. In the latest Global Investor survey of Global Custody clients, we were ranked #1 of our major peers in 16 categories. Global Custodian magazine released its securities lending survey in May. We were ranked #1 overall in two categories which is particularly pleasing to see since the last couple of years have been a pretty tough time for both the holders and the lenders of assets.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to invest in the future growth of our businesses. On July 1, we successfully closed the GIS acquisition, and just a quick update on that. We're really pleased with how everything is going so far, which is a reflection of the terrific work being done by the integration teams across the company. As you may recall, our deal model relied very little on revenue synergies in the early years. Having said that, the first couple of weeks post-closing have been pretty encouraging. We're starting to see very nice revenue synergies and we're looking forward to seeing more of that to come.</p>
          <p>Cultures are mixing well. People are working very well together as one company already and it's also a nice expansion into Europe, particularly related to hedge fund administration. So bottom line is we're pretty optimistic about our ability to achieve the expense and revenue synergies that made this deal so attractive in the first place.</p>
          <p>On other fronts, we expect to close the BHF Asset Servicing deal in Germany next month. We recently received final regulatory approval to open our Asset Management joint venture based in Shanghai. This will enable us to start offering new products in China as well as to our international clients and we expect to be able to do that later this year.</p>
          <p>We've received approval to provide more asset management capabilities in Korea. We also announced the acquisition of a wealth management firm in Toronto, our first wealth management acquisition outside the United States. So there's a lot of activity underway to build the future revenue pipeline as well as our global footprint. I would say the key takeaways before we hand it over to Todd would be solid earnings, a very strong balance sheet, we're generating capital and we're investing for the future.</p>
          <p>So, let's hand it over to Todd to go through the numbers in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning. As I get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review beginning on page 3. Let me isolate a few points, key data points on a sequential basis. First of all, we earned $0.55 for the quarter on both a reported and operating basis. Fee revenue benefited from a 6% increase in securities servicing fees and a 39% increase in foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Net interest revenue was down 6%, which was slightly more than expected due to the defensive investment strategy that Bob just mentioned. Non-interest expenses were up 3%. We'll get into the detail on that in a minute. Credit quality trends continue to improve. Provision for credit losses was $20 million, down from 35 million in Q1 and reserve levels actually increased.</p>
          <p>Our businesses continued to generate excess capital during the second quarter. We actually increased Tier 1 capital by over $430 million and tangible capital by almost 800 million.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 5 of the Review, assets under management and assets under custody were both up year-over-year, but down sequentially due to the strong dollar and the decline in the value of equity markets globally.</p>
          <p>In assets under management, we had our third consecutive quarter of strong long-term asset flows. Over the last 3 quarters, we've had a total of $42 billion in long-term flows, including 12 billion this quarter, and these are principally fixed income and global equity strategies.</p>
          <p>Money market flows remained negative and that's consistent with industry trends. The good news here is that we're beginning to see an increase in money market yields, reflecting a steeper yield curve at the short end.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 6 of the Earnings Review that shows our fee growth. Securities servicing fees were up 6% quarter-over-quarter and down 2% year-over-year, and asset servicing fees were up 2% sequentially, due primarily to new business and higher transaction volumes; and up 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business, and higher transaction volumes.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we won an incremental 419 billion in new business in asset servicing. Securities lending fees were up 17 million sequentially and down 51 million compared with the second quarter of 2009. The sequential increase reflects seasonality, while the year-over-year decline reflects narrower spreads and slightly lower loan balances.</p>
          <p>Issuer service fees were up 6% sequentially, primarily reflecting seasonality in depositary receipts and shareowner services, which is partially offset by lower corporate trust fees, which is impacted by the continued very low debt issuance globally. Clearing fees were up 7% due to higher trading volumes as well as stronger money market related fees, and they were down 2% over the prior year primarily reflecting the lower money market related distribution fees from that period.</p>
          <p>Asset and wealth management fees, adjusting for performance fees and income from consolidated asset management funds, were down 1% sequentially, not too bad given that the S&amp;P was down 12% and the MSCI was down 15%. Fees were up 12% year-over-year, reflecting improved market values, the Insight acquisition and the impact of new business, which was partially offset by higher fee waivers and a reduction in fees due to money market outflows.</p>
          <p>FX revenue of $244 million was up 39% sequentially on higher volatility. The FX and other trading line was down 16%, however, due to negative other trading revenue of 24 million, which is largely a result of the credit value adjustment driven by widening spreads in the quarter as well as a lower level of fixed income trading.</p>
          <p>The decline in FX and other trading is somewhat offset by translation of leasing residual gains and investment and other income, which is up $92 million on a year-over-year basis. The translation gain largely resulted from the decline in the euro over the period.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 7 of the Earnings Review, NIR and the related margin reflect the impact of persistently low short-term interest rates globally. As you may recall, we indicated in Q1 that net interest revenue would decline by about 30 million versus Q1 in the second quarter, and that was due to hedging gains that we enjoyed in the first quarter as well as some other items.</p>
          <p>As it turned out, NIR was actually down 43 million sequentially. The larger decline was primarily driven by the defensive stance we took in short-term investments in light of the situation in Europe, and the continued reduction in our targeted loan portfolio, which is actually moving a little faster than expected. Versus the year-ago quarter, net interest revenue was actually up 3%. The net interest margin was 1.74%, compared with 1.89% in the prior quarter. It's pretty much in line with previous guidance, and the decrease primarily reflects the factors that I just discussed.</p>
          <p>Turning to non-interest expense on page 8, you can see that the sequential increase of 3% primarily reflects four items. First of all, we had the impact of our annual merit increase, which is 2% effective April 1. We also expensed the U.K. business tax in the quarter, excuse me, the U.K. bonus tax. We also had seasonally high business development expenses. This was partially due to client conferences we held in the second quarter that had been cancelled last year and there were also costs related to business we expect to convert in the second half. And finally, about half of the increase was related to the quarterly change in the market value of Lehman securities that we've supported.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we continued to generate significant capital, $430 million in Tier-1 and nearly 800 in tangible. As a result, our key regulatory ratios have all increased by 20 basis points, Tier-1 to 13.50, Tier-1 common to 11.80, and TCE to 6.30.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet was a bit high at quarter end, largely reflecting a spike in a number of large client deposits and concurrent with the GIS and BHF acquisitions. What we had projected in the deal model was that after closing, our TCE would be around 4.9% and Tier-1 common would be at 10%. We also successfully, as we indicated we would do, we successfully raised $700 million of common equity via forward sale agreement. That will settle in the third quarter. And based on the current levels of our capital ratios we're confident that the ratios will actually come in higher than we've indicated when we announced the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Moving to our loan portfolio on page 11, while our risk reduction efforts are having a modestly negative impact on NII as I discussed earlier, they are actually benefiting our credit costs. The provision for credit losses declined from 35 million to 20 million in the second quarter, and that reflects the decrease in higher risk-rated loans as well as non-performing loans. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit losses actually increased $7 million as net charge-offs totaled 20 versus &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; totaled 13 versus a provision of 20.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate in the second quarter was approximately 30.2%. During the third quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate to come in around the 30 to 31% range as well. So, looking ahead, our third quarter results will begin to reflect the full quarter impact of GIS and the two-month impact of the BHF acquisition, and we expect these to be neutral to slightly accretive. Bear in mind that third quarter earnings have traditionally been impacted by seasonality associated with lower levels of capital markets-related revenues, particularly securities lending and foreign exchange. We expect the net interest margin to continue to be in the range of 170 to 180. Our lower credit provision should be sustainable, and we will continue to manage expense growth.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to focus on the drivers of revenue growth, which include winning new business, converting it as quickly as possible and delivering exceptional client service. These are the keys to success and they are things we've proven we can do well.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is from Ken Usdin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of just questions here. Can you just detail for us in some of the fee items, how much of an issue was the market; and as far as in the FX line, what caused the big delta in the fixed income trading; and then in the other other fee income line, how much was the benefit from FX translation gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, why don't we start with the trading revenue? There are really three drivers of what &#x2013; I mean let's start with FX. FX was strong, volumes were pretty good, obviously, volatility was up and we saw the 39% increase. The decline in other trading revenue was a reflection of three things. First of all, it's just lower fixed income trading across the board. Secondly, the credit valuation adjustment in our derivatives portfolio was a negative for the quarter. We saw spreads widen. Had less of an impact where we had a payable because our spreads didn't widen that much but where we had a receivable, it had a meaningful impact, and finally, we did incur some modest trading losses due to some volatility on the client positions, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say probably, Todd, the biggest impact was the mark-to-market on the positions and because we have the strongest rating of the banks in the United States and our counterparts tend to have lower ratings, their spreads blew out wider than our own so we would have an unusual change this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, we do disclose those numbers on page 11 of the Earnings Review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I was just really looking for the color on why the movements, right, I saw that. And then could you also walk through the FX translation gains and any other offsets throughout the income statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think they kind of neutralize each other. We had a win on a payable that we had booked in dollars, which ultimately we had elected to book in dollars and was paid in euro, so the quarter saw a fairly significant move on that and it turned out to be a positive. It's obviously going to be a one time event. Otherwise, we've hedged the balance sheet pretty carefully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And last quick one. Can you talk about how much of fee waiver recapture you might have gotten from the LIBOR widening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There is a modest improvement there, Ken. I'd say it's probably less than a fifth of what we are waiving but we did see a little bit of improvement in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you guys talk a little bit about the pipeline for new business, specifically within asset management and then also on the asset servicing side as you look at kind of the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, actually why don't we start with asset servicing and then we'll go to asset management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Dan. Tim Keaney here. We have a pretty solid pipeline, about 2.4 trillion. It's pretty flat quarter on quarter, similar number of deals. I think one thing of note is we tend to see a little bit of smaller and mid-sized deals which are actually a good news story because those deals convert into the revenue line pretty easily and you would continue to see an emphasis in terms of size and scale to be geared towards global FIs and a larger number of names from outside the U.S., so generally a solid pipeline is the answer. Mitchell, what would you say from an asset management point of view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say similarly, a couple of things. The U.S. and non-U.S. are both building at about a 50% rate that in the first half of the year, we have seen a slow but increasing pipeline of long-term flows coming in. The mix of business has been very beneficial to us. A lot of fixed income and alternatives, especially given the equity markets, but we're seeing equity as well and it's being supported by pretty good performance across the board, especially on our 3-year numbers. So overall, I'm pretty optimistic about the pipeline. Funding has also been accelerating for us as well, from new wins, so that's been encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rachel. Why don't we try Rich Brueckner on Pershing, because that's one of the interesting stories that have been developing over the last three to 6 months here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Bob. It's Rich Brueckner. I would say that we had significant wins. Bob mentioned this earlier in his remarks. Significant wins throughout the first half of 2010, and part of that is in the pipeline that we think of as business that's not yet to be signed, which is stronger than it was last year by a pretty significant amount of about 150 or 160% from last year. But in addition to that we have a conversion pipeline where we've already signed business and that's due to be converted in over the next six to 9 months and that I would say is as strong as I've ever seen it in our business. Order of magnitude 80 to $100 million in new revenue, $100 billion in new assets scheduled to come on over the next six to 9 months. So we feel very good about that and that's what we're investing in, which is why the numbers are the way they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that's what I said earlier on, Dan that we had some costs going through Rich's P&amp;L in the short-term but the revenue shows up later this year and early next year. Karen, is there anything you'd add from your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add the DR pipeline is quite strong. We've had a lot of new business wins: We're up about 25 new programs year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So quite good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And hedge fund administration, our AIF business is doing very well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, this is Art here. We're up significantly from the core growth before the merger with GIS and putting GIS on top of it has just accelerated it again. So we're very encouraged and not only is the pipeline growing, but the rate of implementation is accelerating, so it's moving into the revenue stream quicker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Larry, is there anything you'd add from a Wealth perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We had the best new business quarter in the second quarter that we've had in the last year and the pipeline is the same so it's the best pipeline we've had over the course of the last year, up about 7% from Q1, so good strong results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the message here is it's a tough environment to grow revenue and we're working really hard to outperform on it and this is going to be our key focus going forward now that our balance sheet is so strong.</p>

          <p>Hey, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A follow-up to the last question, can you just talk a little bit about how you're winning this business in terms of your positioning relative to competitors? Is it a function of just more investment spend on your part? More feet on the street? Or is there also weakening competitors that are adding to this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, it's Jim Palermo. How are you doing? Actually, it's similar to the -the pipeline is strong. We really haven't added a lot of new sales staff. We think we've got excellent global coverage at this point in time, but what we are seeing is a pretty competitive landscape. We've seen a few deals that we actually saw some unusual pricing from some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>I would say that as we've alluded in the past, we continue to have I'd say very strong pricing discipline for all of our client activity and we're actually seeing a high percentage of our overall revenue streams associated with high-dollar fees versus the capital markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was intrigued in the quarter because while volumes might have been come in a little bit lighter than expected at least versus our expectations probably due to the market activity, market valuations, the revenue line hit our number. I mean, it looks to me like your gross margins went up both in asset management and asset servicing. Is that accurate? And if so, can you talk about why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the asset servicing side we did, in fact, go up on a linked basis, our margins from 28 to 30% and that's principally due to the seasonality though, Betsy, when you have the big lift in securities lending as well as the foreign exchange that Todd was talking about earlier. You know that as you look out into particularly in the third quarter, those have a tendency to soften. What we have seen though, which is encouraging on both fronts is because of the new business activity that we've converted over the last year, specifically, we've converted about 1.3 trillion over the last 4 quarters, that results in more global and cross border activity, so that accounts for some of the foreign exchange growth. And then, also encouraging on the securities lending side, we continue to see more clients either returning to the program or new clients being added to the program and spreads are slightly wider with the spread differential between LIBOR and Fed Funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you doing something different to get the clients back in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you doing anything different to get the clients back in, or is it just, more lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing specific. But what we have done is I think we've introduced a lot of clarity around the reinvestment portfolios. There's a lot more transparency that goes on in the business today than I think you saw a few years ago and then clients are feeling a little bit more comfortable with the stability that exists in the securities lending environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I'd add, Betsy, to this is we don't talk about this very often but we have a lot more business lines than most of our typically quoted competitors. As a result, at the top of the house, we have a group called global client management, which is about 300 people around the world that are really focused on managing our biggest client relationships globally, and the object of the game for them is not just to ensure that we really meet the needs of our clients and deliver great client service, but also to ensure that we deliver the entire firm to our clients, which is a message we're receiving over and over and over again from our major clients, and that is just don't show up with one product. Show up with the whole firm. That's run by Tim Keaney amongst a few other things, but Tim what would you add on what we're doing kind of differently over the last year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's a good point, Bob. Betsy, one of the things we've recognized, in particular around financial institutions, when you look at the range of products across all of our business lines from Pershing to our broker-dealer services area, asset servicing and asset management, we're finding we have more opportunities to partner with &#x2013; whether it's a fund manager, a bank, an insurance company or a broker, and they're under pressure because they want to do more business with fewer players and there's very few people that can stack up as a partner and one of the things we've recognized is a number of those client segments are changing their business models because of what's happened in the outside world over the last 18 to 24 months. And so, we're really talking about all of the things we do for these market segments and that's what we do in client management and that complements very nicely the product line sales approach that we have. As a result of that we're seeing a larger number of big play, high-revenue opportunities particularly amongst financial institutions and I think you'll see that continue to show up in our sales pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the clients are interested in doing that you think from a cost perspective, consolidating their business activity or is there something more there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what they're trying to do is simplify their own operations and they are also looking at outsourcing. That's an area we've seen a big pick-up in overall activity, particularly in the fund management space and in insurance companies. They're narrowing the number of partners. They want a better deal and because we have a wider range of products and services, including some of the new ones that we've just launched around Derivatives360 and our futures clearing opportunities, they are very happy to talk to us about moving more business to us. It ends up being cost neutral to them but a big positive for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your commentary, you alluded to strategies to replace net interest income. I was curious if you could just elaborate on what you're thinking there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Howard, it's Todd. We have traditionally kept our liquid deposit base, a significant amount of it in relatively short-term placements. There's some alternative strategies, even very low-risk strategies if we move over to securities. So we are evaluating &#x2013; a number of them are repo types of transactions as well. So we would expect to start implementing some of these in the third quarter. You won't see much of a change. You'll probably just see a little bit of a growth in our securities portfolio relative to our placement portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thanks, okay. And then just to follow up on that, on the quarter, could you just provide some details on the impact of the discount accretion on the spread revenues and the NIM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. As we had indicated, I guess it was one or two quarters ago, the restructuring really hasn't changed the impact to our NIR at this point or to our NIM from where we had previously indicated, and our best guess is for the year, that should be in the vicinity of about $320 million to the positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and then switching gears, I guess within the industry, we started to see more of the securities lending gates coming down. I know you don't necessarily go head-to-head with some of those folks that are taking down sec lending gates but just curious if you have any thoughts as to how this changes the competitive landscape, if at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take that one and maybe my colleagues from asset servicing can jump in here, but as I understand it, the issues that have come to light here are related to issues around affiliated funds and we just don't have that issue. So, I don't see that as having a specific impact to us, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, and then finally I don't know if Bob is still on but I'm curious bigger picture, curious if you could comment on your appetite and ability to take on another deal here and how you prioritize that versus other uses of capital deployment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question, Howard. At this point, of course, we are generating still excess capital, but we're very mindful of what's happening with Basel III and what's eventually going to happen there so we're being cautious. We &#x2013; the last two or three things you saw were just frankly really attractive and they really built out our franchise and products in geographies we didn't have before. We're still interested in doing other things, particularly in Asia Pacific, but I wouldn't say it's anything of size on the horizon. It would be smaller fill-ins and particularly in specific geographies.</p>

          <p>We're hearing everybody is winning new business, so your securities servicing revenues were up 6% linked and that's good and you're saying you're winning new business, and State Street's saying they're winning new business, and J.P. Morgan says they win new business. I'm sure Northern Trust tomorrow will say they're winning new business. So how can you all be winning new business at the same time or what percent of the new business is coming from the other top 5 players and how much is coming from the rest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Hey, Mike. It's Tim Keaney. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just some general comments first. Bob mentioned the 419 billion, we have won 1.2 trillion in the last four quarters. As I look at it, we're still winning over 60% of the deals we're picking up. I think you're seeing the asset pools are growing so you're seeing asset managers now attracting new assets. Banks and insurance companies the same, which is why we continue to emphasize and put an emphasis on financial institutions. I will say over the last four quarters we've been a net new business winner versus every single one of our competitors and aside from the odd question mark around pricing, I think winning the quality game is making a difference here and quality has become a key differentiator, much less so on price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, the thing to remember too, Mike, is savings globally are increasing and that is a big change from 3 years ago. With savings increasing that implies that the banks are going to be longer deposits but more importantly, asset managers are going to be really bringing in a lot of money as well, which would be very beneficial to asset servicing, to asset management, to Pershing, to a lot of our businesses which is all about growing the pools of cash as people &#x2013; as the population ages and gets closer to retirement, and we play to that long term trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a short follow-up to that, Bob. By geography could you be more specific as far as the money flows for the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a good question. The biggest change I think globally is the United States. Just from the standpoint that we were over-levered. The consumer was over-levered in the United States from both a &#x2013; a debt standpoint and as you know, the savings rate in the '50s to the '80s was 8 or 9% per annum and basically into '02-'03 it basically went to zero or negative and it feels like the savings is more like 5 or 6% today and you're seeing that people are putting money in longer term instruments, longer duration instruments versus short-term instruments and so I think the U.S. is probably the biggest. Also, Asia-Pacific will continue to be saving, I just saw that Australia put up their superannuation to 12% and even though you're going to have lower GDP growth or low GDP growth in Europe, the fact of the matter is you're going to still have very strong savings rates in Europe and increasingly, individuals are going to have to focus on savings versus allowing their governments to look after their retirement needs. Mitchell, is there anything you'd add to that, just as a general theme?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a couple things. You also see a shift of asset classes, so you're seeing movements from cash and equity into fixed income and alternatives at this point. Your savings rates in Italy and Japan have been significant. We're certainly seeing flows from there, as Bob said, Australia, Korea, so you have significant savings still coming from outside the United States that I think we're all benefiting from. So asset shifts and non-U.S., I think are where you're seeing a lot of wins for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you think about your 12 billion geographically where was it over the last quarter, Mitchell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>50% of it was outside the United States. 50% was in the U.S., but the U.S. I would call more of a shift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We benefit because we have such a broad product diversification and we have such a deep &#x2013; particularly on the fixed income side, range of product that we benefited significantly from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things we noticed, Mike, during the toughest part of the European issues in the last quarter was a lot of people were shifting to emerging markets in both debt and equity as a diversification play, and hopefully an uncorrelated diversification play which was something new that we had seen and we also had seen some Europeans liquidating American investments in order to get cash back into Europe. Jim or Tim, is there anything you'd add on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob. I think, Mike, the knock-on impact from what Mitchell was describing is more financial institution activity. There's more fund activity, and it shows up in our results as well, where more than 50% of our revenues came from outside the U.S., two-thirds of it came from our existing client base, and more than three-quarters of it came from financial institutions, so all of those factors that we're describing here are all coming into play quite nicely. So now, our overall revenue stream on the asset servicing side is over 40% outside the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that, I think what that does is it highlights why we're investing in GIS and BHF. That's more about financial institutions and asset managers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So promise, last follow-up. So what percent of the asset servicing business is being gained from the other big players, State Street, Northern, J.P. Morgan and Citi, and what percent would be gained simply from more activity or the lower-scale players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess we don't know the answer to that, Mike, because we don't have that data really accurately. But I would say is that's the main reason why we're so focused on having the number one client service in the world, that is, it reduces the odds of losing the client and it increases the odds of our existing clients referring new business to us from another client, and so we'll see. I think the pools are getting bigger and when you can best service at the margin over time, it should allow us to grow market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess the two-thirds of our business comes from existing clients, then it's certainly less than one-third coming from the other big players.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just in regard to the pipeline again, any change in that because of the market volatility? Are clients pulling back at all? It sounds like they are not. Could they actually accelerate their activity to lower costs, et cetera? And what impact is regulatory issues? How is that affecting their willingness to outsource back office versus previously doing that internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff, it's Tim Keaney here. There are a couple of market segments that continue to be under profit pressures. I would &#x2013; and this is general commentary. I would say, fund managers and insurance companies in particular. We continue to see a shift in outsourcing and this has been a steady point now, where somewhere around 20% of our pipeline is around outsourcing. What's changed is clients are willing to talk about the bundle now and they are not just outsourcing middle office, they are looking at the bundle for the reasons I talked about earlier, where they're trying to simplify their operating model and do more business with a fewer number of strategic providers, and so I would say that's at least a six quarter trend and it plays to a real strength of the organization because we have a breadth of products that most of our competitors don't have for those market segments and we're one of the leaders in the outsourcing space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up on the money market is that you mentioned about 20%. I assume that in future quarters that will be greater in terms of reduced fee waivers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Jeff, it's Todd. I'll take that one. That's not necessarily the case. The real mover in fee waivers will be to see a rise in overall interest rates. The good news is as we see some level of yield curve change here. There's actually a little more yield in money market funds and therefore a little more fees for us. Until we see the Fed actually do something here, I'd be surprised to see a big increase there, a big relief on the fee waivers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple, few quick questions. First of all, on the discount accretion, I think you, did you, did I hear you say correctly 320 million is your expectation for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The restructuring that we did in the third quarter or last year, we initially estimated obviously it would be less than that. As we saw some improvement in the underlying performance, we bumped it up to now we expect the positive impact to be about 320 million and I should say, Brian, we're actually seeing pretty good performance in the underlying, we're pretty pleased with how it's working and how it's going, so it's possible we could tweak that up, but right now, that's our best estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then were you about 75 for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total impact, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>75, great, okay. And just on asset management, if you could just talk a little bit about the institutional equity side of asset management in terms of pricing. I thought a lot of the pricing was done at quarter end rather than let's say average month end or average daily and a little bit, I would have thought that there would be a little bit more impact to the weak equity markets in June, so maybe if you could just talk to that and whether you think there will be more pressure on equity-based asset management fees in the third quarter if markets sort of stay where they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mitchell Harris, Brian. A couple of comments. First off, it is based on the month end value, and it has been down about 12-13%, depending what market you're referring to, but what I would say is a couple of things. Performance, irrespective of the markets, has actually been pretty good. Our international equity products, our small and mid-cap value products have all seen strong flows in. We have not seen pricing pressure in the equities. Clearly, that's not where the majority of that growth is coming from, but I guess the mix of products and the performance has helped us quite well. Large-cap has suffered the most quite frankly but we're still seeing flows into the others, as I've said. And again, just moving off equities, we've benefited because of our broad fixed income capabilities, in particular, and alternatives and foreign currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And on the performance fees, do you expect &#x2013; the 19 million, is that coming mostly from the good international performance that you mentioned or is it coming more from the alternatives side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's coming from the international.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then on the money market fee waivers, this is 20%, you mentioned, is that across the franchise, so including the Pershing distribution channel, or are you talking about just the asset management business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is, Brian. It's the pre-tax income impact across the entire company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So if we have a situation where the LIBOR let's say settles back down if that ever happens and if the Fed Funds effective rate stays well under 25 basis points, do you think you might come back to the fee waiver levels that you were at or should we expect this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can see it back up a little bit but not that much. Part of the reason is because just there's lower money market funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just a lower base on what you're waiving.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's going to move too far away from this, Brian, maybe $5 one way or the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, on the fixed income trading side, can you quantify the losses that you had in the fixed income, not the CVA, but the actual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the total losses, which we disclosed on page 11, was 24 million in the other trading. And if you look historically, we probably make in other trading, obviously that can be a pretty volatile revenue line for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We probably make in the 25 to $75 million range, so we posted a negative 24; that was very unusual for us. I would expect that we would, in a very soft environment we're seeing today, we'd expect to be to the middle to the lower end of that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the 25 to 75 range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And I'm sorry, just the CVA versus the actual fixed income trading <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the 24, the CVA accounted for a significant component of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Quick question on Wealth Management. There was some commentary you were saying the best new business quarter in Wealth Management that you'd seen all year or in a year and I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that in client segments and geography and whether as a result of the kind of wacky markets we've had, the investment into Wealth Management, those plans have changed or stayed the same or gotten better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Nancy, it's Larry Hughes. In fact we've seen strength across our entire business, so the family office business and the core U.S. markets business have both been strong for us, so results are good and the same statement is true for both the pipeline is the best that we've seen in a year. It's up sequentially from the first quarter, about 7% overall.</p>
          <p>The opportunity for us to expand is clearly there. There are additional markets we would like to serve. We announced during the course of the quarter an acquisition of a firm called i3 Advisors in Canada. We expect that that will be an opportunity for us to expand into some additional international markets, so we see strength and opportunity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Florida market has been one of the brightest spots for us during the course of 2009 and 2010, so the Florida market is a strong and growing market. We have 7 offices in the state of Florida and seeing strength across the state.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your investment plans for that business are basically the same over the last year, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've expanded our sales force for Wealth Management; we're up about 6%. We expect to be up about 15% in terms of the sales force during the course of 2010, so we expect to continue to invest both for organic growth and for potential acquisitions as they arise opportunistically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Nancy, what I'd add to that is we've been under-invested in sales capabilities in Wealth Management and we don't want to reduce that investment level and there's still geographies in the United States that we're interested in and we'll continue to focus on. And, we got to be opportunistic on that as things occur.</p>
          <p>One thing that's a little new here is we're so strong outside of the U.S. in terms of our other business lines that Larry is increasingly thinking about what are the opportunities on the back of that to be able to grow share globally and offer these sort of products and services on a more integrated basis with our other business lines, and frankly, I'm encouraging him to continue to think that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And a quick question for Todd. On the NIM, are we basically at sort of a stable rate in NIM right now given the kind of interest rate environment we're in? Have all of the declines in rates sort of factored in and it's at this level until rates start to rise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, I would say so. There's a possibility depending on what happens with the yield curve for there to be some slight contraction from here and based on what our asset mix is going to be, but it feels to me and then we have looked at this pretty hard that we should be able to keep it around the 170 on the low end of the range to 180.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing I should add to that. If the balance sheet grows a lot, it's hard for us to keep it there so there will be positive net interest revenues, so if we see a significant amount of new deposits, which we did see a fair amount of that in the second quarter, and that would put a little pressure on the NIM as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Bob, in the past, you've talked about the business from overseas of the non-U.S. business and a couple of the highlights in the sectors of the company, you mentioned, for example, asset management, now 49% is non-U.S. With what's going on in Europe, does that alter your view of how much business you're going to generate from non-U.S. sources and could you remind us what the optimal number is for the consolidated Bank of New York?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know the optimal number, but I suspect that, I don't suspect it, I know that we're in an increasingly globalized economy and that's not going away. It's going to be more and more and more global and more integrated, which will imply that over time, more and more of our business is going to be outside of the U.S. So one of the themes you heard here this morning is that at the margin, we are becoming more international by business. We are particularly focused on Asia Pacific. No acquisition opportunities there, but on the other hand, great organic growth opportunities. We're continuing to invest executives and strategy time there. Maybe there will be some JV opportunities in Asia Pacific where we can partner with important players there to help them be more successful over time and to provide our global infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Europe is &#x2013; I suspect, is going to be an opportunity going forward as well, both organically and maybe even through smaller acquisitions in our core businesses. I keep thinking about a very simplistic reality that over the last 10 or 20 years, in the United States, just about everyone got out of the custody business because if you were sub-scale in terms of the size of your book of business and in recognition what clients we're expecting in terms of investment in new software and capabilities. Eventually, that's going to happen in Europe as well and no one can predict timing on that. But the hardcore reality is there's a lot of sub-scale players in Europe still and we'll see if that creates opportunities for us in years to come.</p>
          <p>And the other advantage we have that's fairly material is that on average, our asset management products are very well priced and their performance is excellent compared to many of our global competitors outside of the U.S. So I think the inevitable outcome is that even in an environment where you have more uncertainty about the global savings rates are going to continue to be extraordinarily strong and cross-border capabilities will be undoubtedly of huge importance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you then still pursue if assuming the Basel capital requirements force many of the European banks to raise capital and they choose to do it by selling some of their assets like their custody business, in view of what's going on in Europe that would not deter you guys from looking at those types of businesses in an acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it would have to be really financially attractive, as usual which are pretty tough hurdles for us. And then the question would be, which is really important is could you actually grow the business because you never want to buy something that, even though it's financially attractive on day 1, that is low growth. So if we could bring our global capabilities to something, would it make sense over time? And I guess the easy answer to that is I just don't know the answer to that yet. But that's something that you'd obviously have to think about.</p>
          <p>I do worry, frankly, about higher regulatory costs in Europe, bank taxes, we saw the U.K. do this and recently there's talk of France and Germany doing it, perhaps Belgium. We're not hearing it from Ireland. But if national entities want to really increase taxes that makes the economics much more difficult and less attractive to us and I guess we could talk separately about any bank tax in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of capital, you guys have a very strong Tier-1 common ratio. Do you have any sense from talking to the U.S. regulators where they're going to come out on what's an appropriate level for companies like yours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Gerard, we don't. It is one of the, I guess, closely guarded realities of people working very, very hard towards, which I'm still continuing to hear and continue to read there's going to be some kind of global accord on capital and liquidity by November for the Korean G20 announcement, so I think most governments want to get this over with and show that progress has been made.</p>
          <p>I think it's a given that minimal, that the minimum capital ratios are going to rise. The quality of capital has to go up. Liquidity has to go up. That's an easy bet and then the question would be for the median player will their capital have to increase as well? My guess is probably true.</p>
          <p>It's not clear to me though that for the top quartile players, whether or not they will have to add to capital because one of the realities that I've learned over the past six months in speaking with our colleagues around the world is you do have to remember that in the U.S. here, we've been pretty aggressive at writing down assets and raising capital, much more so than in other countries around the world, so we have to think globally here. There are going to be other nations where they just are not going to be able to reach our level of capital for a long time.</p>
          <p>So I would think American banks have an advantage over many of our global peers and I think we're going to have a long implementation period as a result as well because certain of these economies are going to be very low growth and it will be hard to grow capital rapidly, so it's going to be very interesting to see where we end up and I'm somewhat optimistic, but of course, this is the next very, very, very important step as we get into the next phase of regulatory reform, which is these global accords.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and then just finally for Todd, two quick questions. What were the after-tax numbers for the U.K. bonus tax that you had to pay and also for the money market waivers that you gave up in this quarter, the after-tax number for both of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had indicated that the U.K. bonus tax would cost us, we'd indicated in the Q that it cost us about 15 million. It came in a little more than half of that on a pre-tax basis, so if you assign a 30% tax rate to it, you can figure that out. And the fee waivers are hitting us in the vicinity of 65 to $70 million a quarter pre-tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Gerard, just to maybe to hit the point more bluntly on global issues and taxes, what I thought about, when I think about the discussion going on in Washington now about the possibility of having a bank tax next coming to the U.S., I know the number we've all seen is about $90 billion over 10 years. So that's $9 billion per annum, you know, BK, Bank of New York Mellon is the eighth largest bank in the United States, so that 9 billion per annum would be the equivalent of the annual profit of two BNY Mellons per annum, and that's probably equivalent, if you want to offset it, that would be a loss of 100,000 jobs in the industry over a 10 year period and I just can't see how that's very good for the country.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I'd add to that, Tom, is we actually added to the reserve for the quarter, so even though we only provided 20, we only charged off 13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. I guess my last question is just on the pricing side. Is there any changes being made in the pricing side of the model, particularly in asset servicing to make the model even more or less sensitive to market valuations going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom, it's Jim. As I said before, we're seeing beginnings of that transition moving to more explicit or high-dollar fees as a percentage of total revenues.</p>
          <p>The reality is that's going to take a period of time because you need to work through your lengthy contracts that you have with clients. So we've taken a methodical approach and as new client contracts come due or new opportunities present themselves we find a high percentage of our high-dollar fees going into the overall equation.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our final question today is from John Stilmar with SunTrust. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen, for squeezing me in. My first question just has to do &#x2013; Bob, as you talked about the M&amp;A environment it seems like you've laid out the capital, competency, price and geographic uncertainty have all sort of lead to a diminished outlook for potential targets. Can you sort of prioritize as you look out there and you look at platforms, which one of those four is probably the predominant or dominant part of &#x2013; that shapes your view of potential acquisitions and pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I, you think about the longer-term trends, John, you just have to think about Asia Pacific. There's really three economies on the planet now. There's Asia Pacific plus Latin America, then there's North America, and then there's Europe, and they're growing at very different rates. So I was in Brazil last month. Brazil added 1.7 million jobs in the last 12 months. GDP growth is about 6% per annum.</p>
          <p>That &#x2013; Brazil is a country that's on a roll. They have 200 million people, huge natural resources, we're investing aggressively in Brazil. We're going to continue to invest in Asia Pacific. You think about a developed economy like Australia. They haven't had a recession in 20 years because they are enjoying the halo effect of good fundamental management of their economy plus everything that's going on north of them in China and India and Korea and other places, so that's going to be our primary focus. That is the smallest percentage of our company today and we really want that to grow. But that is the one area that really stands out as being a longer-term priority for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, in those markets, would you characterize &#x2013; would there be potential opportunities as you look out via acquisition or organic, is it a competency issue? Is it capital? Is it &#x2013; what are kind of the primary criteria as you move forward in this market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will be mostly organic, and we may have a few strategic relationships with a few major clients in the region that may accelerate that growth beyond normal organic rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just as one final question, as we revert back to the servicing segment, it seems like to me that the servicing revenues have grown at a faster pace than servicing assets now for three quarters, and as we look out, my assumption is that that is reflective of the trends that we saw with expanding services that aren't necessarily tied to asset values.</p>
          <p>How should we think about that trend over the coming quarters on sort of an intermediate-term basis by virtue of the fact that &#x2013; should we expect that trend to continue and if you could give me a sense for how much of servicing fees in the current quarter or in the past couple quarters have not been tied to assets, but more tied towards the functionality or a service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Boy, that's a big question, John. There are a lot of issues there, but if you look in securities servicing fees, we're really looking at a number of businesses, including our issuer services business, our clearing business, as well as our asset servicing business and there's a fair amount of volatility as you know in our issuer services, specifically around depositary receipts, so ultimately, it is a reflection of the total amount of issuance and shares outstanding, but there are corporate actions and other things that tend to be a bit seasonal that can move that, so a little bit of the bump that you saw in the second quarter is reflective of that. It's somewhat offset by the very slow, limited amount of activity that we're seeing in corporate trusts, which again is reflective of the amount of trusteeships that we have and there you just aren't seeing new debt issuance globally. In terms of asset servicing, I'll turn that over to Jim to comment on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, when we take a look at all our revenue streams and tied to asset growth, about 40% of our revenues are tied to directly to asset growth. The other 60% comes from transaction volumes, from holdings that we have with our clients, our performance measurement analytics capabilities, our fund accounting, fund administration transfer agency, so you're seeing the highlighted areas that will continue to be more overweighted going forward, particularly with the GIS acquisition, which is largely overweighted on fund accounting, fund administration and transfer agency, i.e. high-dollar fees, so I think you can expect that 40% to be more likely to decline than increase as it relates to market sensitivity.</p>
