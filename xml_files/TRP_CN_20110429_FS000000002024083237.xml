          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the TransCanada Corporation 2011 First Quarter Results Conference Call.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. David Moneta, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, Mr. Moneta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to TransCanada's 2011 first quarter conference call. With me today are Russ Girling, President and Chief Executive Officer; Don Marchand, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Alex Pourbaix, President of Energy and Oil Pipelines; Greg Lohnes, President, Natural Gas Pipelines; and Glenn Menuz, our Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Russ and Don will begin today with some opening comments on our financial results and other general issues pertaining to TransCanada. Please note that a slide presentation will accompany their remarks. A copy of that presentation is available on our website at transcanada.com; and it can be found in the Investor section under the heading "Events and Presentations."</p>
          <p>Following their prepared remarks, we will turn the call over to the conference coordinator for your questions. During the question-and-answer period, we'll take questions from the investment community first, followed by the media. In order to provide everyone with an equal opportunity to participate, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue.</p>
          <p>Also, we ask that you focus your questions on our industry, our corporate strategy, recent developments and key elements of our financial performance. If you have detailed questions relating to some of our smaller operations for our detailed financial &#x2013; for your detailed financial models, Terry and I would be pleased to discuss them with you following the call.</p>
          <p>Before Russ begins, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to important risks and uncertainties. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, please see the reports filed by TransCanada with Canadian Securities Regulators and with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd also like to point out that during this presentation, we'll refer to measures such as comparable earnings, comparable earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, comparable EBITDA, and funds generated from operations. These measures do not have any standardized meaning under GAAP and are therefore considered to be non-GAAP measures. And as a result, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. They are used to provide you with additional information on our operating performance, liquidity and our ability to generate funds to finance our operations.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Russ.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As many of you heard in my Annual Meeting addressed a short time ago, we had a very strong first quarter. Comparable earnings were up 30% compared to the same period last year to $425 million or $0.61 per share.</p>
          <p>The two main factors that drove this earnings increase: we are seeing the positive results of our $9 billion of new assets being put into commercial operations this past year, and TransCanada base-load power assets have benefited from power &#x2013; higher power prices, primarily in the West. Our strategy is working, and realizing on our vision of becoming the leading energy infrastructure company in North America by focusing on what we have worked on so well in the past and executing our strategies moving forward.</p>
          <p>We will continue to deliver energy reliably, safely, and responsibly, growing earnings and cash flow over the near-term and the long-term. And a key element of this is completing the remaining $10 billion of our capital program. Over the last 12 months, seven new major projects have started operations: the first two phases of the Keystone project, Kibby Wind, Halton Hills, Bison, Groundbirch and the North Central Corridor project. Two other major projects are expected to be complete in the coming days and months, but I'll provide you a little bit more of information on that in just a moment.</p>
          <p>On the financial side, on all measures, this was a very strong quarter. Net income applicable to common shares for the first quarter was $415 million or $0.59 per share, which is an increase of 20% per share over last year. Comparable EBITDA for the first quarter of 2011 was $1.2 billion, an increase of 22%, and funds generated from operations were $919 million, an increase of 27%. As well, today the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share for the quarter ending June 30, 2011.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Keystone, we celebrated a very significant milestone this quarter and just a few weeks ago I was in Oklahoma to mark the start of the Cushing Extension of our Keystone pipeline system. And I think you'll remember I announced the start of the commercial operations of that portion of the pipe in our last quarterly call. This extension expands the capacity from 435,000 barrels per day to 591,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>And shippers have entered into binding contracts on the first two phases of the project. 530,000 barrels a day, or about 90% of that capacity, is already spoken for. And we continue to progress the Keystone XL project on a number of fronts. There is now greater clarity in the regulatory process for the expansion through the Gulf Coast. We were very pleased the U.S. State Department committed to concluding its review of Keystone by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And two weeks ago, the State Department issued its Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement, and that report provides additional information and thousands of pages of additional detailed analysis of key environmental issues. But the fundamental conclusion the State Department reached last spring in its draft report has not changed, the project conclusions were that it would still have a limited environmental impact.</p>
          <p>We expect completion of the environmental review in July or August and from there, there will a 90 day national interest determination period. I'm confident that the Keystone XL project will pass that test and that we'll receive a positive decision by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The President of the United States this spring said that they will continue to rely on Canada as a steady and stable and reliable supplier of oil. And I think our Prime Minister said it even better. After his meeting with the President, he said that the U.S. faces a choice between the nation's receiving its ongoing needs for imported crude oil from unstable sources such as the Middle East or from the most secure, most stable and friendliest location, which is Canada. The choice is clear and TransCanada's Keystone pipeline can help provide that energy security. As well, it creates 20,000 jobs and injects $20 billion into the U.S. economy without $1 of government support. So clearly our view is this project is in the public interest.</p>
          <p>Moving over to our gas pipeline business, following the start of operations at the Groundbirch natural gas pipeline in late December, I'm please to report that we began construction of the Horn River pipeline last month. Both Groundbirch and Horn River have contracts to ship just over 2 billion cubic feet a day of BC shale gas to markets. Part of this total includes a new agreement to ship another 100 million cubic feet a day, growing to about 300 million cubic feet a day by 2020. This new project will require us to extend our Horn River pipeline by about 100 kilometers deeper into this prolific play at a cost of about $265 million.</p>
          <p>Further development in Alberta and British Columbia is on the horizon. We have filed several applications with the National Energy Board to expand our pipeline network to accommodate growing volumes and throughputs. TransCanada is expected to invest about $475 million in these various projects over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Mexico, our Guadalajara pipeline project down there continues to move forward. We increased our investment in the project through the addition of a $60 million compressor station that CFE required to expand its gas capacity, and the pipeline isn't even complete yet. Construction is now about 90% complete, and we should be operational next quarter. The $420 million project will move gas from Manzanillo to electric generators and to supply Mexico's second largest city in Guadalajara.</p>
          <p>Over to the Mainline, TransCanada filed an application with the National Energy Board in late January for approval of revised interim tolls towards Canadian Mainline effective March 1, 2011. In February, the National Energy Board approved TransCanada's revised interim toll application; these tolls were effective March 1 and were consistent with the approved 2007 to 2011 settlement.</p>
          <p>We filed an application this morning for approval of final tolls that is consistent with this five-year existing settlement, and it is aligned with our current interim tolls. We have worked, as you know, very hard with our shippers over the last many months, and while we've agreed on many concepts, unfortunately we have not yet enable to reach agreement on new tolling concepts. It is our current intention to file a more comprehensive rate review application with the National Energy Board later this year that will address tolls for 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>The question that I'm most commonly asked these days is, "Are your costs going to be recoverable in the Mainline?" I think what's important to remember is that the Mainline is a regulated utility and it's my belief that, given the scope and importance of that asset, it will remain regulated for a long time to come. Its costs were all prudently incurred and they were all approved by the regulator. And therefore these costs are recoverable as they have been historically.</p>
          <p>The Mainline is a very important piece of the North American gas delivery system. Evidence of that need for the system was demonstrated well in the first quarter, where the system receipts averaged about 4.2 billion cubic feet a day, and peaked at about 5.4 billion cubic feet a day, and that is by far still the single largest long-haul gas transport system on the continent. Total deliveries east were about 6.6 billion cubic feet a day.</p>
          <p>In addition, we recently concluded a successful open season for the Mainline that resulted in agreements to ship 220 million cubic feet a day at Marcellus shale gas to eastern markets. And we just wrapped up another open season for the Mainline that is expected to the lead to contracts for an additional 150 million cubic feet a day of Marcellus gas that will make its way onto Ontario markets and perhaps further than that.</p>
          <p>On the northern gas front, the Alaskan pipeline team continues to work with its shippers to resolve the conditional bid that we received as part of the project's open season held last summer. And we are working at completing tasks together with our partner ExxonMobil in many areas in preparation for a filing which will be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by October of 2012.</p>
          <p>In the last month, the Mackenzie Valley pipeline project was approved by the National Energy Board, marking the end of our long Federal Regulatory process. The project sponsors are now preparing for discussions with the Federal Government on a fiscal framework that would allow the project to move forward.</p>
          <p>Over on the Power side, next week we will officially mark the start of commercial operations of the Coolidge Power Plant in Arizona. Power produced at Coolidge will be sold through a local utility as part of a 20-year power purchase agreement. The $500 million generating station will provide peaking power to the area residents when it is needed.</p>
          <p>The remaining stages of the Cartier Wind project in Quebec are nearing completion. The final two stages of the 590 megawatt project are expected to be operational in December 2011 and December 2012, respectively. Cartier Wind is 62% owned by TransCanada, and like Coolidge all of the power produced at Cartier will be sold to Hydro-Quebec under a 20 year power purchase contract.</p>
          <p>Over at Bruce, plant commissioning is underway at Unit 2. As refurbishment work enters its final stages, construction of Unit 2 should be compete in the second quarter of this year. Bruce expects to load fuel into Unit 2 in the second quarter of 2011, synchronize the electric grid by the end of 2011 and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Unit 1 should see fuel loading start in the third quarter of 2011, first synchronization of the generator in the first quarter of 2012 and commercial operations are expected to begin on Unit 1 in the third quarter of 2012. Plant commissioning and testing are underway and will accelerate at the end of the second quarter when construction is expected it can be completed. TransCanada's share of total capital costs still is expected to be $2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>On the financial side, earlier this week, TransCanada announced that it sold a 25% interest in both its Bison Pipeline and Gas Transmission in &#x2013; Northwest Gas Transmission system to TC PipeLines, LP for US$605 million. The purchase price included $80 million &#x2013; $81 million of GTN debt and the sale is expected to close in May, and it's subject still to certain closing conditions.</p>
          <p>The proceeds will be used to help fund our near-term capital needs. Going forward, our goal is to maximize shareholder value by using our growing internally generated cash flow as well as our debt capacity to fund growth. If additional funding is required, we will consider further asset sales to our LP as we did with Bison and GTN or other portfolio management activities.</p>
          <p>Earlier today, we announced that we would no longer issue common stock from treasury under the dividend reinvestment program. As we have stated before, we do not believe that we need any additional common equity to fund our existing capital program. Our funding requirements over the next three years we believe are very manageable. Our substantial and growing internally generated cash flow, our ability to access senior debt, preferred shares and high spread security markets on very competitive terms provides us with significant flexibility going forward.</p>
          <p>In 2014 and beyond, our significant discretionary cash flow will be directed to further enhancing financial strength and flexibility, incremental growth opportunities and ongoing dividend growth. So to wrap up, and as I told our shareholders this morning, we have a clear path for growing this company through our enviable portfolio of long-life assets that are critical to the supply and delivery of energy across the continent.</p>
          <p>We are well positioned to benefit from a continuing rise in power as the economic activity recovers and we have completed nearly $10 billion in projects that have started or will start soon over the coming days. And we have $10 billion of high quality contracted projects that will be completed in the next two to three years, projects that will deliver predictable, stable, long-term cash flow. In the longer term, we have three very attractive and growing businesses to reinvest our $3 billion to $4 billion of annual cash flow, reinvestment that will be done, as we've always said, in a disciplined fashion and in a way that allows us to live within our means. If we are successful in executing on those priorities, we will grow cash flow, earnings and dividends, which ultimately leads to share price appreciation and growing long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don Marchand, who will provide you with some additional details on our first quarter 2011 financial results. Don?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Russ, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I expand on the details of our first quarter, I'd like to draw your attention to a few key themes. First, TransCanada's diverse set of high quality infrastructure assets generated significantly higher comparable earnings and cash flow year-over-year, even though a portion of our business continued to be impacted by lower power prices and natural gas storage spreads.</p>
          <p>Second, I will reiterate Russell's comments earlier; we continue to successfully advance our $20 billion capital program that will further contribute to earnings, cash flow and dividend growth in the future. Over $14 billion is now invested in the program and about $10 billion of these projects either begun or about to commence operations.</p>
          <p>Both the Wood River/Patoka and Cushing Extension phases of Keystone, the Halton Hills and Kibby Wind power facilities, and the Bison and Groundbirch natural gas pipelines were all generating significant EBITDA in the first quarter of 2011. Coolidge and Guadalajara are both expected to enter commercial service in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And third, TransCanada's financial position and access to capital remains strong. Earlier this week, we announced a U.S. $6 million asset sale to our sponsored MLP, TC PipeLines, which in turn successfully placed $300 million U.S. of common units in a public offering that will close on May 3. Proceeds from this drop down will put a significant dent in our financing needs for 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2012 and 2013, in addition to our growing internally generated cash flow, we are well positioned opportunistically from the remainder of our current capital program without additional common equity. Options include further drop downs to TC PipeLines, portfolio management activities, senior debt, hybrid securities and/or preferred shares.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to take the next 10 minutes or so to elaborate on these themes and our first quarter 2011 results. Comparable earnings in the period were $425 million or $0.61 per share, compared to $328 million or $0.48 per share in 2010, an increase of 27% on a per-share basis. Incremental earnings from $9 billion of newly commissioned assets, combined with improvements in many of our existing core businesses, contributed to the significant increase in first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>Specifically, the startup of Keystone, Halton Hills, Bison, Groundbirch and the second phase of Kibby Wind, higher power prices realized in Western Power, higher return on equity on a thicker equity component for the Alberta System, and lower pipeline business development costs. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in unregulated natural gas storage revenues and higher interest expense.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly review the business segment results at the EBITDA level. The natural gas pipelines business generated comparable EBITDA of $796 million in the first quarter compared to $768 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year increase reflects incremental EBITDA from Bison, a higher equity return on a thicker equity component for the Alberta System and lower expenses related to the Alberta &#x2013; the Alaska Pipeline Project.</p>
          <p>Moving to Oil Pipelines, as mentioned last quarter, we began reporting EBITDA on both the first and second phases of Keystone at the beginning of February. We are very pleased to have this marquee asset fully operational and contributing significant earnings and cash flow.</p>
          <p>Keystone will generate 11 months in EBITDA of 2011 based on long-term contracts of 530,000 barrels per day plus any additional volumes received in the spot market. In the first quarter Keystone reported $99 million in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Energy generated comparable EBITDA of $354 million in the first quarter, compared to $259 million in the same period last year. The $95 million increase was primarily due to higher realized power prices in Alberta, increased generation volumes and lower operating costs at Bruce A, and new earnings from Halton Hills in Ontario in the second phase of Kibby Wind in Maine. This was partially offset by lower realized power prices, lower plant availability at Bruce B and reduced revenues for Alberta-based natural gas storage.</p>
          <p>In early January 2011, the operator of the Sundance A power plant declared force majeure on Units 1 and 2, effective mid-December 2010, and in February 2011, notified TransCanada that the units could not be economically returned to service. TransCanada does not agree with this claim and has disputed both matters under the binding dispute resolution process provided in the power purchase arrangement.</p>
          <p>As the limited information TransCanada has received to date does not support these claims, TransCanada continues to record revenues and costs under the PPA as though this event was a normal plant outage. Comparable EBITDA in the first quarter included $39 million related to the Sundance A PPA.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the income statement items below EBIT on slide 23. Comparable interest expense in the first quarter was $210 million, compared to a $182 million last year. $28 million increase reflects decreased capitalized interest related primarily to Keystone and incremental interest expense and new debt issues of US$1.25 billion in June 2010, and US$1 billion in December 2010.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, $97 million in interest was capitalized to assets under construction compared to $134 million for the same period in 2010. As we have seen as new projects are placed into service, capitalized interest will begin to decrease, somewhat offsetting the impact of higher EBITDA associated with these new assets. Comparable interest income and other of $31 million in the first quarter of 2011 increased by $7 million when compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>The increase reflects higher gains realized in 2011 compared to 2010 from derivatives used to manage exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar income.</p>
          <p>You will have noticed this quarter that we've modified slightly our definition of comparable earnings to exclude unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives related to risk management activities.</p>
          <p>Previously, we excluded unrealized gains and losses on U.S. Power and Natural Gas Storage derivatives and Natural Gas Storage inventory, but have now expanded this to similar fair value adjustments for all commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>While these derivatives provide effective economic hedges of underlying exposures, they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, we must reflect changes in the fair value of these instruments and net income each period. These fair value or mark-to-market changes reflect a point in time valuation that is generally not representative of locked-in margins that will be realized on settlement and therefore do not meaningfully reflect our underlying operations. Assets, we've excluded them from comparable earnings.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that the realized gains and losses that aren't recorded when these risk management derivatives are settled continue to be reflected in comparable earnings. Comparable income taxes of $185 million in the first quarter 2011 was $67 million higher than first quarter of 2010, primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings.</p>
          <p>Preferred share dividends of $14 million was $7 million higher in the first quarter of 2011 due to the issuance of $350 million of cumulative redeemable first preferred shares in each of March and June of 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving on to cash flow and capital expenditures on slide 24, cash flow was strong in the quarter for many of the reasons I already discussed in my review of EBITDA. Funds generated from operations of $919 million increased $196 million or 27%. Capital expenditures were $784 million in first quarter 2011, principally related to Keystone, the Bruce A restart, Guadalajara and Alberta System expansion projects.</p>
          <p>For the year, we expect to spend approximately $3.5 billion to further advance our $20 billion capital program. With our strong and growing cash flow, cash on hand at the beginning of the year and the proceeds expected from the announced sale of a 25% interest in Bison and GTN to TC PipeLines, our capital funding is largely complete for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now looking at slide 25, our liquidity and access to capital remains solid. At the end of the first quarter, our consolidated balance sheet consisted of 42% common equity, 4% preferred shares, 3% junior subordinated notes and 51% debt net of cash.</p>
          <p>At March 31, we had $600 million of cash on hand along with $3.8 billion of committed and undrawn revolving bank lines. Our two commercial paper programs remain well supported by the market and continue to provide a flexible and attractive source of short-term funds. Our dividend reinvestment program participation was 37% in the most recent quarter, generating $93 million of common equity.</p>
          <p>With the dividend announcement today, common shares purchased with reinvested cash dividends under TransCanada's dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan will no longer be satisfied with shares issued from treasury at a discount, but rather will be acquired on the TSX at 100% of the weighted average purchase price.</p>
          <p>This will serve to reduce further future dilution of earnings and is reflective of the strength of our financial position for successful advancement of our construction program and the various attractive alternatives available to TransCanada to finance our current growth portfolio.</p>
          <p>Next, just a quick update on TransCanada's decision to adopt U.S. GAAP versus International Financial Reporting Standards or IFRS.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned last quarter, given the uncertainty around rate-regulated accounting under IFRS and the one-year deferral available to the company, TransCanada will continue preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with existing Canadian GAAP for 2011.</p>
          <p>Effective 2012, TransCanada has the option to and will adopt U.S. GAAP as an alternative to IFRS. This will help ensure the economic impact of our regulators' decisions regarding the company's revenues and totals will be appropriately reflected in our accounts going forward.</p>
          <p>In closing, TransCanada produced a very strong quarter with comparable earnings 27% higher than first quarter 2010. Our unprecedented $20 billion capital program is now two-thirds complete, having invested over $14 billion to-date, with $10 billion of these projects significantly contributing to earnings and cash flow in 2011.</p>
          <p>With the drop down to our MLP, TC PipeLines, our financing plan is well advanced for 2011, and we are well positioned to fund the remainder of our current capital program through 2012 and 2013 without any additional common equity.</p>
          <p>Finally, in 2014 and beyond, we expect to generate significant discretionary cash flow that can be used to continue to grow the dividend, invest in accretive growth opportunities and further enhance our financial strength and flexibility.</p>
          <p>That's the end of my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to David for the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could provide some color on the current level of throughput on Keystone, how that compares to Q1, and directionally where you would expect that to go over the remainder of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Alex here. Since we have opened up the Cushing Extension, we are flowing at &#x2013; give or take 375,000 to 400,000 barrels a day and we would expect that to slowly ramp up over the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's important to remember that as of the commencement of commercial operations, we have 530,000 barrels a day of firm contract that the pay for movement irrespective of what the flow is and so our cash flow isn't necessarily reflective of the volume movement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, makes sense. And then secondly, given the bottleneck at Cushing, there has been a few competing proposals made to get oil &#x2013; more oil from the &#x2013; into the Gulf Coast area. Could you comment on how you think Keystone &#x2013; the Keystone expansion stacks up from a competitive standpoint? And whether you think there's room for more than one pipe, multiple pipes into the Gulf Coast region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Off the bat, our initial proposal for our Cushing market link was around 150,000 barrels a day. I think from what we hear from industry experts ultimately by 2013 or so there's probably a need for up to around 500,000 barrels a day takeaway capacity to the Gulf. We &#x2013; if there is that interest, we have the ability to upsize our offering, but even given that, it looks like there is an opportunity for more than one pipeline.</p>
          <p>We take a look at this project, we think it is a very competitive project, it has a very low capital cost and we can be in service right around the beginning of 2013. So we think we're a very competitive option and we've already committed to go ahead because we've received sufficient shipper support to do so. So it's full speed ahead on that project for us.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall two questions, and the one is very broad. Russ, you've had a chance now to settle into your current role and &#x2013; the question's about structure and the size of TransCanada coming out the other side in 2013, 2014 and I kind of look at what Duke did acquiring Westcoast, breaking out Spectra, Duke Power et cetera. I'm just wondering if you may view or perceive you may have a whole-code <mark type="ph" /> whole-code (30:49) discount within your company now or in the future? Does it makes sense to look at the size of your company in several pieces, whether or not a renewable spinout makes sense or not, and there's my &#x2013; both my questions, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at the current time, Sam, no intentions on splitting the company or doing any of those things. Currently there is significant synergies between all parts of our business, both financially and operationally.</p>
          <p>Looking out into the future, we will do whatever I guess is in the best interest of our shareholders and add to most shareholder value, but I can tell you from my perspective I've seen the value of operating these companies together. The cash flow from one can fund the growth in the other through certain parts of the cycle and vice versa.</p>
          <p>Operationally, a lot of the equipment we use, whether we're using a gas turbine to run a compressor or whether we're using it to run an electric generator, it's the same equipment and we see economies of scale by operating those things under one operating tent. So at least at the current time we think that there isn't a discount on our stock for holding these businesses together and that they are synergistic.</p>
          <p>At the financial level, all of our businesses have the characteristic of low-risk, stable cash flow. So from a balance sheet perspective they all fit together and I would suggest that, as I've observed some of these other transactions that have occurred, one of the difficulties is holding assets on a balance sheet that have different characteristics and actually require different kinds of balance sheets.</p>
          <p>We've been very careful to construct our Energy Business, for example, in a way that has the, from a cash flow perspective, the same kind of characteristics as a regulated pipeline or a contracted pipeline. So they're all sort of very similar from that perspective, and I don't think that there is any discount out there at the current time. We actually I think get some positive benefit from the size and scale and scope of the operation and then the cash that it generates.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, a quick one. Just want to confirm the CapEx profile over the next couple of years. You mentioned $3.5 billion in 2011, and how is it going to roll out in 2012 and 2013? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Don here. Looking at something in the $5 billion range for 2012 and about $2.3 billion for 2013. Those can move around depending on the Keystone spend profile, but that's the order of magnitude in those two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and one last, given your drip, the decision you took on your drip reflecting some kind of more confidence in your financing end of this year over the next couple of years, are you more open now to take a look at acquisitions opportunity either in the Power business or the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that we are focused on our existing capital program. So we've got about $10 billion of work in progress that needs to be completed over the next two to three years. To the extent that good investment opportunities arise on the horizon, we'll look at those, but they're certainly not our focus today.</p>
          <p>As we sort of get out into the 2013, 2014 range, we're going to be looking for new investment opportunities and acquisition will be part of that slate of opportunities that we look at, and certainly we'd have to start looking at some of those today because it takes that long to actually look at and close. Certain transactions would look like that, but our current focus is on what's in front of us today. We've got some hard work left to do. We have $10 billion of projects, and quite frankly our team has continued to find new investment opportunities in our core businesses around Keystone XL, and like Alex mentioned, things around &#x2013; the market linked projects, we're seeing opportunities potentially attached to Houston market for example; we are looking upstream.</p>
          <p>Our gas business is generating incremental need for capital to attach new gas supply to it. On the energy side, we're seeing continued opportunities for new builds in the various markets that we participate in as people look to move away from coal and add more gas generation. So on our horizon there appears to be a lot of opportunities for development. And I think what the message that we're sending today was whatever that slate of opportunities is, whether it's development or acquisition, we will finance those in a way that is sort of defined by living within our means, which is our internally-generated cash flow, our debt capacity. And then if we need to actively do some portfolio management and use our limited partnerships, we'll do that as well.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Nice results. Hey, Russ, maybe if I could start just a question on the NEB filing that you did today. Was it potentially a consideration instead of just filing 2011 today to actually do a multi-year filing if indeed a settlement didn't look like it was going to happen? And trying to kind of just get a sense of, are we in a position where negotiations, even though they haven't happened yet, or settlement hasn't happened yet, are still ongoing? And also if there's any way to kind of firm up a sense of timing. You said later this year we'll be looking to perhaps file that. I didn't know if we could narrow that down it all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I let Greg take that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem. We said right in our filing today that we would look to file a comprehensive rate case by October 31. So the goal would be to file a case that is really a full review of all of the costs and the cost of service as part of that application as well as some structural changes in order to fulfill some of the larger pictures issues, which is to have the areas which are the most used on the pipeline with the largest volumes paying for the infrastructure to a larger extent. So we're preparing that case, we are in negotiations, we continue to negotiate, we would &#x2013; we actively seek to settle with the constituents.</p>
          <p>We were just unable to get there right now. So we had an obligation to file by May 2 to firm up the tolls for '11. It made sense to firm them up consistent with the interim tolls that are already in place for the year so that the marketplace had consistent tolls for the year and to continue to work towards something for the longer term. But in parallel to that, because we've been at this for quite a while and we have diverse interest amongst our stakeholders, we thought that it was necessary to move forward with a formal filing, which we'll put in place in the fall as we continue to negotiate along those same timelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I appreciate the color. And if I could just follow-up one other question, and I guess this is probably more for Alex. And this is really just, if I'm trying to reconcile from where we were at the end of last year to today, this is particularly on the U.S. generation portfolio and there was a mention that, I think in perhaps the year-end release, there was something on the order of over 11,000 gigawatts hedged contracted for 2011, and it looks like there's only 4,300 left for the remainder of the year. And I'm trying to better understand what's going on there because part of it is, is when you say the 4,300 is going to be perhaps representative of 60% of our likely generation in sales. That seems to be much lower than last year, and so if you could help to get some color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. I guess a couple of things, and Glenn might jump in and talk about this a little bit. But the changes we made were really done from a perspective of attempting to give better clarity and better information to our analysts and to our shareholders. And in the Eastern, the U.S. business particularly, and maybe I'll contrast it to the Western business, but the Western business &#x2013; we're basically in a business of marketing the volumes that are produced from our facilities. In the East, we're marketing volumes produced from our facilities, we're buying third party volumes, physical volumes, and we're buying financial products, all with a view of serving our very significant customer load. And as a result, we thought it would be a lot more meaningful to our analysts to actually talk about how much of our kind of owned generation is actually forward sold. Because it &#x2013; I think it tended to over inflate if we added all those various sources of supply and treated them as percentage sold. So it's really just an effort to give more clear information to our analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only thing I would add to that, because I think Alex covered it quite well, is that when you are looking at what we've provided previously that was always an historical look back, split between contract and spots. And as Alex said now, we think better information is to provide it a percentage of planned generation.</p>
          <p>And a couple of more points maybe to make on that is that as we go forward over the course of the year, normally and in a normal core situation you'd be looking to firm up more of that. And remembering that contracts can be anywhere from a year out to a week out. So definitely you would see that number increase. But as Alex also said, a good portion of that is what we would call our back-to-back sales to our industrial, commercial and wholesale customers. So that's not quite the same as &#x2013; the concept of contract versus spot doesn't really hold there, but it does inflate the numbers.</p>
          <p>And lastly, this 60% is only a point-in-time estimate, and again that will continue to move going forward. But I think the biggest underlying points we made there is that we did feel that this was better information for the U.S. Power Group as opposed to the traditional approach we were maybe taking with the Western Power Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. So we just have some apples and oranges right now between those numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's different how we look at the two businesses differently and how they're maybe exposed differently. And as Alex said, they're &#x2013; the different streams of power coming in under different contracts to different types of customers, you need to look at it a little differently, and we want to make sure we provide the best information possible.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. With respect to the Sundance PPA, I'm just wondering if you can talk about the timing and the process for the arbitration over that Sundance A PPA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Juan. What I would say that we have in front of us right away, there's a couple of what I would call procedural issues that need to be dealt with in front of our panel of arbitrators. Those are just some issues that I would imagine we'll be able to deal with quite quickly, call it, in say sort of a 30 to 60 day period. But the actual meat of the arbitration is a lot more complex process with there's going to be discoveries, documents, examination of officers and so forth. And I would expect that the timeline for an ultimate decision on the Sundance A arbitration would probably be kind of in the 12 to 18-month period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, that is helpful. And my second question with regard to the future potential roll down of assets into TC PipeLines, I'm wondering what assets you might consider rolling down; would you consider a portion of Keystone to be a possible asset that might be a drop-down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the current time, we look at all of our U.S. based pipeline assets as being possible candidates. Some are better than others from a tax perspective and a structuring perspective. But that's not a list that we've shared external to the company. Those are options that we hold going forward and, as we said before, it's not an automatic that we would make any sale to the LP; they're dependent upon the cash needs at the corporate level. And if selling assets to the LP makes the most sense and it is our cheapest form of capital after we've exhausted other means, then we'll look at that. So all of the assets would be in that eligible pool and, as I said, some are going to be better than others for various reasons, mostly driven by tax and structuring reasons.</p>
          <p>But currently, to be more direct, I guess, with respect to your question, until we get Keystone completed, I don't think it makes sense to restructure that asset and bring other partners into it until you have such time as you've got a stable and running asset. So generally when you've seen us sell into the LP, I mean with Bison for example, we waited until we completed it, it was up and running before we took a look at selling a portion of it into the limited partnership. So Keystone interest would probably sometime in the future, if that was to be considered at all.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A first question is on, in Western Canada, you've talked about how weather and outages really driving the big spike in power prices, can any maybe break that out; was the outages just Sundance, were there other things and then go into what you see for supply/demand going forward here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think Q1, I mean losing those Sundance units obviously, I mean you take that amount of megawatts out, especially base-load megawatts out of the market and that resulted in really kind of a, give or take, a $20 a megawatt hour across the board increase in power prices kind of all the way out the curve, 2011, 2012, 2013. But then on top of that, I think Q1 was somewhat exacerbated that we did have some very cold weather in Alberta. And on top of that, we actually lost a number of other units in addition to the Sundance units and that kind of pushed sort of, call it, the equilibrium price from the low $60s up into the kind of mid $80 range for an average price that we saw in Q1. But yeah, I mean going forward, forward markets are kind of looking for the next 2, 3 years in the low $60 range and that seems like a pretty reasonable view to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful, thank you. And then if I could just stay on the power side here, you said at Bruce B, a lot of the contracts rolled off at the end of 2010, so this is our first look at that roll-off. I mean how many contracts were actually rolling, what was the vintage of them? And so we had $53 a megawatt hour this quarter versus kind of $58 to $60 in 2010; is that a good run rate going forward or is there a lot more rolling off in '11 and '12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean most of them either rolled off or we bought them back in a low price environment. So I mean you're going to see that number over the next couple years will probably move down to the Bruce B floor price of, give or take, $50...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. A couple questions, one on Ravenswood. I'm just wondering why the U.S. power earnings weren't a little bit better given more capacity available to offer into the capacity market from Ravenswood this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And we're going to obviously see a change going forward with this new demand curve reset decision that is coming out of FERC. But I think basically what happened is we got some extra megawatts because we were seeing the roll-off of that unit 30 outage that we had affecting our claim capacity. But then on top of that, the other big component which obviously affects capacity markets is peak demand. And as part of the ISO process, they have come to a conclusion that there have been a modest reduction in peak demand in the winter season, which offset the incremental megawatts that we were getting back by the end of the 30 outage rolling off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Any thoughts on timing for the change in payments vis-&#xE0;-vis the FERC proceeding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we obviously took a position after the decision came out that we felt although we were very happy with the decision and we thought it vindicated or supported a lot of the positions we had taken in that process, we were little disappointed that the FERC allowed the ISO such a long time into November to implement the decision. So we certainly argued that there should have at least been an interim re-filing that would have seen us benefit quicker. I think we're expecting now we're hoping to start seeing some of the benefits of the demand curve reset this summer, probably August or so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks for that. And just one separate question, probably, Don, this is for you. Obviously, I think it's very good that you can show financial flexibility by dropping assets down into the LP at an attractive valuation, but I guess my question is how much more of that do you even really need to do, given that Keystone spend is, even if you get a decision at the end of this year, effectively delayed probably 6 or 12 months? I mean do you even really need any more excess equity on your balance sheet? Cash flow is so strong, especially this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the direction arrow's pointing in the right way here and we'll watch cash flow. The credit metrics still made some improvement, the FFO-to-debt one in particular. And as construction risk mitigates here, I mean we're feeling more and more confident that, I mean, we're getting near the end of it here. So it's really a point in time and any other opportunities that might pop up and any speed bumps we might hit. But given what's on the plate right now, we're in pretty good shape here. To the extent we need any more subordinated capital and we've outlined the hybrid security market, the <mark type="ph" /> pref (51:17) market and again further drop down. So these are all fairly quick things we can do opportunistically. So the answer to question is, yeah we feel we're getting near the finish line, but we may not be completely there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess my question's for Russ or for Greg. And obviously your natural gas footprint touches a lot of different basins across North America and I'm just curious as to your perspective on what areas are really surprising to the upside on incremental development and what you believe the drivers are on any upside that you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess when you look at North America in total, most areas that have shale development also have conventional supply falling off and they're staying relatively flat from a total production perspective. The two areas that shine in that environment are Marcellus, which is all incremental supply, and with the WCSP, where we're seeing significant new finds, significant development and fortunately for us, we're able to tie a good portion of that into our system.</p>
          <p>As we all see, the richer plays of more liquid-rich plays are driving development; the pure dry gas plays are a little more difficult to get done economically. So areas like the deep basin in Alberta, which are quite rich, are seeing more and more development, but we're also seeing more of the conventional areas of Alberta using the new technology and seeing development there. So we've been able to tie in significant new volumes. We've got more projects on the way and we're hoping that all of that will help bolster our infrastructure system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up to that, there have been a couple large joint-venture arrangements and in some cases offshore entities with North American companies that already own assets and resources in whether Western Canada or in the Marcellus. Do you see a continuation of that trend and could that even further accelerate the development of those basins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so. When you hear the CEOs of some of the larger North American companies speaking, such as EnCana, they refer to their interest in continuing to find joint-venture opportunities. They've got lots of development acreage and in the low price environment it takes significant capital to move forward to either hang on to leases or to do some initial work to firm up reserves. So I think you will see more of that kind of development.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. Just some clarifications around your $265 million Horn River extension. Would that be part of the Alberta system rate base or would it be more contracted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that would be rolled into the Alberta rate base. One of the big advantages that we have as the result of as, you recall a couple of years ago, the change of jurisdiction to any B jurisdiction through the Alberta system is we are able to reach beyond the Alberta border, whether it's into Saskatchewan or whether it's into BC or elsewhere in order to economically tie in new production into the existing system, it being the most liquid point in North America and producer's seeing they can get immediate liquidity by tying their volumes into our system. So we'll continue to see, I think, expansions into Horn River, into Montney and into other new developments and we certainly have other discussions underway to continue to grow our Northeast BC business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's EBITDA.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA. And what was the after-tax number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably about $0.04.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, after-tax, Linda, it would be the equivalent of about $0.04 a share.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Linda, I'd just clarify for you as well, I believe the Horn River project you were referring to, as well as the $475 million, add those two numbers together. So in other words, the Horn River project is not part of the $475 million, so you've got total incremental spend in the neighborhood of $700 million between those projects outlined in the quarterly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just first question on the Mainline. You've seen a bit of a flip-fop in support and I'm just wondering directionally maybe just comparing it to your proposal from late last year, what are some of the things that are different about what you're negotiating right now? And Russ, you mentioned about having agreed on many concepts, obviously there's still a lot left to go, but can you just talk a little bit about what some of those concepts were you found agreement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Greg start and I'll jump in here where I might want to add a few things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's fair to say that's included in our filing. The B support that we had in December was primarily Western Canadian support, <mark type="ph" /> CAP (57:37) and others supporting moving forward. I think it would be right to say that all parties are interested in seeing the Mainline remain competitive and get to a steady, stable toll that's lower than the toll we have today and there's strong interest in reaching an agreement. We were able to obtain significant market area support as a result of the work we've done over the last couple of months, but unfortunately we weren't able to garner really unanimous support that we would have needed to push forward a settlement right at this time. So it was necessary in order to meet the filing deadline with the NEB that we move forward to firm up '11 tolls so that marketplace has consistent tolls for the year and then to focus on 2012 and 2013. At this point, because you have so many diverse stakeholders, it makes sense to proceed to prepare for a filing in the fall that would address the longer-term, at least '12 to '13, and look to deal with all of the components of our cost of service and, in parallel, continue discussions with all of our stakeholders to see if we can result at least some, if not all of the components of that filing before that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve (sic) [Robert], I guess the only think I would add is the differences between December and what we were trying to achieve in the last few weeks and then sort of the change of support from, say, migrating from West to East, if you will. I think it was due more to subtleties of language and those kinds of things, which tie us into though obvious concerns about how things will be actually defined for the long-term. And again, one of our reasons for moving down the filing route is we'll solidify those long-term subtleties. I mean the concepts of moving costs out of long-haul zones into both Eastern and Western zones, those are the kinds of concepts we were saying generally people can get their heads around because they make some sense. But the subtleties around how you define some of those things and the term structures and those kinds of things are probably more where we can't find consensus among all of the parties. And therefore, we're probably in a better position to try to define them with the regulator as part of the process and not outside of the process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just and then &#x2013; thanks for that &#x2013; the other question I had was about the funding, slash, the DRIP. And just wondering your philosophy on how you think about the DRIP; is it just something that you feel you're comfortable kind of frequently turning on and off or should we really take your decision to turn it off as a feeling that you're feeling really good about the funding plan over a multi-year period notwithstanding, although the CapEx might be a little lower this year, you've got $5 billion coming up for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely the latter I would considered it as. We don't take turning the DRIP on and off lightly. And we would put it in place a few years back for a specific reason. We knew we're coming into a $20 billion unprecedented capital program and that we needed that stability to maintain our ratings and to make sure that we had the capital to continue to fund our capital program. That need no longer exists and we don't anticipate having that kind of need in the future. So I would say that unless something like that arose again, you would see us putting it that back in place. I don't know, Don, if you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd agree with that. And on an economics basis, we have other alternatives that are flexible and cheaper at this point as well.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question just on throughputs on the Canadian Mainline. I'll assume much of 2010, that I guess what you call the summer season, the Mainline throughputs or receipts in Western Canada were about 3 Bcf, which almost looks like it's a bit of a group of longer contracts that are under-rating, if you will, about 3 Bcf a day. Does the Mainline have similar long-term contract support to keep running at about 3 Bs a day or more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say right now, Steven, we're running about the same as last year at about the 2.9 Bcf level. We do have some significant long-term contracts coming due here in the fall, but say for the bulk of this year, most of those contracts remain in place. Right now, we'd be ahead of where we thought we would be at this time last year when we were forecasting, thinking more, as you say, in the 3 Bcf, 3.1 Bcf range. And right now, we think we're likely to come through the year in the more of 3.3 Bcf range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, guys. Just a couple quick follow-ups, if I could. The first is just on the tax rate, Don, I think around February, you had kind of indicated maybe expect the low 20% tax rate all-in for the year or maybe for the next few years; is that still the case even with a little bit higher rate here in first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is higher and the principal driver is the Canadian regulated pipes, primarily the Mainline. It's a unique structure there where we don't book taxes on our Canadian Reg assets on the traditional deferred tax basis. We basically book what we pay in cash tax and add that to our revenue requirement. So the bulk of the change upward is primarily due to a new view on a tax collection on the Mainline tolls. So where we are right now, I would expect something going forward, something that looks more like the Canadian statutory rate in that 25%, 26% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, all-in for the year, you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, probably yeah. In the 26% range is probably something that's a better guess right now as to where we end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just to be clear, though, that is basically coming from the Mainline, which is going to be passed-through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. In terms of the rest of business, again something in that range from the Canadian statutory rate is probably appropriate as well, the 25%, 26% range. The headline tax rate will jump up and down depending on, again, this Canadian regulated position. To the extent we collect less taxes, it will drop to the extent we need to collect more taxes, it will pop up. But to color-code it, aside from the Canadian Reg business side, use something in that 25%, 26% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no, that's helpful. And then a second question, if I could, and I apologize if this was already mentioned, but we've seen a little bit of some shift perhaps in the California renewable market and is there any update perhaps or color on Zephyr maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean what are you referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, like the merchant wind credits, for instance, the idea that maybe California is perhaps more open to taking renewables outside of the state within their portfolio and I didn't know if that was creating some additional certainty around Zephyr or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we are right now still kind of monitoring that and we're in pretty close discussion with the utilities. I mean the big question for us is going to be regardless of what the regulatory environment is, how much interest do the California utilities have in contracting out of state? So I would say on that one, probably continue to sort of hold tight on that for a quarter or so and we'll probably have a little better feel on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I apologize if this is in the Mainline final toll filing, but maybe you can just clarify, for the $1.89 toll to be in place this year versus a $2.07, that would allow you to achieve all your revenue requirements. Currently, what would be your expectation of under-collecting revenues, if at all, if you exclude the 2010 $237 million under-recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll recall in 2010, we had an under-recovery; I think it's around $239 million. That number is in the 2011 tolls; however, we had some over-recovery due to the higher than expected volumes earlier in the year and then we forecast out what the rest of the year would be. So in order to keep the toll flat to the interim tolls and staying within the four corners of our five-year settlement agreement, the toll would have gone to $2.07. We asked the NEB to hold it at the $1.89; that's just the toll to Don. And I think on balance, the under-recovery should be in the range of just assuming you carried forward the 2010 under-recovery and hopefully a little bit less, depending on how the volumes turn out for the rest of the year. So then we would go into the long-term toll rate case and in that case, where we were hoping to bring tolls down substantially, a deal with that under-recovery amount is just one of the issues to be dealt with during that rate case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you expect to be flat for 2011 to maybe up a bit, so at $200 million under-recovery in total could be a reasonable number to assume for entering in 2012?</p>

Terry, Lee and myself have been at the site of our AGM, but we'll heading back to our offices. To the extent you have any follow-up questions, we'd be happy to try to deal with those later this afternoon. Thanks again for your interest and we look forward to talking to you in the not too distant future.</p>
