          <p>Good evening from Bangkok. Welcome to the DTAC Q3 2010 result conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Mr. Jon Fredrik, our CFO, Vanna Pornsinsiriruk, and our VP <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
          <p>As usual, we will begin with the strong presentation and open up for question later. I'll hand over to <mark type="indiscernible" /> to start the presentation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good evening from Bangkok. I am happy to share with you that DTAC today together with its third quarter results announced its first interim dividend of $0.66 per share. DTAC has had a strong growth in mobile service revenue this quarter. We have improved our EBITDA margin, thanks to a continuous focus on cost which we have talked about the last two quarters every time. And we have also on quarterly basis achieved very positive net balance. We have a one time settlement on that also but on a quarterly basis this because of introducing net <mark type="ph" /> production in our IC calculations, we have become positive.</p>
          <p>The market is growing more or less as expected and even if the other two competitors have not yet disclosed their results, we believe we are able to keep our market share when it comes to customers and also on revenue, but that will be nicer when they announce, but we have increased our customer base by 300,000. So we are coming very close to 21 million or 20.9 million in Q3.</p>
          <p>Our planned minutes per use on ARPU is more or less in same range as last quarter. It's a small increase of 1% on the minutes of use. It's 6% year-on-year. And on ARPU there is a small reduction of 0.5% quarter-on-quarter and more than 3% a year-on-year. In this quarter, we have also included normal minutes coming from IC agreement with <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>
          <p>Well, then I will &#x2013; very short introduction and hand over to my CFO <mark type="indiscernible" /> who will take you through the more details on actual results, and I will come back a bit later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Greeting from Bangkok, where we finance this meeting. In Q3, we have got strong 8% organic revenue growth, and under service revenue breakdown the portion of VAT have been increased significantly from 12.6% to 14.4% in Q3 this year.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, we've got one-time gain as mentioned earlier by Torie <mark type="ph" /> from the retroactive revenue entry from entering the CAT-IC agreement. And these three include this, our revenue grew such to 13.2% year-on-year and on the &#x2013; if we look more into the vast revenue the data side is close to double from 24% in Q3 last year to Q3 this year.</p>
          <p>We have been successful in keeping our cost base low. The positive net IC balance has increased slightly from 26.4 last quarter to 27.3 that's due to the first time positive net IC balance as mentioned earlier by Torie <mark type="ph" /> and we have been still doing very well on the network OpEx and we have managed to increase from 7.2% last year to 6.1%, and the major attributable item will be repair and maintenance cost and electricity cost and other sale side cost.</p>
          <p>The net IC has turned positive for the first time after the long while of DTAC history. On the normalized basis it has changed from minus 82 in Q2, in the past quarter to 142, and if you take into account, the one-time retroactive gain from the entering into the IC agreement with CAT than we spend at 794.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A side, we have seen doing quite all right with slight increase from the previous quarter, but a reduction from Q3 last year we have been successfully brining down substantially the bad debt from 5% in Q2 this year to 3.7% with our more focus on the quality of subscribers.</p>
          <p>And after we saw of all these strong performance in reduction of cost base, our EBITDA margin has improved further from 44.2 in Q2 this year to 35.1 and it will include the one-time gain from CAT agreement and our EBITDA margin has &#x2013; to 38.1%. The normalized net profit has increased substantially from the previous year by 55.3% and from the previous quarter 4.1% and these lead to our strong cash flow position.</p>
          <p>At the end of quarter three, we have already reached 16.5 billion, which is very close to our target of 17 billion previously announced. So this has enabled us to increase the remuneration to the shareholders by giving the interim dividend of 56 <mark type="indiscernible" />. And on top of that we have decided to revise upward our year-end target to 19 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll talk a bit about what we have called regular for invest for reusing quarter phase of that is our opinion. And I think the industry and far side of the <mark type="ph" /> industry agrees to such a statement. You all &#x2013; I'm sure you all are very familiar with what type of business regions you come from, license activity where CAT took NTC to court and they got an injunction earns, which was challenged by NTC but again, like in the Supreme of judge of court injunction was still valid and the have had suspended their all auctioning profits. We were more or less ready to go last trail to take part in this auction when everything collapsed.</p>
          <p>Of course in the wake of 2.1 auctioning which may take long time to get going again and we can discuss that later if you wish to go into that. We are working with capital spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen one moment while we reconnect our speakers.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> So you are back in conference. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Sorry for this. I don't know what happened, but we are not the lease line operator here, so I don't think we caused this. I was talking about 3D licensing which collapsed but I think I was already up to them. Then I talk a bit about our ongoing work with CAT to get an expansion of our 850 HSPA trial effort which we have established in small part of Bangkok already and we believe that we will be successful with this. So we can go live with a wider network initially on the non-commercial basis as <mark type="indiscernible" /> still is considering whether it should be a low to mid on a commercial basis or not.</p>
          <p>The New Frequency Act is a law which has been discussed in the Parliament and the Senate. So far they didn't agree on all parts of the new law. And therefore a joint committee of the Parliament and Senate for the time being is working on this to see if they can agree on the final wording. If not, there will be a decision on within the Parliament and the schedule from the government is to make this happen before end of November, which is also the time when the session for the parliament will end this year.</p>
          <p>If the law is approved then also the new establishment of the new regulator will be approved, along time it will take established regulatory, of course a very difficult period to say. There may of course also be delays in the final approval of the frequent check <mark type="ph" /> but as they are working hypothesis for the government is to end this by the end of November.</p>
          <p>Concession conversion, we all operators want to have that but we haven't been able to get any kind of concrete proposals on the table. And after 3G 2.1 auction collapsed and there has been very limited discussion on this, but the operators had a meeting with the Minister of Finance a week ago. And the concession conversion work is ongoing.</p>
          <p>There are some legal questions to be sorted out and the Minister of Finance has also advice after a counselor tape <mark type="ph" /> how to proceed on some of the issues linked to this. But as of yet that is a normal slide presentation, the timeline is still unclear but it has focus from the government and the intension is to terminate the existing concessions and change into licensing for whole long period and at what costs and terms and conditions in general is very difficult to say for the time being.</p>
          <p>One another possibility is being implemented all over in the industry. And we expect that commercial launch will happen late this year, at the end of the year. For the time being although for us this is not time on the daily basis, because almost complying to the regulators that one, which all operators feel and really speaking about that. We are working hard to make this happen and hopefully it can happen by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>How it's analyzed without the 3G license? We although very motivated and determine to get going on finally on wireless broadband. Now we are preceding other options that I already mentioned at the main option area is dtac's 850 or over 850 frequencies where we have 10 megahertz. We are also talking to DLT on MBMO <mark type="ph" /> aspect, but this is an initial phase.</p>
          <p>We will continue to have focus on our operational efficiency activities to improve even further our cost base. And as internet is already is important and will become more and more important, especially when we get wireless broadband. We are building everything we can on internet platform which has nothing to do with physical platform as structure and the technology solution, but more a basis for the factor grow, we went further into the data.</p>
          <p>This quarter we &#x2013; our data differs, its revenues have increased, 49% year-on-year and &#x2013; between 25 and 30% quarter-on-quarter thus far, so we have a good combination already but we want to build up on even stronger. And as we started with, we have increase in remuneration for shareholders. And for the first time we are &#x2013; the board has approved to give up additional dividends.</p>
          <p>What is further outlook for 2010? We have made a couple of changes on this compared to the previous quarter. As we have had a very good cash flow so far, we have pretty large cover target, to $19 billion that is also linked to good performance so far. We also have <mark type="indiscernible" /> has slowed down our CapEx just a bit, so now we indicate 45 billion. Previously we have seen &#x2013; said same as last year which was roughly 6 billion, so it's a small decrease there.</p>
          <p>On the revenue growth where we have 8% growth year-on-year so far, we are still sticking to our target with the high single digit and that is the combination of service revenue and handset sales. And with constant net adds we still believe the market will grow as we have indicated previously, 4, 5 million altogether, where we will take our share of this market which is roughly 30% when it comes to customers and we are well on our way to manage that.</p>
          <p>So that's a presentation for us this time and we are ready to try to answer your questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that concludes our presentation. Now we are opened up for questions.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question today from Colin McCallum with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for call and congratulations on a strong sales results. Two questions from me. First of all, I realize obviously you are cutting the CapEx for this year and I imagine you'd been relatively careful with what you spent on 2G this year, given expectation you are going to get 3G. But could I press you to give us a little bit of color on how next years CapEx will look, assuming no 3G. Do you think you can sustain then at the 4 to 5 billion level or do you think you have to pick up the CapEx there again and you have some so to having 3G to support 2.5GT to <mark type="ph" /> growth, for example?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can I just ask regarding the efficiencies that you very successful go through to get your EBITDA margin up? In the previous time when regulatory charges went up in 2006 from 20 to 25%, DTAC was able to gain further efficiency, so that really investors didn't notice to obviously when regulatory charges increased, but given that you're facing higher regulatory fees in a year's time in October 2011, do you think you'll be able to find further growth or further efficiencies to offset that higher regulatory cost or would you expect basically to have a P&amp;L account hit when the regulatory charges go up next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let's answer those two questions, one about the CapEx for next year. Normally we give guidance for our CapEx when we release for Q4 results, so I don't want to give any complete figure here, but what I will say is that there will be some reload <mark type="ph" /> next year, but the main thing because of the data growth and not only in capacity, but also in revenue, there is a need to increase data capacity in our network. And even if we should get 3G, which we obviously hope, we still there believe there will be growth in the data capacity more or less every country or every operator we've got 3G as of the same time as data is growing in the 3G network at the same time has growth in Edge GPRS network. So there will be in CapEx spend course for next year also partly for reload <mark type="ph" /> partly for capacity and there will be some cost efficiency activities which we're carrying off. I'll give one example there and that is server consolidation which we are doing now and which will give up some investment, but overtime of course, it will be a good business case for us because of our operational expenditure will go down.</p>
          <p>On the margin side, the EBITDA margin, of course we'll continuously try to improve our margins, with the fact that revenue share increases 5% towards the fourth quarter next year is quite challenging to absorb in the long goals.</p>
          <p>I again, will not give any commitment that we &#x2013; you will not see that on our results that we adjust or absorb overnight. But of course we try to maintain our margin. But it's very difficult of course, with 5% extra EBITDA margin to increase further from where we are so the target is maintained well above we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we will hear from Arthur Pineda with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on your performance. Two questions from me. Can you talk about your debt covenants, what pre cost do you have to change it, and are you allowed other forms of capital recurring <mark type="ph" /> based on the existing agreements?</p>
          <p>Second question I had is with regard to the concession conversion that you've mentioned, how can it be made legally possible, if it also effectively requires spectrum allocation on 2G side?</p>
          <p>Third question I had is with regard to the interconnection revenues, I do see that it's gone up a fair bit. Could you just explain what changed in the market to push this to a positive number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the covenant side, we have got some consent from the lender that we could uplift, as they have seen our strong balance sheet. So we could manage with the lender. Do I answer your question or is there anything else on the covenant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that done already that you amended these covenants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, correct. But that is on a yearly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What level are you allowed to be up to at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually let me put it this way. We start from the cash flow that we would meet in the fourth quarter, and we compare it with the project of our free cash flow from operation and what is not used. As you know that we don't have the 3G investment, then we increase the remuneration to the shareholders. And as everyone could see our strong balance sheet and we could be a bit underleveraged, and I think this is also gearing up to the right direction for capital structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I comment on the concession conversion, yes you're pointing at an important point. One other discussion topic for concession conversion is really if we terminate the concession and get a license, will that license only be valid up to the end of the concessionary period, meaning 2013 for TRUE, 2015 for AIS, and 2018 for us. Then if that is the case, then I don't see much problem with this because there already are frequencies allocated to the operators, and there shouldn't be any problem.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if there's also in the discussion to terminate the concession and a give a 15-year licensing period, then this can be a challenge and it can be something which makes it difficult. This is also depends upon how fast the Frequency Act is approved. And when the Frequency Act is approved then frequencies really expiry of licenses don't have to be given back to NTC and that will be auctioned out &#x2013; briefings happen before that, it can be done within their concession.</p>
          <p>So there are uncertainties to this and we cannot answer today on this. It is also remains to see what will be the final conclusion from the court. Because it's quite important to be aware that the court, the Supreme Court only took a stand to the injunction, they did not decide and conclude that NTC didn't have rights to operator or to deal with frequencies, because of lack of frequency plan.</p>
          <p>So when the court finally decides, they may come to two auctions of course, either NTC has the rights to deal with frequencies or not. If they don't have the rights, then of course, there is a bigger issue than if they have it. So this we have to wait and see the conclusion from the court.</p>
          <p>On ICA <mark type="ph" /> revenue or margins, we had in the second quarter we were roughly minus 80 million. We have improved that a bit towards the two &#x2013; our two competitors, but on top of that we get on a monthly basis a plus from our IT agreement with Hutch, meaning that they are sending more traffic to us than we are sending to them.</p>
          <p>So we get a plus and that's why the total may get pivot <mark type="ph" /> over to mobile competitors <mark type="indiscernible" /> is low and they are plus from the CAT/Hutch Agreement is higher that's why we get the positive balance there. And as long as this traffic distribution exists, we will have a positive balance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Vishesh <mark type="ph" /> from JP Morgan. Just wanted to ask on your dividend. The 56 down paid this quarter, does that anything affect the 50% payout ratio for the final dividend and also would there be any guidance on a special dividend policy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 50 stock as I mentioned earlier is base on what we need in the first quarter and what we foresee that we could generate. And for the future, I think special dividend or interim dividend is also possible and that depends very much under our business opportunities that we have mentioned during our presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Sorry about asking repeatedly on the dividend side, but can you put more color on your debt covenant guide, do you still have the same cap of 50% for this year and what should we expect your dividend paid out going forward given you have consent from the lenders that showed dividend pay out? And can you also give us some guidance on this year dividend policy, do you still retaining the 50% payout what you see in particular? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So far we maintained the dividend payout ratio that we have said earlier and if there is some change on our payout ratio then we will announce, but we did special dividend we seek certain consent and agreement from the lender and that is a truth. In terms of future possibility is I think it's difficult for a company to commit what will whether or not we could pay interim dividend next year, but even the strong balance sheet and are uncertain on the investment I think that is possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I also follow-up on this interim dividend is it on top of the normal 50% paid out that you'd expect to payout at the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we still continue with that. We think that's possible.</p>
        </plist>
