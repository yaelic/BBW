      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our first-quarter results again underscore our diversified cash flow generation, our winning execution across our territories and the growth opportunities that we captured in our different categories, combined with operating efficiencies and lower cost per unit case produced double-digit increases in the operating income in all of our divisions.</p>
          <p>We achieved more than 15% consolidated operating income growth and generated close to 12% EBITDA for the quarter. Our encouragement into new beverage categories through Jugos del Valle contributed to Mexico's top line growth for the quarter. As of February of this year, we started distribution of these products in our Mexican territories through traditional channels and that is close to 1% incremental volume growth in our territories.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect to continue gathering the benefits from this important acquisition leveraging our distribution network and our innovation in these various categories.</p>
          <p>Now before we explain our performance during the quarter in detail, I want to share some important information about the new non-inflationary accounting guidelines that we have to follow to disclose our financial information.</p>
          <p>Beginning January 1, 2008, Mexican Financial Reporting Standards on the effect of inflation was modified. It now defines the following to economic environments to determine when to use inflationary accounting.</p>
          <p>First, in any inflationary environment that is defined when the community has seen inflation of three consecutive years is 26% or more, the effects of inflation are recognized.  Second, in a non-inflationary environment, when the community inflation of the three preceding years is less than 26%, no inflationary effects are recognized.</p>
          <p>On December 31st, 2007, we applied inflationary accounting for all of our operations beginning January first of this year based on current levels of inflation, our company's discontinuing inflation accounting for its subsidiaries in Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Colombia and Brazil. For the rest of our company's subsidiaries &#x2013; namely Argentina, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Nicaragua &#x2013; we will continue to apply inflationary accounting.</p>
          <p>According to the new accounting standards, we have restated the figures for 2007 in Mexican pesos with the purchasing power as of December 31st, 2007, instead of March 31st, 2008, which would have been the practice under the previous methodology.</p>
          <p>The new accounting regulation should make our company's performance more comparable with that of our global peers across the world. We expect the information to be fully comparable beginning 2009.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as we mentioned in our press release, beginning with the first quarter of this year, we have decided to align our operations based on the way we manage our business. We have regrouped our operations into three divisions, Mexico, Latincentro, comprised of our operations in Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. And Mercosur comprised of our Brazilian and Argentine operations.</p>
          <p>Now going back to our performance during the quarter. Our consolidated sales margin grew close to 4% compared with the first quarter of 2007, driven by volume growth in all of our divisions. Our sparkling beverage volume growth was driven mainly by brand Coca-Cola, which posted more than 12% volume growth and accounted for more than 60% of our incremental volumes in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from last year's successful launch of Coca-Cola Zero in some of our territories and now we are introducing this product in Columbia. Additionally, we continue to produce strong growth in the still beverage segment, mainly by the growth contributions of Mexico and Central America in our total volume of 20% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The performance of our juice-based products in Mexico under the Jugos del Valle brand and in Central America under the Hi-C brand combined with the strength of Powerade in these markets contribute significantly to this growth.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our consolidated revenues rose more than 6% to 17.3 billion Mexican pesos or approximately $1.6 billion. Our gross profit increased 9.5% in the first quarter of 2008. Higher revenues combined with our lower cost per unit case driven by the benefit captured from the cost of sweeteners in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia more than compensated for the second stage of the previously announced concentrate increase in Mexico and higher PET cost in Mexico and Argentina. Consequently, our gross margin increased 140 basis points.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our consolidated operating income increased close to 16% year-over-year to 2.8 billion Mexican pesos or approximately to $265 million as a result of stable operating expenses as a percentage of our sales. Our consolidated EBITDA rose to 3.6 billion pesos or $236 million resulting in a solid EBITDA margin of 20.7%, a margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our majority net income increased 31.8% resulting in earnings per share of 0.88 Mexican pesos per share or the equivalent of $0.83 U.S. per share.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk about our divisions. Our Mexico division posted 4.9% volume growth compared with the first quarter of 2007, driven by the strength of brand Coca-Cola, the distribution of Jugos del Valle product since February 2008 through traditional mom-and-pop sales channel and the strength of our water brand Ciel.</p>
          <p>Volumes of brand Coca-Cola increased 4.4% for the first quarter, driven mainly by growth in non-returnable multi-serve packaging. Our water business under the Ciel brand continue to deliver strong volume growth of 6.7% in our Mexican territories, accounting for almost 30% of their growth.</p>
          <p>Supported by the introduction of Jugos del Valle beverage products, our still beverage volumes grew significantly during the quarter. This performance demonstrates our conditions to build a complete integrated beverage portfolio, delivering a balanced offer to our clients and customers.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned before, we started to distribute Jugos del Valle products in our Mexican territories to mom-and-pops beginning in February 2008. We will now incorporate the volumes sold and the revenue generated by the Jugos del Valle products to the traditional channel as part of the still category in our Mexico division.</p>
          <p>During 2008, most of the profit will remain at the Jugos del Valle for significant investment behind the brand and to improve the manufacturing facility.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our Mexico division's revenues increased close to 7%. Our volume growth represented more than 70% of incremental revenues and the average price increased with reference to the dollar. Increasing our average price per unit case included the effect of Jugos del Valle products, which carry a higher average price per unit case.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from price increases implemented last year in some of our key presentations and expect to keep our revenue management strategies in line with Mexican inflation during the year.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, our gross profit reached 12 billion Mexican pesos, up 7.6% resulting mainly from lower sweetener costs that compensated for higher rating and concentrate costs this year.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, our sweetener costs decreased approximately 10% year-over-year, while resin costs increased around 8% in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Our improved operating leverage, with operating expenses remaining stable as a percentage of total sales, resulted in double digit operating income growth for the first time in two years. Also, our operating margins expanded 70 basis points, and our operating income reached 1.4 billion Mexican pesos, or approximately $128 million.</p>
          <p>Mexico has been able to translate its top-line growth combined with the benefits of lower sweetener costs and operating efficiencies to bottom-line growth.</p>
          <p>EBITDA increased more than 9% to 1.8 billion Mexican pesos in the first quarter, or approximately $159 million.  And the operations EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 23.1%. Mexico remains our most profitable market, delivering sustainable cash flow generations despite the U.S. economic slowdown, which has not had until now a significant effect on our Mexico division.</p>
          <p>Our Latincentro division post 1.2% volume growth compared with the first quarter of 2007. The growth of flavored sparkling beverages in Central America and Venezuela combined with the growth of brand Coca-Cola in Central America compensated for the decline in flavored sparkling beverages in Colombia.  Volume growth across the franchise was 4.9% in Central America and 1.5% in Venezuela. Our Colombian operations volumes decreased by 1.4%. However, the successful launch of Coca-Cola Zero in Colombia helped to support the category in this market.</p>
          <p>Total revenues in our Latincentro division reached 5.35 billion Mexican pesos, up 3% compared with the first quarter of 2007. In the first quarter, average price per unit case increased 1.8%, driven by price increases and volume growth in non-returnable presentations, which carry a higher average price per unit case.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit increased 7.6% to 2.4 billion Mexican pesos, mainly driven by higher revenues and benefits captured from lower raw material costs in some territories in the division. Cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 200 basis points.</p>
          <p>Operating income grew 27.6% to 750 million Mexican pesos driven by stable operating expenses compared with the first quarter of 2007. Operating efficiencies have grown in these territories.  Lower marketing expenses in Colombia combined with lower expenses related to the introduction of bottle and cases in our Central American and Colombian territories. Sales achieved good results.</p>
          <p>In the Latincentro division, EBITDA grew almost 15% to 940 million Mexican pesos. The 17.7% decrease in D&amp;A was mainly driven by the amortization of deferred income derived from the sale of some of our Latincentro division brands to The Coca-Cola Company during 2007.</p>
          <p>The performance of the Latincentro division underscores its capacity to generate incremental profitability despite chasing tough comparables last year and a difficult operating environment in Venezuela. We remain confident of the raw material cost pressures that we are facing in Venezuela and the labor union demands to increase salaries ahead of inflation in this country.</p>
          <p>Our company believes in the growth potential of our territory in Venezuela despite the difficult environment that prevails.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk about our Mercosur division. Excluding beer, our Mercosur division volume grew 4.2% in the first quarter of 2008. The continued strong performance of Coca-Cola Zero in Brazil combined with brand Coca-Cola in returnable multi-serve presentations in Argentina drove this growth.</p>
          <p>Margin growth across these franchises was 4.1% in Brazil and 4.3% in Argentina. Net revenues in the Mercosur division increased 9.1% to almost 4.1 billion Mexican pesos compared with the first quarter of 2007. Excluding beer, average price per unit case increased 3.9% mainly as a result of a positive price shift mix from our value protection brand toward brand Coca-Cola in returnable presentations in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Excluding beer, net revenues increased 8.3% to 3.75 billion Mexican pesos in the first quarter compared with the same period of 2007. Driven by volume growth and the higher average price per unit case.</p>
          <p>Total revenues from beer in Brazil grew 36% to 324 million Mexican pesos compared with the first quarter 2007 mainly driven by the migration of volume previously sold directly by Kaisers supermarket in <mark type="inaudible" /> which is now being sold by Coca-Cola FEMSA.</p>
          <p>Gross profit in the Mercosur division increased almost 17% to 1.9 billion Mexican pesos, mainly driven by lower cost of sugar in Brazil and by benefits captured by the appreciation of the Brazilian real applied to dollar-denominated raw materials. This increase more than compensated for higher sweetener and PET cost in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 260 basis points. Operating income grew 13.4% to 704 million Mexican pesos. Operating expenses grew 19.1%, and expanded 200 basis points as a percentage of sales compared with the first quarter of 2007. This increase was driven by higher labor cost in Argentina, combined with higher operating expenses in Brazil related to go-to-market initiatives.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew 14.3% to 833 million Mexican pesos. EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%. The 19.4% increase in D&amp;A resulted mainly from higher amortization of coolers, bottles and cases recently introduced in the market.</p>
          <p>In the Mercosur division, our effort to supply our customers and clients with the right product at the right place for the right consumption occasions have reinforced our share of sales in Brazil and Argentina year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On a consolidated basis, our performance continue to underscore our ability to strengthen our balance sheet and generate balance sheet cash flow. Our franchises outside of Mexico delivered half of our consolidated EBITDA with our Latincentro and Mercosur divisions contributing 27% and 23% respectively.</p>
          <p>As of March 2008, our net debt to EBITDA ratio coverage was 0.73 times. Total net debt decreased approximately $60 million compared with year-end 2007.</p>
          <p>Regarding our Brazilian acquisition, we are advancing the process to close the deal in the Coca-Cola Company. We have begun to provide guidance to implement our strategies and execution model in today's new franchise and expect the consolidated result during the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>This was another great quarter of our company. Our operators and management team continues to demonstrate that we can capture value for our shareholders across our territories.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your interest in our company and the trust you place in us.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to open the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your continued improvement in Mexico.  First, if you could just talk about the current market environment particularly with respect to pricing and then also just give us a sense of the opportunities that you see with the continued rollout of new brands there and how we should think about &#x2013; how that's going to contribute to your volumes going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren, good morning.  The environment in Mexico as I mentioned, continues to be very positive.  To be very honest, given all this noise that has been created with all the, difficulties I mentioned, the money that is transferred for some construction workers into Mexico during the first quarter, we were a bit surprised of the strength of our volumes during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>April has continued to provide good numbers, although a bit smaller growth on what we have in the first quarter. But it's too early to really know if the acceleration in the U.S., the size of the effect that this acceleration on the U.S. economy would have in Mexico.  April as you know, it's an odd month because of the holy week being now in March as opposed to April and there might be some effect because of that.  But ordinarily, we continue to see good volume growth during April.  With respect to prices, given what we have seen in terms of decrease in some of the raw materials, especially with respect to cost of sugar in Mexico.  We are seeing that our competitors have more, let me give you this expression, more air to breathe, maybe a bit more, and that probably will create some stabilization of the prices for a while.  I don't see prices increasing in the next five to six months, and obviously it will depend a lot on how sweeteners and the requisite of the raw materials behave going forward.  But as I mentioned during this introduction, our objective is to try to maintain prices with inflation for the full year.</p>
          <p>In terms of our specific competitors, we continue to see Jarritos and Red Cola staying with the same prices that they have.  We saw some price increases on Pepsi and Big Cola towards the end of last year and both those prices have stayed, and that basically is the environment that we see in price.  With Jugos del Valle, obviously as you can imagine, those products carry a higher price per case in the territories, and we would expect to benefit in the pricing mix as we continue to improve the size of the volumes we sell to our mom-and-pop chains.</p>
          <p>It's important to remind everyone that all modern freight volumes are going to be sold centralized to Jugos del Valle, and every bottler in Mexico will take care of the traditional channels with the Coca-Cola distribution system that everyone has, no?  So, at the end of the day, we do expect, we started to distribute products by around mid-February.  So the effect that you have there, which was basically 2.5 million unit cases of Jugos del Valle product.  Basically take us to on a normalized quarter, somewhere along five million unit cases of Jugos del Valle product is what we should be selling, no? And that as I mentioned, will have a slightly positive effect on them, because still the number of cases is too low but it will benefit the pricing mix.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Robert Ford from Merrill Lynch.  You may proceed sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning everybody.  Thanks for taking my question, H&#xE9;ctor.  Congratulations on the quarter.  I was curious with respect to the improvement in the expense ratio in the first quarter.  How much of that is just cycling the big campaign behind Zero and if you could expand, you're saying that Zero is a big portion of the incremental Coke volumes. Can you discuss a little bit about how the brand is trying to recover from the unfortunate incident with the sweetener?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bob.  Yes, I think that certainly last year the first quarter is what we were pushing very hard for Coca-Cola Zero, speaking specifically about Mexico and then I will go to Argentina and Brazil.  And there were big expenses related to that introduction last year.  The sweetener thing in Mexico has not worked in our favor, obviously because we were in a way confronted with the decision of continuing with a product that is authorized in Mexico, but that created a lot of tension among our consumers with respect to the formula.</p>
          <p>So, even though it's a formula that has been used in Europe and in a bunch of other countries, there was a big revolt, let me use that word, in Mexico with respect to the use of this sweetener.  So the Coca-Cola Company, after a very thorough analysis, and we agreed with that conclusion, we decided also to change the formula.  We are recuperating some of the volumes that were lost towards the end of last year as this change occurred.</p>
          <p>When you compare the volumes of Coca-Cola Zero now versus what we were selling last year, the volumes are very, very low compared to last year.  Obviously, we have the effect of the big introduction during last year and now it's a product that has been in the market for a year and that's has a little bit of effect.  But, there is no question that the sweetener events have cost a good number of cases in the case of Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any sense of year-on-year the delta that's associated with the change in the launch from Big Cola or maybe even a sense, how much of the 30 basis point decline is just the cycling against the launch of Zero last year, in terms of the expense ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, I don't have that specific information right with me. Let me check with <mark type="inaudible" /> he's with me, he will check the numbers and see. Certainly there were more expenses last year.  But I don't think that the whole effect is related to the expenses related to Coca-Cola Zero last year versus what we have right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Lore Serra from Morgan Stanley.  You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Good morning.  I just wanted to ask about the change in disclosure, and I think that in general it's not positive when people or companies rather move from more disclosure to less disclosure.  Given the inflation differences and given the currency differences, do you recognize that by making this move you're making it more difficult for analysts and investors to understand your company? And given that, why would you make a decision like this to change the disclosure so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Lore, I fully recognize that this is going to be a very difficult year, especially with the transition of going into inflationary and non-inflationary accounting that we have followed from the Mexican Accounting Standards.  Certainly I recognize that we're complicating things much more by closing off some of the information.  At the end of the day, the decision was taken because we believe that given the dynamics that we have in each of our countries, that this is at the end in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>This is the way we manage our business, this is the way we present the information to our board of directors.  And recognizing that this is a difficult year with all the movements that we have in terms of comparing G&amp;A with the compared numbers, the decision was taken, because as I mentioned, managing all of these, we felt this was in the best interest of the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I'm not a big fan of guidance, but then why don't you issue guidance, because it's extremely difficult from our end to forecast Latincentro.  You can appreciate when you got all the different cross currencies in your different franchises.  So, if you're going to pull back on information, why don't you support the investment community by giving guidance then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lore, point well taken. Let me think about that. But I mean the policy of the company has been for many years to steer away from providing very specific guidance. We basically give some information or guidance with respect to volume and CapEx numbers, and sometimes some of the pricing environment that we see. And I'm sure that everyone would understand, that is the standard, this is in the best interest of the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask actually a slightly unusual question related to the debt structure. Can you give us a bit of an idea of the floating rate that you have, how much of that's related, if any, to LIBOR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the U.S. dollar rates, most of this, what we have in float is in the case of U.S. dollars, most we have a special portion, which is floating. Don't know the number exactly, but it is somewhere around 60%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And all of that is basically based on LIBOR.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In which case, given that we've seen the pretty big step up in LIBOR and some controversy around the calculation of it, is it that something that might influence the way you structure your debt, or the degree to which you try to fix out that or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we constantly monitor if there is an opportunity to hedge either the currency or the rates, and we have a couple of people that are basically looking all day about that, and we are monitoring those movements closely and we'd certainly act accordingly if we feel that there is an opportunity to move in that direction. What has basically happened to us lately is that although spreads have &#x2013; often in case we need additional &#x2013; in case we were looking for additional resources, the base rate spreads have lowered substantially. So we have broadly &#x2013; we work to look for new money during this year, but it would be a bit more expensive than last year. So broadly similar to what we have two or three years ago because of the low base from where we are calculating the spreads now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear though, my understanding is that the base rate itself has actually reset higher because of this calculation this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the case of LIBOR &#x2013; in the case of LIBOR, sorry. What I'm trying to say is if you were to &#x2013; and we have also our financing in place. And so we are not looking for any refinancing, whatever, just trying to comment. If we were to looking for additional money in this year, the all-in rate will be a little more expensive than 2007 but broadly similar to what we have in 2005, the ordering rate -.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given your existing debt, I guess is my question, that resets?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The existing rate would broadly would have some, yes, you are right.  On that portion of the U.S. dollar of United States, which is around 40% of our indebtedness and on 60% of that, we basically have a floating rate, that is based into LIBOR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we're talking basically a quarter of your debt here, roughly, that is exposed to this LIBOR increase.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Robarts from Santander. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi everybody. I missed the early part of this call so hopefully this question hasn't been asked or if so I apologize. Going to just the PET trends, I wanted to understand a little bit more there the Mercosur, versus non-Mercosur, the lower cost in Mercosur, can we assume that it's for PET, strictly the, a currency issue? And what was the kind of magnitude of Mexico and Latincentro and then kind of the synthesis here is what was your PET consolidated cost movement in the first quarter and what do you think it might be on average for the year if you could give us a range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alex. Let me give you some flavor here on them. In general PET prices when you compare first quarter versus what we have the first quarter of last year. In general I'll say that PET has increased around 8% in dollar terms. What has happened is that in countries like Brazil or Colombia where you have a very strong appreciation of the currency &#x2013; the local currency around 16% in the case of Colombia and around 14% in the case of Brazil. When you translate the cost of PET bottles into the local currency that is available in the financial statements that we have, we have a natural reduction on those two quarters in the cost of PET.</p>
          <p>Going forward given the oil prices that we're seeing our specialists are indicating toward that we should be expecting somewhere around 5% increases on PET during the next few quarters. And that's pretty much the environment that we see with that and obviously depending on the each currency and how that behaves going forward.  You might end up having even though you might have a higher PET pricing in dollars, you may end up having a similar or even lower cost of PET in local currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 5% on average this year is a consolidated number for you in pesos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I'm saying is that first quarter we have already an 8% increase in dollar terms and we will expect another 5% in dollar terms for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But then for example in Mexico where the currency has appreciated a little bit instead of &#x2013; I don't know if the total effect in dollars is 12 or 13% in Mexico probably will be, effect will be 10% because we have a appreciation of 2, 3% in the currency. And in the case of Brazil that has a very strong re-evaluation of the real then the PET cost in local currency will be lower than what it was last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that clear, Alex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's helpful and I guess in this new era of disclosure here maybe I can kind of go a little bit further vis-a-vis sweetener and is there a way that you can kind of give us a sense of where the sweetener would go this year on a consolidated basis and right now today on a consolidated basis how much are you sugar versus high fructose? I mean obviously there are certain countries that are a lot more geared to either one, but do you have that number break down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me give you some trends that we have here. In general, we have seen a very stable sweetener cost environment and in countries like Mexico seeing an important reduction, as I said here in the conference around 10% reduction versus the same quarter last year. We are using in Mexico a mix close to 50% high fructose and 50% sugar and we are seeing cost of these two products coming down during this quarter and we don't hear a specific hike in the cost of the sweeteners going forward.  We see a little bit of risk with respect to high fructose because of all their relation with corn and corn prices, but the environment in Mexico, remember that the Mexico has a very, very high cost for sweeteners. The environment in Mexico &#x2013; I feel positive about that for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>In the other countries we have a Brazil situation where we have prices very similar to what we had in the first quarter of last year, but they are higher than what we had during the fourth quarter. So Brazil, I see a little bit more of risk of prices of sweetener going up from there a bit, because that's much linked to the international price.</p>
          <p>In other countries like Argentina, we use basically 100% high fructose. And in there we have suffered little bit on the increase on seasonal prices on the high fructose. Basically we have seen somewhere around 4 or 5% increase quarter &#x2013; first quarter versus the same quarter of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in general, then to conclude, do you think that this first quarter, H&#xE9;ctor, had among &#x2013; might have the highest raw materials pressure year-on-year? Or the lowest? Or we still kind of &#x2013; it's too early to say kind of this quarter versus the rest of the year in aggregate what the margin pressure is coming from raw materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Given all these I agree that this quarter is very favorable with respect to raw materials. Because we have a very important improvement in the cost of our sweeteners that more than compensated the second step up in concentrate cost in Mexico, that was announced 2.5 years ago, something like that. And also the increases in PET that were not that significant in some of the countries because of translation &#x2013; because of the weakness of the dollar versus some of the other currencies. So I would say that in general, we now have a very favorable environment in this quarter with respect to raw materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, and then the last thing just on the kind of switching to Jugos del Valle and I understand how you've explained it to us, which is that the difference of accounting vis-a-vis the mom-and-pop channel and the supermarket modern channel, and your interest in really putting back a lot of profit into SG&amp;A.  Is it &#x2013; can you give us a sense this year, whether at the EBITDA level, the Jugos del Valle business for you would be net accretive in EBITDA or would it be breakeven or might we see EBITDA being positive in aggregate from that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex, let me try to explain this. In general, the model that we are using in Jugos del Valle is that modern trade is being shared by Jugos del Valle centrally and all the bottlers, our shareholders, these companies &#x2013; and The Coca-Cola Company as 50% owner of that company. So at the end of the day, once we finalize all the transfer of shares, Coca-Cola FEMSA will own around 20% of this company, which is called Jugos del Valle. We will be in charge of manufacturing; we will be in charge of selling through the modern freight.</p>
          <p>The profit that we arrived from that portion of selling through the modern freight will be reflected as a purely equity matter, because we will have a 20% equity participation and that will be below the operating income line, and the other expense of their income line.</p>
          <p>With respect to the traditional channel, even the fact that this is a transition year where we have to finalize the acquisition of the company do the integration with all the rest of the bottlers, and because of some tax planning reasons also, the spit up of the different companies that will serve each of the different 13 bottlers in Mexico will have their own companies &#x2013; their own piece of the company that would serve the traditional channel and they will share it 50/50 with The Coca-Cola Company <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>What I am trying to say is that this first year, which is a transition year, because of the fact that we would like to reinvest most of the profits back to invest behind the brands and to completely redo the manufacturing facilities that were in a messy situation, we are putting in state of the art technology so that we can bring a lot of innovation with new products and everything. The decision was taken that all the profits this year would stay in Jugos del Valle, which is the company that we own 20%. Whatever profit we have here in 2008 will not be reflected in EBITDA level, will be reflected on the other income or expense line, as an equity participation.</p>
          <p>My sense is that starting probably May of next year, that model would change so that each of the individual bottlers going to start having profits reflecting in the operating income on the EBITDA of their P&amp;L and sharing that with The Coca-Cola Company in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So this first-year, basically from April, May of this year to April, May of 2009, you will see a strange effect because you will have volumes reflected in your bottle figures. You will have revenue in your P&amp;L, but you basically have cost of transfer pricing that is very similar to the revenue figure that you have, except for what is actually the cost of these typical distributables. So, we basically would breakeven during this year, when you look at the P&amp;L of Coca-Cola FEMSA or each of the other bottlers.</p>
