        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Josie, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us again for this early morning call. We appreciated your feedback following last quarter's early call. And I think it was very positive. So I think we'll continue with this format going forward.</p>
          <p>After another challenging year for banks worldwide, RBC stands apart as a globally significant strong and stable institution. In 2009 we generated cash net income of over $5 billion, up 8% from last year. Reported net income was 3.9 billion, down $700 million mainly due to the $1 billion of goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, last year's numbers included the reversal of the Enron-related litigation provision of $250 million. This quarter we earned $1.2 billion, up 10% from a year ago reflecting strong performance from Canadian Banking, Capital Markets, Wealth Management and Insurance.</p>
          <p>Excluding our items &#x2013; the items on slide six, our earnings were $1.5 billion or $1.03 per share. Our ability to deliver strong performance throughout 2009 demonstrates the value of our franchise, the strength of our diversified business mix, our disciplined approach to cost management and our commitment to maintaining a solid financial profile.</p>
          <p>Like all institutions around the world, we faced significant headwinds through the year from challenging economic and market conditions. Historically, low interest rates, high credit cost, write-downs and accounting volatility made for an unusual environment.</p>
          <p>In response, we undertook a number of initiatives to address these external challenges head on and fortify our financial position. We built up our capital base and closed the year with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 13%, up from 9% a year ago and tangible common equity ratio of 9.2%, up from 6.5% last year.</p>
          <p>We executed on our cost initiatives by containing spend and discovering new ways to be more efficient while at the same time driving growth across our businesses. This is particularly evident in Canadian Banking where we grew our business while reducing cost by 1%.</p>
          <p>We exited specific businesses to redeploy capital in areas where we could generate significant returns. For example, we quickly moved to contain certain non-performing Capital Markets businesses to focus our attention and resources on strengthening our core capabilities and expanding outside of Canada. We also reduced exposure in our available-for-sale portfolio and as a result our portfolio reflects a net unrealized gain compared to a net realized loss that we had in prior quarters.</p>
          <p>It's worth pointing out that the net unrealized losses in the portfolio peaked at $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Today we have a net unrealized gain of over $60 million. We are now in an extremely strong competitive position relative to many financial institutions around the globe that are dealing with capital constraints, government ownership and new regulatory hurdles.</p>
          <p>Our strong balance sheet and diversified business model combined with our risk management and financial performance have given us an unprecedented range of opportunities to invest and grow our businesses while others are more constrained. Our pursuit of three long-term goals shown on slide eight has guided the plans and activities of each of our businesses for several years and going forward.</p>
          <p>These goals are in Canada, to be the undisputed leader in financial services. In the U.S., to be a leading provider of capital markets, wealth management, and banking services by building and leveraging our considerable capabilities. And outside of North America, to be a premier provider of select capital markets, wealth management, and banking services in markets of choice.</p>
          <p>These goals are supported by seven key elements that are the foundation for our strategy. We believe these factors outlined on slide nine differentiate RBC as an organization and create a sustainable competitive advantage that will build upon our 2009 success and drive further momentum across our enterprise.</p>
          <p>I would like to briefly review our progress that we've made in 2009 in each of our businesses. Canadian Banking performed extremely well and continued to underpin our results. Our ability to drive strong results during these current economic conditions speaks to the earning power and strength of our Canadian retail franchise. We generated double-digit volume growth across many of our retail product lines.</p>
          <p>For example, we grew deposits by 11%, residential mortgages by 9%, and business loans and personal loans by eight and 21% respectively. This strong growth was muted by the rise in credit provisions resulting from a weakened economy as well as compressed margins reflecting historically low interest rates.</p>
          <p>I would once again remind you that each of our reported segments absorbs the full cost of running its business, which not only provides an accurate picture of performance, it also incents the appropriate business decisions. Despite these headwinds, we increased our market share, expanded our distribution capabilities, improved our overall operational efficiency on a reduced cost base.</p>
          <p>I would note our core deposit market share was up 100 basis points and we had record net account openings. We launched several significant transformational initiatives to enhance sales and service productivities while streamlining and automating processes. This drove an efficiency ratio of 47.8% and operating leverage of close to 4% this year.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will continue to leverage our size and scale to grow and drive our efficiency ratio towards the low 40s, which should fuel superior earnings leverage as the Canadian economy recovers.</p>
          <p>Our results in Wealth Management were down modestly from last year mainly due to lower average fee-based client assets as well as spread compression. In this environment, we leveraged our strength and stability to build our capabilities by attracting close to 160 client-facing professionals across our Canadian, U.S. and International businesses and enhancing our product and service offerings.</p>
          <p>Our growth in advisors was particularly strong in the U.S. where we are the sixth largest full-service brokerage firm with a presence in 42 states. We had a record year of recruiting experienced advisors from competitors who were more challenged by market conditions.</p>
          <p>We continue to be the leading wealth management and asset management company in Canada. Our full-service wealth management business continued to extend its lead, ending the year with over $174 billion of assets under administration.</p>
          <p>With the improvement in equity markets and investor confidence in the latter half of 2009, we began to see asset values recover and money flow back in the long term funds. As the largest mutual fund company in Canada with 16% market share, we continue to lead the mutual fund industry with close to $100 billion in mutual fund assets under administration as of October 31, 2009.</p>
          <p>With our strategic acquisitions over the past few years and the record growth of the number of experienced client facing professionals to more than 4,500 worldwide, our Wealth Management segment is in excellent position to deliver strong organic growth.</p>
          <p>The current environment has also presented significant acquisition opportunities for this business and we will continue to consider suitable transactions outside of Canada in our Global Asset Management and International Wealth Management businesses.</p>
          <p>Our Insurance business continued to make solid contributions to our diversified earnings stream and complement our retail product offering. We are unique in that we offer a full suite of solutions for both business and personal clients and we're the only Canadian insurer with an integrated manufacturing and distribution capabilities.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we had growth in all of our insurance businesses. We also recognized &#x2013; are also recognized to be more responsive to client's needs and added 14 Canadian retail insurance branches to our network. Going forward, we will build on our insurance capabilities, deepen client relationships and streamline processes to make it even easier for our clients to do business with us.</p>
          <p>In International Banking, our U.S. banking business continued to be affected by the weak economic conditions. We are restructuring this business to improve client service and achieve greater operational efficiency and as Morten will explain asset quality metrics are showing some signs of stabilization.</p>
          <p>In our Caribbean banking operation, we are successfully integrating the RBTT acquisitions with the goal of establishing a common operating platform to support growth in the region. Our biggest opportunity in international banking is a turnaround from this year's losses.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital markets, our performance has been truly exceptional with net income increasing 51% from a year ago, not withstanding losses of about 650 million after-tax from market related activities. While the other banks have cut back the capital they commit to this business, we have been prudently managing our balance sheet and have continued to invest by attracting almost 400 talented professionals in building teams to strengthen our global capabilities. We are now seeing the results of these initiatives including market share gains across a number of our businesses.</p>
          <p>As Canada's only truly global investment bank we have taken advantage of opportunities around the world. With approximately two-thirds of our capital market staff located internationally, we are able to offer our clients the benefit of both our Canadian leadership and our global reach.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we increased clients in our investment banking and trading businesses. Most of these clients were outside of Canada which is in line with our global growth strategy. Further our focused client approach is enabling us to increase our product penetration with existing customers.</p>
          <p>Undoubtedly our trading businesses have benefited from favorable conditions throughout most of the year including market volatility and wider credit spreads. However, our success also reflects investments that we have made over the last five years that are paying off.</p>
          <p>We made investments in infrastructure and talent in the U.S. and as a result we have increased market share across several businesses, including investment banking, municipal finance and built a significant U.S. dollar fixed income and currency business.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we became the only Canadian bank to be designated the U.S. primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York allowing us to participate in U.S. treasury auction. This status demonstrates the strength of our U.S. fixed income trading business and provides us with a broader product offering to better serve our clients around the world.</p>
          <p>We are also gaining ground in a number of our global and trading businesses and our global data origination franchise. Our fixed income and energy and mining businesses are global leaders.</p>
          <p>In the latter part of 2009 when market stabilized and we started to see higher levels of origination activity our leadership position in investment banking was evident. This year we are the number one in Canada for equity and debt underwriting and M&amp;A. Gross underwriting and advisory fees were up 20% from last year and we were awarded a number of key mandate.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, trading results were likely moderate from 2009 as volatility subsides and spreads move closer to pre-crisis levels. Improving market conditions and economy condition should result in lower write-downs, however, in our trading books and lower credit losses in our corporate loan book and should provide a better operating environment for investment banking activity.</p>
          <p>Overall our performance this year was strong and I am certainly proud of the many accomplishments we have achieved. Nearly all of our businesses performed very well both on an absolute basis and a relative basis to their primary competitors.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14, we measure our performance against the set of medium-term objectives that align with our long-term strategy. This year we continue to make progress towards these objectives and delivered strong shareholder returns, although weak economic and market conditions and the actions to strengthen our capital position certainly hurt our EPS and return on equity.</p>
          <p>Our defined operating leverage for 2009 was 3.5%, reflecting an exceptional revenue growth and effective cost management. Overall we achieved strong value for our shareholders with top quartile performance with three and five year total shareholder returns at 8% and 16% respectively. We are maintaining our quarterly dividend at $0.50 which we believe is prudent given the current environment.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2010, we remain committed to these medium term objectives. With regard to our operating outlook, we expect our businesses to benefit modestly from recovery in Canadian and global economies. Credit quality is expected to remain under pressure with some improvement in the latter half of 2010. We project global capital markets will continue to stabilize and credit spreads will tighten further as the global economic recovery continues and access to credit improves.</p>
          <p>In the next five years leaders in the financial services sector in my view will to be defined by their ability to successfully manage through regulatory reform. Our capital strength, low leverage ratio and business mix combined, provide a great competitive advantage over other global competitors that will be required to shrink their balance sheets and change their business strategies in response to regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>In closing, RBC continued to produce solid results in a difficult environment and I'm proud of the way we managed and grew our businesses. I believe our leading market position, diversified business mix and our prudent actions to address challenges head-on and strengthen our balance sheets served us well in 2009 and will continue to be key advantages going forward.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our strong balance sheet and capital base will enable us to invest in key business areas as well as explore potential acquisitions that meet our strict economic, strategic and cultural criteria. We are now one of the better positioned financial institutions in the world, but we are certainly not complacent. If anything our experience in 2009 has reinforced our sense of urgency about improving the way we deliver products and services and ensuring our infrastructure is flexible to meet the needs of both our clients and our growing businesses.</p>
          <p>Throughout these remarkable times, what has struck me most is the outstanding commitments of our employees around the world in helping our clients and I would certainly thank them for their efforts.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the meeting over to Morten.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gordon. Turning to credit on slides 17 to 21, overall provisions for credit losses increased $113 million over last quarter. Specific provisions for credit losses remain elevated reflecting the economic environment, but were stable compared to last quarter. A slight increase this quarter relates primarily to our corporate lending portfolio, and provisions of $28 million resulting from the reclassification of certain impaired available-for-sale debt securities for loans which I will discuss in a moment.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we added $156 million to the general provision, predominantly relating to our U.S. banking and Canadian unsecured and business portfolios. This compares to $61 million last quarter largely in the U.S. banking. The increase in the general provision reflects ongoing weakness in the economies in which we operate despite stable specific provisions this quarter.</p>
          <p>This quarter we reclassified certain available-for-sale and held-for-trading debt securities for loans in accordance with amendments to CICA Sections 3855. Available for sale debt securities held at year end that are not quoted in active markets have an estimated fair value of $11 billion and includes certain auction rate securities, U.S. non-agency MBS and government and corporate debt.</p>
          <p>The majority of the debt securities that are not quoted in the active &#x2013; in active markets remain in available-for-sale debt securities and fair value exceeds book value or we intend to hold until their fair values recover to book value.</p>
          <p>The fair value of reclassified securities was $871 million in our primarily non-agency U.S. mortgage backed securities in our international banking segment. These securities were reclassified as they are not quoted in active markets, had previously incurred significant loan credit related losses and we intend not to sell them in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>As a result of the reclassification, these securities will be assessed using the impairment model for loans thereby eliminating accounting volatility related to liquidity discounts. With these changes our reporting is now more closely aligned to IFRS and U.S GAAP Accounting Standards. The reclassification had an impact on our credit quality metrics, most of which are shown on slide 19. Specific provisions increased by $28 million in the fourth quarter and $67 million for the year, specific PCL ratio was four basis points higher in the fourth quarter and two basis point higher for the year as a result of the reclassification. Those impaired loans at the end of the year were $1.14 billion higher and gross impaired loans as a percentage of average loans was 38 basis points higher. Our total coverage ratio at the end of the year was 61% after the reclassification, down from 72% on a pre-reclassification basis. Further details on the reclassification can be found in our 2009 Annual Report.</p>
          <p>Before I go into credit performance by business segment, let me touch on a couple of items I've addressed in prior quarters. Our U.S. Insurance and Pension solutions business in capital markets provides stable value contract from bank owned life insurance policies purchased by banks and groups of eligible employees. We no longer originate these policies. For the year, we recognized losses of $111 million, almost all of which were related to one contract that invest &#x2013; that is invested in both leveraged and unleveraged strategies. This contract was restructured to remove the economic consequences of an early surrender of the policy by establishing a fixed maturity date and the notional value.</p>
          <p>The fair value of our estimated payments under the restructured contract debt maturity is $250 million which has been fully recognized as a loss.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we also refined our valuation on the specific monoline insurer to ensure that we are appropriately reserved despite near-term positive volatility in credit spread and underlying asset values. The near-term positive movements resulted in a gain in the fourth quarter. To date, we have taken significant cumulative credit valuation adjustments against our exposure and believe that we are adequately provisioned.</p>
          <p>Turning to credit performance, overall this quarter, asset quality metrics in most of our U.S. portfolios and our Canadian credit card portfolio continued to show signs of stabilization. However, our corporate loan portfolio, particularly in the U.S., continues to be impacted by the economic environment.</p>
          <p>In our Canadian Banking segment, the decrease of $26 million in provisions from last quarter was largely due to lower provisions in our business lending portfolio. Performance in the remaining portfolios was consistent with last quarter. Credit card with specific provisions as a percentage of average loans remained flat at 467 basis points as loss rates due to bankruptcies remained high but stable over the last quarter.</p>
          <p>In International Banking, provisions were flat from the prior quarter reflecting lower provisions in our U.S. banking commercial and residential builder finance portfolios as a result of stabilizing asset quality. Early signs of U.S. economic recovery and lower new impaired loans resulting from a general reduction in the residential builder finance portfolio contributed to the stabilization of provisions.</p>
          <p>These decreases were largely offset by increased provisions of $27 million related to the impaired available-for-sale securities reclassified as loans I mentioned earlier. In the Caribbean, provisions increased slightly as the economy continue to be negatively impacted by slowing tourism and rising unemployment.</p>
          <p>Capital Markets-specific provisions increased $43 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to a few impaired loans in our U.S. corporate lending portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2010, credit quality will likely be driven by economic conditions and will continue to impact our consolidated results as credit losses historically come off the peak one year after the trough of the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>In Canada, we expect credit quality to remain under pressure with some improvement in the latter half of 2010 as we anticipate the unemployment rate will peak early in the year. Credit quality is expected to be &#x2013; continue to be weak in the U.S. but should improve through 2010 as we're coming off a high level of credit losses in 2009 and anticipate improvements in consumer and business spending and modest gains in labor and housing markets in 2010. Further detail on economic and market outlook is discussed in detail in our 2009 Annual Report.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risks, we had one day of large net trading gains which arose primarily from credit valuation adjustments. This reflects improvements in global capital markets and moderated volatility in the latter part of the year.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the presentation over to Janice Fukakusa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. As Gordon mentioned, our fourth quarter net income was up 10% over last year, reflecting strong revenue growth and our ongoing commitment to prudent cost management.</p>
          <p>We look at our expenses net of variable compensation. Compared to last year our expenses were relatively flat after taking into account the impact of foreign exchange reflecting the average depreciation of the Canadian Dollar, the full year expenses from acquisition and last year's reduction in the Enron-related litigation provision.</p>
          <p>All of our businesses currently have initiatives underway spanning two to three years to reduce our discretionary costs and transform our cost base. Examples of these initiatives include reducing complexity in the organization through process redesign, streamlining workflow to enhance efficiency and improve the client experience and simplifying sales and service processes through automation.</p>
          <p>Before discussing our segment results, I'll touch on a few points. This quarter we had losses related to available-for-sale securities which reduced earnings by $150 million. Also a provision related to the restructuring of certain Caribbean banking mutual funds reduced earnings by $39 million.</p>
          <p>As background, these funds were trading at a fixed par value despite changes in the underlying asset values and are now being transitioned to a floating net asset value, which is more in line with international standards. We injected cash and provided a guarantee to the funds to allow unit holders sufficient time to adjust to these revised practices.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these items, we witnessed the continued stabilization of capital markets this quarter with improved investor confidence and more favorable funding markets. As a result, credit spreads for us and many issuers continued to tighten. Credit spreads are now close to pre-crisis levels and going forward, we expect to see more normal levels compared to the extraordinary volatility of the past 18 months.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to slide 23 and 24 for a look at the performance of our five business segments. Starting with Canadian Banking, net income was up 6% from last year and 7% from last quarter, mainly driven by revenue growth across most businesses and very strong operating leverage of 5.6%. Specific provisions were up from last year mainly due to weaker economic conditions, but were down from last quarter as Morten mentioned.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 25, you can see we experienced margin expansion from last quarter, largely reflecting improved lending spread. When the absolute level of rates increases, we should benefit from further margin expansion. Further, we were the last bank to reprice our unsecured lending portfolio, so we would expect to see some impact in our margins in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to wealth management, net income was 39% higher over last year as last year included provisions related to the reserve primary fund and the auction-rate securities settlement with U.S. regulators. Higher transaction volumes reflecting improved market conditions were partially offset by spread compressions and lower average fee-based client assets.</p>
          <p>Net income was down 4% compared to last quarter, mainly due to a lower gain on our stock-based compensation plan in our U.S. brokerage business. This was largely offset by higher average fee-based client assets and higher transaction volumes reflecting improved market condition. Insurance net income was $104 million, up $45 million over last year as last year included investment losses.</p>
          <p>Business growth largely in our European life reinsurance business also contributed to this quarter's increase. Net income decreased $63 million from last quarter largely due to unfavorable actuarial adjustments in the current quarter, reflecting management actions and our annual assumptions changes.</p>
          <p>International Banking net loss of $125 million compares to a net loss of $206 million last year, reflecting lower market environment related losses on our available-for-sale portfolio. This compares to a net loss of $95 million last quarter, reflecting the current quarter provision relating to the restructuring of the Caribbean banking mutual funds I mentioned earlier. This was partly offset by lower market environment-related losses on our available-for-sale portfolio, and a decrease in FDIC costs due to the special assessment levied against all U.S. banks in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income for capital markets was $561 million, down $23 million from last year as last year included the $252 million reduction of Enron related litigation provisions net of related compensation adjustments. This quarter, capital markets generated stronger trading revenue compared to last year, particularly in our U.S. based equity and global fixed income businesses. We also recorded total market environment related gains as compared to losses last year and higher equity origination fees. These were partially offset by higher variable compensation and increased specific provisions.</p>
          <p>Compared to last quarter, net income was flat. We had lower trading revenues in certain businesses which were impacted by the lower volatility in credit spreads. Offsetting these factors were market environment related gains compared to losses in the prior quarter, improved equity origination activity and higher M&amp;A fees. In fact, our equity new issue and M&amp;A fees in Canada were at near record levels in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 26 illustrates RBC's total trading revenue. We continue to have strong trading revenue in traditional, less-structured fixed income products such as bonds, money markets and interest rate derivatives, driven by favorable market conditions, increasing client activity, and tighter credit spreads. Our equity and foreign exchange revenues were lower than last year due to decreased volatility and volume.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin questions and answers. Please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue, so that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Operator?</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. A question, I think for Mark Standish. Some of your peers in Canada and as well in the U.S. have had some pretty &#x2013; felt some pretty dramatic normalization effects in interest rate trading, but your number held quite steady in Q4. So can you give us an update on your thoughts on sustainability specifically for the fixed income trading division? I saw that the equity number was down a fair bit this quarter. Is it a forgone conclusion that we should see a fair bit of weakness here in 2010? And separately, can we read anything into the higher levels of trading assets in Q4 versus the third quarter? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Steve. Let me take those one at a time. In terms of sort of distribution of trading revenues, probably if I give you some numbers it might help. If I look at the last quarter, trading revenues came from 28% in Canada, 42% in the U.S. and 30% in Europe and Asia, so I think we've got tremendous geographic distribution in our trading business and particular in our FIG business. As Gord mentioned, obviously we expect some moderation in trading revenues. Q4 was a great quarter for us. During the quarter, July was a stronger month relative to October as things have clearly sort of tailed off. But they seem to have &#x2013; levels seemed to have sort of normalized for us and clearly it's going to be new normal level for us. We continue to see very strong market gains and that is, as I said, that's a geographic thing, not just a Canadian market thing.</p>
          <p>Another way of explaining I think or demonstrating where we are today versus where we were couple of years ago is since we became a primary dealer in the U.S. in July of '06, we've seen our volume in U.S. Treasuries up over 71% and that's really opened a lot of doors for us with respect to new clients. In the U.K., for example, we've seen a tremendous growth in our various trading businesses there, in particular our gilt business. And we know the market volume numbers, we get those from the Bank of England and the Debt Office, but we're not allowed to disclose them, but we can clearly see significant gains.</p>
          <p>I think a good way of demonstrating that is in October the British government issued a 2060 gilt issue. It was a &#xA3;7 billion issue and we were one of only four book runners on that deal and that's clearly a huge success for a Canadian investment bank and clearly gives, I think, a good indication of where we are in that marketplace. And then in terms of sort of inventory levels, because we are more active today in government securities, be it gilts, be it U.S. Treasuries, to support both of those businesses, clearly we're carrying higher inventories specifically in government securities be it gilts and be it U.S. Treasuries, so I think that would explain that.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Just wanted to follow-up with respect to Morten's comments and I'm looking at page 29 of the Zip pack. And looking at the acceleration with respect to impaired formations on wholesale, and Morten, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more. You seem constructive on credit cards and certain parts of U.S. banking, but the wholesale portfolios, both in Canada and in the U.S. continue to have accelerating impairments. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on maybe sectors that are coming into your watch list? Any kind of help here would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll give that a shot. I mean, if you look at impaired formations, we are up slightly this quarter from last quarter, but down from the peak earlier in the year. So, I mean, I think, the underlying economy having shown some signs of having hit the bottom, my anticipation is that impaired formations should be stable to hopefully slightly improving as we go through 2010.</p>
          <p>If you look at the various parts of the wholesale portfolios starting with the positives first, if you look at the Canadian commercial portfolio is actually performing extremely well. And if you look at the underlying stats you can see business bankruptcies across the country, I guess, with the exception of Ontario, are actually still showing a downward trend and quite a contrast to what you see on the personal side. And I think that has been driving very strong performance both in terms of impairments and loss rates on our Canadian commercial portfolio.</p>
          <p>So most of the issues that we've had both in terms of impairments and provisions in the wholesale portfolio relate to the U.S. And I think the story on our RBC Bank portfolio is fairly well worn if you like, and I think the facts there, I think are well understood, but we are seeing; we've seen significant improvement quarter-over-quarter in the commercial portfolio within RBC Bank. But overall impairments obviously remain high, and I think we've got some quarters to go before we see significant overall improvements in that book.</p>
          <p>The biggest driver of the quarter-over-quarter performance in wholesale has been issues in our corporate book. As I said primarily in the U.S., the nature of that book is that it's fairly lumpy. We've had as you saw an overall increase in provisions of $43 million quarter-over-quarter paralleling a fairly significant jump in the impaired category in that business.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; you can actually see on the sector pieces here where from a real estate standpoint you're seeing that our overall assets are down quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by a fairly focused effort within RBC Bank of driving down real estate assets. You've got some issues in non-bank financial services reflecting a couple of quite large loans having gone impaired. And I would say as a footnote some of those have actually been close to fully hedged, but we're obviously we have taken the gains on the hedges prior to them starting to write the provisions this quarter. So from an economic standpoint, you end up getting a slightly distorted view of how lumpy the issues are.</p>
          <p>In terms of inflow to our watch list and impaired in corporate banking, it's dangerous to work off snapshots, if you like. But as in the fourth quarter, we had from &#x2013; we had a reasonable number of new loans going impaired. The pipeline behind those particular assets is actually very skinny. So making a judgment based on an end of October, early November snapshot, the corporate portfolio actually looks like it actually is not showing any signs of &#x2013; they continue to perform at the kind of the levels you've seen in this quarter or the previous quarter. But given the economic conditions there is obviously a fair amount of uncertainty on that; it doesn't take a large number of loans for both provisions and impaired levels to bump back up again. But I would say, overall the performance on wholesale in terms of impaireds and provisions reflect a much more negative scenario than my personal outlook is for the next couple of quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gordon, I appreciate that color. Janice, I just wanted a follow up, I may have missed this on your comments with the AFS securities losses during the quarter. I think we're in an environment where spreads have tightened and asset values have increased, so I was very surprised to see the losses and you're highlighting it due to market environment. So if you can give us a little bit color on the underlying assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jim. If you look at our AFS portfolio, you will have seen that we had a category called equities that was significantly underwater for an extended period of time. And so, when we look at the equities, and in particular some Canadian securities that were underwater because of the duration they were underwater and fact that they're in liquid markets, we made the accounting call to impair those securities. So we've significantly taken down the equity risk in our AFS portfolio, and that's why you see net unrealized gains there because of the spread tightening on the &#x2013; a lot of the fixed income securities they're taking down the equity risk.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It looks like in the U.S. banking outside of residential mortgages, we're seeing a bit of an uptick on lending volume. And Jim, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind giving us what your outlook is for lending in the U.S. on the retail side, outside of real estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, John. Well, certainly, we think that most of the sectors have bottomed out and we are seeing modest improvements. And I think that Morten's comments are pretty reflective of our view of the market. We certainly think that a modest growth would be our expectation, that there's still some underlying economics there that need to improve before we'll see substantial gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And if I may, Gord, we're sitting at 13% Tier 1 capital ratio and a tangible common equity ratio which probably would have been acceptable three years ago as a Tier 1. Is this Royal being ultraconservative heading into a period of regulatory change or is this also an environment where it's difficult to deploy capital as we're seeing risk-weighted assets on the credit side actually decline sequentially for the past couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, I think the answer is it's a combination of both. I think that, as I said in my comments that I think navigating the regulatory environment over the next couple of years is going to be a major undertaking for all banks around the world and we want to go into that in as fortressed a position as we possibly can because we think it will provide us good opportunities to deploy capital into the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of that deployment today &#x2013; as we've said in the past, we're certainly looking to deploy capital in each of our businesses. We potentially would look to make investments if we found ones that were attractive and met our various hurdles and our various criteria. It is a challenged environment to do that given not so much the lack of availability I would say, in terms of opportunities, there is probably never been more incoming calls than there are today. But given the regulatory uncertainty, given the capital uncertainty going forward in terms of bank measurements we certainly are going to maintain a very cautious position as we sort of look at different opportunities.</p>
          <p>We do think there is an ability to deploy capital as I said in each of our existing businesses, so again we are doing it. Each business is slightly different. Capital markets we have had the opportunity to expand and grow our businesses, but we've actually shrunk our balance sheet over the last year in that business and again that's been really more a story of redeploying capital. We freed up a lot of capital from aggressively managing our balance sheet, particularly in areas like structured credit and so forth, where we had &#x2013; where we were chewing up a lot of capital in underperforming businesses. And we moved &#x2013; we aggressively managed our balance sheet down in those areas.</p>
          <p>So as we look at the environment today, I think, it will be a combination of deploying capital in each of our businesses, hopefully seeing some good asset growth in Canadian banking and international banking, as well as in our capital markets platform.</p>
          <p>We will look at opportunities, but again, we are going to maintain a position of caution, simply because we think in today's environment it's the prudent thing to do. And as these regulatory rules start to come and they come in the form, as I said in my comments, it is going to force a lot of banks around the world to change their business strategies.</p>
          <p>We don't think we're going to have to change our business strategy. And we think there will be opportunities in each of our businesses to pickup share and to grow opportunities as a result of that restructuring. So we want to go into it in a very cautious position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Gord, may be I could ask that same question in a little different way, when you look at potential acquisition out there, and whether to do them or not. You are making some &#x2013; probably going to have to make some implicit assumption on what the new rules are going to be from OSFI, so are you &#x2013; do you want to share what kind of the higher capital requirements are going to be your impact on your Tier 1 is the &#x2013; is 8.5 the new 10.5, or how should we &#x2013; how should we look at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know &#x2013; and I would never speak for OSFI, but what I will tell you is that certainly every expectation we have is that there will be greater consistency between standards across the various countries and various regulators around the world. And I think that OSFI have made it very clear that, that as these new international standards are formulated whether it's new Basel rules, the new financial stability, Board rules that Canada will be consistent with what happens elsewhere.</p>
          <p>I think the $64,000 question which is difficult to answer is what are those new standards going to be? We are very confident that whatever they are, we're going to be very well positioned because of our strong capital position and our low leverage position. I think there's no question that you will see a significant increase in the capital cushion required under the new rules, whether that's &#x2013; whether that's two or 3% incrementally from where it was in the past, very difficult to judge and I would say there is &#x2013; I would say that there is not necessarily full agreement between international regulators or perhaps more appropriately governments around the world on that issue.</p>
          <p>I think we'll also going to see a leverage cap probably 25 times or in that range. But again I would stress that there is certainly not international agreement as to whether there even should be a leverage cap, let alone what that cap should be. What we've been emphasizing is that the most important thing from Canada's perspective and I think from a global safety and soundness perspective is level playing field consistency and simplicity across &#x2013; around the world. We should have clearly higher tangible common equity ratios than we've had in the past. And I think that will be a new critical ratio going forward, because I think both the market and the regulators will pay much more attention to tangible common than they will to Tier 1 from what they've done in the past.</p>
          <p>We should have a Tier 1 ratio, which is obviously significantly higher from where it was in the past, but it should be established hopefully with a degree of clarity and hopefully simplicity because there is so &#x2013; it's not just what the Tier 1 ratio is. It's what is the definition of Tier 1 and what's the definition of risk adjusted assets because there is so much discussion going on around whether it's goodwill, whether it's deferred taxes, whether it's countercyclical capital ratios. I mean the list just goes on in terms of the different things that are being looked at.</p>
          <p>So it's not just the ratio itself, it's the makeup of that ratio. Our &#x2013; what we've been emphasizing to governments and regulators is simplicity, consistency and a level playing field around the world. And I think extremely important that we have some kind of leverage cap placed on banks around the world because in my judgment that's probably the single biggest differentiator between those banks who performed well versus those that struggled in the crisis.</p>
          <p>So that's a long winded way of saying there is still a high degree of uncertainty. The one thing we can assure you is that the world will be operating with much higher capital ratios. Lower from where we are today we believe, but much higher capital ratios from where we've been and probably a leverage limit somewhere around 25 times and I think on that basis we consider ourselves well positioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gordon it also seems that the regulators are going after things that aren't necessarily capital ratio either. I mean they talk about liquidity, so keeping more liquid assets around the issue of solo capital. And I guess the only thing I can come to is that means low &#x2013; tax rates may go up, because you can have less capital in tax efficient jurisdictions. There's systemic risk &#x2013; is there &#x2013; there also the possibility that you're just going to have lower spreads or lower earning assets or higher taxes, the stuff that falls outside of the capital ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think the answer is &#x2013; and I actually gave a speech in London a couple of weeks ago, it's on our website, I encourage you to look at it. I mean I think the &#x2013; your question, the fall-out from all that, and this is the issue that governments are going to be dealing with, is that it's all &#x2013; it's great to say that we're going to have significant rule changes around liquidity, solo capital, counter cyclical capital ratios, higher capital, lower leverage, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But ultimately, the cost of that would be passed on to borrowers and to the marketplace if banks are going to continue to return &#x2013; generate the kinds of returns that are necessary to maintain their credit ratings and to maintain their confidence in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And I think that's where you're going to see this overreaction and then sort of a pullback to the middle. And I'm quite confident that we will end up with different liquidity rules and we will end up with different capital rules and we will end up with different leverage rules. But I think we'll be pushed into more reasonable positions, simply because if you were to move too far on any of those fronts, I think it would constrain capital on a global basis. And clearly that's not what governments would like to see.</p>
          <p>So I mean you're right, I mean there's probably 10 or more different components of capital make-up that are being discussed and looked at by the Basel Committee and the FSB Committee and various regulators around the world. And it's tough to comment on them with any degree of certainty other than as I say, our encouragement is to move to something in the middle that's reasonable and ensure that you've got a level playing field around the world so that the general markets aren't sort of held hostage to the lowest common denominator from a government or banking perspective in one particular jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>So I do think you'll move somewhere to the middle on this front. But there's a lot of discussions currently underway and this process isn't going to be resolved in two or three months. It's going to be an ongoing process for the next couple of years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a couple of really quick clarification questions, Morten. I couldn't remember &#x2013; I didn't hear it. I'm zeroing in on the gross impaired loans in the U.S. division. Can you just remind me how much of that is the builder financed in terms of gross impaired loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So gross impaired loans, you've got in RBC Bank overall, from a legal entity standpoint, 2.2 billion. In terms of the builder finance, it's 352 within the RBC Bank legal entity, another 486 in our &#x2013; in the real estate finance, so whatever the sum of those two numbers are. Overall, I mean from an impaired standpoint, it equates to about 45% of our builder finance assets are in the impaired categories, it's sort of roughly stable, slightly up from previous quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So what I'm trying to zero in on is, when I look at the amount of impaired loans you have in the entire U.S. and international division, it's about two to three times that of say, Regions, BB&amp;T and SunTrust. And what I'm trying to sort out is &#x2013; and you also have a very low coverage ratio. Now you mentioned that you have stabilization in the builder finance. Should I take that to mean that there were fewer impaired this quarter? Or that you're actually getting recoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a combination of factors. Let me give you a couple of statistics, because if you look at the coverage ratio for the builder finance portfolio, it's at about 14%. But it's 14% of a written down amount. If you look at our performance in terms of &#x2013; I mean, we continued to sell loans or gradually get repayments of loans in the builder finance category. So the reduction you've seen in the real estate related assets in international banking is largely a result of all of that.</p>
          <p>We've been selling &#x2013; the loans that are going off the books have been going off the books at $0.90 on the dollar thereabouts, it's now creeping down more in the 0.75 to $0.80 on the dollar. If you look at where we're carrying these loans, we have written them down significantly. So that between write-downs and current provisions, the value on the loans relative to original loan amount is in the mid-60s.</p>
          <p>So in other words, in terms of where we're currently seeing assets move off the books, we've got $0.20 or thereabout of cushion before we run out of room, so to speak. So the &#x2013; this is a decision that we took some time ago that we are not a distressed seller. We have a focused and fairly deliberate and mildly aggressive approach, trying to move the assets off the books, remove them off the books at values that are not in the &#x2013; to distressed sellers. And that's been quite successful. And the coverage ratio that we've got, we think actually given the written down amount of the loans, is appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. I think I'll follow-up with you little bit later, I'm working on a theory with respect to the U.S. but one last question I'd like to sneak in here is do you care about anything that's happening in Dubai?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're naturally interested. I mean we're in the fortunate position of not having any exposure that's affected by this. So from a Dubai standpoint, we have a de minimis amount of bank related exposure which we don't see as at all problematic, and we have no direct exposure to the entities that are involved in restructuring. And I &#x2013; obviously, if this had spread, there are other parts of the world I would be interested in, we don't see that as a likely event at this stage.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Also a quick point of clarification, on page 29 of your supplement, looking at the increase in the gross impaired loans, I want to make sure I understand what proportion of that increase from Q3 to Q4 relates to the reclassification? And I know that you have restated it historically because I can see that the supplement has changed. What I'm getting at is, how much of that relates to those specific securities that were reclassified, is it that reference you make on page 11 in your press release to $164 million?</p>

          <p>Okay, another sort of quick question. Someone referred to &#x2013; maybe perhaps it was you Janice or maybe Morten &#x2013; referred to the mono &#x2013; a gain on the mono-line in the quarter. Was that a pretty small number, I presume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was. It's in our disclosure under market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I missed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so what happened with respect to the market environment, we referred to a couple of things. We referred to the fact that with the BOLI contract that we have, that we have restructured the contract, and then the mono-line exposure that we have taken effectively a gain. And if you look at those two being the significant items, they net down to a pretty de minimis market environment impact, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, is that in the press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or is that in your MD&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in the annual MD&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, why don't we give you a disclosure map on that because it's in the annuals and it involves a little bit of taking what's disclosed last quarter, taking the delta from that. Why don't we go through that offline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've maintained a pretty conservative approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And I think that the point that we were making on the evaluation of that mono-line is that we've used a modified spread basis based on our own estimate of realization value. So we have a fairly conservative valuation methodology in looking at the value of that coverage, given that when you look, and you're looking at indicative market spreads, you may think that there is a different answer there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I just want to make sure that there wasn't some kind of gain in the quarter that wasn't specified or highlighted, but you're suggesting that the BOLI and the monoline issues offset each other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all of the market environment issues were pretty de minimis this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then very quickly, on expenses, you referred to moving to the low 40s in domestic retail from an efficiency perspective. I think Janice you referred to a two, three year project the bank is on to reduce expenses. What would be helpful to understand is, is this one of those situations where the bank works on cutting costs and at some point down the road, a year or two years from now, we see the expense line change significantly, as in drop significantly, kind of like the way it did early in 2005 or is this much more of a gradual thing, do we see all expenses sort of gradually decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, I'm going to ask Dave to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mario, it's Dave McKay. It's a good question. And I think we're focusing really on that productivity ratio and not specifically on the cost line per se, and as we've talked about, we have a couple of objectives. One, maintaining positive operating leverage, so we do focus very much on cost in relation to a revenue trajectory but as we go through a multiphase transformational program in Canadian Banking where we are looking at our end-to-end business, we are trying to drastically simplify our end-to-end business, so it should reduce and lower cost. But we always look at can we get that upside in sales productivity? So our first objective obviously is to take it on the top line and revenue growth and sales force productivity, but certainly we look at the optimization of our network over time. And you can see from our numbers that we are down FTE year-over-year as we try to optimize that. So it's going to be a combination of both, but that's why we're really focused on our productivity ratio and not actually the bottom line cost line as the sole objective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you feel like this is a gradual thing or do you figure the benefits hit at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be a gradual trajectory. We've got a multiphase approach, we're well into phase one. It's going to look at some technology implementation, so there will be step-downs as we implement new technology that simplifies and takes out some of our manual processes, so I would say it's going to be kind of a step-wise process over the next three to four years, but it's &#x2013; we have a real focus on that low 40s target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Sumit Malhotra from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This isn't my direct question, but just following on what Mario was saying originally. Janice for the gross impaired loans on the debt securities reclassification, you have a slide in the presentation, slide 19, that indicates it was 1.1 billion that got added because of the AFS. I thought the 168 or 164 was the amount of the formation. Is that accurate? Am I on the right track here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Sumit, I think that the gross amount we transferred was actually the face amount of the securities at &#x2013; I'm thinking November 1, right, 2008. So we backed that up there, and then the GIL formation you would have to look at its spot at the end of Q4, right? So, we'll take you through that. I realize this is &#x2013; it's a bit complex on the 3855. And some of the disclosures in the earnings release, some of it is in the Annual Report. So, I think that what I'm learning from this is that we need to give you guys a map of what's happening and also address Mario's question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we should rather than take it offline with one or two we should provide it to everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we will &#x2013; we'll definitely. We will provide everyone with a bit of a disclosure map of where, going into every single piece of our disclosure including the step-back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because that &#x2013; okay, I won't go too long on this. But that pre-reclassification number 4319 that doesn't tie to where you ended Q3, so I was under the impression that that was where you would have ended Q4, if it wasn't for moving the securities over, is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what it was designed to do. But it's because we did restatements in both Q1 and Q4 that &#x2013; there may be a lack of continuity, but why don't we get back to you all on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then my actual question probably for Gord, or Mark Standish might want to chime in on this as well. We certainly all accept and acknowledge and realize the fact that capital requirements for banks are going higher. The biggest surprise to me this year has been the ability of the group to re-price their cost of capital for customers so quickly. I mean, we can look at your net interest margin, which is up 20, 25 basis points from a couple of quarters. Mark, if you look at something like a trading ROA on that business, you're running at levels that are two times wider than you did in the last six years.</p>
          <p>You know. As even your largest peers in capital market are now regulated as banks globally. How much do you think of these wider spreads we've seen whether it's in the credit, whether it's in the market oriented businesses are actually structural more than just a function of low interest rates or wider spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll start off some and then Doug will add to my comments. I think this is very much structural and I think that while we're seeing a contraction right now, it's contraction driven by a huge amount of global government stimulus that's come into the market. At some point that stimulus will have to be removed. So, I think we're in a new environment where the sort of the last couple of years has been taken off in terms of overly aggressive pricing. And I do think that we'll be settling into a different environment that will be very favorable going forward.</p>
          <p>If you look around the globe, and that's one of the reasons why I highlighted the distribution of our business geographically, we're extremely well positioned in many markets where there will be a very significant amount of debt issuance and equity issuance as well as advisory work. So, I think what's happening is playing to our strengths and it's very much structural.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Doug, I would just add as well that we're seeing a fairly significant price &#x2013; re-pricing of the loan book. And how sticky that will be &#x2013; we'll have to wait and see. But I would say that the pre-2007 lending spreads, I don't see them coming back anytime soon. So there has been significant pickup on the loan credit side in the corporate loan book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's really the takeaway for me and Gordon mentioned the potential impact on risk weighting on their call last week, BMO talked about market RWA being two to three times higher. And I think we all get that. The interesting phenomenon here is how quickly the banking system as a whole particularly obviously here, I can talk to Canada, has been able to re-price that risk capital this year. And from what you're saying if your market &#x2013; if your costs are going to be higher, it's probably going to make its way to the end-customer as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The average term of these loan books is sort of in the 2.5 year range and we've been in a higher spread environment for going on two years now. And so, it is largely re-priced and any new business we're doing is at more favorable pricing than we saw pre &#x2013; the summer of 2007.</p>
          <p>I would say going forward we'll see how that sticks, but it feels pretty good now and the customers aren't having &#x2013; I think a lot of trouble with it because overall nominal rates are quite low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The structural issue too again coming back to what I said earlier, it's Gord speaking, is that, you still have a world where the banking system has too little capital and too much leverage and in that environment it's pretty hard to argue that this isn't a structural change that's going to last for a considerable amount of time because a tremendous amount of equity either has to be raised or balance sheet has to be reduced in order to the sort of live in the new normal world as we move forward. And those dynamics point to a permanency to the structural changes that we've seen happen over the last year or two.</p>
