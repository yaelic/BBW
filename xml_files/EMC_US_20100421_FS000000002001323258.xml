        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joanne. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Today we are joined by Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and CEO: and David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice President and CFO. David will provide a few comments about the results that we released this morning. He will highlight some of EMC's activities this quarter and discuss our updated outlook for 2010. Joe will then spend some time discussing his view of what is happening in the market, EMC's execution of the strategy, and how EMC is positioned.</p>
          <p>After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. I would like to point out that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure today in our press release, supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. All of these are available for download within the Investor Relations section of EMC.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial tables in our news release and on our corporate Web site. These include a lot of financial detail, so we do encourage you to take a look at them.</p>
          <p>The call this morning will contain forward-looking statements, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Lastly, I'll note that an archive of today's presentation will be available following the call.</p>
          <p>With that, it's now my pleasure to introduce David Goulden. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that EMC started the year with very solid results in Q1 with revenues of $3.9 billion, up 23% from Q1 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, up 63%, and free cash flow of $1.1 billion, also up 63%. These results speak to the strength of our leadership position in some of the most important areas of IT and to the power of our operational model. We clearly executed on our Triple Play: we gained market share, we invested for the future, and we improved profitability. We're confident that we will continue to execute in all 3 of these areas going forward.</p>
          <p>Within these numbers, each of our 2 businesses had excellent results. Our EMC Information Infrastructure business had a great quarter with $3.3 billion in revenue, up 22% year on year, and $0.21 of non-GAAP EPS, almost double our EPS from last Q1. VMware also had a great quarter, contributing $632 million of revenue, up 34% year on year, and $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC. Customers are increasingly recognizing that VMware is the strategic layer on which to build their next-generation cloud data centers.</p>
          <p>I'll start off this morning by making some comments about the Q1 spending environments, why EMC is thriving, and then I'll discuss some details from our Q1 results.</p>
          <p>There are 3 major factors that contributed to our excellent revenue performance this quarter. First of all, based upon what we saw in the marketplace, we think IT spending looks to be on track with what we've been expecting, up around 3 to 5% this year. In addition, customer activity and commentary is consistent with the view that our addressable market will be up around 6 to 8% this year.</p>
          <p>A second factor this quarter was the continuation of some pent-up demand that we saw in Q4. For EMC's Information Infrastructure business, this strength was concentrated in the U.S. storage business, especially in financial services. And while it's difficult to quantify, it was certainly a positive. As a result of these 2 factors, we think growth in IT spending in our target marketplace in 2010 will end up at the higher end of our projected ranges.</p>
          <p>Third and most important, we expect to gain a significant amount of share this year, and it seems pretty clear we're off to a good start in this regard. EMC grew faster than our target market for a number of reasons, including our expanding role as a trusted partner with customers, our leading technology in several of the hottest areas of IT today, our proven support and service to back up this technology, and our compelling vision and ability to execute on this vision. As a result, we're increasingly the best guide for customers' journey to the private cloud, and we believe this competitive advantage is the major factor enabling us to show strong growth and gain share. And it positions us well to continue to gain share going forward.</p>
          <p>Given this unique combination of strategic market and technology advantages, we now anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of $16.5 billion, up 18%; non-GAAP operating margins of 20 to 21%; and non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 31% from last year.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, EMC Information Infrastructure revenues were $3.3 billion, up 22% year on year. Non-GAAP earnings per share for EMC II were $0.21, up 91% from last year. Free cash flow was a very strong $819 million, up 66%.</p>
          <p>Within these overall numbers, strong demand for our Information Infrastructure products generated revenues of $2.2 billion, up 27% from last year, while Information Infrastructure services were $1.1 billion, up 13%. The fact that products were so much better than services is an encouraging sign that customers are moving forward with their infrastructure investments.</p>
          <p>EMC Information Infrastructure operating performance for the quarter was also very strong. Non-GAAP gross margins were 53.4%, and non-GAAP operating margins were 17.8% in Q1. These substantial year-on-year improvements stem from higher volumes, a better product mix, and the measures we've taken to lower and streamline our cost structure.</p>
          <p>Looking at the revenue results from each of the businesses within Information Infrastructure, Q1 information storage revenues were 2.9 billion, up 24%. As always, information growth continued to be a key driver. We also saw customers beginning new projects in their existing traditional infrastructures. Added to both of these was continued growth in the number of customers that are moving to virtual data center infrastructures. All 3 of these drivers benefited us in the quarter, as EMC is a trusted partner not only for customers' requirements today, but also going forward as they embark on their own journeys to the private cloud.</p>
          <p>In the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 28% year on year. Our V-Max transition is essentially complete. Customers are eager to benefit from its more efficient, flexible and cost-effective technology, and we're clearly gaining share. Today's applications require an architecture that scales with their business needs. In Q1, one of the largest software companies in the world chose V-Max for its ability to scale capacity and performance and to support critical online applications. The combination of proven reliability, along with cost-effective storage tiering, utilizing fiber channel, solid state and cellular drives, provided this customer with the best value.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the mid-tier. Over the last few years, we've seen a shift in the way customers utilize mid-tier storage. The rapidly changing business environment in this tier increasingly requires the adaptability of multiprotocol systems, and growing virtualized server environments intensify the need for these dynamic storage capabilities. As a result, customers are increasingly looking for mid-tier storage that is capable of supporting multiple information types and communication protocols.</p>
          <p>We have been in lockstep with customers throughout this transition. For years we've been the acknowledged leader in the mid-tier for these capabilities, and we began to combine some of them when we introduced our market-leading unified products in 2006. While we haven't previously disclosed our overall mid-tier revenues, today we're expanding our reporting to help you track our progress here. In Q1, our mid-tier storage product revenues were $800 million and grew a very robust 32% year on year. This amounts to a $3.2 billion annualized run rate for our mid-tier product revenues alone. This annualized number is quite conservative, as it does not include support, updates, or other services revenues, and is being annualized based on our seasonally smallest quarter.</p>
          <p>We gained share in the mid-tier due to the breadth and depth of our portfolio and the world-class service and support to back it up. Let me give you a couple of examples from Q1 of how we're winning in this space. A large medical services company was looking for unified storage, replication, disaster recovery, back-up and recovery, de-duplication and path managements. We won this multimillion-dollar deal against NetApp on the strength of our mid-tier portfolio as well as our replication and recovery capabilities within the customer's clustered VMware environments.</p>
          <p>Another win was a global online content services provider who selected EMC over NetApp for a couple of reasons: EMC's superior royalty useable efficiency, resulting in lower total cost of ownership and compelling de-duplication and VMware integration.</p>
          <p>Our relationship with Dell strengthened in the quarter, and we were pleased to announce an expansion of our partnership to include additional mid-tier products. Channel partners including Dell are extremely important to our ongoing success in the mid-tier, and we're very focused on expanding these partnerships. Our efforts here have really paid off as EMC was recently named 2010 CRN Channel Champion. Channels were a big contributor to our mid-tier business at approximately 75% of our mid-tier product revenues in Q1. It should also be noted that our mid-tier revenues are more weighted toward the high end of the mid-tier markets. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our footprint into the faster growing low end of the mid-tier, and are mobilizing the people, investing in the products, and engaging the partners to make this happen.</p>
          <p>Our success in the high end of the mid-tier is driven by our ability to satisfy customers' needs today no matter where they are on their journey to the private cloud. EMC has been leading the charge on most of the important new technology and information infrastructure today. These include virtualization data centers, SSDs [solid state drives] with automated storage tiering, and next-generation back-up and recovery.</p>
          <p>As our biggest, most immediate, and most important growth opportunity, the evolution to fully virtualized data centers is where we're focusing the majority of our efforts. Fundamental to virtualized data centers is the creation and integration of virtual servers and virtual storage infrastructures. Clearly we are far and away the leader on the service side with VMware. In addition, our unique vision around the virtualization of the information storage infrastructure is resonating with the industry, and you can expect to hear more from us soon on how we're going to make this happen.</p>
          <p>We also continue to lead the charge in virtualization affinity across our product set in both directions. In other words, we are unique in being able to see and manage from storage to virtual machine and from virtual machine to storage, and the connections continue to grow. These capabilities are key to new ways of thinking about data center design, and no company is as well positioned as EMC to help customers.</p>
          <p>Our fully automated storage tiering software known as FAST completed its first quarter availability in Q1, including double-digit penetration rates in the high end. Customers clearly see the value proposition of having the right data in the right place at the right time. And turning this advanced capability into a feature across our full solution set further extends our competitive advantage as customers prefer to buy from a partner with a comprehensive solution as opposed to buying point products.</p>
          <p>Our back-up recovery systems business performed ahead of our high expectations. In fact, Data Domain and Avamar each accelerated to over 100% growth in the quarter. The synergy between these two is key to the acceleration here, and these businesses are certainly growing faster than any other de-duplication technology in the markets. It's great to see this business systematically capitalizing upon opportunities worldwide, both within EMC's existing accounts and with net new customers as well.</p>
          <p>In other storage areas, our online back-up solution, Mozy, continued its strategy in the quarter to build its customer base via service providers, adding Comcast to an already long list of partners. Iomega continued to thrive on the unrelenting demand from customers wanting plug-and-play storage for all their media types. In addition, we're seeing increased demand from small and medium businesses that want easy-to-use network storage.</p>
          <p>In sum, EMC's storage business in the quarter outperformed our expectations due to our ability to provide leading-edge technology in a comprehensive solution that is afforded by our world-class services organization. There is no vendor with the broad and innovative technology solution sets, the depth of experience, and the proven track record to provide information infrastructures that can safely and securely transition customers' data centers at their own pace to private clouds.</p>
          <p>Our RSA security revenues in Q1 were $161 million, up 13% year on year, as information-centric security remains a key customer priority. There are several noteworthy events at RSA this quarter, including RSA's annual Marquee security conference and the acquisition of Archer. Delegate attendance at the RSA conference was up 25% from last year, attesting to the growing importance of IT security. The addition of Archer's governance risk and compliance technology complements our existing DLP and Envision S-I-E-M tools to create one security management platform. The resulting level of visibility shines a welcome security and compliance spotlight into both physical and virtualized environments.</p>
          <p>In addition, in Q1, RSA Archer, VMware, and Intel introduced a proof of concept for compliance, security and control down to the most fundamental layers of multitenant virtualized infrastructure. This is an important early step to help accelerate the growth of external clouds. With the addition of Archer, RSA is now the leader in every area in which it competes: authentication, IT-GRC, DLP, S-I-E-M, and Web fraud protection.</p>
          <p>Revenues from our content management and archiving division in Q1 were $178 million, up 2% from Q1 '09. We saw increased customer activity with new license growth up 8%, a higher number of big deals than in Q4, and a strong pipeline exiting Q1.</p>
          <p>Our XTP [extreme transaction processing] composition platform for case management which is unique in the industry is garnering a lot of customer interest. In fact, a major European national health system has standardized upon XTP for its health records.</p>
          <p>A sharper focus on partnerships is also expanding CMA's growth opportunities in 2010. These include our recently announced partnership with FatWire to improve Web content management, as well as a new relationship with SAP to provide a number of SAP-focused ECM solutions, the first of which we plan to announce in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p>EMC's global services business once again showed strong results for the quarter, with revenues up 13% over last year's Q1. Our professional and technical services are doing well, and our consulting business continues to outperform, benefiting from customers' transitions to virtual data centers architectures. In fact, EMC consulting expertise was key to winning the first phase of a long-term collaboration with a Fortune 100 defense contractor to accelerate the transformation of a data centers to a service-oriented private cloud model. Such an undertaking requires deep expertise in cloud strategy and architecture, as well as the infrastructure products that are being purpose built for such environments. This is why they chose EMC.</p>
          <p>Our partnership with Cisco continues to gain momentum. In Q1, our VCE coalition was up and running. Its focus on helping customers accelerate their move to cloud infrastructures has really struck a chord, and interest has been outstanding. Customers are already in production with V-Blocks and will soon be rolling out a lower-end version of the V-Block. Over the next few months you will see exciting announcements from both systems integrators and service providers leveraging the work of this coalition of best-of-breed technology companies.</p>
          <p>Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results, including both our Information Infrastructure and Virtual Infrastructure businesses. As I mentioned, the EMC Information Infrastructure business had revenues of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP operating margins of 17.8%, and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.21 and free cash flow of $819 million. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure business had revenues of $632 million, non-GAAP operating margins of 28.1%, and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 and free cash flow of $291 million. Together, our 2 businesses had total Q1 consolidated revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, up 23% year on year, non-GAAP operating margins of 19.5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, $561 million higher than Q1 non-GAAP net income.</p>
          <p>These consolidated results represent the combined power of Virtual Infrastructure and Information Infrastructure. Together we're moving forward under a shared vision and strategic direction. Additionally, through complementary efforts we're increasing affinity between the virtual and information infrastructures. This strategic alignment positions us well to execute our Triple Play: to gain market share, to invest for the future, and to improve profitability.</p>
          <p>As you can see from our revised 2010 revenue growth guidance of 18%, we intend to grow substantially faster than our target market and gain share. Second, we're investing for the future. We continue to plan to expand our R&amp;D spend by 20% over last year. And we're further adding to our sales capability worldwide, particularly in emerging markets and the commercial and S&amp;B markets. And we now plan to implement a broad-based annual compensation review to reward and retain our work force, which has been outstanding throughout what has been a very challenging period.</p>
          <p>Third, these increased investments notwithstanding, we expect to further improve profitability. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for 2010 to reach between 20 and 21%, representing a substantial increase over the levels seen for the past several years.</p>
          <p>Now a few housekeeping items. Currency added 240 basis points to the year-on-year revenue growth on a consolidated basis. The Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, higher than expected, as renewal of the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit has not yet been passed. We still expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be around 20% as we project that the tax credit will occur later this year, possibly as late as the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Q1 consolidated operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up 53%. The improvements that generated this strong results include deferred revenues, which were $4 billion, inventory turns, which were 8 times, and DSOs, which were 40 days.</p>
          <p>Due to the improvements in our stock price, we now expect our fully diluted share count for the year to be around 2.15 billion. The difference from the 2.12 billion we disclosed in January is primarily due to the impact of our convertible debt.</p>
          <p>We ended Q1 with $10.2 billion in cash and investments. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S., with the remainder overseas. In the quarter, we used $176 million of our cash to buy back 10 million shares of EMC stock and spent approximately $290 million on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The program we announced last month to maintain our position in VMware as an approximately 80% majority ownership underscores the importance of VMware's role in EMC's strategic direction. We believe maintaining EMC's ownership in VMware at this level enables us to continue to achieve our original objectives for the publicly offering this stock and also maximize value for EMC shareholders over the long term. To this goal, EMC purchased approximately $100 million of VMware stock in Q1.</p>
          <p>Now looking at our best-of-breed technology and services portfolio, our longstanding presence in data centers worldwide, and the customer trust we have earned, we believe there is no company better positioned to guide customers along their journey to the private cloud, and there is no doubt this is exactly where customers are heading. As this recent survey shows, almost every single CIO spending priority this year is either on technology that puts customers on the path to the private cloud or is a benefit of having a private cloud.</p>
          <p>The first step to building a private cloud is server virtualization, and capturing the full benefits of server virtualization requires advanced automation and management capabilities designed for these environments. This is where VMware stands alone. Customers are embracing the new security paradigms that are necessary for private cloud infrastructures to proliferate. As we saw in the quarter, EMC, RSA, and VMware are working hard, together with partners like Intel, on approaches to information-centric security that will accelerate the adoption of private cloud infrastructures.</p>
          <p>Customer interest in cloud computing is really picking up. At EMC our strategy to bridge internal private clouds and external public clouds is spot on. The ability to virtualize storage infrastructure enables the necessary new remote computer models required for private clouds. EMC has introduced several innovative new offerings in this space, and in the very near future will introduce virtual storage technology that will enable customers to use distance as an asset rather than see it as a constraint.</p>
          <p>The need for desktop virtualization is gaining momentum. A virtualized foundation like vSphere on the back-end enables the scalability and seamlessness of use that are critical to a successful enterprise rollout of VDI [virtual desktop infrastructure] and priorities like labor optimization, efficiency, and green computing. All of these are byproducts of operating a private cloud infrastructure. What all this indicates is that customers are quickly discovering that to keep their competitive edge they need to do things differently. They need to transform their aging traditional infrastructures into the more cost-effective agile new models for IT that are now possible.</p>
          <p>EMC and VMware together are leading the charge in making these new compute models a reality. No other company has the proven or market-leading technology, services and support that we do. No other company is as squarely aligned to these priorities, and no other company has the vision and ability to execute on this vision.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Joe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, David. I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's conference call. As always, thank you very much for your interest in EMC.</p>
          <p>Overall, I was very pleased with our Q1 results. In fact, this Q1 was the best first quarter in EMC's history. We had record Q1 revenues, record Q1 net income, and record Q1 free cash flow. And, I might add, these results mark the second consecutive quarter in which we announced record quarterly results, proof that our strategy coupled with our focus in strength and storage, virtualization, security, and information and content management is resonating very well with our customers. Clearly at an apples-to-apples year-on-year growth rate of 20% this Q1, we are growing significantly faster than the markets we serve. In other words, we are taking share.</p>
          <p>And as always, what propels any company in any industry is excellence in execution. To that end, I would like to thank the more than 43,500 people of EMC and VMware across the globe for their dedication to our customers, for their skill, hard work, and teamwork they exhibit every day. Congratulations to all of you on these strong results.</p>
          <p>As David has indicated, in Q1, IT spending patterns were so much stronger than normal as customers caught up with some pent-up demand from last year's cutbacks. Other positives that had customers -- had firm IT budgets in place, and they are investing in IT to gain productivity, both to help contain costs and to enhance revenues. As an example, we saw this global strength in our flagship Symmetrix product line. In addition, we had good visibility and predictability throughout the quarter, and experienced a good flow for calendarization of orders, much better than we experienced in the first half of 2009. And while we remain cautious about the pace of recovery, we are optimistic and have confidence in our ability to exceed our goals for this year as is evidenced in our enhanced 2010 guidelines David just shared with -- guidance that David just shared with you. What gives us this confidence in our ability to continue to grow and take share is our focus on 4 multibillion dollar markets, all of which are currently are and will continue to exhibit extremely rapid double-digit growth for many years to come, and each one has the potential to be a billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity for EMC.</p>
          <p>Our first and largest opportunities is to help CIOs transform their data centers into private clouds. The key attribute of a private cloud -- that this will give CIOs the ability to truly offer their internal and external customers IT-as-a-service. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment where application workloads are truly policy- and service level-driven. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that is far more automated, flexible, and dynamic than today's data center environment. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that advances security, availability, and control to a higher level. And IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that will deliver significantly lower costs.</p>
          <p>Our second billion-dollar-plus opportunity is to help service providers and telcos build out their public clouds using virtualization, storage, security, and information technologies -- information management technologies. We will bring the same private cloud attributes and technologies to our service provider and telco partners as they build out their public clouds. This will allow them to attract application workloads from our enterprise and commercial customers. And by adding a suite of applications, they will be able to have full IT service offerings to attack markets such as SMB and public sector. Additionally, EMC will offer our service partners several applications, so choices like PC and PC back-up, and storage as a service.</p>
          <p>Our third multibillion-dollar opportunity is for EMC to be the clear leader in next-generation back-up recovery and archive solutions. As a proof point of the opportunity here, the actual Q1 results from just the Data Domain and Avamar product and services already represents a billion dollars in revenue on an annualized run-rate basis. This is especially impressive when you consider that these products represent new growth areas for EMC. And for the record, we do expect Q2, Q3, and Q4 results for Data Domain and Avamar solutions to show sequential improvement. And to top things off in this category, we have other offerings like network or for back-up, the SourceOne product family for compliant archiving and our family of disk libraries.</p>
          <p>Our fourth massive opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. We will bring to this market the benefits of virtualization and centralized management, the protection of centralized storage, and enhanced information management, with a new and better way to secure information while lowering total costs. In short, we'll help our customers embrace and get the maximum value from the rapid advances in choices that are now happening in client devices, while lowering their total TCO. This de-client market, while quite small right now, is as extremely active as numerous customers are engaged in proof of concepts. Additionally, we see early adopters experiencing solid results. These are clear signs -- to steal a phrase -- that this is going to be big.</p>
          <p>Collectively, in these 4 mega-growth opportunities, we have the vision, the leading technologies in virtualization, in security, in storage, for block, file and object data, and for the next generation of back-up recovery and archive solutions. We have the people and the expertise to help customers and service providers make this transition. We have the partner ecosystem in place to succeed, and very importantly, we have the trust and permission of our customers to play in these markets. We are convinced that continuing our focus on these 4 growth markets along with continued investments in innovative technology and in exceptional people -- we can maintain a long-term double-digit revenue growth rate.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for joining us today. I now turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&amp;A portion of today's call.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel Nicolaus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, guys, and congratulations on the good quarter. Understanding that you guys are giving a new, what you call, mid-tier breakdown of revenue, I'd like to dig into that a little bit deeper as you're not disclosing CLARiiON growth. If I look at Data Domain within that, and you cited 100% growth, 800 million of revenue -- backing that out would imply kind of organic growth of about 6% by my math. So I guess first of all, can you help me? Am I thinking about that correctly? Or maybe even more importantly, could you give us what the CLARiiON growth was in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aaron, yes, let me clarify that for you. So first of all, I think the way to look at things would be on an apples-to-apples basis. I'll give you that data point. So if you took our mid-tier product revenues at about $800 million -- bear in mind this is products only per my clarification -- the apples-to-apples growth rate is 20%. So the reported growth rate was 32%, but if you included Data Domain as if we'd owned it a year ago, the apples-to-apples growth rate is 20%. So that's really the kind of comparable data point you should be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you say what CLARiiON growth was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to break that out because really what's happening is because of all the convergence in the mid-tier, focusing upon individual products is now kind of less relevant, and that's why we want to focus upon the total business and show you how that is progressing over time. Also as we pointed out, your channel partners are so important here as well. Hence we gave you the 75% data point in terms of channel partner contribution to mid-tier revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aaron, this is Joe. First, thanks for your congratulations. And let me just put a little color on that. First of all, we're kind of following the classic Gartner context for what makes up a mid-tier storage from price range and size. And what we're doing now, as we go to market, we're basically going to market with a more unified message. So, for instance, a lot of what would have been CLARiiON now has a CLARiiON in back of a Celerra as a unified platform. What would have been sometimes a CLARiiON data library, disk library is, we might now throw over to Data Domain. So you really got to look at these things collectively, and that's why we're giving you a fair number. So in other words we have an exact same set of assets in 2009 as we did in -- first quarter 2009 as we have in 2010, and the apples-to-apples growth is 20%. But it's really the way we go to market, to look at one product is just not a good way to look at the market.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is the way we're going to go forward, in this unified message, and the fact that we have this unique ability to have this next-generation back-up and archiving included in our offerings is truly a mid-tier category, and that's how we're going to report, and that's -- and that is the 20%.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations on good numbers. David, I want to dig into your prepared remarks. Earlier on you mentioned that you still saw more pent-up demand in this quarter. I believe U.S. and financials were the specific verticals you highlighted where that -- you're seeing a lot of that. Do you have any gauge or insight as to how long do you think that still can last before you move into sort of "normal purchasing patterns," not catch-up mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. Great. And again, thanks for all the congrats. I also refer you back to what you heard from VMware last night, because they also commented upon the fact they saw pent-up demand in the quarter. And as I mentioned, for the Information Infrastructure business, we saw it mainly in the U.S. storage sector. We saw it in financial services obviously where there was a weak compare with Q1 a year ago, and we saw it in the form of more large deals than you would typically expect in Q1.</p>
          <p>We really are not anticipating a lot of that pent-up demand kind of running forward into the rest of the year. If you kind of look at how we guided, obviously our 16.5% -- $16.5 billion guidance is a very strong revenue number. It's an 18% revenue growth. But if you kind of pull it apart, you'll see that because of pent-up demand, we're expecting Q1 to be higher than a usual percentage of the total. So we're expecting to move to a more seasonal pattern kind of after Q1, which would mean essentially that you wouldn't see quite as big a jump. In fact, Q2 might be nearer flattish compared to Q1, and then expect a more seasonal progression from that point going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up. I guess, is part of the change related to the mid-tier storage number due to the CLARiiON refresh and the convergence share with project unity?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. I'm just trying to understand the mid-tier storage number that you're giving. I mean, is this partly related to the CLARiiON refresh expected here and then the convergence of the CLARiiON and Celerra platforms with project unity that is underway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly we're &#x2013; and it's very good news -- we are absolutely collapsing platforms. So we're going &#x2013; our big message is unified. And we have a strong family there. You'll see the second wave of emphasis beyond &#x2013; I'm not going to use any code names, but the second wave of emphasis will be -- the mid-tier market is even grower faster where we're not a major player today, and that's in the smaller systems. And you'll see a lot of work on that probably in the early -- very early next year. So we're very excited. But this is the category. This is how we compete against others in the industry. They're trying to pull together a suite of products that covers this landscape, and of course we have, I think, an extraordinary position in the next-generation back-up recovery.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark. You see coming from 2 sides of the business. You saw a nice build-up in deferred revenue on both the VMware side and the EMC Information Infrastructure side. In both cases it's basically mainly due to prepaid software maintenance contracts, so customers basically prepaying software maintenance with their software licenses, which is always a good sign.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; good morning. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about your cash usage and where -- first of all, how you're going to balance acquisitions versus the various repurchases? It seems like there is a pretty good strategy of obviously keeping your VMware stake at 80%. How important is that? And what does that mean for purchases of VMware versus purchases of EMC, and then how you balance acquisitions for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, that's a long &#x2013; could be a long answer. But just to get highlights, obviously we are going to continue. VMware is part of the EMC family. We are &#x2013; you can see the private cloud when you heard their conference call yesterday and their thing. I mean the strategy for both companies is the journey to the private cloud. Strategy is making sure we get to the service provider public cloud community. Strategy is to watch and participate and have the best technology and -- as this growing business for the virtual desktop and virtual client emerges. So those are all common strategies. So it's important that we work them together.</p>
          <p>Obviously we continue to let -- to work VMware in a very open fashion so that others can continue to play, and that will continue to be the case. And of course EMC on the back of that, which is good for today's environments and good for tomorrow's cloud environments -- the next generation back-up recovery that we add. So keeping that stake is incredibly important, and that's exactly what we're going to do.</p>
          <p>And secondly, as we have those 4 great -probably one of the first times in my life that I had 4 opportunities this big hitting me at once. So our best, I believe, our best return on value for customers is to make sure we take the right moves and continue to invest in technology through our own R&amp;D. You saw how we were a little -- it's going to ramp up, but we are going to increase our R&amp;D this year 20%. We are going to continue to buy companies, both in VMware and in EMC, and that will be the primary focus for the cash and to get great return for the shareholders. And we continue to focus on what David calls the Triple Play. We want to hit the short term. We want to hit -- we want to make sure that we can continue to grow and take share. We want to make sure that we continue to invest for the long term and capitalizing opportunities, so we want to do all 3.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Can you talk about components in the quarter, if there are any shortages? If so, what components? Because I see inventory was down only modestly, and I'm just wondering if that's a buffer and if that's still a sign that things are still tight. And if I could just follow up on that, can you just provide any color on whether you're expecting component tightness to ease in the back-half and if that's reflected in your 20 to 21% out margin guidance for the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This might surprise you, but we were fine this quarter in terms of our supply chain. We did not see -- that tightness that you referred to, we didn't see that that hard and did not impact us at all. We don't expect it to impact us going forward. So we think we're fine.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Do you expect the ease going into the back-half of the year that might help you on the margins, and is that reflected in your --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what obviously happens is when you get a tightness, everybody is ramping up, and these are the suppliers we use. And as that happens, there is some opportunity there. But I stick with my statement. We did not see &#x2013; this tightness that you referred to did not impact us this quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great; thanks, guys. You know, looks like your incremental gross margins on your information storage business have been trending nicely over the past several years and especially the last 4 quarters. I guess the question is, going forward do you expect those trends to continue at these high levels, and if so &#x2013; or if not, is there a reason why we shouldn't expect to see a six handle on overall corporate gross margins at some point down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, obviously if you look at our information storage, our Information Infrastructure business, margins have progressed very nicely. You saw we did 53.4% in the last quarter. And as I mentioned, it's been a few drivers. Obviously volume helps. Mix shift helps, and obviously our V-Max transition has been helpful for us. And that is something that is basically &#x2013; that piece of it is now complete. But as we go through the rest of this year, we expect to still be able to improve on the gross margins we delivered in Q1.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You talked a lot about share gains, and so can you give a little bit more detail about what the competitive environment's like right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very competitive out there. I don't think much has changed. We're still seeing the same competitors we've seen for the last couple of years, and I do believe that -- you saw a tremendous strength in Symmetrix. The move to the x-86 technology in V-Max, the fact that we have the flash and the FAST technology out now is resonating very well with customers. So that -- we're competing very well there. You saw our mid-tier results. Unified is absolutely the way to go, and of course I think we're uniquely positioned in this next-generation archive. I think we're in -- if you look at our security business, you know, the unique focuses we have there on IPV and on security and event management and on data loss prevention are hot areas. I think as we go to this case, XEP type of approach in archived management business, that's going to play extremely well.</p>
          <p>So again, competition is the same. Competition is intense, but the teams have done a really good job distinguishing our products, and we have a good go-to-market organization, and we're now investing heavily in marketing. Jeremy Burton just joined us as CMO, and we're going to make sure we can -- we do a better job on that front.</p>
          <p>So I don't know if that answered your question, but it's kind of how we see the landscape.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the Symmetrix business which you just mentioned there, Joe. And specifically if I'm not mistaken, I think that business was down about 10% last quarter year over year and accelerated pretty substantially. So if you'd either correct that or maybe say what the sequential growth was. And then maybe just give a little more color what's driving that. And then finally, IBM mentioned on their call their mainframe cycle kicking in the second half. Any impact that might have on you guys on the Symmetrix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, mainframe cycle's always good for us on Symmetrix. It's still -- we're still a major player there.</p>
          <p>But I think the big story is V-Max, the adoption and the opportunity that V-Max gives us. And of course the 2 big things with V-Max is the fact -- the way we've planned this from the beginning to really optimize the use of flash drives, and then our FAST technology which tiers storage automatically. So whether it puts it on -- it's dramatically different cost structure -- whether it puts it on a flash drive, say, a 15K fiber channel drive, or a 2-terabyte SATA drive, or a 2-terabyte SATA drive de-duped. These are very different cost profiles of the customer, and therefore our customer can set a policy and let us just move the data automatically. And of course as we have thousands of customers who now have over a petabyte of data, this automation is what has to happen. I mean, that's kind of one of the basic tenants of even the private cloud. It's becoming so that you got to trust the automation to help you get the productivity. And that trust is there in Symmetrix, and I think that's the big reason it did well. And also, to be fair, Symmetrix did benefit from some of the pent-up demand from last year's hiatus, so to speak.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Kevin, just to clarify the numbers that you asked about, basically Symmetrix was up sequentially 7% from Q4, which obviously reflects a very strong result. Typically you expect a sequential decline from Q4. And as we explained on the last call for Q4, the Q4 results were down 14% year on year, which was actually the best year-on-year comparison we had in 2009 for Symmetrix.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on gross margins in the quarter relative to your expectations. Looked like there were a lot of really positive forces. V-Max went up. You had exceptionally strong performance from both VMware and de-dupe, which are higher margin. So I actually would have thought maybe gross margins on a sequential basis could have done a little bit better. Can you comment on whether gross margins, given those considerations, were in line with your expectations and what you saw, both in the pricing environment and any reinvestments that you would have made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Toni, you're right in terms of what some of the positives were. A better mix from some of the de-dupe products including Avamar and V-Max certainly helped. Obviously, sequentially volumes are in total down, so you're a factor that in. The area that you probably -- is a little different from what you may have expected is if you look at our services, the services component of gross margin, which you can get to either with the stand-alone results or by pulling out VMware, what you'll see is a fairly large decline sequentially in the services gross margin for a few factors. One is we are building up our consulting and professional services business that has a lower margin mix, and that was a higher percentage of the business. And also, on the services side, bear in mind we reinstated the 5% salary cuts this quarter. We had some fringe adjustments and a couple of other things happening to the services side. So the services gross margin sequentially was a little bit down more than it would have been or more than it was, for example, from the last Q4 to Q1. So that's perhaps the difference between what you're expecting in your margin model.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When we look at the pricing trends and we look at the sequential and the year-on-year declines, we'd say we saw a pretty normal pricing environment, given the comments that Joe made -- notwithstanding the comments that Joe made about still being tough out there, but in terms of the impact of price, it's pretty much in line with our expectations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I think -- well, as David said, we saw a little bit better than normal calendarization, so obviously that would say we booked more earlier than we had certainly for the last 4 or 5 quarters. Some of that is because of the recovery. Some of that is because of the advances we had in the product families like V-Max kind of hitting its stride now. But -- so the closure rates were a little better than they normally were, so sales cycles were a little shorter.</p>

          <p>Good quarter. Real quickly, as you look to competitors and as they move towards integrated products, you often see it take a long time to do software integration. You guys talked a lot about unified platforms, yet you have a lot of distinct personalities within your storage infrastructure. Does virtualization allow you to unify them without a big overhead of software integration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The bigger is the Intel multicore, and the rework -- it takes time to rework your products, but it gives you the ability now with multicore and reworking some of your products into more thread-like approach, so to speak. That helps a lot. And you're right. There are products that we are putting natively under VMware, and that overhead now is drastically reduced and gives us opportunity. So it's a combination of multicore and virtualization, but mostly the native use of multicore that we're doing.</p>

          <p>I mean, Kaushik, let me just add too, a couple points. First of all, we will continue to enhance the mid-range products, and very importantly, as we go into the future, we have a great history of preserving customer software investments on all of our platforms. So every future products that we bring out let them take advantage of the applications that are written on existing platforms. So we really have given them an investment protection roadmap, which gives them enhancements into the future, which is why they're comfortable continuing with our state-of-the-art leading technologies we have today.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Well, first of all for what it's worth, I do think the new mid-tier category you guys are using makes a lot more sense for analyzing the business.</p>
          <p>But I want to dig into the high end versus mid-tier a bit. I understand you're enjoying a product refresh and cyclical recovery within Symmetrix. So with that in mind, can you help us understand how we should think about mid-tier versus high-end growth over time particularly over the long term? And then secondarily to that, does the increasing sort of tendency to tier within the box eventually even make the distinction between mid-tier and high end somewhat irrelevant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I do think there'll always be a mid-tier and a high end, but I do think you hit on a very important point. We for sure are seeing customers that would have bought a mid-tier product just saying, okay, now that tim -- now that SIM has this degree of scalability, because this new SIM is unique in that it scales up like every other SIM did, but it also scales out. So you could scale these things out fairly inexpensively, and by sometimes by taking that approach and adding a low tier, say, of SATA drives in it and using software like FAST, it can compete very, very effectively with mid-tier. So you are right; it does -- and that is one of the reasons for SIM's &#x2013; one of the reasons for SIM's high growth this quarter. So there will be some blurring.</p>
          <p>But that being said, I still think you'll see these 2 distinct tiers for the long term, and I do expect that the mid-tier has the ability, especially as we get into the lower mid-tier, which, where the higher growth is today that we're not a strong player in yet, but will be. I think you will see the mid-tier for the long haul grow faster than the high end.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. We have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question today comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; thank you. Nice quarter. David, on linearity, do you think that is a theme for this year, meaning more linear quarters, lower DSOs, and free cash flow closer to the 1 billion range you reported for March? Is that sustainable through the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Katie, thank you. Multi-part question. Linearity. Q1 I think a little bit better than expected because some more of the pent-up demand we spoke about we saw earlier in the quarter. And you're absolutely right; that's reflected in our DSOs down at 40 days. If we're correct on our assumptions about pent-up demand really being a Q4/Q1 phenomena, then I think we'll go back to quarters that are slightly more normal from a linearity point of view, obviously better than we saw last year, but kind of more comparable to what we saw in 2008.</p>
          <p>From a cash -- from a free cash flow point of view, bear in mind that Q1 is always our strongest quarter. Q1 and Q4 are always our strongest quarters because you're collecting off the biggest receivable base. So obviously we're very pleased with what we've done, but we're not promising billion-dollar cash flow quarters going forward at this point in time. But we are very confident that we'll continue to show significant difference -- positive difference between free cash flow and non-GAAP net income for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Closing, first of all, thank you all for joining us. We are very confident and do believe we have a compelling vision and strategy, one that's not only right for 2010 but well behind. I think we're in great shape with our products and solutions and the support to underpin this vision and strategy. We have a world-class partner ecosystem. Very importantly, we have the leadership and a deep belief throughout our 43,500 people plus around the world that we can and will win.</p>
          <p>And just as a side note, our premier customer event we call the EMC World happens to be in Boston. It starts on May 10, and we will use this opportunity to be giving our customers updates on our strategy and vision of how we take them to the private cloud and all the great features and new products that the R&amp;D teams have been working on. So this is their time to share this with our customers, and of course as we share it with our customers, we'll share it with all of you. And again, thank you very much for being with us today, and we'll be talking to you.</p>
