        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Inditex First Half 2008 Results Presentation. Please, Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim half year 2008. I am Pablo Isla, Chief Executive Officer of Inditex, and here with me are Antonio Rubio, CFO and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>To start, let me tell you that we are satisfied with these results, obtained against highly demanding comparables, and in a challenging retailing environment in some markets. I would like to cover a few of the highlights.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008 sales in local currencies and constant perimeter have increased 14% to &#x20AC;4.6 billion. Regarding Inditex like-for-like performance in the first half of 2007 -- of 2008, we have achieved growth of 1% against a demanding 7% comparable in the same period of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the two-year compound base like-for-like growth was 4%. Let me point out that operating expenses remain tightly under control, as we keep on with our efficiency programs and space growth remains significant.</p>
          <p>Net income has reached &#x20AC;406 million, a 7% increase year-on-year, when excluding gains due to changes in perimeter. Our cash flow generation remains strong. Funds from operations have increased by 8% to &#x20AC;632 million. And finally, our capital allocation process remains highly strict. Capital expenditure in the year so far has been &#x20AC;475 million, growing 2% while space growth has been 15%.</p>
          <p>Over the first half of 2008, we have continued to implement our strategy of international multi-concept growth. The ongoing expansion of the Group has resulted in an increasing share of international sales, reaching 65% of total versus 62% at the same point of the previous year. I would like to highlight the rapid growth, we are experiencing in markets with a strong growth potential in Eastern Europe and Asia. As a result, this area has grown in just two years from 11% to 17% of Group sales. This is remarkable because in this period Inditex has experienced a strong growth.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Antonio Rubio, who will provide some of the details behind the headline numbers. And I will join you later for the outlook section. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. As you can see in this slide, the results for our first half of 2008 when excluding gains due to change in perimeter keep showing significant growth in all the key lines of the profit and loss account.</p>
          <p>This is remarkable, taking into account, the demanding comparable of the first half of 2007. If you take a two-year view, all the lines of the profit and loss account, when excluding gains due to change in perimeter, show compound annual growth rate above 15%.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, let me tell you that new selling space has contributed 13% to total sales growth. Like-for-like sales have increased 1%, against demand in comparables. Considering that two year compound base like-for-like growth is 4%.</p>
          <p>The translation of currencies different to the euro and change in the consolidation perimeter has deducted 3 percentage points from sales growth in the period. Let me remind you that the perimeter effects have now fully analyzed and will not have an impact in the reported sales of the second half of 2008. Picking up on sales growth, I would like to note that we had opened 249 stores in the first half, reaching a total of 3,940. Store openings for 2008 are according to plan.</p>
          <p>Gross profits in the period have increased 12% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. In percentage terms, the gross margin has had a satisfactory evolution. It has reached 56.4% on sales, improving 71 basis points over the previous year. We are pleased with the level of gross margin achieved.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control and had grown 15% in the period. In our opinion, this is remarkable as the space addition has grown at a similar rate. The operating working capital has had a normal evolution during the first half, and has reached &#x20AC;1 billion of cost-free financing. Funds from operations have increased by 8% to &#x20AC;632 million.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned to you, our capital allocation process remains very strict. Capital expenditure has increased just 2%, reaching &#x20AC;475 million when adjusted for the impact of changing perimeter, while space has grown by 15%.</p>
          <p>Over the period 2006 and 2008, we are making significant investments to adapt our logistic capacity to future growth. With these investments, our logistics are scalable until 2012.</p>
          <p>I'm now handing over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I will go briefly over the performance by concepts. Let me highlight that sales in local currencies and constant perimeter for both Zara and the other concepts have grown 14% in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>As you can see in this chart, the majority of the concepts have continued growing sales significantly over the period. In the case of Massimo Dutti, the growth rate in the first half of 2008, 3%, is due to the double-digit like-for-like comparable of the previous year and space growth significantly below the average of the Group.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. I would like to spend a few minutes reaffirming the key lines of our strategic vision that we introduced to you last March.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight that Inditex expansion high growth markets in Asia and Eastern Europe have a strategic component. The initial results are highly satisfactory. As I have anticipated to you, the share of this area in total store sales has increased in last two years from 11 to 17%. This is particularly remarkable having in mind the strong growth experienced by our Group globally in that period.</p>
          <p>We see huge long-term potential in these geographies, and a high expansion rate looking forward. Our goal is to increase selling space in the area at a rate that more than doubles, the increase in selling space for the Group.</p>
          <p>As an example, over recent months, we have increased the pace of openings in China, where we now have the stores in many of the key capitals. We have also had a very strong reception in our launch in Korea. In Japan, a very interesting market for Inditex, we are opening Inditex store number 4,000 in Ginza, Tokyo, on Sunday.</p>
          <p>We are also experiencing a strong growth in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation. The reception of Zara in Ukraine has been highly successful, and we continue to expand significantly in Russia. As you know, Western Europe is an area of expansion for all our concepts. We see significant opportunities to gain share in all markets due to its fragmentation, while taking advantage of the consolidation in countries where we have a strong presence. And finally, in the Americas, we see the opportunity to build on our current presence with a selective expansion.</p>
          <p>I would like to stress, the strong reception of our first two stores in Korea. In August, we have opened Zara's third store in Seoul at M Plaza in Myungdong, the main commercial area of the capital. The performance so far has been highly satisfactory. I would also like to point out the strong reception of our first store in Ukraine. Khreshatik is Kiev's most popular shopping area. We see a strong long-term potential in this market.</p>
          <p>In July, we have launched a new format, Uterq&#xFC;e, focused on accessories, shoes, bags, and costume jewelry. The initial reception has been very strong and above our expectations. We feel very satisfied with the performance of the first round of stores.</p>
          <p>For the rest of 2008, we are encouraged by the growth opportunities we are finding to invest profitably in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns. In 2008, we estimate that the store opening program will add 290,000 square meters of additional retailer space.</p>
          <p>Our capital allocation process remains very strict. We expect capital expenditure in 2008 to be similar to that of 2007, while retailer space grows 15%. Additionally this CapEx level similar to that of 2007 includes the completion of our cycle of logistic investments in the period 2006-2007 to support our expansion until 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding the outlook for the rest of the year, I would like to highlight the good reception of our autumn-winter collections. The six weeks since the beginning of the second half shows similar growth patterns to those of the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We are now ready to answer your questions regarding our results and other subjects. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions, if I can start. First if you could make some more specific comments on the performance in Spain, in the first half, and what trends, and what level of deterioration you may be witnessing related to the overall growth. Secondly, if you can maybe relate back to the guidance that you had and how should we think of that going forward in terms of like-for-like, gross margin, operating expenses.</p>
          <p>And maybe more specifically on the operating costs, if you can articulate on the trends and the type of acceleration that we've seen in the first half and how should we think of it into second half. And lastly, maybe a comment on the tax rate which is also something that seems to be keep coming down. I don't know how we should forecast that going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Well, first of all regarding the performance in the second half -- in the first half sorry, you always must have in mind the extremely demanding comparables. We were anticipating when we published both our first -- full year results and our first quarter results. We are talking about 1% like-for-like sales growth compared to our 7% like-for-like sales growth in the first half 2007, which probably was the best first half regarding sales and profits of the history of the company. So anything related with the first half must be analyzed in that context, the 7% like-for-like that we achieved in the first half 2007.</p>
          <p>Globally, about our performance in -- and also if you think about our first quarter results publication, you can see an acceleration of our sales growth during the first half of the year, if you remember the results we were publishing for the first quarter. So from that point of view, there is nothing really different to say from what we said when we were publishing the first quarter results and we could say that from the point of view of that relative performance of the different markets, we have some markets which are particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe, which are having very strong performance, most of the markets which are aligned and Spain which is slightly below the average. That is the situation right now. Regarding our guidance for the rest of the year and particularly on Massimo...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I -- sorry to interrupt, on the slightly below average, is it still positive or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- we never enter into saying like for like sales figure for any particular geography. You have the global figure with a very, very demanding comparable and there are so many things involved that. We have never wanted to enter into like-for-like sales figures for any particular geography, because we think the best way to analyze our business, we are so internationalized, so the best way to analyze our business, if we enter into each particular geography, thinking about like-for-like in that geography, we think it can be perhaps even misleading.</p>
          <p>We prefer to have the global figure and I think from -- it would not be reasonable from our side to enter into like-for-like sales evolution in each particular country. Regarding the guidance for the rest of the year, we can say -- well, you were mentioning three different items. Of course, regarding like-for-like sales growth evolution we are targeting higher like-for-like sales growth in the second half than in the first half. Regard -- because of many different factors, but of course, comparables have to do with that.</p>
          <p>Gross margin, we maintain our statement about the stable gross margin as the most reasonable assumption. And regarding OpEx growth, we continue maintaining our target. Regarding cost growth and sales growth, rates being the same. You must assume that if you look to our OpEx growth 15% and our space growth 15%, this means that most of our OpEx growth has to do with space growth, which is also remarkable from the point of view of cost control. And for the tax rate, Antonio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate in this first half is 24%, in this moment is the best estimation for the whole year is the result of the mix of the different countries where we are operating and is also not only the tax rate for the next half, but our best estimation for the full year. And in the medium and long-term you have to come to assume that the tax rate will trend to a rate between 26%, 28%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow up on the second question about the second half trends? Your comments about so far growth rate being in line with the first half, how should we rate that in relation to the like-for-like? Does it mean that you are still on a 1% like-for-like, or the base effect is also starting to contribute some positives on the like-for-like? How should we interpret the statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think is that it is not very worthy to talk about like-for-like sales figure in a six weeks period. I think what is relevant is what I have transmitted to you, that our goal is to achieve higher like-for-like sales growth in the second half than in the first half. And as I say, we were saying during the presentation that our autumn/winter collections, the reception has been good regarding our autumn/winter collections by our clients in the different markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Phil Rudman from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Just one quick question on the OpEx cost guidance for the full year. You finished the first half with a 400 basis point gap between sales growth and costs growth. Obviously, it is in line with the overall space growth of the business in the first half. But it means quite a considerable saving in the second half. And I was just wondering how you were going to achieve that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Antonio, perhaps you can elaborate a little more, but what I would like to say is that we don't have, we do not have a 400 basis points gap because store sales in local currencies, they have been -- the real sales figure is more 14%. So -- and that foreign exchange impact, regarding costs is not at all as significant as it is regarding sales. So we are not talking at all about our 400 basis points gap, probably half of that what we are mentioning.</p>
          <p>And also you must assume that costs -- from the point of view of sales, in our sector and in our company, there is a clear difference between first half and second half. The weight of the two different halves is really different. And regarding costs, there is not so much difference because of rental expenses, because of personnel expenses. So that is why we always have said that the best way to analyze costs is to look at the full year results. In that respect, we think this target, as we always have mentioned is ambitious, but is achievable. That is our estimation right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one quick follow-up from that, then. Is the guidance for the full year excluding currency impact on sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the guidance for the full year is sales growth, store sales in local currencies compared with cost growth in local currencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Local currencies. Okay, fine. Thank you. Can I have just one quick follow-up question on the gross margin as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of a factor has the internationalization of sales and the weak Spanish market contributed to your gross margin improvement in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really what you are saying in a relevant way. As you know, our gross margin is a combination of many different factors. Globally, we can say that we feel within the gross margin achieved in the first half, having in mind all the elements and also the environment in the sector, more promotional environment across the sector, our gross margin achieved in the first half globally, we think is quite satisfactory. And it's a combination of many different factors. Not particularly because of one specific isolated factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Shiret from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Tony Shiret from Credit Suisse. Just a couple of questions for me. You talked about Spain earlier. If you look at your slide six, you can calculate that Spanish sales were up 1.5% in the first half and at the beginning of the quarter, your store numbers were up 7% year-on-year in Spain. That seems to imply that Spanish like-for-likes are probably down 3 to 4%. First of all, can you comment on that? But it does seem that's a bit more than slightly below the average. Secondly, can you comment on your inventories being 19% ahead? And lastly, can you give us a sales guidance figure or some indication for the next financial year, not just this one? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding your question about the Spain globally from the point of view of a sales growth in the Spain globally, well the figure you have provided -- the real figure is slightly higher than what you have said, but is not very different from what you have said.</p>
          <p>Regarding space growth in Spain, it is slightly below the figures you have provided and then what you also must assume in Spain that contribution from newer space is lower than the average. That is what I would say. But I don't want to enter into the details, as I was saying before, of any specific performance in one particular market.</p>
          <p>Regarding inventories what we can say right now, -- well, first of all, what you have heard for have us many different times. Now that what we have here, what we monitor very closely is the evolution of commitments -- of purchasing commitments much more than the evolution of inventories. In any case, what we can transmit to you regarding inventories is that currently our inventories are growing even below our sales growth. If you don't take the picture, at the end of July, if you take the picture mid-September, our inventories are growing even below sales growth. But this is not a real concern for us. I remember when we published our first quarter results and we talked a lot about the inventories figure. And you have seen later on at the end of the season that there was nothing dramatic in that figure as we were transmitting during the conference call.</p>
          <p>And regarding sales guidance for the next year, you must have in mind what we always say that we continue targeting, thinking about million and long-term this 4% like-for-like sales growth evolution. So at this stage, this is what I would transmit regarding the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, to follow-up, nothing you've seen so far this year makes you think that you are going to have a tough time next year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel -- I mean, no, not really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think Spain is going to rebound next year, do you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't like to analyze macroeconomic. I think we could spend hours and hours talking about macroeconomic trends, and probably not only you yourself, Tony, but most of you know much more than what I could know about macro trends knowing in the different markets.</p>
          <p>What we think, if you look -- as I was saying before, we're publishing our first half results. If you think about compound annual growth rate, like-for-like compound annual growth rate is 4%, which is very much in line with our medium and long-term target. Thinking about the next year, at this stage, we continue targeting the normal figure of the evolution of our company -- of course on the different geographies in which we are present.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hello. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions regarding your foreign currency exposure and regarding your gross margin expansion. What percentage of your stores is in US dollars and currencies backed to US dollar, and what percentage of sales is in dollars and -- yes, currencies backed to it? And I was wondering how your gross profits and sales will be affected if US dollar goes to 1.2, 1.0, and if you have any hedges in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alexis, as you know we're probably one of the retailers which is less exposed to any variation in the dollar. Because if you go to slide number six, you see that the exposure of the dollar in our case comes from the presence we have in the Americas and some of Asian currencies which are backed to the dollar. In total, I would say that no more than 20% of our sales are related to dollar.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, given the sourcing platform that we operate currently our sourcing in dollars is something around one-third of what we source approximately. So the net short position in dollars that we have is around $400 million per year. So as you can say, is not very relevant, okay? We have a natural match between our sales and our sourcing. So that position we cover part of it. So all in all, to summarize, our exposure to the dollar is not very relevant, and it's never been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, I understand. And your growth profit margin has expanded. What drives this expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the 71 basis points is composed of many differing factors coming from mark-ups, markdowns, currency, mix. So to enter into the details of 71 basis points, I don't think is relevant. Our policy, as you know, as we mentioned, what we target is a broadly stable gross margin. And this is what we expect looking forward.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, couple of questions. Firstly, to carry on from what you said to Tony, what has been the EBIT performance from Spain year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I think there is one very relevant factor talking about Spain. As we have mentioned, we have discussed the trends in terms of sales in the sense that like-for-like is slightly over the average. But what you have to bear in mind and this is very relevant about Spain, and the translation of that into profitability is quite different. Why is that? Because most of the expansion we're doing in Spain, we have no CapEx there. We are requiring mall owners to pay for refurbishment.</p>
          <p>This means that even under the scenario in which like-for-likes may be slightly below the average, we are able to sustain the profitability in Spain in a very strong way. Why? Because we have no additional CapEx in the country. This is why there is not a direct correlation between what we're talking about of like-for-like sales and EBIT performance. In fact, Spain is a market that we know very well. We are extremely comfortable in Spain. We expand selectively and in fact we are launching a new concept, Uterq&#xFC;e, in Spain with 15 stores as of today. And our results are well above expectations. So to my message is, do not take below average like-for-like into any kind of sharp deterioration of profitability in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And on a separate topic, could you tell us whether there has been any evolution of the geographical sourcing mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No particular changes. We maintain more or less 35% of our sourcing in Asia. We maintain 50% in proximity and 15% mainly in Turkey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So no significant change during this year. And we are not expecting significant changes looking forward. You always could say one or two points. But for us proximity sourcing is key regarding our business model as you perfectly know. And we are -- our aim is to maintain this proximity sourcing to be able to react during the season to have this flexibility of our business model which is something absolutely key for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Frans Hoyer from PI Ideas [Proactive Independent Ideas]. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just trying to understand your language about the first six weeks of Q3 and being similar to same period last year. I unfortunately don't know what that period was like in Q3 last year, but I do know that sales were up 14%, 15% or so in Q3 last year. Is that what you are aiming for in Q3 this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not referring to the same period of previous year. We are referring to the same -- to the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's -- so the six weeks are similar in terms of sales growth to the top line development in the second half last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In any case, I think that the relevant period is not what is going on in the first six weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is much more relevant what I was saying before that what we are targeting is like-for-like sales growth in the second half above higher than like-for-like sales growth in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Much more than the evolution in the first six weeks. What we want to say with that is that there is no deterioration in the evolution of the sales of the company in the beginning of the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the gross margin, there seems -- the first half was up, but if you look at the first quarter and the second quarter, I think Q1 was up and Q2 was flat. What is the key difference between or the biggest difference between the margin evolution in the second quarter versus the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know Frans, we manage the gross margin over a season, not over a quarter. And this is why we mention at the end of the first quarter that you should look at the whole of the six months to extrapolate the gross margin performance. And what we discuss is that we were expecting broadly stable gross margin for the year. And with the first half, we can say that we are pleased, 71 basis points increase in the gross margin. I believe this -- we have to say we're very pleased with the performance of the gross margin in this first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But you mentioned increased promotional activity. Has that been a factor in Q2 -- more of a factor in Q2 as compared to Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that we have to compete in the market what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>71 basis points, I think, is a very good result. We're very pleased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what we envisage and what we sustain is the target of a broadly stable gross margin looking forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Briefly on CapEx, you mention, I think, what you're saying is 950 million CapEx for the current year including the final leg of the big capacity expansion in logistics. And I was wondering -- and then you seemed to suggest there won't be any further logistics investments, not on that scale anyway until let's say as we close in on 2012, as you will be sufficient -- you have sufficient capacity to cater for that growth right through to that period. What, sort of, CapEx should we then look at for '09 for instance and '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is -- because one thing which is very relevant regarding our results is the strong cash flow generation. Another thing which is very relevant is the efficiency regarding the CapEx. And as you were saying, we are completing this year this strong strategic logistic investment plan. Once we have completed it, in the next three years '09, '10 and '11, we will not have to go through investment, logistic investments similar to those we have been going through in the last three years. So regarding the CapEx with this 15% space growth you should expect CapEx if there is any growth in any case below 5%. So CapEx evolution will be very, very moderate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Below 5% per annum...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From the level in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the level of '08 which will be the same level as in '07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay, got you. Okay. And so how soon -- how much before 2012 would you have to initiate a second batch of expansion in logistics? I guess the lead time must be one year or at least I would have thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That is why we are saying that we have with this logistic plan we have enough capacity until 2012 included. And that is why I was saying that in the next three years you should not expect big logistic investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So nothing, no boom again in 2012 or 2011?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Richard Chamberlain from JPMorgan. You have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning gents. Three questions please. First of all, your comment on Massimo Dutti, why the sales and store opening rate was much lower than the other formats, why was that? Is that a timing issue? Are you deliberately cutting back expansion of Massimo Dutti in some markets?</p>
          <p>Second question is just on gross margin again. I just wondered if I could sort of try and tease out of you whether the currency impact in Q2 was significantly different than Q1? And third on costs, do you have any new cost initiatives coming through in the second half to better match the rate of cost growth with sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, regarding your question about Massimo Dutti, what was -- what we mentioned, the main effect comes from the double digit like-for-like comparable of Massimo Dutti in 2007. This is the main reason. The second reason, it's true that the space, the number of openings in Dutti is slightly below the average, but not significantly. Massimo Dutti has opened around 40 stores in the last 12 months. So obviously it's a good rate of growth, but when you compare it with the Group it's clearly below the average. But nothing as to stop the expansion of Massimo Dutti, on the contrary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding currency, basically as you know currency is something that again we have to look at it on six months basis. We cannot look at it on a quarterly basis because the impacts of currency both from a reported point of view and from a hedging point of view must be seen on a seasonal basis. And again we, as you can see the gross margin evolution has been positive. We still have a currency translation impact but mainly on the topline. But it has not affected significantly the results of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Richard. About the continuous process of getting efficiencies for introducing cost, I can provide you some examples. For example, logistic level we are during this period working in improvements in the consolidation of the land transportation between Zara and the rest of the formats getting savings through this way.</p>
          <p>We have signed a new agreement with Aeroflot for the export to Russia. At the store level, for example, we have initiatives for increasing the efficiency using the DVD for a better schedule of the timetable at store level and increasing the productivity. Or global -- new global agreements with the supplier for the maintenance and cleaning services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Okay. And that's all coming -- so that should all help to reduce the gap between sales growth and cost growth in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You know that because the operational cost had to be analyzed in a period of one year, what you can see in the first half is that we are controlling strictly the cost and we are growing below the space growth. And for the full year we maintain the same guidance that we provided two years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is to follow-up a little bit on your trading update. You say that you have seen in the first six weeks a continuation of the trends seen in the first half. I wonder whether this means that or the way now is quite irrelevant in the first six weeks of the second half. You are still seeing 4% compounded average growth in like-for-like over the last two years.</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be on pricing. How are you seeing pricing performing in the current difficult trading environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you mean pricing in the different markets or --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pricing in -- yeah, in the different markets. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding your second question -- regarding your first question, we would say more or less the same we have already said. That it is just the beginning of the second half, and we prefer not to enter into many details. I mean, we will -- there will be a moment in which we will have to talk about like-for-like sales evolution in each particular country, in each particular day, which is something a little bit crazy. But regarding your second question, and regarding pricing, we are not seeing any relevant difference...</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay then, on the training update, put it in another way, have you got any signs to think that 4% compounded growth in like-for-like that you've reported in the first half, will be difficult to obtain in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. I have two questions. The first one is regarding the share price at this moment. With the share price at this level, is the company thinking in any buyback program or something similar? And my second question is regarding the new lower CapEx expectations. This will imply a higher future dividend, or is the company going to change a little bit its dividend policy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, both questions are related. Regarding our dividend policy and the way we return back money to the shareholders, it doesn't change, but it implies something, because our policy is that we feel comfortable with a neutral balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We feel comfortable with a situation in which we do not have debt and we do not have cash. If we are generating more cash, this would have an impact regarding the dividend in the future. So no change in the dividend policy because the policy, I would say, is very consistent. Share buybacks is something we are not considering having -- we think in our case that the best way to return money to our shareholders is through the dividend.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Hughes from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. It's Andrew Hughes calling from UBS. I've got another question on gross margin. I know you only talk about it on a half-by-half basis. But looking at the 70 basis point improvement in the first half, how does that split down between level of markup and the markdown change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, it's not only markup and markdown. It's mix, it's currency, it's volume of discounts. So to split that 71 basis points into that, from our point of view, is impossible. There is no single relevant factor. This is what I can tell you. It's a number of the small factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you can't give us a markdown movement for the half, on the half before?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I mean is the gross margin has gone up by 71 basis points. I think that says everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The markdowns were higher, were they, this half than the previous half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But again, I mean, it's not relevant, it maybe marginal but nothing relevant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, bear in mind that last year we produced a 7% like-for-like, and this year on a compound basis it's a 4% like-for-like with 1%. But again, the evolution of the gross margin is highly satisfactory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And when you talk about promotions and promotional activity, are you just referring to markdowns, or are you doing more in full price selling periods to drive sales? So are you being sharper in terms of entry price points? Are you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...making more promotions within the full price season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We are not talking any -- in our case, we have not changed our commercial policies at all. No, no, this may be the case by -- in other operators. But we are not changing our commercial policies at all of trying to maximize full price sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of how your sales growth splits down between more customer visits and average selling price. Is there any change in that average selling price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No changes in average selling price. In our case, like-for-like is always an increase in the number of product that we sell. It's difficult to know because, in our case, being a fashion retailer, it may have a mix impact. But in our case it's a product. It's the quality of the product that we have the right fashion which drives like-for-like. Nothing on pricing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, in the tradition of follow-up questions. Just one thing you said in response to my first question, I was wondering why the new stores in Spain are converting at a lower rate to sales growth than elsewhere in the Group. Is it some cannibalization effect? One would have thought they should have actually converted quicker into sales than in more immature countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not the case, Tony. So I don't see where you derive that conclusion from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got loads of stores in Spain, everyone knows you, so a new store should convert into ultimate sales level far quicker than in a country where you're not known.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is because we are talking about, in most of the cases, new shopping malls, which have their own ramp-up period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what is the typical difference, then, between the ramp-up in the Group and in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean this is not pure mathematics, no? But you could assume, perhaps you could assume one year more for the ramp-up period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what level of cannibalization are you suffering in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in a significant way, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say not significant, do you mean the Group context, or in the Spain context?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This -- but you also must have in mind, because Marcos was talking about that just before, that regarding profitability the conditions in which we go to these new shopping malls are so good that if we think about global profitability, there is no cannibalization at all. If you think about sales, I would say that much more than cannibalization, it has to do with the ramp-up period of these new shopping malls in which we are locating these new stores that we are opening in Spain. A new shopping mall always takes some time, and that is what is being the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically the reason why the profitability is okay, is because you're not paying any capital costs because the developer is paying those. So, on a fully costed basis the picture would be pretty different, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but we also adjust personnel expenses to sales, having in mind the number of people we have at these stores. We have talked about that several times when we were talking about cost control initiatives. So from the point of view of global profitability, there is not a significant difference. And as I was saying to you before, from the point of view of sales, nothing dramatic, but the conversion is slightly lower because of the ramp-up period of these new shopping malls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Robert Miller from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can I ask about CapEx? Where is the efficiency coming in the CapEx line? Is it simply because you're not spending as much outside the store opening program, or is it efficiencies in the cost of opening new stores, or is it a geographical issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has to do with managing more efficient -- in a more efficient way our capital. I mean, we are investing more efficiently when we are talking about new openings. We are investing more efficiently when we are talking about logistic investments. It's not -- you cannot isolate this. Of course, we are negotiating in a better way with shopping mall developers regarding capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>So it's a combination of different factors. There is not one specific thing to say, this is coming from whatever, or from this particular thing. So it's a combination of many different factors. Globally, we are investing in a much more efficient way, and this is an area in which we are working every day to invest in a more efficient way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is your average fit-out cost of a Zara store now lower than it was 12 months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The average, having in mind what we pay, yes, because CapEx is growing below space growth in a significant way. So it's evident that it's less costly, no? But as I was saying to you before, it has to do with efficiency, regarding the way we invest and it also has to do with negotiations with the shopping mall developers, it has to do with many different factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I ask about pricing? Obviously a lot of retailers are talking about the need to pass on some price inflation. You're in a relatively good position from a supply chain perspective. If across Europe, retailers are passing on price inflation in clothing over the next 12 months. What would your tactical response be to that? No change to your price levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not planning any change. Our pricing policies is stable in the different markets, and this is what we are planning to continue doing during the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I finally just ask Antonio on the cost comments? Given that 70% of your cash costs are personnel and rent expenses, which are pretty local to geographic countries, how can your -- the cost impact -- sorry, the currency impact on your costs only be half that of your -- on your sales? Can you explain that to me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because as you can image, where this currency speculation takes place, tend to be countries in which both the rental expenses and personnel expenses are lower as a percentage of sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's <mark type="inaudible" /> Ben from Citigroup. Two questions if I may. Firstly, just on the total store openings in the first half, in broad terms can you give us a breakdown of how much of your store openings were in Spain, versus the rest of Western Europe, Asia and the Americas? And secondly, just for your first six weeks, the comparative you're up against, is that -- should I assume that's similar to the rest of the second half, which I believe was around plus 3%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the second question, as you know, in the first half last year, our comparable is 7% in the second half. It was 3% for a total like-for-like year performance in the year of 5%. And your first question, if you don't mind, what I will do is to -- we can't tell you that on the call because it's a very -- it's a lot of minutia so we prefer, if that's all right with you, we can cover that on the telephone later on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to my second question, the question was on the six weeks, is the comparative the same for the six weeks as for the rest of the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't provide like-for-like. It's just on a seasonal basis, six months. So to talk about -- but nothing relevant on that part. And what I -- we would like to stress is that our target, obviously it's our goal, that like-for-like in the second half we will try to achieve higher than in the first half.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a follow-up. Luca Cipiccia from Goldman Sachs. I was wondering if you could spend some time on Uterq&#xFC;e. You made some comments in the presentation and in the press release on the initial reception. If you could remind us what the expansion plan is?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I was just wondering if given the environment that you're seeing, consumers shopping less and less inclined to do so. Whether from a strategic standpoint is there any measure, or initiative?</p>
          <p>Are you looking into maybe opening the option to some more targeted advertising or anything of that kind to just stimulate interest? I'm just curious to know how you see that changes in the consumer landscape could bring any new attempt to again attract people on the streets coming to your stores compared to what has happened so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well regarding Uterq&#xFC;e, what we can say is what we were saying during the presentation that we are satisfied with the initial results and that these results are above our expectations. We are planning to open between now and the end of the year another 15 Uterq&#xFC;e stores so at the end of the year we will have around 30. And for the next year you could expect a similar figure, somewhere around 20 -- between 15 and 25 stores for Uterq&#xFC;e, mainly located in big cities because the type of concept is particularly appropriate for big cities. And we are beginning also the international expansion of Uterq&#xFC;e.</p>
          <p>We are doing with all the different formats. Probably we can say that we are quite satisfied with this launching and that it has been very well received by customers, and very good comments, very positive about the product, about service, about the store itself. It has been very, very well received. And regarding the management of our company, what we think is that what we need to do is to have the best product at the best price, at the right moment everywhere. This is what we are trying to do.</p>
          <p>What I would like to remark, having in mind that this is the last question, is what we were saying during the presentation that we have seen good reception of our autumn/winter collections in the different markets and this is what we need to continue doing to maintain our business model with this flexibility and to try always to offer to our customers the best product regarding fashion, quality and pricing. And this is what we are trying to do.</p>
