      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I am going to speak in English because we have a lot of people watching this presentation on the other side of the channel. As usual at this period of time I will not make a lot of comments, I would let Pierre-Andr&#xE9; bring into the details of the result of 2008 and what we think about 2009.</p>
          <p>Only two things about 2008. First, it's another very good year for Danone. And most important for me or more important for me is the end of the year, because as we told you in November, our visibility about the end of the year was not so good. And at the end of the day <mark type="inaudible" /> we will see that in detail, but I think that what we achieved, even the quarter four is a beautiful result for us. So we have good news, bad news, average news, whatever, but at the end of the day the model of Danone is still incredibly well working.</p>
          <p>The second good news for me is Numico. And I remember all the questions you asked us about difficult for Danone, the first time you swallow so big company, different countries, two businesses, you know nothing about the businesses, what about the management, everybody is going to quit the company, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla. And I can tell you that the success of the integration of Numico is more than 100%. And it's not even an integration; I think we accelerate the good result of Numico and you will see that and that will continue.</p>
          <p>About 2009, I am not going to be the very happy guy saying we are better than the other. We know everything, we have a good vision, no. The reality is a reality. The world is declining in every country. And I remember your surprise when Emmanuel explained to you in November what is the question, obviously the emerging country would slow down, obviously, and that was a surprise for you that a consumer goods company told you very frankly that we don't plan the same growth in the emerging country for the future. I confirm.</p>
          <p>Except that, the issue for me in 2009 is to find a way to pilot the company the best way. It's exactly, if I take an illustration, when you drive a Ferrari on a dry road or on a road with a lot of snow. The road is full of snow. So we have to be very careful. We have to change, not change, but we have to confirm our mindset, the way we manage people. We have to be very close with them. I asked to all of our manager to call to their manger every week, not a very strong reporting, just a discussion, how are you, what are your trouble, what -- how could we help you, that kind of very simple thing, which make the management very, very close.</p>
          <p>The thing I can say is that the management of Danone, I am not talking about Bernard, Emmanuel and myself, I am talking about the 1,000 managers of Danone. They really want to benefit of this crisis. They want to take benefit of this crisis. They want to create a bigger gap with competition. They are confident that the culture and the de-centralization culture of Danone is a competitive advantage. And they know exactly on which items they have to focus for the next year. And you will see, perhaps <mark type="inaudible" /> during my comment. There is a one which is not a new one for us, but something very important for us which is market share, because market share is the right indicators to tell you if you have to accelerate or slow down.</p>
          <p>If you are winning market share means you grow because you have different ways to grow. You can benefit from the business itself or you can gain on your competitor during a crisis to make volume of value earned. Gaining market share is very important, means if you remember what I explained to you, which is the best tools we have in this company, roll out best practices. Perhaps, that is the best thing we know the best to do, roll out best practices, means that the only thing we have to do in 2009 is to look at what is working, in which context, and if it is working, we roll out very, very, very, very quickly. And I will give you one example about the product I read a lot of stupid things at the time being, Actimel.</p>
          <p>Actimel in Spain, just now is growing double-digits again, because of a new mix in term of advertising, price positioning, new taste and so on. So we are -- it's a very -- brand new evolution for us. It's a very new, means perhaps three weeks, four weeks. We have to roll out, we will <mark type="inaudible" /> if we have to roll the campaign. It's a one minute advertising campaign, explaining very clearly what Actimel is. So if it is really positive, we will roll out it. And we will roll out it in a country where we think the growth could be. If we think the growth will be not there, we will not roll out because we have to put effort where we will gain a really solid return.</p>
          <p>I've got a lot of questions about Essensis, why do we stop Essensis? And please, we are not a carmaker. So when we stop a product, it's not very expensive for us, and at the end of the day, if you do nothing, you will stop nothing.</p>
          <p>Okay. So Essensis, we stopped it, because we feel that we need three or four years perhaps to improve the quality of the scientific illustration, the benefit. We explained to you in November that that will work, if we find -- if the consumer finds a way to measure by himself the effect of the product. I think it's too early for a product like this. It does not mean that it does not work.</p>
          <p>Scientifically speaking it works, and we continue to support the product in Italy and Spain, just to improve, let's say, the marketing mix of the product. But we stop it because after four, five years you will ask me the same question you asked me this morning, how much does it cost? And we are not in a position for the time being to spend money and to take risk, because we need this money to support Activia which is a 25 years old product, which is going to achieve more than 2.5 billion at the world level, which is still growing double-digit everywhere. So for me, the strategy of the company is an add value strategy for our product definitively.</p>
          <p>The best product we have, the ones which are the best are the health positioning product definitively. Base business is another story. We try to find solution, the best news for us is that product like Activia, Actimel, Danacol -- Danacol is now the number six of the dairy range.</p>
          <p>If I go to the Baby Food and Clinical Nutrition, you'll see the result. They are wonderful. We had some, let's say, exceptional explanation of that. But the base business of these two categories are incredibly resisting, which is normal, not very difficult to understand, and still is growing very strongly.</p>
          <p>The water, you have to divide by two; emerging country, and you remember what I explained about our geographical portfolio in water, which is mainly China, Indonesia. I said China, I am not thinking about Wahaha, I'm thinking about <mark type="inaudible" /> which are doing very well.</p>
          <p>China, Indonesia, Mexico and Argentina and France, Spain and UK exporting Evian, just to give you a flavor.</p>
          <p>Now 60% of our volume are done in these new countries where we grow double-digits. Even in Mexico, even Brazil, time being. So obviously the value is less, but the value is now 52%, our total water sale. So we are working on this subject. If we are in an emerging country in -- let's say Western Europe countries like France, Spain and UK.</p>
          <p>But we have some good signal, especially in market share, because globally Evian is gaining market share. So we think that will take time, but I think it's a business we still have to focus on.</p>
          <p>So now I will let -- I will let Pierre-Andr&#xE9;, as I call him Pat, which is Pierre-Andr&#xE9;. Normally I call him Patrick. So Pierre-Andr&#xE9;, if you want to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So good morning to all. This is Pierre-Andr&#xE9; Terisse speaking. I'll run through -- I'll run you through the results before I hand over back to Franck, and we go for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I'd start first with -- yeah -- the summary pages, which give a glance on all the main indicators of the company, and which basically says that all the targets which we set ourselves at the beginning of the year and then during the rest of the year have been achieved. That's obviously the case with sales, which amounted to 15,220 million and grew like-for-like 8.4%. That's the case of the margin, which has grown 56 basis points like-for-like, which is above the 40 to 50 basis points we indicated at the end of first semester. That's the case of EPS, which has grown 15.1% in line with the 15% at least. And that's the case as well of the free cash flow for which we had not specified any target, but which was grown not only in absolute value strongly but also in percentage of sales, you will see that later on.</p>
          <p>I look at the evolution of our sales, the growth of our sales of over the past few years and the evolution -- the benchmark to our guidance. I think what you can see on this screen is basically a demonstration of two things. Number one, the confirmation of our ability to deliver what we commit to.</p>
          <p>And number two, the fact that the Danone model as we have defined it after the Numico acquisition, and even in a very specific context is working. If you want to split these figures, dairy is -- out of 8.4% dairy contributing 7.7% growth and water 1.9, Baby 17 and Medical 12.7.</p>
          <p>If you have a look at evolution of the margins, you got three blue blocks, which stands for, on the left side full-year 2007 as reported. In the middle, full-year 2007 pro-forma, which means as per the addition of Numico for last year and after the accounting for the change of accounting method of Wahaha, which is now in equity and it gets to a base of 14,468 million, and on the right side you've get full-year 2008.</p>
          <p>There are two main block of elements explaining the variance in performance, first currency on scope. Scope being the addition of two small subsidiaries, Japan and Chile mainly, and currency which has basically weighted on your sales growth by 3.5%. If you strip that out, the rest is what we call the organic performance, which is 8.4%, made of 2.8% of volume and 8.4% of value &#x2013; sorry 5.6% of value for a total of 8.4%.</p>
          <p>If you have -- look at the same chart for the Q4 analysis, an important element to notice is the related weight of the volume and price and the total growth, which has been indeed 6% for the Q4 on the high part of the rage of 5 to 6% which we gave ourselves during the Investor Seminar of November.</p>
          <p>The value part has obviously decreased significantly by 3.3 against the average and that's a result of basically the timing of the price increase, which was mainly at the end of 2007, very beginning of 2008 and volume on the other hand stands at plus 3.7%, this is an average for the year of 2.8%.</p>
          <p>I will now go through the various divisions of the Group starting with Dairy, which has made a good year in 2008, a year, first of all, where we'd been able to protect the margins after the increase of the cost of milk which took place at the end of 2007 to digest it, and yet to grow mainly for price indeed but to grow altogether 7.7%.</p>
          <p>The total performance on volume has been minus 0.6% for the year, value 8.3% which has been made approximately 1% of mix and the remaining as price. If you look at Q4, Q4 has obviously decreased in terms of growth because of price effect is steadying away. Its been growing at 3.5% with volume growth of minus 0.3%, in line with what was delivered during the third quarter, which means that the evolution of the volume has been stabilized.</p>
          <p>Important factors regarding Dairy by geography first, we have seen a very good fourth quarter. Western Europe, big countries in Western Europe being Italy, Spain, France, Germany and the UK recovering compared to the trends which we have seen during the rest of the year. You remember that in Q2 specifically and Q3 France was very difficult, the situation has improved.</p>
          <p>On the other hand and on the other side of the Atlantic, we've seen America is suffering. We have talked to you about Mexico during the last quarter, which has had difficult performance, this has continued, and the US with Danone had a difficult quarter as well with negative values.</p>
          <p>It had difficult performance with negative values, but not on the back of blockbusters which have continued to perform well, as they have continued to perform well for all the geographies.</p>
          <p>One of the things which has been observed consistently across all the quarters of 2008 has been, and we have mentioned that several times and this is confirmed in Q4, the relative high performance of blockbusters compared to the rest of the range, which again, has essentially continued during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If you take them one by one, Activia has been obviously still growing very fast, as Franck mentioned. Danacol is still growing extremely fast at levels above 30%. On the other hand Actimel, had some less growth, as we mentioned that again in the last quarter that we are fixing the issue as we talk.</p>
          <p>In dairy in 2008 and 2009, we will continue and we continued to launch renovation of online expansion. You have examples on this chart, which are Activia Drink, Danacol in Poland, Savia in Canaries, essentially we will be acting on three fronts.</p>
          <p>Number one and the most important one for this product, of course, is to keep reinforcing the benefit of understanding of our product by the consumer and therefore the value for the consumer.</p>
          <p>Number two to keep bringing value to the consumer through line expansion and marketing activities. And then three, again to continue bring value to the consumer through an adequate price positioning.</p>
          <p>I'll speak to Water, the second of our division by size. What we've seen in Q4 has been basically the continuation of the trends which have developed and been observed during the whole of 2008 with volume growth of 3.8%, and which has been fueled by predominantly the non-emerging countries, the one which Franck mentioned.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand a negative value effect, which is coming from the fact that Western Europe or what we call the industrialized countries have continued decelerating, and therefore as per this negative mix resulting in the negative growth for the quarter.</p>
          <p>If you have looked at the following page you can visualize these trends very well. See that in the industrialized countries, the trend has been confirmed with a minus 14.6% value during Q4 2008. This has come predominantly from the UK, of course, from France, but also from Spain.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; we have been for the past few months and we continue addressing this issue through a number of initiatives about the environment, about the perception of the quality of the water by the consumer, these are things which will take time. We are very confident about our ability to implement them and the improvement will come gradually.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, developing markets, which now represent 52% of our Water division and this percentage is obviously increasing year-after-year, has been confirming the trends of the growth which is double-digits and which even if it's a bit counterintuitive in some cases has been basically confirming and showing no sign of weakness, whether in Mexico, whether in Indonesia, in Argentina or other countries. So this part of the business is extremely sound.</p>
          <p>In Water again, I mentioned the initiatives we are taking in Western Europe to strengthen the position of our brands and the perception of the quality of Water. On top of that we keep adding some innovations. One of them is Touche de Fruits, which I have here on my table. I encourage you to drink. There is only 2% sugar. It's very good and very healthy.</p>
          <p>Another one is Brazil. We have started the rollout of Bonafont in this country. Too early to talk about figures, of course, because it's only a couple of months, but it's basically doing on track and even better than what we expected. So we'll keep you updated about that.</p>
          <p>Baby Nutrition, that's been a fantastic year and a fantastic quarter, historical performance, with a 17% growth during the year, 20% growth during the quarter. Obviously there are some specific elements which explain the performance. One of them is the low base from last year following the adjustment of inventories we did after acquiring Numico. And the other one is obviously the expansion of our market share in China for the past three months which has been remarkable.</p>
          <p>This being said the business continues to be extremely sound, both in volume and in value and as well in terms of market share, taking market share everywhere, in all countries with an underlying performance which we assessed being for the fourth quarter of 10 to 11%, driven with the same mix of volumes, mix and pricing.</p>
          <p>Again, in this division we keep innovating and strengthening the benefit perception by the consumer and we basically work on two different concepts of blockbusters as we will call them in dairy, one is Actimel Immunity and the other one is Bebelac, complete nutrition, with different price positioning and with different value to the consumer and working as well on extending the range for this product.</p>
          <p>Last division, Medical Nutrition, which has been growing in line with the full-year trend and the medium term expectations at 12.1% for the quarter. That is obviously because a very significant part of the product of this division are under investment. There is obviously less exposure to the evolution of the environment with a few exception was -- one being the US. All the products and all the categories are growing. That is the case of Fortimel. For the independents that's the case of <mark type="inaudible" /> growth, that is the case of Neocate for allergy relief. And we are really focusing our energy now on this disease-targeted products.</p>
          <p>Again, innovation, as I said, we will be pushing on the selection of products which we think have the potential to grow fast and deep and wide. That is the case of Fortimel for which we are going to switch to a compact version during the first quarter of this year. That is the case as well with KetoCal which is a food dedicated to people subject to epilepsy.</p>
          <p>If you now look at the geography you would surprisingly find the reflection of what I have said about the division. Europe has been growing 2.6%, the slowdown being attributable for a large part to the pricing, with two parts, Western Europe which has been more difficult because of Water principally, and Eastern Europe on the other hand, which has kept growing well.</p>
          <p>In Asia, the growth has been strong in all markets. It's been particularly strong in Baby Food in China, but it's also been very strong in Indonesia with our subsidiary Aqua in water. And in the rest of the world the performance was softer at 8.6% growth with strong performance of the Latin American countries with the exception of Mexico. And on the other hand, as I mentioned, a lower performance than the previous quarter in the US for dairy.</p>
          <p>I'll now switch to the profitability and the margins, starting with the break down of the operating income between trading operating income and other operating items. You've got from the other operating items, minus &#x20AC;83 million, which compares to minus &#x20AC;57 million at the end of the first semester, which makes an addition of slightly more than 20, which is related to legal provisions, on which I am not going to comment further for obvious reasons. The other part is obviously the trading operating income, which stands at 2,270 million, equivalent to a margin of 14.91%.</p>
          <p>Elements of improvement of this margin, again, the three blocks. We've got full-year 2007 reported. We go to the pro forma, thanks to the addition of Numico and the change of consolidation effect for Wahaha, which brings 130 basis points. There are impacts, all negative from translation country mix and scope of consolidation, and then the addition of continuous input costs, operational performance brings a margin of &#x2013; margin evolution of 53 basis points, again higher not only than the guidance expressed at the beginning of the year, but even than the 40 to 50 we gave later on.</p>
          <p>These 53 basis points, is -- number one, helped by the Numico synergies, which you will remember contributed 25 basis points at -- during the first semester. They now contribute for the full year 34 basis points out of the 53. The remaining part is essentially operating leverage. And there is also the management with, of course, a very significant impact of the increase of the cost of raw material this year compared to last year with a negative 191 bps 2008 total compared to 2007 total. And on the other hand, the positive effect from the price increase taken as a result.</p>
          <p>Again, if you look by division first and then by geography on -- in Dairy the majority of the improvements come from Western Europe, they come in particular from Spain, Germany, the UK and the Benelux, France as on each side contributing negatively to the evolution of the margin. Outside Europe, the margin improvement was supported by Brazil.</p>
          <p>On Waters, the negative change of the margin was -- is coming almost exclusively from Western Europe, of course, with a very strong negative leverage effect which has been partly, but only partly compensated by the positive leverage in emerging countries.</p>
          <p>And in Baby, there was improvement in all areas, of course, with the reflection of the synergies as well, but margin improvement in all the raw markets and more especially in Asia.</p>
          <p>If you look by geography, Europe was of course negatively impacted by France as I mentioned and by Water while Eastern Europe and the other European countries contributed positively.</p>
          <p>Asia, same as sales, it's China, Indonesia leverage, and the rest of the world. So positive contribution of Brazil offset almost completely by a negative contribution from the US and Mexico.</p>
          <p>Going though the operating income to the net income, you know this table and on the left hand side you've got 2007 then 2008 in three columns, reported, non-current items and the underlying part. I'll focus first on the non-current items.</p>
          <p>I've commented already on the elements on the operating side, which is &#x20AC;83 million. For the rest there is &#x20AC;269 million on the net income of discontinued activities, which comes from the finalization of the sale of our Biscuit division during the first semester. And you can see a negative &#x20AC;142 million, which is attributable to a mechanical impairment <mark type="inaudible" /> due to the evolution of the market price.</p>
          <p>Looking at the underlying part from 200 -- sorry &#x20AC;2, 270 million operating income. The financial expenses stood at &#x20AC;442 million better than the pro forma, that's under an improved base, while the interest rates have been in average 4.75% for the year with the second semester slightly higher, because of the different elements of our debts. As you know, we've been issuing long-term debts and therefore taking higher spreads. Altogether we expect this level to be continuing for 2009.</p>
          <p>Income tax I'll come back on that, 429 million, and then no major change on the underlying. Income tax, you remember, we mentioned during the first semester, that income tax rates had fallen from slightly over 27% to 24.5, if I am not mistaken. We see full year 23.5%, which we see as something sustainable for the coming years, around 24%. And that's been achieved mainly under two factors, number one, decreases of rates in two countries Germany and Spain, and number two, and most importantly, strong mix elements coming from the acquisition of Numico.</p>
          <p>This has resulted in EPS -- sorry &#x2013; yeah, in an EPS of -- in emerging countries of 1, 230 million for an EPS &#x20AC;2.74, increasing by 16% versus the pro-forma and increasing by 10% versus the historic, which has led the Board to propose a dividend per share of &#x20AC;1.20.</p>
          <p>A word about cash flow, to say that we have done a very good year on this side with the change of working capital, which was negative during the first part of the year, which is now positive with quite a lot of focus on our two new divisions for them being in the negative working capital. They are making progress, and will continue.</p>
          <p>The CapEx stood at 4.6% and altogether we delivered a free cash flow of slightly less than 1.2 billion, 7.8% of sales, progressing versus last year, despite the financial charges which we have been taken from the acquisition of Numico last year. Furthermore, the 7.8% is a significant increase compared to 7.2%, we showed during the first -- during the first semester.</p>
          <p>These have helped reducing the debt. Our financial debt has been reduced by an amount of approximately &#x20AC;400 million. On the other hand, the puts has been growing by 150, which leads us with a prediction of the debt total by &#x20AC;250 million. The equity on its side is showing variance, which reflect the evolution of exchange rate, which as you have seen has been pretty significant for the last three months.</p>
          <p>A word about the debt, I think, it's important we now show it regularly, because we keep strengthening it. I think we have a picture, which is now fully satisfactory with the maturity profile, which is well balanced and which is well in relation with our cash flow capabilities, CP, that's 1.6 million.</p>
          <p>The 2010 maturity, which has dropped down at the moment only for 1.2 million on -- out of the 2.4 billion total possibility. And this has been achieved of course with the new bonds issue, which we have been doing during the second semester.</p>
          <p>On the <mark type="inaudible" /> for the comments, just to reconfirm that there are no financial covenants in any of our financing, and to tell you that we have no coverage of short-term commitments, which is far more than 100%, made of 1.5 billion of undrawn amounts on the syndicated credit line; &#x20AC;3.8 billion on the back up lines; and in addition, 0.5 billion of treasury shares, which cover, on the other hand, 1.6 billion of CP, and &#x20AC;2.9 billion of stock options. So approximately 1 billion of our capacity compared to what we need.</p>
          <p>That's the end of the presentation for finance and for the accounts. I will now hand over back to Franck for further comments and/or questions and answers. Franck?</p>

          <p>Good morning everyone. Pablo Zuanic here from JPMorgan. I have to say, when I look at the dairy business, the lack of volume improvement in the quarter, it's a bit of a concern to me. And when I think of pricing trends, your price realization for the first nine months about 9%, obviously that's easing now about three points for the fourth quarter. How should I think about Dairy in 2009? And really there are so many questions there, but one, for example, would pricing be zero, or is there any element of pricing resilience, particularly in emerging markets, or mix benefits that will come through? That's one question around 2009 Dairy.</p>
          <p>Second, you talked a lot about the growth in blockbuster brands having driven the performance in 2008, and the question that we keep hearing is that blockbusters are recession-sensitive, perhaps, and that they could even be down in 2009. So how do you think about blockbuster growth in 2009 and still being able to drive growth? And lastly, related to Dairy, what is the impact so far of the Eco Packs in Europe and of NutriDay in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And fourth, I would say in the case of Dairy, if I may, just Dairy one question, I'm sorry -- I'll pass it on. The U.S. and Mexico, I don't have much visibility of Mexico, but the U.S. to me, more than the category issue it is just a competition. It's a bit like what we have with private label in the summer here, what's happening with General Mills now there. So how are you responding to that? And I know you're not giving guidance, but how should we really think about Dairy performance and growth in volumes and price in 2009? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I will answer very quickly to the last two questions and let Emmanuel come on the two first. First of all Eco Pack, NutriDay is in tests in the U.S., Eco Pack is not a test in France because we launch it nationally. The only thing I don't want you think is that the strategy of Danone is to enter that kind of category. The strategy of Danone is to continue to drive the market with innovation, add value innovation. If we make Eco Pack in France, that was tactical answer to specific context, the story is that that was quite difficult to list the product in the trade, not because the product is not good, but perhaps somewhere this product was attacking another product category in the shelf where they are making more money.</p>
          <p>Second, it's clear for us that Eco Pack is not the future of our range, but it's clearly the strategy we explained to you, how do we segment vertically a category. Some countries we are testing Eco Pack and NutriDay, some countries like Spain we are using one of our base business, we don't call it Eco Pack but we have a pricing strategy which help us to cover all the consumption. So it's not a new brand, it's not a blockbuster, it's not everything I read, it's just how could we cover the full range of price segmentation, because below Eco Pack you have all the strategy we explained to you, called Affordability Strategy, and even we changed the name now, we call it with our special language Affordvaluity, which means being affordable for the consumer and making money for us. So we are testing in different countries; okay in France the name was Eco Pack because we want to test it. Is it a success? Yes and no, the product is okay where the product is, but it's not a real success in terms of how could we list the product in the trade. If you look at <mark type="inaudible" /> Eco Pack is doing quite well, if you want to look at -- I will not take the fair share but in center of the cities in France it's difficult to find it because we don't succeed to list the product for other reasons and we are not ready to invest money in terms of price-listing in the trade to reference the product.</p>
          <p>NutriDay, the test is comme si comme &#xE7;a for the time being, which is another illustration of what I explained, the success of the Dairy will come from products like Danacol, Activia, na, na, na, na, na, and going to the U.S. Activia is still growing very strongly. Now the base business, as we explained to you, was really attacked by the competition, you are right, in term of promotion, so we have to adapt our tools for the base business, and the blockbuster, not only in the U.S. everywhere, everywhere. It means you will see some transfer from advertising to promotion, not globally but we will have a specific tactical way of supporting our brand, depending if it is a base business, if it s a blockbuster, if it is a product we just launched. And we will also transform the way we support our brand, not only in advertising, as we explained to you in November to speak to the medical community is more and more important for us, and we learn from Numico about this. So I think that we are still incredibly confident in the blockbuster strategy, and let's say, the health benefits of our products. The only thing we already explained, and I already said that at the beginning, the consumer must trust, so we have to improve the credibility of our product and improve the credibility means consumer must see by himself the effect, and that's the reason why you've Danacol. If you have cholesterol at least three or four times per year you will measure your rate of cholesterol so you will have directly the illustration of okay, this product with diet, with obviously perhaps some also some medicament help me to control or to reduce, and it's exactly what we are going to do for every product. It means, for example, for Essensis, one day we will have perhaps a tool, I don't know what, to measure the humidity of your skin. That will come, that will come, we are sure about this, so the only thing is perhaps we were in advance on that process. Emmanuel?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You will have a short answer to your short list of questions. I think that we cannot discuss the way we look at volumes for Dairy in '09 without discussing the outlook, so I will come back to that. Just to finish first on '08, the total market share gain of Danone on a worldwide basis in Dairy in the countries where we operate for 2008 has been more than half a point, globally, compared to the 2007 position, and we have indeed lost market share on the first half of the year 2008, which has been where we were finishing the execution of the price increases. And since the low point of June, we have gained more than two points on the same scope. Our global presence in all the markets where we operate at the end of this year, we came from 26, which was the lower percent market share at the lowest point of last year. In December we were at 28.1. So overall the equation that Franck has just described, talking about a few of our key products, has delivered more growth than for our competitors on our category. I think you can summarize year 2008 for our Dairy business as one where basically we have had flat volumes quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>We had been expecting a rebound and talking with you about a rebound since the early part of this year -- of last year, sorry, and even before, but in the middle of the year, as everybody else, we were "in gradually a more and more difficult economic environment," and indeed, as Franck reminded you, in November we told you we expect we see some weakness signals -- weak signals in emerging markets, and we expect emerging markets to slow down, which has been the case in the fourth quarter and in our scenario will continue to be the case for 2009. If I look, however, at the way our volumes have evolved, I think you also have to look at France versus the rest. I'm sorry to say we're back to another France situation, but the total Dairy sales have grown more than 9% overall in 2008, Dairy sales, I'm not talking volumes only, but Dairy sales outside of France and declined by 4% in France. So you can clearly see that there are different geographies, and the truth about France is roughly I would say the direction is the same for a number of Western Europe countries, which are dragged by the similar macroeconomic patterns than France for the last six months and we expect for the next 12 months. So that's basically what the situation is.</p>
          <p>If you look at our outlook, we have reconfirmed the guidance or the elements &#x2013; or the key elements of the guidance constituencies that we have depicted in November to the financial community for 2009. A few points below our mid-term target range for top line, an improvement in the margin and an EPS which will grow 10% now on a like-for-like basis. This is a change in the target given the volatility of the currencies and their depreciation. We don't want to bet on whatever currency will be by the end of this year and we'd prefer in order to guide you on how we build and continue to build our business to use a like-for-like basis for the EPS. Having said that, today our scenario depicts a 6 to 7% negative impact on our EPS on the currencies, so it means that in real currencies, in real euros, by the end of this year we would expect our target, means that on a historical basis the EPS would grow by 3 or 4%.</p>
          <p>So that's in essence the way we are looking at our targets for this year. It's important for me to remind you that we have depicted a macroeconomic scenario in November. We keep this scenario for 2009, so we believe that there will overall not be any significant improvement in the overall economy nor any dramatic breakdown. We haven't accounted for &#x2013; I don't know -- a huge devaluation in Latin America that would completely change the perspective in Brazil, Brazil is doing pretty well these days overall in a macro standpoint. We have not thought that China is going to close down for the next foreseeable future. We still believe that China will go into and is currently already in a phase of significant slowdown in consumption patterns locally. We think that Russia will continue to be a difficult country for year 2009 as it has been for the back of 2008, so in a sense we are not optimistic for 2009 but we don't think that, or we have built a scenario where we don't think that there would be major breakdowns impacting our business beyond the current, pretty sluggish overall consumption pattern.</p>
          <p>I'm taking time to say that because this has significant impact on the way we manage the Company. We believe that this 2009 situation is a transition, I don't think -- we wouldn't call it a crisis, we would call it a transition towards patterns of consumption, which we think are going to be structurally impacted by the current situation. So there will be a before and there will be an after, and what we've been working on for the last 12 months, and we are working every day, is how the Danone mission will continue to be relevant to our consumers and society beyond 2009 and beyond this transition, and it is very clear that our blockbuster strategy is core to this answer.</p>
          <p>Now how are we going to implement this blockbuster strategy in the new environment? That's the question. We believe that there will be more concern for health, and we are going to therefore continue to improve the health functionality, the benefit and the way the consumer can perceive that benefit in our blockbusters. In the same time we have probably some advantages going through this transition compared to a few of our competitors, which is that we've had terrible headwinds on the milk price inputs for the last 18 months or two years and now we have tailwind. How do we want to use this tailwind? We could put it all in the margin but we could also put it in the price, and it's very clear, looking at what the next consumption pattern will be in a number of key geographies, that we believe that price repositioning will bring significant volume growth opportunities, when we looked at the price elasticity of some of our products and when we also take lessons from the very, very significant price increases that we had to put in 2007 and 2008 and when we looked with you at the impact they had on our volumes.</p>
          <p>So, in essence, we will use 2009 to manage day-by-day how we build the 2010 and beyond story using the tailwind of milk price inputs to make sure that our blockbusters continue to be relevant for a frequent and high penetration consumption by our consumers. So I am saying all of this to say basically that we want to manage 2009 in a way that will do two things; one, prepare the future, meaning that we want to be stronger even than we are today, than we will tomorrow, when we exit this transition phase on a number of indicators including market share, which will be indeed a good acid test of how relevant our strategy will be. We are not going to push growth where we don't think that growth can be reasonably achieved. We will be extremely consistent on pursuing any growth opportunities when and where they make sense, which will be in a number of countries, but I can tell you that we will just plug the pool on a number of growth opportunities that just don't make sense these days, this will be just money lost for nothing. So we will be very pragmatic in the way we manage our growth.</p>
          <p>The one thing that we want to add to the perspective I'm describing is that we want to continue to have a Danone model that delivers superior, profitable, cash-generative growth, and the acid test for this year will be our like-for-like EPS growth, and that's why we are very committed to our target of 10% like-for-like EPS growth. Whether we achieve it by a few points higher sales than our guidance here, we may be lucky and that's fine, or whether we achieve it with even maybe a few, a couple, whatever, several points below the mid-range is also a possibility depending on how all the markets are evolving during this transition, but we will manage the EPS growth through the adjustment of our margin because we spend &#x20AC;1.7 billion of advertising each year and we know what the return on investment of this advertising is and we will be particularly cautious on the cost and cash efficiency of our organization this year.</p>
          <p>I'm sorry for this long introduction to the answer to your questions, but then we can discuss about blockbuster strategy, there is no doubt that we expect our blockbusters to continue to be the drivers, not only in Dairy but this is true for Baby Food as well, for example, to be the drivers of our growth in 2009. Whether there would be volume growth will essentially depend on what I said, we are not going to push growth artificially, this would be nonsense. What I am confident on is that there will be a mixed contribution because precisely of the fact that we will continue to have blockbusters pushing faster than the rest, so there will be a mechanical mix effect in the growth of Dairy and pricing will entirely depend on how much price do we reposition or how much margin do we actually take into our pocket from the tailwind of the milk input prices. So I would not expect, and we said that already in the past, but this is even more true now, we don't expect any significant pricing -- policy pricing effect on the growth of Dairy this year, in a nutshell.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm John Parker from Deutsche Bank. Could I ask one little detailed question and then a broader one? And the detail is on what contribution from Wahaha are you consolidating in these numbers. If any, are you able to give us an indication of that. And just thinking up on this cost issue, are you able to give any sort of quantification for the tailwind on raw materials that you refer to for 2009.</p>
          <p>I think you said that there was an adverse 191 basis points on cost in '08, any sort of guidance that would be helpful, and still on the costs issue. And are you, as part of your plans for this year and looking at your own operating costs more aggressively than in the past, and if so, you have to say anything about that or might there be some significant restructuring announced during the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the first two and Emmanuel will take the last one. On the Wahaha contribution I'm not going to give you details about that just to say that we've been extremely cautious in the way we've treated that, so yes, it's consolidated as an equity investment and therefore we have a contribution from this company. We've been cautious in assessing that and that's all.</p>
          <p>On the raw material tailwind, again, we're not very -- I don't think it makes sense to give a quantification given what Emmanuel explained about the way we're going to actively and dynamically manage the question of the Group in various countries, meaning in all the key geographies during the year, because that will be essentially in the question of volumes, value, margin and with margin costs, which we will have to adapt again dynamically depending on the evolution of the market and what we want to do with the aggression of those markets. On the cost side --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, for 2009 I would say unfortunately there is no doubt that cost of doing business is declining. The costs of GRP, for example, for advertising is declining because less and less people want to advertise so we are able to maintain our volumes of GRPs and advertising at a lower cost than last year, for example. And that applies to a number of the functions of the Company.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we have productivity programs which are ongoing on a long-term basis, and yes, we will be more than ever focusing on the efficiency of our organizations. At the same time, your question on the restructuring, no, we have no plan today. We don't think, we don't want, this is not what and how we want to prepare 2010 and the future. There won't be, in our scenario, in the scenario that I described before, the need to achieve either our numbers for '09 or the Company we want to build for beyond, any large restructuring amount charge taken and big layoffs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on this question, because it's a recurring question about restructuring plan, Danone since, I don't know, 50 years wants to be the lowest cost producer, so that's the reason why we don't have huge plans, suddenly saying we have to close ten factories. We did it with the Biscuit, but clearly in the other businesses we have, let's say, an ongoing efficiency which helps us every year, crisis on crisis, we have to be and our managers have to control their costs and have to be the lowest cost producer and they have to improve their efficiency. And if you remember how do we offset the milk impact, not last year 2008 but 2007, a big part was coming from this, let's say, ongoing efficiency. So obviously, in the time being, we will ask our manager to really focus on that, but nothing special.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Cedric Lecasble, Kepler. I would have a general question on your relationship with the trade and how the situation evolves. They are facing also an equation with lower food inflation and so on, how do things evolve, not only on the current negotiations where you might tell us in the different countries how it's going on, but more generally on the will to organize promotions with you? And are they responsive to more aggressive, eventually longer promotions to help your volumes, to help their sales and could you tell us about that maybe? And in this equation you told us you would monitor the cost savings on milk, what's your best guess today regarding '09? Do you think all the benefits will be reinvested to sustain volume? Could you maybe help us a little bit to understand this equation where you have plusses and minuses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer on the -- I will not help you on the last part of your question, because if you follow what Emmanuel explained and if I translate the way I understood what he said, it's -- we have a target and we have different ways to achieve the target. That's the big news, because as you know every time we fix a target for this Company, if we fix a target it's because we feel we can achieve the target whatever the context. So going back again to what Emmanuel explained, if we have -- even I will not do it but I need two days to explain to you because I have to go product by product, SKUs by SKUs, country by country, businesses by businesses, that the way we will fix our pricing strategy. And also our relation with the trade, everybody is looking to crisis as something negative, okay it's negative, it's obviously easier to grow when everything is doing well than when everything is doing bad, but as I'm used to say I'm always looking to the glass full, not empty. That the case for the relation between the trade and ourselves is as you described very well, perhaps we have some difficult context, but the context is perhaps more difficult for some of them than for us because of their economic model, basically. You are talking about private label, wonderful, okay but private label you have different first price and there are discounts and so on and so on. Means I can tell you we have no difficulties to have top to top meeting focusing on how, mister customer, I can help you to develop, add value, top line growth in your shelf, which is basically the role of the leader of the market.</p>
          <p>And since now ten years ago -- no, sorry, 12 years, I explained to you that the strategy of Danone is to be locally number one with a big gap with number two, means for me the end game will be the leader, private label, first prize, and something around just to -- because you need something else, it could be a local producer, for example, a small one with a specialty. Even <mark type="inaudible" /> now he gets what he wants, and if you read the last declaration of <mark type="inaudible" /> he explains just one thing, I'm going to work with the brands, I'm going to protect the brands, obviously I will negotiate, I will control the inflation of the country. Okay, but basically when he is speaking about brands he is with us, so now we have to give to him the right answer in front of his political positioning, but it's not very difficult, so it's an example.</p>
          <p>The milk, the price of milk &#x2013; something -- just to give you an example, because obviously globally speaking everything that Pierre-Andre and Emmanuel said was true. Just take France. There is now more milk in the market than the industry needs milk. But as Emmanuel said always and as I'm saying always, we are a social responsible company. We have farmers behind us. We continue to buy the milk -- buy the milk. But with the surplus we have to do something, which is less <mark type="inaudible" /> than the milk itself. So for the time being in France, we don't see for us an equation with the milk going down dramatically. So we have to explain that. So we have nothing to transfer. In the same time, you know, I know that the last five years our price or our consumer price grew 2% in Danone Fresh Dairy in France.</p>
          <p>So obviously if you think at the beginning, the price, France is very expensive, so you have to reduce your -- they are not the good assumptions. First of all, France is the second cheapest country of Europe after Germany. France is not the most expensive country of Europe. That's the second one. So you see that we have really to explain and it's exactly what we are doing with the trade by the time being. So in terms of negotiation, as I told you -- since I'm 53 years old, I start in this Company 25 years old as a rep, I see no difference now, 25 years ago, and I think for the next 20 years, let's say, ten years. So clearly the buyer -- a retailer tries to buy cheapest as he can and we try to valorize what we sell to the trade.</p>
          <p>But when you have Activia growing double-digit even in a crisis environment, even in the US or whatever, again -- and I explain that since now ten years, we are very close to the trade because they need also to have product with growing where they are making money. So we will pilot and I think pilot is the right wording for 2009, how could we pilot very, very precisely brand by brand, SKUs by SKUs, country by country and customer by customer. So if I look at it, I will not enter into negotiations. As usual we can decide to fight with somebody because -- not because we hate this guy. Just because he asked us something and if we give in to him, all the other will ask. So it's better to stop and to work with the other, that's all.</p>
          <p>And saying that, don't forget that especially in the emerging countries you know that we have double strategy. One, which is to grow beside our classic big retailers and the other one is to protect and to continue to develop this traditional channel. Okay? And we have specific brands, specific range of product. And especially like country in Mexico, we are now selling product at the cross of roads as you know, if you go in this country. And for the first year we start to make money by selling our product at the crossroad.</p>
          <p>So we are -- I think basically this crisis will help us to reinvent not the Company and the culture because I think that the culture is really adept to this situation and I'm sure that the culture is more and more competitive advantage because we are decentralized, because our people are focusing on their businesses and nothing else. But we will have to reinvent some part of our businesses, the way we drive, the way we are producing. And we can also reduce the cost of production not by making -- by closing factories but perhaps by reinvent the process of some of our products. So -- but as you know we start this not this year. That's the only thing I want you to understand. Danone is not entering in what everybody described as the beginning of the crisis, which is going to be worse within two or three months. Honestly I don't know, I'm just listening. The only thing I know is because of this culture of this company, we don't have to transform the way we work even with the trade because of the crisis. We did it before. <mark type="inaudible" /> strategy is not something we create for the crisis. It's something we create because we have a mission to bring health through food to the maximum number of people. Nothing to do with the crisis, okay?</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Jerry Castle, Redburn Partners. Two questions. The first one is on your Baby Food business. Obviously the reported like-for-like of 20% was an extremely good number but some one-off factors in that. If you were to strip those out, do you think there is any sort of a slowdown in the Baby Food business? And perhaps you could comment specifically on a few of the big markets, maybe the UK, Italy, Indonesia and France obviously? And then the second thing is on A&amp;P spending. In terms of the &#x20AC;1.7 billion that you're spending a year, would you expect that would actually decline in absolute terms in 2009? Or do you think it would maybe go up by less than it has in the usual year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Baby Food, I think I said during the presentation that indeed specific effects. But outside these specific effects we estimate that the underlying growth for the fourth quarter has been 10 to 11%, which considering that there are some pricing effects fading away as well, is a level very much in line with what we expected. If you talk about the evolution of -- by geography &#x2013; sorry -- the underlying trend is positive in all geographies. It's in line with what we had in all geographies. It's accelerating in China of course. Markets globally are far better I think than others. There are some markets which are not growing -- which have not been growing as fast as in the past. France is one example. But because we have been able in all markets to take market shares we keep growing in all markets. So in the performance of -- in the performance you can see besides the specific effects we see very, very sound numbers.</p>
          <p>On the A&amp;P, I would not answer the point specifically with numbers. I would just say that we have no intention of using A&amp;P to make our results. We have no intention of milking. We have an intention to invest wherever we think it makes sense to invest to support the growth because there is potential for growth. That has been the case and will remain the case for 2009.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We've a question now from David Hayes of Nomura . Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks. Just two questions if I can. Just to push my luck a little bit on the guidance for 2009 and perhaps the points that you've made. If we see a breakdown if you like to use your term in terms of the macro and sales were as low as 2 to 3% growth underlying, would you still be confident of margin expansion based on the flexibility you talked about in terms of the cost base. I'm just trying to get a feel for, if you like, how much growth you need to get margin expansion and where that gets at risk in terms of your budgets at the moment?</p>
          <p>My second question is on dividend payout, I think the dividend payout ratio declined marginally from about 44.5 to just about 43.5. Could you just talk again about the dividend policy for the Company and whether that's a ratio that would increase moving forward or whether it will gradually decrease. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, by definition, a breakdown would be a breakdown. So I think we would have to meet again and discuss. If as you said, our sales, in the case of a breakdown would still grow 2 or 3%, I think we would call it a good news, if there is a major breakdown. But this is not the case of the way we've built our scenario today and I will just stick to what I said. We believe that we have a band. Obviously this scenario is not a given GDP growth number. But within that band which reflects the current trend and we understand that as Franck just said it may get to be worse in a number of countries including some big ones. We are confident on what I have behind me on the screen.</p>
          <p>On the dividend policy, I think the average payout historically for Danone has been about 40%. I have to say on a long-term basis we are quite committed to this number. Last year we made a very conscious choice at the Board level, approved by our shareholders obviously that beyond the short-term dilution of the Numico acquisition that had created a blip in the growth of the EPS last year, we would basically swallow that and serve a dividend that would still represent the growth of the underlying EPS. And that's why that payout rate grew to 44% -- 44.5 I think or something of that order. We don't think that 44.5% is what we want to build the financial policy of the Company. And we see no reason not to, at some point in time, be back to the 40% that we've had for a number of years.</p>
          <p>Having said all of that, in the current circumstances and given where the stock price has taken the value for our shareholders over the last 12 months for 2008, our Board has decided that we should be still paying a dividend that would reflect nearly all the growth of our reported earnings, because if you look at the pro forma earnings that we've been working with you over the last 12 months, this is 15%. The growth of our reported earnings is 10. That 10% is basically reflected in the payment of the dividend. So it's another year where the Board has decided to be very friendly to our shareholders in this situation and this is because we are confident on the model that we are building for 2009 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Xavier Croquez, Exane BNB Paribas. Two questions. The first one on the slide 19 regarding margins. The 190 bps negative on input costs, could we get a sense of what the growth input cost impact had been because if we assume that the pricing is hidden there, pricing might have been around 500 bps. That could help us to get a sense, the net and the gross figure. Pricing is normally not in operational performances, that's my assumption. So what is the growth impact?</p>
          <p>And the second question is Danone is particularly effective in rolling out what works. We are entering the year where you tell us that whatever the way to get there you will deliver the goods. Can we get a few examples, two good ones and perhaps one mistake in terms of what has worked for price elasticity? There must be places where you have not been increasing prices or you have been doing a few aggressive promotions, just to get a sense of what can be achieved in this equation of elasticity, price and volume over the last four, six months. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first one, maybe the slide is not fully clear, but indeed the 191 bps is reflecting our input costs and the 259 is reflecting the rest, which we have placed under operational performance, which includes pricing and all the other elements. But it includes everything. We used to show it in only one block. Because of the increase of the cost of raw materials we've chosen to show it separately but it basically includes everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On price elasticity, a few examples. I think we discussed with you in the past that even before the melamine crisis in China, we had introduced a big change in the Bebelac positioning which is our second brand in China for Dumex, with a very significant discount to the super premium brand that we have. And that has allowed us to take very significant market share while still developing our profitability in China. When I say very significant we're talking about several points of market share that we have gained on the matter of not even a year in China. That's an example for Baby Food.</p>
          <p>In Dairy, I could say Actimel in Poland, for example. We have very significantly decreased the price of Actimel. And as a result of that the trend that was double-digit negative for several months after the several price increases that we had taken, is now back to a multiple of double-digit growth basically. So it's growing very, very fast. You've asked for recent examples. I cannot say that we have taken or we can fully take the learnings from the Actimel Poland story. It's still growing as we speak. But this is definitely something on which already a few other countries including Spain, says Franck, are working on in terms of rolling out that strategy together with -- and it's a full repositioning including, as we said, mix, communication, etc. For examples, who haven't worked, I think you can read the papers in France at least.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning all. I have two questions, if I may. The first is on China. Could you update us on the launch program in Dairy? What is your current stance? When do you expect to start launching your products in China? And the second is related to paying down debt. Could you update us on what you believe would be achievable in terms of paying down debt in 2009 and maybe include also your guidance for CapEx plans in 2009 in that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, on the first question I will not tell you when we are going to launch our product in China because it's done. So we started the launch of Bio which is Activia in Shanghai, controlling 100% like us. And it seems that we recovered the same success we had when we slowed our own because we were negotiating to go out of the JV with the Chinese local partner. So I think that will be commenced, let's say, in the middle of the year. But the restart is a very good one, but we are not surprised because the success was there. So now China will benefit of all the organization like the acceleration unit organization we have to deploy all the strengths of Activia which is Bio in China during the next months and next years. So China will contribute to the success of Activia for the following years. That's the only comment I can do on China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the debt, you've seen our cash flow for this year, which is close to 1.2 billion. We still expect to grow it significantly. Then the other elements which move the debt are the dividends. You've seen the level of payouts. You've seen as well in the press release that we have chosen, given the current volatility <mark type="inaudible" /> volatility in the stock price and the value which is needed to offer the facility to our shareholders to opt for payment in cash or for payment in stock. And these are basically the two elements which are going to make the debt move, except for any acquisition or disposals, which I'm obviously not going to comment on.</p>
          <p>On your specific point about the CapEx, as you've seen we've slowed down the level of the CapEx at 4.6%. And I think it's at this moment, the best reflection of what we are doing. Yeah. I'm sorry. Just to add because I forgot that. You've seen as well in recent press release that we have received the cash from the disposal from Africa which is in excess of 600 million. And there is another transaction pending which is Huiyuan for which Coke is still waiting for the approval from the Chinese authorities within the legal timeframe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got two questions please. The first one is, Emmanuel when you presented to us in November, I think you made a pretty specific reference regarding input costs and you discouraged us from factoring in falling input costs into any expectation regarding margin improvement in 2009. Yet in the press release this morning, there was specific reference about improving input prices in key commodities benefiting the margins. Are you planning therefore to retain perhaps more of these sort of savings essentially relative to last year in 2009, than what you had previously anticipated or planned for?</p>
          <p>And then my second question would be just on current trading. Could you give us an update on how Q1 is shaping up, basically the volume trends that you described for Q4, have they largely continued in January? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the input prices, no I don't think there is a change in the scenario. The fact is that input prices have gone down even quicker in a number of countries in terms of skimmed milk powder. The same would apply for example for oil. Our scenario for oil price as we described it in November was significantly higher than what happens today. So the overall slowdown has created an indirect effect on the input price situation. But at the same time, as I said earlier this morning, we expect it to be both a need and an opportunity to reposition some of our pricings. Whether this is through promotions, or whether this is through repositioning of prices, we do not know yet. This is a combination obviously.</p>
          <p>But I don't think that you should expect a proportionally higher retention than what we had in mind in November. So I would still insist on the fact that this tailwind will allow us to drive the transformation, the continued transformation and accessibility of our blockbusters through 2009 and to create a long-term sustainable positioning for our blockbusters going forward. On the current trading I think you will have to be a bit more patient, as usual. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take questions from the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> about the launch of Bio Activia, you mentioned 100% control. Does it mean that you have bought some local facilities to produce it or have you created it from their own?</p>
          <p>And continuing on China, on Baby Food, you benefited in Q4 from the disaster in milk powder. Are you expecting some impacts of the collapse of your local competitors to last in the coming quarters, so this extra growth of a couple of percentage points you added to the category in Q4, is it something that could continue for the next two or three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, yes we have two small now milk factories, very small in China. So we control what we are doing 100%. And I say it's very fresh because we restarted three weeks ago. But we already have, just to give you an example, in the Shanghai area, 65% distribution in the area of Shanghai, which is very fast, because the memory of the product is already there. So it's not like you stopped doing ten years and you come back. It's -- the overlapping was very well organized between the way we produced before and the way we produce now. The good news for us is that we control. It means we are building our sales force. We can really do exactly -- the question of -- the previous question about the re-rollout. So we start to roll out. That was more difficult for us in the past because we have to deal with the Chinese partner. We don't have to deal with. We do as we know, which is exactly the same way done everywhere. Means that will I think accelerate in terms of results. China is always the same story. It depends -- if you consider China as a wall or if you consider China something you have to go step by step. And I think we learned a lot in the last 15 years about this. So we go step by step but very solid.</p>
          <p>The second question about the competition, now China is China. So, you know, the most difficult thing in that kind of crisis situation is to take the right assumption because if you are dreaming about the wrong assumption you will drive your company in the wrong direction. So the best way for me to answer to your question is very directly, say no. The right assumption is not to say that we will have a collapse of our Chinese competition. No, they will come back, because we are -- first because we are in China, second because they have to save their business. Third because it's never good for everybody in the category that somebody has a safety issue in the category. So they will come back. On the top of that if we grow plus 20, plus 20, plus 20, on more than 22% of the total net sales of the Company, I'm not sure that Emmanuel will say points or whatever below last year. So it's a global constriction, global world building the result. I think that the trend that Pierre-Andre said about the normal trend will be around 10%, I think is a better assumption than to think that the Chinese competition will disappear.</p>
          <p>On top of that you don't have any Chinese competitor in China. If anything, I think we have to take benefit of this situation and perhaps accelerate the number of people, the number of reps to reinforce our presence in term of territory in China. That's I think the best thing to do by the time being. Just on the market share on Dairy, because Emmanuel mentioned that we gained, just to give you the amplitude. At the world level, in the country where we are, obviously because where we are not, we are not, we gained something close to 2 points market share on a one year basis, 1.6% at the world level. Baby food, baby food -- where we are, when the number two is losing something like 0.4 so the gap is like 2 points which is huge in that kind of market.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Pierre Tegner, Oddo Securities. I have two questions if I may. First of all, are you facing some issues with some retailers specifically in emerging markets concerning the working capital? And how do you manage this issue?</p>
          <p>And secondly, concerning Russia, in November you explained that Russia was with Mexico and North America, one of the three major countries where you probably will have to face some consumption <mark type="inaudible" />. Could you make some update concerning these countries in term of categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll take the first. On the retailers, we obviously see around us retailers having more difficulties than they used to in the past. We mentioned one specific case in Mexico during the year. We have obviously immediately reinforced the way we manage our sales and the control of the cash with the delivery. So we are -- we have very tight procedure in place. And so far we've not seen any other specific issue than the one we mentioned about Mexico. But we believe we have to keep managing these very tightly, because retail is indeed and will indeed in the same countries and locations have problems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three geographies you mentioned, I think in Russia the teams had been preparing an incredible plan operationally to counteract the effects of the slowdown during the Q3. That was applied in the Q4, frankly quite successfully. So rather on the high side of our expectations from a category standpoint, both for Dairy and for Baby Food. Having said that when you look at the market shares, it clearly shows that this was not a category situation, but really the competitive situation and how Danone has -- Danone teams have reacted. So overall we believe that the macroeconomic scenario we have depicted for Russia is in place in Russia. How competitors will react to that is yet to be seen. But I can confirm that the consumption trends and patterns particularly at the back end of Q4 are the ones that we were predicting, a big slowdown.</p>
          <p>Mexico, no change from what we said earlier. We see a significant slowdown in Mexican consumption patterns, on the back of the relationship -- the economic relationship and financial relationship with the US quite likely. But no change from our previous case. And as far as the US is concerned, I think the most recent consumption patterns show that indeed there is significant slowdown in the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Continuing -- Joseline Gaudino, Societe Generale. Continuing on Russia, what is today the book value of your stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann? And due to the environment of the Russian market what is your plan with your stake? Could you have a chance to do something? In terms of China, what -- also for an update on the situation at Wahaha and especially with the Court in Stockholm? And when do you expect something to expand -- what are you expecting?</p>
          <p>And in terms of your price positioning, normally it's at the beginning of the year, when you renegotiate some with the retailers. So is everything set? And I mean the price position in Q1 to do -- to achieve, is it already done? Or will it be from time to time, depending on the situation, on different countries, different brands, or have you already -- a global and a good view of what you want to do in the price positioning -- repositioning the Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer to the third one very quickly. If I took France, as you know, we have to finish the negotiation by mid-February, something like this. So it's not done. Now globally speaking more and more with all the customers, we are working with business plans. So means we fix targets and after that we discus together what kind of tools we have to put in place to achieve the targets. So it's not only a question of pricing. It could be pricing on an ongoing basis. It could be also what we call the storm story. It means, for example, when a customer wants to make a good big event on health because of whatever, we try to put all our health products in promotion at the same time, our advertising at the same time, our reps on the field in the same time, which is something nobody talks about.</p>
          <p>But also in terms of competitive advantage, when you look at what happened in a crisis situation with some of our number two, number three competitors, one of the first thing they decide is to reduce the sales force. In a country like France we are increasing the sales force, because you know that we make a test. It was I think in the <mark type="inaudible" /> to see how -- with what kind of return we have with more bigger pressure coming from the field, which is something we are going to extend also in France. So no, the negotiations are not done. But honestly it's the same story all the year, every year. Nothing new. Perhaps because of the crisis, an obligation of everybody to go very fast to start the year, at the beginning of the year. And again, you know, I don't think somebody will quit products like Activia, Actimel, Danacol, in this crisis situation because they are still delivering far better than the other. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Wimm-Bill-Dann, we have essentially made an impairment based on the additional stock price. And therefore we have pulled the value back down to the stock price at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have a specific answer on your question about the overall situation of Russia and what we could do with Wimm-Bill-Dann. It's -- this company is a listed company. We've been a shareholder for a long time and we obviously pay attention to keeping a dialog with this company for the long term as well. For Wahaha, dialog would probably not be the right word, and long term I don't know. But the situation is that there has been -- the Court of Stockholm audiences in January, where both parties had a fair chance to expose their claims and defences. We expect the Court to render the judgment somewhere at the back end of first half. And I don't think that there will be significant developments on that front other than tactical before that judgment comes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning all. Mario Montagnani, Cheuvreux. Just a follow-up question on the commodity impact for 2009. Can you just recap how we should basically project the phasing of this lower pressure coming from lower input costs in 2009? And the second follow-up question is on pricing. I didn't get very well what you said in terms of pricing that you expect in the Dairy division for 2009. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again on commodity, what we basically said is that yes, there are some tailwinds. So you just have to -- you just need to have a look at the evolution of the price of oil and the evolution of the price of milk at least in some markets to see that there would be tailwind. We've said as well that we did not want to comment specifically on that and obviously neither on the phasing. Considering that we see that as part of the global recession, we'll have to manage geography by geography, market by market, together with volume and pricing.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on pricing, let me summarize what I meant. We see opportunities to reposition our products. We discussed the example of Actimel in Poland briefly. That could lead to significant volume growth opportunities after a few months. We will use the input price decline which is overall on the rather high end of what we expected in the scenario that we discussed with you in November -- it is still in the scenario so it's not out of the scenario but it's rather on the high end overall -- to put our prices through promotions or directly in price positioning at a level where we believe that creates sustainable growth for our blockbusters. As a result of this I think that you should not expect any significant price effect coming -- positive effect I mean. And we could also have actually negative from quarter to quarter because we are not going to manage this transition on a quarterly basis obviously on the Dairy side. So essentially growth this year for Dairy, will be on the back of the mix, that's for sure. We're very clear on this and tactically and where depending we see the growth happening and how fast volumes.</p>

          <p>Sorry. By the way let me just add one thing, which is another reminder of what we discussed in November, talking about phasing. I'm sure you still have in mind that last year at the same period we were growing 11% on a like-for-like basis for the first quarter of 2008. This is a tough comp for this first quarter of the year. So when we discussed in November we said that we would have very, very limited growth. It could be zero to something. We don't think that it is going to be an impediment to the guidance that we've given.</p>

          <p>Hi, a quick question on FX. Minus 6 to 7% sounds quite high at current rates. Could you just tell us what -- is there a difference between the impact on the top line and on the EPS basically? And could you give us a sense of that if possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's no major difference between the impact on top line and the impact on the net income. It sounds a lot. At the same time if you have a look at the evolution of currencies between basically our Investor Seminar and now, a lot of them have lost 10, 20, 30%.</p>
          <p>That's the case even in the three European countries. I'm thinking of Great Britain, for instance, where we now have business in all four divisions. That's the case in South America, with the Brazilian currency which has already started depreciating. But as you go further that's the case of the pesos in South America, that's the case of the ruble in Russia, that's the case of the Indonesian rupiah. So that's basically reflecting what I said.</p>
