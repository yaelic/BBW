          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the News Corp. First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Marla. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and will be happy to take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2011, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.</p>
          <p>Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating income and the EPS and net income reconciliation is included in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, we're off to a great start for fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>Total company revenue for this year's first quarter is up 7% compared to the first quarter a year ago. It's led by mid-to-high teens revenue growth at our Cable Programming and Filmed Entertainment segments. Total segment operating income in the first quarter was $1.39 billion, a 21% improvement over the $1.15 billion reported a year ago. All segments, with the exception of Publishing, reported double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Included in this year's first quarter results are $130 million in pre-tax charges in Other, net, reflecting a fair market adjustment on our SKY Deutschland convertible securities and a fee related to the withdrawal of our BSkyB bid in July. Additionally, the company recorded a $91 million pre-tax restructuring charge, and this is principally related to the company's United Kingdom Newspaper business.</p>
          <p>Net income this year was $738 million, and this is down slightly from last year's $775 million result. Excluding the net income effects of the one-time items in both years, principally the items just noted, the first quarter adjusted net income this year is $823 million, or $0.32 per share, as compared to the year-ago adjusted result of $759 million or $0.29 per share. In addition, you should note that last year's first quarter result included a net tax benefit of approximately $90 million, or $0.03 a share, related to the resolution of various tax matters.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to provide some comments on the first quarter performance at just a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks, our largest profit generator, which accounted for over 55% of News Corporation's total segment operating income this quarter. This segment continues to drive the overall company's result with first quarter segment operating income contribution of $775 million, and this is up 18% in the aggregate and reflects 16% growth at our domestic channels and 25% growth internationally.</p>
          <p>This growth continues to be top-line driven with segment revenues up 13%, affiliate revenues at the Cable Networks increased 12% over year-ago levels, and advertising revenues grew 17%, and this reflects particular strength at FX and Fox International channels and at STAR India. The revenue growth demonstrates the continuing strength of our Cable Network franchise. FX ratings are up 17% so far in calendar 2011 and in September ranked as the number three most popular cable channel among adults 18 to 49. This is its highest monthly ranking in its history.</p>
          <p>Fox News just finished its 56th consecutive quarter of operating income growth and looks to gain more momentum as the year progresses with the upcoming election cycle. And our strong international channels growth reflects particularly robust affiliate fee increases in Latin America from subscriber and also from rate increases as well as noteworthy advertising increases in India from continued rating leadership and also market growth.</p>
          <p>The Filmed Entertainment segment reported first quarter segment operating income of $347 million, and this is up 24% from the result we reported a year ago. Higher film studio contributions were driven by the very successful worldwide theatrical result of Rise of the Planet of the Apes that generated over $450 million in worldwide box office receipts as well as worldwide home entertainment contributions from Rio, the biggest selling family title ever for an August release, which is on track to sell over 9 million units worldwide. First quarter results also include certain licensing revenues from the Avatar Theme Park deal with Disney.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $133 million increased 27% over the first quarter a year ago. This growth was driven by double-digit advertising increases at the broadcast network and higher retransmission fees that were partially offset by higher marketing expenses related to the launch of our new fall series.</p>
          <p>Higher advertising revenues at the broadcast network reflect a continuation of deploying a national ad market and higher ratings as well as the broadcast of the 2011 Emmy Awards. Season-to-date, Fox Network's 18 to 49 ratings are up over 17%. At the stations, advertising revenues were below year-ago levels due to lower political spending. Excluding politicals, local station advertising revenues in the quarter were essentially in line with a year ago.</p>
          <p>Turning to SKY Italia, first quarter segment operating income increased approximately 45% to $119 million from last year's reported $82 million, and on a local currency basis, operating income improved 32%. This improvement is largely the result of lower programming expenses from the absence of the World Cup costs that were included in the year-ago result and lower marketing costs reflecting last year's re-branding campaign.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, SKY Italia surpassed the 5 million subscriber mark with approximately 34,000 net additions in the quarter. And as you may remember, a year ago the programming packages were reorganized and the price point of the soccer package was reduced. These actions have had the anticipated impact of stimulating subscriber growth and lowering the monthly ARPU to approximately &#x20AC;40.</p>
          <p>Two months ago on September 1, we initiated a &#x20AC;2 per month price increase. Quarterly <mark type="ph" /> stack (7:45) decreased approximately &#x20AC;50 on average from the first quarter from last year, resulting in lower marketing cost.</p>
          <p>In our Publishing segment, the first quarter segment operating income of $110 million declined 38% compared to a year ago. The $68 million decrease reflects the impact from the closure of News of the World in the United Kingdom as well as lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers and our Integrated Marketing Service business. These declines were partially offset by higher advertising and circulation revenues at The Wall Street Journal. And at our Other segment, we reported a first quarter segment operating loss of $99 million, a $57 million improvement from the prior year and this is principally due to the absence of MySpace losses.</p>
          <p>Before turning to earnings guidance, I'd like to update you on our $5 billion stock buy-back program. Through November 1, the company is spending a little over $1.9 billion repurchasing approximately 117 million shares. As we announced in July, we intend to complete this program within one year. We remain committed to that time period.</p>
          <p>And now let me address our guidance for fiscal 2012 and as a reminder, if you measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2011 the $125 million litigation charge, results in a base of $4.975 billion segment operating income for comparative purposes. In early August, we gave guidance anticipating our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2012 to be in the low-to-mid teens range, above the $4.975 billion fiscal 2011 segment operating income base level. So, far, business has remained on track with our expectations. As a result and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating-segment income guidance for fiscal 2012 to a growth-rate range in the low-to-mid teens above the fiscal 2011 adjusted result.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. With so much of the press coverage of News Corporation in recent months focused on The News of the World issues in the U.K., our earnings call is actually a good time to shift gears to talk about our operations. I'm in no way minimizing the importance of the issues we face in the U.K. or our commitment to properly address them, however, there is not a lot more that I can say beyond what's already been said, that is we are cooperating fully with the authorities in their investigations and we'll do what is necessary to make things right.</p>
          <p>So, I really want to use the next few minutes to talk about our operations and assure you that in spite the time spent on the U.K. issues, the last few months have been a time of real progress in driving our business toward both our short and long-term goals. As you just heard from Dave, our businesses are on course to meet our financial targets for the year and we're off to a great start.</p>
          <p>The strength in our businesses was wide and deep in the just-completed quarter. At the Fox Studio, our Film business is off to a strong start and we see a stabilizing home-entertainment business while our TV production group continues to be a leader with a lineup that comprises 8 of the top 20 scripted series in TV. On the Broadcast side, Fox is off to its best fall start in memory and our stations continue to improve margins and market share.</p>
          <p>The advertising market has also been an area of strength with September quarter ad sales up over 15% at Fox and in our Cable business in aggregate with scatter at double-digit premiums to the upfront in both. While we have limited visibility looking forward, the national market continues to be solid although scatter is not quite as strong as it has been as scatter premiums have pulled back slightly. Should also note that we're in a very good cash position going forward given our strong upfront and cancellations are in line with historical experience.</p>
          <p>The local market remains a bit softer. After a slow start to the September quarter, we had a good finish; however, business has slowed a bit to the September quarter where it looks to be down about 10% or flat excluding politicals.</p>
          <p>Our Cable business, both domestic and overseas, just gets stronger with channels like FX setting new ratings highs and Fox News continuing to be a juggernaut. Internationally, we now reach over one billion cumulative subscribers, up over 15% from a year ago and see businesses like STAR India lead India's television in 7 program genres and setting market-share levels not seen since 2005. Both our Italian and German SKY platforms will each add hundreds of thousands of subscribers in calendar 2011.</p>
          <p>The one segment with headwinds was Publishing. Nonetheless, The Wall Street Journal was up on both advertising and subscription dollars in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>It was also a quarter where we continued to execute on initiatives that will enable us to achieve our goals for long-term growth in profits and cash flow. We continue to invest in content with the belief that the expanding appetite of digital platforms will make unique content more valuable than ever.</p>
          <p>We've added new hit programs like The New Girl, X-Factor and American Horror Story at the same time that existing series like Sons of Anarchy just get stronger. On the sports side, we've added the UFC and World Cup, both franchises with enormous growth potential to our roster of premium-event sports content.</p>
          <p>So, we're not just focused on the U.S. content. For example, SKY Italia has recently completed agreements for the exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and renewed our Serie A soccer with expanded rights to include mobile and digital extensions. We have also become more focused on acquiring broad international rights to targeted series. The Walking Dead was a real success for our International Channels reaching about 10 million viewers across 122 countries with the recent Season 2 premiere. We look to replicate that success when we launch American Horror Story in most countries next week.</p>
          <p>Another priority is to build on our content and brand strength to build the subscription revenues of our channels including Fox re-transmission agreements. Our just-completed agreement with DIRECTV is a critical step forward in reaching the financial targets for our channels. We believe we reached a deal that is fair for both of us and look forward to continuing to work with DIRECTV in the future in a spirit of partnership that enables us both to grow successfully.</p>
          <p>We've also continued to pursue an array of opportunities related to emerging digital technologies. These range from licensing our content in a disciplined manner to digital distributors, to building our own digital platforms and content. We now have authentication deals with Dish, DIRECTV, Verizon and Mediacom to increase our viewership while maintaining copyright protection. This is becoming an increasingly important part of our business with VOD viewership of individual episodes of series like Terra Nova exceeding 5 million.</p>
          <p>We also made the decision with our partners that Hulu was a more valuable platform for us to own and build rather than sell. We recognize that a partnership can be a complicated ownership structure; nonetheless, we believe owning the leading digital platform provides us invaluable opportunities to shape and build our digital strategies.</p>
          <p>In addition, we completed a transaction to strengthen our Religious Publishing business with the acquisition of Thomas Nelson for about $200 million. While Publishing is not the sweet spot for our growth efforts, we're going to intelligently manage the businesses we're in and take advantage of unique opportunities to create value. This is a transaction where we've deployed only a modest amount of capital to achieve significant synergies that will be accretive and generate returns far in excess of our most aggressive hurdle rates.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're excited about our future and we believe we have the momentum to continue to build on our current strength. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Chase, and now, Dave and Chase would be happy to take your questions.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> In the interest of time, once again we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And our first question will go to the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have one for Chase and then just a quick clean-up question for Dave. Chase, let's turn to FX for a second. If you look at the backdrop for general entertainment cable networks, there's definitely been some choppy ratings for some other guys this year. So, can you talk a bit about what has FX been doing differently maybe this year to grow ratings? And I guess sustainability of general entertainment cable networks. That would be my first question and then one for Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, look. I think FX is really, while it's in the general entertainment category, I think what it has done is really distinguish itself with series that stand out and I think that's important in any of these businesses is you don't want to sort of just be part of a genre, you want to have series like Sons of Anarchy, Sunny in Philadelphia, American Horror Story. They are unique series that clearly resonate with a real segment of the audience.</p>
          <p>And I think John Landgraf and his team there have done a great job of sort of &#x2013; I mean particularly in the last year of really continuing to distinguish FX and have it be a brand that sort of represents something unique while widening its audience, getting the things like Two and a Half Men and adding some of the movie inventory that broadens it without losing its distinction. And I do think it's a channel that really resonates as being a unique franchise for a lot of viewers out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then for Dave, could you talk a bit about what did FX do internationally for advertising <mark type="ph" /> affiliate fees, (17:33) cable networks for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The effect of the currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's relatively minimal. I would &#x2013; 2% to 3%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And next we'll go to the line at Alan Gould with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chase, when you describe the business, you often talk about billion-dollar buckets, and one of those buckets is the RSNs. Can you just give us some &#x2013; and that's kind of contentious with what's happening, say, what happened with the Lakers and what's happening with the Dodgers and sports costs in general. Can you just address what's happening with sports costs and the RSNs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, realistically outside LA, most of our contracts are pretty long term. We do have a situation that is ongoing in LA. Contrary to questions I got today, we're not buying the Dodgers. But clearly in LA, there's a dynamic we're dealing with. It's not new. We have dealt with these in dynamics before; we navigated it in Dallas and restructured the deal. I'd say sports rights are probably becoming more complicated. And I think that's just a reality in the marketplace. In some ways, in a market with more and more choices, fragmentations, sports rights probably become more and more unique and it's a little bit of the double-edged sword I guess I talked about before.</p>
          <p>They're great properties of unique value but probably increasingly complicated to deal with the rights and costs around them. I think we've proven an ability to navigate those pretty well. Again, outside Southern California, we've got pretty long-term agreements in place. I think we feel we'll be able to navigate Southern California reasonably well, and again, I guess I'd point to our track record of saying we have a track record of navigating these issues and knowing how to deal with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're still confident there's a path to that being a $1 billion EBITDA business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, for sure. Yeah, look, it's a big business now and, like I said, really barring that one region, we've got multi-year agreements in place, in I think almost all the places I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We'll go to the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. For Chase and I guess one for Dave also. I think you said on the last call that the fiscal first quarter would be the slowest for the Cable Networks. Is that right? And can you talk about the timing of when the DIRECTV deal kicks in and what the impact of an NBA strike will be for the RSNs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I don't remember the comment on the first quarter so I don't &#x2013; I can't even sort of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what maybe you said, that the lease fees, they'll sort of ramp as the year goes on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have agreements that come up. Obviously, DIRECTV is one of them, the new agreement. The new DirecTV agreement was not in place in the first quarter, will be in place. Not everything is at the same time. So, they come up at different times, but the DIRECTV agreement will go into effect after the first quarter, by the end of this fiscal year. And I think I also said we have particularly in News, re-trans ongoing. We have agreements that are coming up where we have &#x2013; where we have targets we're looking to achieve, so those things will occur as we go through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the NBA strike impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The NBA strike, look, we hope it settles; we'd like it to settle. It is not a significant financial event for us. We'd rather have the games in place but there are sort of offsets against it if we delve in between. So, we'd offset some rights fees that we have that offset to the degree we have impacts in terms of our advertising and subscription. So, it's not a &#x2013; it would not be an event that would materially affect our financials for the year, though we'd like to see them settle it, and we'd like to have the games in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just, Dave, your buy-back, you're probably going to get this question from now on forever, but the buy-back has been way faster than I think most of us thought so far. So, could you just give us your current thinking on once you run through this, which at this pace will be January or February, and given the incredible cash position, how should we think about ongoing capital returns?</p>

          <p>Just we've been aggressive with it. It's going to basically &#x2013; we're going to continue to buy back the stock based on the conditions that are in the market, which mean price and a lot of different things. And I just think we first got to get through the $5 billion buy-back, and then we will address it when it's through. I think Chase was pretty elaborate with respect to our explanation for our use of capital in December, or excuse me in August rather, and we intend to continue to work towards those financial goals.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then maybe on the ad market, you guys talked about scatter, the scatter pricing softening a bit nationally, local a bit weaker. What do you guys think is happening there? I mean a lot of us are thinking that so much money moved into the upfront that it's just less scatter volume which is having some downward pressure on pricing. Is that how you guys see the world at this point? I know no one sort of knows for sure. But what's your best guess on what happens as we move into Q1, calendar Q1, on the scatter pricing? What sort of the underlying trend is in national television advertising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I'm really not going to &#x2013; I mean I think if there's one thing that's true is it's really a tough market to have visibility and clearly, you've got a market that continues to be pretty strong but continues to be a market where people have pretty short leashes. So, I think it is true, a fair amount of money that went into the upfront. Certainly for us, we did. We were aggressive in the upfront and made a conscious decision to be aggressive about pursuing volume in the upfront and felt it put us in a good place for the year.</p>
          <p>But the market, it really doesn't have that type of visibility. It can change pretty fast. I mean really, scatter continues to be pretty good. I mean when I say it got softer it probably got softer in the last 7 or 10 days.</p>
          <p>So, these are not long-term trends, the trends that &#x2013; like I said with stations. They were a little weaker in September, in July and August, they got better in September and October and then get a little weaker in the last few days again, the last week or two again. So, it's a market that ebbs and flows but realistically has a pretty good &#x2013; you know it continues to have a pretty good underpinning to it. Now, you know it helps I think if you got unique stuff to sell and the network's doing well, <mark type="ph" /> Edge (24:47) doing well, Fox News doing well. If you got it, that's what people want, is unique stuff. So I think we are in a pretty good place to be selling, to have product that people want to buy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. A couple of questions. Hulu &#x2013; Chase, I'm just curious if the usage of your content on the Hulu platform has changed at all since you moved to a full ad load? And then separately, just curious if you're seeing acquisition opportunities that management believes could prove interesting, knowing you're not going to give any names. But I think there's a general view that management is hunkering down given the U.K. situation and focusing internally on execution and I just want to make sure that we understand management's mindset relative to deployment of capital. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may have to <mark type="ph" /> get you since (25:49) I didn't understand the second, but the first question on Hulu, it's probably not going to make a lot of &#x2013; I mean, pretty early. We only did this in the last &#x2013; we're sort of, it really didn't become relevant to moving it. While we moved the window in August, it wasn't until you got to the season &#x2013; we feel very good about it. I mean I think it's working for us, so that's &#x2013; I think that's clear. I think we feel that the decision to put the inventory in is the right one. We think consumers accept it as part of getting a broader experience but I think for us, we think clearly it was the right decision to window the product the way we have. And it has actually been a positive for us in terms of creating value. The second question in terms of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the second question is the BSkyB deal had to be set aside or was set aside and then a large buy-back was announced that you've moved quickly on. And I think there's a view by investors that you guys are very focused internally right now and I just wanted to make sure that the market has the management's mindset correct. Could you see a series of acquisitions starting to develop? Or should we think that you're going to continue to focus internally and on buy-backs?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are &#x2013; I think as we said, it's strategic. I think we feel we're pretty complete and I think our focus first and foremost is to really building the value of the businesses we got. I think we think there's some places we can add things that fit within and &#x2013; but they are targeted and as I said, sort of in the tens and hundreds. But I think it's correct to say our focus is clearly operationally and to the degree there are things that fit within our operations and add a dimension that we can create real value out of, then I think we'd be opportunistic. But first and foremost, we are really driving our businesses to what we think is the potential to take them to another level over the next couple years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just &#x2013; with Cable Networks now becoming such a large portion of your operating cash flow, could you detail roughly the relative size of affiliate versus advertising when you look across your entire global footprint for your Cable Network division? And then I think you grew 9% domestically, this was kind of touched on in earlier questions, but how do you think about now the visibility towards high single/low double-digit type growth rates for affiliate fees domestically given types of contracts you just got with DTV?</p>
          <p>And just maybe to relate to that, Jeff Bewkes earlier today kind of touched on the weakening in multi-channel household as a reason for some of the pressure on affiliate fees. I'm just curious whether you're seeing the same thing and how that affects the first question I asked? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it obviously varies by channel so it's tough to generalize. You get something like sports is always going to probably be much &#x2013; the one end of the affiliate base to me &#x2013; I think it is clear that we are significantly more than half of its affiliate with significantly less and not sure we get it to the real precise, but clearly the affiliate side is significantly more than half though there's a real range when you go across the channels.</p>
          <p>I think we feel pretty good about, as we look out the next few years, about sort of maintaining the momentum we have had on the affiliate side. I mean, to some degree, and again these are not new topics for us; they're unique to us. I think our channels are newer. You've got channels like FX that are a long way, and I've talked about the strength of FX that are still a long way from the TNTs and USAs, the Nat Geo's, that are a long way from Discovery's. And Fox News is obviously going to become &#x2013; gotten a lot further but in some ways, still a long way from what I think represents it's important in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, when you look at something like TNT...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of those deals coming up, and so I do think when you look at the value, the fact that our channels are newer, that there are places for us to go in terms of &#x2013; the overall aggregate cost of the business is obviously something we have to be constructive about. I mean I make it when I talked about DIRECTV. We're looking to reach deals that fairly value our business and the DIRECTV deal achieves the targets we want to achieve. But we want to be in a partnership, so we want our distributors to be successful as well as us.</p>
          <p>Look, I think the bundle is a great package, a great value to consumers and that I think is highly valued by them. You do have a market that's mature and, therefore, you see it in the subscriber numbers. I'm not saying you don't have the &#x2013; the market is clearly maturing, and I do think some of the economic issues are creating some pressure at the edges, and I think we all have to deal with that.</p>
          <p>I mean, I think that is a valid issue that we have to deal with. But we feel pretty good about our businesses, where they're going. Certainly, if you go international, it's a very different story because international, you're in &#x2013; in a lot of places &#x2013; you're in the earlier stages of the growth, and the growth is still clearly in front of you. I talked about the growth in the subscribers just in the last year, and there's a lot left to come. In there, probably our businesses are, while we're a leader in the marketplace, even much earlier stage in terms of the ability to take share and grow into those marketplaces including in developed markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you just give us a sense when you look at the USAs, the TNTs of the world versus an FX, how wide is that gap in your mind still today as you look to reset contracts with DIRECTV and others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we feel we should be &#x2013; I think FX, like I said, is the number three rated 18 to 49 network. We're widening out in the content with some of the things we've put on it. So, I think right now as FX comes up, it should be competitively valued.</p>

          <p>Thanks, just two quick questions. Chase, I was wondering given your global footprint if you could talk to what you're seeing in terms of advertising trends in Western Europe, given some of the uncertainty going on there? And then secondarily, X-Factor ratings seem like they've been pretty good but maybe under-delivering versus some of the audience guarantees. Is that financially problematic at this point? Or is it in line with your expectations? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Advertising in Western Europe is okay, but I think probably in some of the places you'd expect, there's an impact in like Southern Europe, Spain, you know, I think there's some countries where it's weaker, there's some countries where it's better. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag but I'd say overall it's okay. Look, on X-Factor, we've got a number one show; we make real money off of which is why we just picked it up for a second year.</p>
          <p>And we don't have any make-good issue on &#x2013; today, through the whole network. It is a show that probably &#x2013; always tough to target when it comes out, probably came out a bit below where we targeted. I think we have real hopes as we move into where we only had one live episode on and a real opportunity with that show to build momentum. But look right now, it sits there and plays every night, with two nights a week, where it's solidly wins. You feel pretty good when you've got a show that can do that.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. So, Chase, I was wondering if you can update us on the home-video market and how your titles are performing relative to the industry, and any special programs that you're running for the holiday?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think the home market, the home-entertainment market, I mean it's not a dramatic shift but I think it continues to follow the track we'd hoped it would, which is the &#x2013; I mean, obviously Rio was a title that far &#x2013; that really exceeded our targets for it. We have titles as we go into the holidays but our hope has been that Blu-ray would continue to grow, that digital would continue to grow and I think we are seeing after a period where that home-entertainment sector had been dropping where you've got &#x2013; seem to have a stabilizing of that business and hopefully as we go out a little further, which would probably be really on the digital side that opportunity in the next couple of years to have some growth in it.</p>
          <p>But it's too early to really say it's stabilized but it is a bit better than it was. And if you look at the Q3 or Q1 for us, it was up a touch. So, I'm not going to make a grand long-term pronouncement off of one quarter but I think it feels like a business where, incrementally, some of the things like Blu-ray and digital are getting traction, starting to offset some of the declines in the historical areas.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, again, I think we are continuing to sort of try to develop windows that properly value our strategy. Whether it's $1 or $1.20, it's tough to start getting excited about that is something that properly values our product. I think the 28-day window helped, we'll continue to evaluate what it is but I think we need to make sure our product is fairly valued and we are windowing it in a way that enables us to capture the real value in those, in our products.</p>

          <p>Look, we feel great about the long-term future of that business. I think our focus continues to be what it has been, which I say at this point is focusing on growth and particularly subscriber growth. I think we're competitively the best place we've been for a while. I talked before about sort of digesting some of the things that came at us regulatory-wise and otherwise a couple years ago and I think we've got real momentum to that business and I think a real opportunity to really focus on again, growing subscribers to SKY, growing the top line and behind that over the next couple of years and profitability growth will follow.</p>
          <p>But that doesn't mean we're not growing the bottom line too and obviously this quarter is indicative of that. But I'd say the short-term priority is continuing, which I think we've really put momentum back in the business, continue to maintain the momentum in the business but have that profitability sort of incrementally flow through as we go through the next few years.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on your comments on local advertising. I think in the last recession, it was Rupert who said that he saw a downturn coming in winter of 2008 based on softness in local advertising. So, I was wondering in light of that, do you see any warnings of what are some signs? Or if we were to look for some, what they would be? When the softness in local advertising would spill into broadcast and cable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, you don't have a lot of long-term visibility, so I think that it has been a little bit up and down though if you take out political, is that local would actually be about flat without political, so it's not &#x2013; we'd like to see it better but it's not like a decline in it or serious decline in it. I think it's tough to really have a long-term picture. I mean I talked about it again already in the four or five months we've had this year, we sort of started out a little bit weaker and got stronger and that has gotten a little bit softer.</p>
          <p>So, I think it seems to bounce around. I think there's some obvious things, the health of the segments like the Auto segment, the like. I think the auto numbers that just came out are pretty good, so there are the &#x2013; I think that would seem to reinforce what has been a reasonable &#x2013; certainly after the &#x2013; particularly after the earthquake in Japan, a reasonable strength in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>But I think it's tough to &#x2013; other than looking at the sort of macro-economic issues, which I think when you say, why is the visibility limited? What is it that has &#x2013; creates a &#x2013; is probably the issue that people look at, it is sort of macroeconomic issues. Or it's some of these &#x2013; whether it's sovereign debt or deficits or real estate markets, I think companies are reasonably healthy and the consumer spending is not what you'd like it to be but it continues to muddle along. So, I think we'll be careful, we'll continue to monitor it but I don't think I can make any grand statements about it.</p>
          <p>But I just got to &#x2013; dealt with one question. I guess I didn't answer it before on the cancellations. Right now, our cancellations in the upfront are essentially in line with our historical practices so there's nothing. And again we sold pretty heavily into the upfront marketplace. So, cancellation position is pretty much consistent to what we've had in the past.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I just wanted to squeeze one follow-up in. So, are you saying that in terms of the current quarter, the change in the pace of the ad growth at the local stations has been a little bit greater than the kind of the softening you've seen in the scatter market? I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether you're seeing any differential in terms of the level of softening at the local versus the national level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the national market's stronger than the local level. Nationally, throughout this, the national market's clearly been really, all throughout this year, the national market's been stronger than the local...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just looking for the inflection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>National has been stronger.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, the national hasn't changed as much as the local in the current quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've still got a pretty &#x2013; I mean you've got a solid national market out there. We had scatters, as I said scatter premiums are not quite what they were. They were double digits in the first quarter, not quite there. You still got a premium, but you still got a solid national market, a bit softer but still very solid national market. I'd say you've got a bit softer in the local market. And again, flattish without politicals, but the national market's been stronger than the local market.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the international side, if you could make some comment as to where you are in your international cable network margins? And what your progress is towards hitting the $1 billion bucket in operating income there? Do you think you could actually be tracking to get there before 2015, which is I think what you've indicated at some point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are comfortably on target. So, I'm not going to change anything. I'm not going change any expectations but I'd say we're comfortably on target with our plans for that. I'd say, with as many channels in as many regions as we've got, it's tough to make generalizations. Though clearly when we've got a business that is growing top line, we do expect there are opportunities top and bottom line in terms of margins.</p>

Those costs are included in the quarter or were included in the liability at the end of June. With respect to the charge we made, we put a large restructuring charge through in the first quarter and that reflects the reduction of principally &#x2013; of severance payments to employees in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chase. How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I wondered if I can ask you about the progress of TV Everywhere. We heard from David Zaslav yesterday at Discovery about how there might be some negotiations happening outside of traditional carriage renewal deals. I wondered if that's going on? And also, how much extra you can expect to receive from cable operators or satellite operators in terms of incremental revenue for those streaming rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think largely &#x2013; I think you actually are getting some more. I mean I'd call it authentication is usually like what is TV Everywhere but they're one &#x2013; sort of one and the same. Yeah, I think it's got more momentum than it did, probably still not as much as it should though. As I said earlier, we've gotten a series of authenticated deals done with DIRECT, Dish, Verizon, Mediacom. So, and those are all reasonably recent.</p>
          <p>So, I do think you've got some more traction than you've had. I mean most of these are sort of all part of one negotiation. Now that doesn't mean you can't deal with these outside a channel renewal. I don't think everything can wait for a channel renewal, but to date, I'd say they've probably more been occurring as channel renewals occur, but we are certainly engaged with an array of distributors where those discussions are not based on channel renewals. So, I think you've got a better momentum, though probably not enough momentum, to authentication than you've had in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the incremental revenue front. Is there a way to sort of break out how much extra the cable operators are willing to pay for those streaming rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, I think &#x2013; look, at this point, it's more part of the base agreement you have for a channel. I think the incremental comes out in some <mark type="ph" /> areas the incremental is, (48:41) &#x2013; it's probably on the advertising side as they talked about the viewership, Terra Nova is an example, the number of viewers you're getting. We've got ad loads in it so there is an incremental value of capturing that &#x2013; those views on a VOD basis through cuming up ad rates and capturing the ad dollars. From a subscription basis, we really look at it more as part of the overall core agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you concerned in any way about the fall off in cable video subs at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Look, I don't think it's surprising. I think you have got a business that in effect is pretty mature in terms of households that have it and some economic winds that are clearly a reality today. When you look at the foreclosures and other unemployment, those factors are a reality. I think they're ones that I think it's fair to say we have to address those pressures on that segment of the marketplace, but I don't think it's surprising what you're seeing.</p>
          <p>I mean, longer term, yeah, everybody has the question about what &#x2013; as a 24-year-old that doesn't subscribe to cable grows up, what happens in years to come? But I think those issues are sort of not the next two to three years; they're sort of in a longer term time context. I think the value of the cable packages continue to be pretty compelling.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chase. I was wondering, after the annual General Meeting where several Directors received fairly low votes, non &#x2013; not family-related votes in being reelected. Is News Corp. considering either changing the structure of the Board or looking at new Directors joining the Board?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take those votes seriously, and the Board will and is discussing those votes. We continue to on an ongoing basis evolve the Board, and we just announced a new Board member last &#x2013; whenever it was. Last month we announced a new Board member, so the Board continues to evolve. We certainly take those votes seriously, and look, we're more proactively looking for feedback from our shareholders. And we want to have that engagement. That being said, I think we're proud of the Board. The Board has provided unique leadership and value to the business, but it is something we'll discuss as a Board.</p>
