          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Diageo's Interim Results Conference Call. The information in today's conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Paul Walsh. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us today. As usual before we move to questions, what I'd like to do is give a brief overview of the results that we've announced today. This morning we announced results which show acceleration in top line growth from 6 to 7% driven by our robust pricing strategies in many markets; operating margin improvement of 80 basis points and organic operating profit growth of 9% in line with our previous guidance. In addition, we have reiterated our guidance for 9% organic operating profit growth for the full year. The strong cash flow characteristics of the business mean that we returned over 1 billion pounds to shareholders and have increased our dividend for the half by a further 5%.</p>
          <p>Our growth has been broad-based across all major spirits categories and net sales of spirits were up 7%. In beer, net sales were up 8% and our wine brands were up 11%, whilst ready to drink brands were down slightly by 1%. There were a number of very strong performances from our core brands. In scotch, our biggest category Johnnie Walker again delivered double-digit growth and J&amp;B and Buchanan's have also performed well.</p>
          <p>Outside of scotch, we have seen strong performance once again from our core brands particularly Smirnoff and Captain Morgan. And in beer, Guinness which delivered growth in both GB and Ireland as well as its international markets.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to our performance by region. In North America we delivered good net sales growth, up 6% in the half; performance in the U.S. spirits industry continues to be polarized with weakness in the value segment, that is brand selling below $10 a bottle. This segment represents less than 10% of our U.S. spirits business and is not a priority for us.</p>
          <p>In contrast, our priority spirits brands have continued to grow with particularly strong performance by Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum. We're also driving stronger growth of our super premium brands as a result of the increased focus that these brands now receive through the Reserve Brands Group. Our premium wine brands are also delivering strong growth and outpacing the market, driven mainly by Sterling Vineyard and the Chalone brands.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the improved performance trend that was delivered in the second half of last year has continued. Net sales were up 4% in the half with GB, Eastern Europe and Russia driving overall growth. In Great Britain, we have increased focus on the off-trade, and we performed more strongly at Christmas this year. Combined with increased marketing, this has resulted in a return to growth for our priority brands. It has also delivered growth in the half in both Great Britain and Ireland, outperforming the beer category in both markets. We've continued to build our presence in Eastern Europe and Russia in the half and capitalized on the growth opportunities for our brands, particularly in scotch.</p>
          <p>In international, net sales were up 16%, and each hub delivered double-digit net sales growth. Our focus in the region has been on driving value and as a result, price increases and mix improvement have been key drivers of performance there.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we have put large price increases through on our secondary scotch brands and focused on our premium brands. As a result, volume is up 1% with net sales up 12%. In the Global Travel and Middle East hub too we've taken price increases and we've capitalized on the premium gifting opportunity to drive margin improvement.</p>
          <p>Africa was the best-performing hub with net sales up 20%. Our beer brands drove this growth; however, spirits contributed a third of the growth as our brands such as Johnnie Walker and J&amp;B performed strongly in South Africa, but also across the region.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific, our brands continue to see strong consumer demand. However, these underlying trends are not reflected in our reported performance due to some warm up challenges that we've had to contend with.</p>
          <p>In India, we have expanded our bottled in India business and increased the number of salespeople providing us with a platform to grow our imported spirits such as Johnnie Walker in the domestic market.</p>
          <p>In China, we've taken on the 200-strong sales team from our previous distribution partner to form the Diageo China. And the focus this gives our brand such as Smirnoff and Baileys is already showing through in the growth of these brands. These investments in infrastructure and in broadening our brand range mean that we will be well placed to capture the opportunities in these markets.</p>
          <p>This half, we've delivered on our guidance and have demonstrated the resilience of our business. The broad-based growth that has been achieved means that we can reiterate our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now, Nick and I will take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Todd Duvick of Banc of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and congratulations on a good first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Todd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a couple of questions on the cash flow and balance sheet. First of all, with respect to the working capital, would you characterize the increase in working capital as a one-time step-up because of the aged inventories? And would you expect it to be less of a drag to cash flow going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask Nick to respond to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Todd, I'd characterize the movement as a little of what you've described but then some other one-off effects. I think, overall you'll see working capital was up by about a 190 million. That's obviously off the back of a couple of years where we had very low working capital requirement and because this is a movement... on a movement there is some impact there. But when you divide that 190 million up, you get a couple of factors which I think are going to be representative of the business going forward. One is just natural growth, and because the top line is growing at sort of 7% there is going to be some just natural growth in working capital, I'd put that down at about 50 million. Secondly, there is growth as you just alluded to, in our maturing stock holdings. We are running our distilleries flat out and we are putting into inventory whatever we can because we see that we'll need it for future growth and there is a good 50 million more that falls into that category. And I think that will be a feature of our business for a while going forward. The other remaining amount of increase, frankly, I put down to more like one-time factors. In particular, we had some quite late ordering patterns in our beer business in North America. We've got an increased working capital holding in Venezuela, that's partly down to kind of inflationary factors there. And so, the other kind of 90 million if you like, I think, will unwind during the second half of the year and should not be present when we get to report our full year working capital and full year cash flow. But the first two factors, I think, are a natural consequence of the growth in the business and the demand for scotch and therefore I could well see that 100 million requirement going forward for a couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then I guess with respect to the balance sheet Nick, you issued some debt, some dollar denominated debt last fall, and I'd taken that to be to refinance some maturing debt last November, and also to pre-finance some maturing debt next month but, also, you've got pretty heavy capital spending and also a couple of acquisitions. Can you tell us how you're thinking about future debt issuance in the near term and if you do have plans or if you would consider issuing debt, if you'd be looking to the U.S. or Euro market? Any color you can give me along those lines would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well you're right in that up until we announced the Ketel One transaction we had essentially prefunded all of our fiscal year requirements in debt and, frankly, in the market as it is, we are very happy to have done so. We now have a question mark as to whether to take on board the additional debt required for Ketel One in the form of merely increasing our commercial paper program which we could do very easily or frankly look for another opportunity to enter the term debt market. And obviously, we'll be guided somewhat by the condition of the market, the appetite in the market for us as a credit. But if that appetite is there, then I think we'll conclude it makes a lot of sense to come back into the term debt market in the next period, although we don't feel under pressure to do so. But otherwise, you were absolutely right; we had prefunded all of our requirements.</p>
          <p>It's more likely than not, I think, that we'll come to the U.S. market. Historically, it's just always been the lower cost of funding for us, and only once or twice can I actually remember cost of funding with Europe overlapping, if you like, with cost of funding with the U.S., and indeed that was one of the reasons we did a euro deal early last year. But otherwise, I think it's a fair bet to say we will come back to the U.S. debt market, markets willing. We don't have to, but probably that would be our preference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now that's very helpful. And then Paul a question for you obviously with the Ketel One acquisition and related to that the indication that you are no longer in the running for Vin &amp; Sprit. But there have been plenty of rumors surrounding your company, as is always the case, and the most recent has to do with a potential interest in a large beer company like an Anheuser-Busch. Can you just, obviously, not comment on that type of a rumor, but tell us how you're thinking about the total beverage alcohol space and where you might be interested in making some acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First of all, the prime strategy that we will deploy is one that will lead to organic growth. We will make selective acquisitions, as you've seen in the last few weeks, but they must pass our financial hurdles. We would like to expand our footprint in wine, but again, we have some very rigorous financial targets around that. And we certainly only want to operate in the premium wine segment.</p>
          <p>As it pertains to beer, again we want to operate in the premium segment, and if there are opportunities to expand our footprint, we will seize them. To date, such activity has been around alliances, particularly with Heineken, and I would like to think that those opportunities will continue to be forthcoming. I think outright acquisition is going to be somewhat challenging. Now, we watch the space carefully, but I do think at this juncture, expansion in beer through alliances would be our favored route.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful; thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pitchard of Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of accounting questions quickly for Nick. Looking forward to fiscal '09, I was wondering if it's possible to give some indication on what the interest charge or credit related to pensions could likely be. And secondly, today you've obviously talked about the FX impact being neutral, I was wondering if you can give us a feel for what the impact in '09 would be? Whether there's any hedging that could defer a positive impact into that year? And then, secondly, on the UK, you mentioned you had a strong performance over Christmas obviously in the UK, due to easy comparables and other factors. I was wondering if you can give us a bit of an outlook for how trading in the start of the year for the UK has been? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I start with the UK, and then maybe Nick can handle the accounting question.</p>
          <p>If you recall in the previous year, we definitely had a more challenging environment as we tried to drive through far higher price points for our brands. In part that is due to our premiumization strategy, but also in part, particularly on scotch, we see little point in funding promotions that discount scotch, when basically we can hold onto that liquid, mature it for longer and sell it in other markets at a much higher margin.</p>
          <p>We traded very well in the Christmas period. 80% of the growth in GB in the off-trade was driven by Diageo brands, and I was particularly pleased at the price points that we were able to command. Sure there were times when certain retailers pulsed down the price, but it was for a very limited period and very limited amount of product was moved. So, overall in GB, pleased with our performance. Going forward, we continue to see a migration from the on-premise to the off-premise. We understand that margins are lower there, which means quite simply, we will have to continue to command higher share of that channel, and that's what you saw us able to do certainly over the vital Christmas period. Trading in the GB market remains robust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I think if I understood your first question right in terms of the amounts running through the kind of net finance charges related to post-employment schemes. Actually interestingly, at the moment we're on a fairly kind of level trajectory, I think. You'll have seen in the half-year numbers there really wasn't very much difference between '07 and '08. I think you're going to see that for the full year, and I think the number was about 48 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>As we project forward into '09, I think there's a good chance that it remains pretty flat again, because when you think of how that's made up of the return on our assets, with obviously the kind of discounting mechanism against the liabilities, I actually see quite a lot of stability there and our pension deficit isn't moving hugely. So when you put all that together, I think what we're modeling is for '07 to '08 to '09, a pretty level kind of picture there and not huge swings up or down.</p>
          <p>And I think your other question was around forex. And again, at the moment, we're probably looking at something like a, going into '09, something like a 10 million pound impact for '09. So again, versus where we've been, relatively, kind of relatively moderated impact.</p>
          <p>&lt;&gt;: Thanks. When you say impact, I assume you mean adverse impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Positive impact, okay. Just to clarify.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of your pension assets, has the mix changed significantly since the full year? Because obviously we've seen markets fall. Have you moved your mix of assets significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not significantly. Over the last, sort of six-month period, we've actually added a bit more to bonds because when the market got quite toppy, my word, we moved some of our equity holdings into bonds, and again that's going to have the tendency to reduce kind of volatility, if you like, in the earnings-return calculation. So, we've been going a bit more into bonds to be honest over the last six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So sort of a third of the assets now, perhaps, that sort of level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're at just over 30% in bonds right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question comes from Del Warmington of Delwell Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If I may, I'd like to ask a question about your beer category. What brands do you have in that category now, could you mind repeating those please, and the possibility of margin expansion there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, if you look at our performance in beer, total sales grew 8%, the Guinness brand was slightly over 6%, and Guinness by and large represents about 50% of our total beer business. We have some agency brands so we distribute Budweiser and Carlsberg in Ireland, but also in certain parts of the world, we have some very attractive premium positioned lager brands: Tusker in Kenya, Pilsner, Red Stripe, Smithwicks, all are performing well, and they sit along Guinness.</p>
          <p>I would reiterate my comment earlier regarding expansion further into beer. We're doing that in part through innovation. In Kenya, we innovated with Senator, which is an entry point product to migrate consumers from the informal beer market into branded alcohol, and we would look to migrate that concept into other similar markets. Equally, we've had some success in partnering with Heineken. If we can take that partnership further, we would do that. So, our first goal is to continue to drive organic growth in beer. We will then innovate, and thirdly, we will look to explore partnerships where we think it may occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, follow-up in terms of my question about margins expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, margin expansion -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Potential for that, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose the margin by product line. I would say in the aggregate, we are at least holding margin on beer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Chris Pitchard from Redburn Partners has our next question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello again. Sorry, I thought I'd joined the back of the queue, so my apologies for having -. Can I just ask a quick follow-up question on the U.S. market, you talked about expectations of the trends you've seen to-date carrying on and during the year. In terms of the cost structure of the business, you have taken on more people into the reserve brands group. You mentioned the input cost will be harder to offset in the second half, and previously I believe that some of the marketing spend may well have been moved into the second half for the U.S. I mean, should we expect a similar rate of growth in the U.S. or do you think it could be a little bit tougher? And then if you have a second, I was wondering if you could run through the India duty free situation that you talked about this morning? I didn't fully get where we were on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the U.S., Chris. You know, we offer guidance at the Diageo level. I don't want to get, pulled into now, having to break that out by region, but I think an assumption is that the trends that you've seen in the first half should continue. There is no question that in the sub $10 a bottle segment of spirits, you are seeing some volume erosion, but equally, the premium segment remains very buoyant...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, if you look at trading over the vital holiday period, it was pretty good. Interestingly, if you look at retail sales in the half, it was led by gasoline stations, you'd expect that constant volume, but higher prices. But the second most robust channel was liquor stores, where actual retail sales were up about 8%. We don't see those trends materially changing.</p>
          <p>I think, your question on India, pertain to the duty free channel. There are basically three channels in India. You have the duty free channel at airports, you have the imported spirits duty paid which is very high-end, and then you have the bottled-in-market. We are seeing very good growth from bottled-in-market, albeit that is lower price point. We are encouraged that import premium brands are now subject to lower duty prices. We think that will continue to benefit us going forward.</p>
          <p>However, the current largest channel for our premium spirit brand is duty free. The government has taken private, sold-off, the licenses to these outlets and it was not a smooth process and some of them, in some of the major airports were totally closed in the first half. That is now loosening up and we expect that situation to reverse.</p>
          <p>So, that improvement coupled with good fundamentals in both the mainstream bottled-in-India market and premium imported non-duty free, we see this is an attractive combination.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could explain what you're seeing that's causing the migration from off-premise to on-premise, and what's going on as far as the different channels and different shifts in the market?</p>

          <p>I think, you know, this varies dramatically by market. In GB, we are seeing the migration from the on-premise to the off-premise. In the U.S., it is still very much skewed to off-premise where we have a very, very strong sales machine to execute against that.</p>
          <p>In recent years, there has been a gentle migration to on-premise as formal dining and informal dining occasions have increased. I suspect with any slowdown that may cause that trend to somewhat pause and remain virtually in the ratio that it's currently at. However, we continue through our reserve brand group in the state, penetrate high-end bars with product offerings that offer us very attractive margins.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon Paul and Nick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bryan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. First, in Korea, any sense there that you can give us the magnitude of the profit impact that, you know, the change in the distribution arrangement had in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would say in the first half, it's probably cost us around &#xA3;10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the process to, you know, towards, I guess, reapplying for and reestablishing your license. Is that, I saw in the press release that you've reapplied for the license in December, and is there a timing that we should think about, in terms of when you'd actually have that restored or when you think you'd have it restored?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Bryan, it's unwise for me to speculate. What I would say is that there are certain political changes going on in Korea, changes in government, and therefore, it's probably going to be when the new commissioner of alcohol licensing is in office that our case will be heard. So, I don't want to put a timing on it, it is in the hands of the Korean Government. That said, I hope in the not too distant future, we'll have some positive news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, the, as you look going forward and also, you know, whether this was an impact in the first half results or not would be good, but as you are shifting your stocks of whisky from lower value into higher value product, is that going to have an impact on your overall reported volumes? Meaning, maybe the volume, the absolute volumes in the lower priced products, may be larger, and you are trading those into smaller volume, but higher value goods. Is that mix impact beginning to show up in results now and would you expect it to show up I guess, in the second half and in the '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're already seeing it in these numbers. Some of our pricing activity, particularly, around secondary brand is very much intended to, you know, hold back the volume growth in those brands, get better margins, but also allow us to conserve some of that liquid, mature it longer and sell it for even better margins. So, if you look at our total scotch portfolio, you saw about 4 points of improvement between volume and net sales and indeed in Johnnie Walker, I think, total volume was just below 5%, total sales was over 10%. But this is a deliberate strategy, so we want to point to our NSV growth not volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I guess that's the point I'm trying to get at is, going forward the volume growth is seemingly going to be a little less important given that strategy, and will that gap be &#x2013; would you expect that that gap in sales growth versus volume growth to expand or is this sort of the kind of gap you would see going forward given that mix shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would assume this is the gap to expect going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, clearly as we move through some of these price initiatives, we have to monitor it very, very carefully. But the overall intention is to keep volume growth about where it is now but see far better leverage through sales and indeed through the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally in the U.S., did Crown Royal gain share relative to its competitive set? So when you look at it next to Jack Daniels and Jim Beam, was Crown Royal &#x2013; did it gain share in that set or hold share in that set?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that it gained share. If you look at NSV on Crown Royal in North America it was actually up 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My recollection is that the category was probably up less than that and therefore we think we probably got around half a point of share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Right, thank you gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in fact if anything, we saw that performance accelerate towards that later part of the half. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Paulson of Cornerstone. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for taking my call. I have three quick questions. One, in terms of the European marketing spend, where did that go or what did that go to support?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was very much skewed to Guinness, Baileys and premium scotch brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second question I had, and you may have addressed this is in the European call, so I apologize if this is a repeat, but in China, where did the Johnnie Walker come from? Was it a inventory draw down or did it come from other markets, and which markets you think those may be? And on a go forward basis, would you assume your shipments are going to normalize to consumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all the time, shipments have to normalize. What is hard to call is over what period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I mean, more in the second half there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know where that product came from. I mean, we can &#x2013; and it probably is a whole mix shift. There is no question that with the renminbi strengthening, the dollar weakening that created opportunity for people to buy in other markets and bring dollar price product into that market. As we look at consumer uptake we are very encouraged, but certainly our depletions lagged it, we think by about 70,000 cases. I expect that to progressively improve throughout the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then the last question, just to follow-on with Bryan's question, if you look at your total reported results, and you look at the difference between volume and net sales. Do you have a breakdown of price versus mix for the total company, and also for Johnnie Walker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not have that to hand. I think directionally you should assume in both cases, it's about 50-50. So the three point gap between volume and NSV, assume half is price, half is mix. And I would say the same is true on Johnnie Walker, you've got about a six point gap between volume and sales, I would say three points of that is price. Now some of the price was taken late in the period, so you will see a rollover effect of that as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you so much</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a question about the returns to shareholders. You have a very generous policy with the buybacks and the dividends, but the thing that puzzles me is why there's such a disparity between the rate of dividend growth and your guidance for rate of growth in EBIT. And I wondered just what the Board's thinking on that is and why the dividend growth is so much slower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Nick here. You may well be aware that a couple of years ago, we announced a policy centered around a dividend increase rate of about 5%, coupled with our share buyback program coupled with our desire to maintain a single A credit rating. And we did that partly because as we analyzed ourself against consumer goods companies across the world, we found that we had one of the highest dividend payout ratios, or if you like one of the lowest cover ratios and indeed our dividend cover got down to something quite close to 1.5 times. And at the time of announcing that policy, we said we'd like to see that cover actually get back up to something towards two times. And so consequently, the recent periods we've been on a trajectory of having this 5% dividend increase and obviously now, when you're seeing our EPS growth rate be substantially ahead of that, we are now really making some progress in rebuilding that cover. And so the Board's thinking was to let that happen until we can get back up towards two times. I think there is no doubt that some way in the future, we will want to kind of reassess that as our dividend cover builds. But that is the reason why, and we fully accept and understand that there is a difference between dividend growth rate and earnings growth rate, it doesn't at all reflect anything to do with our confidence in the business, it's merely that we set out to rebuild our cover some time ago and we're sort of well on the way to doing that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one follow-up, and this may have been asked previously, but with respect to share repurchases looking to the next fiscal year, have you provided any guidance on whether or not you will be scaling back the share repurchases compared to what they've been not only this year, but the past several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said is that there might be some impact in our next fiscal year following the things that Paul talked about earlier around Ketel One and Rosenblum. The reason why we say might is not to be unhelpful, it's to recognize the fact that what determines where we ultimately end up is a somewhat complex mix of not only our cash flow and interest rates and debt levels but things like the pension deficit, how the rating agencies treats certain contingent liabilities etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And when you put all that together, you do have to make quite a lot of assumptions, and they obviously change as we go through the balance of this financial fiscal year. So, what that means is there is definitely a scenario where we might want to modestly kind of throttle back on our share buyback program. However, I could also see a scenario where if the assumptions fall more into place the way we'd like them to that we won't have to moderate the share buyback program from the current level. And that's why really we have put the thought out there that we might have to make some modest adjustment, we don't want to commit ourselves right now because frankly by the time it gets there we might not have to. And so we haven't given anymore specific guidance than that, frankly because we won't know until we get there what the right number is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I do recall a couple of years ago when you embarked on the program, which I believe was heavier in the first two years and somewhat smaller in the current year, that you had talked to the rating agencies and pretty much sanctioned the share repurchase program within the A rating category. Would it be fair to say that the plans going forward again will be coordinated with the rating agencies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we obviously have conversations that are more than just single year conversations, we want a multiyear program, i.e. we won something that we can be consistent around. We are not in the business of introducing a share buyback program one year to stop at the next. So, our conversations with the rating agencies do factor in a number of years including some capacity for the kind of bolt-on acquisitions that Paul talked about and capacity for the buyback and maintaining the single A rating. So, all of those things are brought together in a multiyear discussion with the rating agencies and that is very much how we've done it and you can assume we will do it going forward.</p>
