          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us in this conference call. First I will summarize the highlights of the third quarter of 2010, which will be followed by comments from our Vice President on the operational and financial results and finally review the outlook for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's start with slide five and a review of the highlights for the third quarter of 2010. The company continued its progress and implemented its growth strategy achieving solid operating and financial results. We announced the presence of hydrocarbons in the Itauna well in Brazil and the presence of natural gas in the Oripaya well in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Production from our Corporate Group rose 16%, reaching 632,000 barrels equivalent per day. Diesel and gasoline hydro-treatment plant started operations in August and September, respectively, allowing the delivery of clean fuels with our own production. During this quarter we made significant progress in restructuring of the Oleoducto Bicentenario project. Ecopetrol incorporated the new subsidiary Oleoducto Bicentenario de Colombia. Obviously Ecopetrol has invited other companies as potential partners in this project.</p>
          <p>Our financial results continue to be strong and worth highlighting the higher EBITDA of COL$3.9 trillion and EBITDA margin of 46%. EBITDA rose 11% compared with the second quarter 2010 and steady compared to the third quarter of 2009. Operating income amounted to COL$2.9 trillion rising 28% compared to the same quarter in 2009 and with operating margin of 33%.</p>
          <p>Net income amounted to COL$1.7 trillion rising 42% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date net income amounted to COL$5.6 trillion with an increase of 57% relative to the same period of 2009. Another important milestone of the quarter was listing our ADR in the Toronto Stock Exchange market. Finally, it is also worth highlighting the acquisition of the 51% of BP's Colombian assets, which adds new reserves, production and potential areas for our exploratory portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the slide stack six, we have summarized execution of our investment plans, which amounts to $6.9 billion for 2010. Organic investments between January and September amounted to $3.3 billion, rising 46% compared with the same period in 2009. 57% of the organic investment was allocated to production projects, 5% to exploration projects, primarily for the development of heavy crude and drilling of exploratory field, 26% was allocated in the downstream projects mainly in the hydro-treatment plant, the Barrancabermeja refinery modernization project, as well as for the expansion of the transportation system. 3% was allocated to internal initiatives and the remaining 9% to the subsidiaries. As previously mentioned, we acquired 51% of the BP assets in Colombia for $645 million. The pending legal authorization of the Colombian regulators, are expected to be obtained before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation to H&#xE9;ctor Manosalva, who will comment on the results in the upstream business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. The slide seven shows the progress made in our Exploration and Production strategy during the third quarter. Regarding exploration, Ecopetrol concluded the drilling of two exploratory wells in Colombia. The Oripaya well with the presence of surface hydrocarbons, which is operated fully on by Ecopetrol, and the Gouda well which was plugged and abandoned.</p>
          <p>International exploratory activity included activity in three wells, Malbec and Itauna in Brazil and Runtusapa in Peru. As of September 30, the Runtusapa and Itauna wells were being drilled the latter with presence of hydrocarbons. The Malbec well was plugged and abandoned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the production, the Corporate Group operated a level of 632,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, rising 16% compared to the same quarter of the 2009. Ecopetrol accounted for 597,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, Hocol reached 26,000 barrels, Savia with 8,000 barrels and 2,000 barrels coming from Ecopetrol America Inc. Ecopetrol's production growth was provided by heavy oil field mainly Castilla with 25% increase, Chichimene with 66 and Rubiales with 95% growth. Mature fields also had significant growth mainly Casabe, which grew 33% and <mark type="inaudible" /> with a 21% increase.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn over the presentation to Pedro Rosales. He will comment on Downstream results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, H&#xE9;ctor. Good afternoon, everyone. Please go to slide eight to present the results on progress of Downstream during the third quarter of 2010. It was mentioned by Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez the detail on gasoline plant of the hydro-treatment project began operation during the quarter. With this project Ecopetrol has started to produce diesel and gasoline with low sulfur content in compliance with fuel quality regulations in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Gross margins in Barrancabermeja refinery was US$7.29 per barrel during the January-September period of 2010 compared to US$4.74 per barrel in the same period of the previous year. The margin improved due to a higher average price of products, partially offsetting purchases of crude oil and products mainly from diesel imports. The improvement of this margin was driven by lower growth feed and a direct crack spread.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the project for the development of the petrochemical infrastructure, conclude completion of the conceptual engineering phase. In the fourth quarter we will realize the review of the business model, including the analysis of the advantage of potential partners to define the next steps in the maturation of the petrochemical program.</p>
          <p>In the transportation segment, we made progress in the structuring of the Oleoducto Bicentenario with a specific focus will be the construction and operation of a pipeline extending from Casanare province to the Cove&#xF1;as port. The pipeline will transport the increasing production from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>The acute evaporation program achieved significant growth in transportation capacity. Main increases in this quarter came from the additional transportation capacity in the Vasconia-Barrancabermeja system from 140,000 to 160,000 barrels per day, in Castilla-Apiay from 80,000 to 120,000 barrels per day and the growth in the pumping capacity between Ayacucho and Cove&#xF1;as from 40,000 to 48,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Total volume of crude and products transported increased 33% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, reaching 1.48 million barrels per day. The growth mainly came from crudes transported with a 42% rise.</p>
          <p>Finally, we began blending biodiesel and diesel at the Barrancabermeja refinery with biodiesel supplied by our subsidiary Ecodiesel Colombia and since August of 2010 the biodiesel is transported on the multipurpose pipeline across Colombia.</p>
          <p>Let's go on to slide nine and we can see that during the third quarter of 2010, our sales volumes grew 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2009. And the January-September period of 2010 increased 15% compared to the same period of the previous year. Exports represented 48% of total volumes sold, mainly in crude sales. The main destinations of our exports were the U.S. Gulf Coast with 40% share, the Far East with 18%, and the Caribbean with 9%. Local sales represented 52% of total volumes sold, an increase of 12% compared with the January-September period of 2009. The growth came mainly from a higher supply of natural gas and diesel to the power generators.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation back to Mr. Javier Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Slide 10, shows the main milestones in corporate social responsibility and internal consolidation during the third quarter of 2010. In order to ensure world class human talent, the company has been working in the development of stronger technical, organizational and leadership skills. Cost savings from optimization initiatives in the supply chain amounted to COL$448 billion.</p>
          <p>Regarding health, safety and environment the number of environmental operational incidents dropped significantly from 43 incidents during the third quarter of 2009 to 15 during the third quarter of 2010. However, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2010, the frequency of accidents, number of accidents per million man hours reached 1.5, up 24% compared to the same period in 2009. Given that situation the company has launched additional campaigns and initiatives to prevent accidents and increase management of identified control failure.</p>
          <p>Ecopetrol is part of the 51 companies nominated to the MAKE, Most Admired Knowledge Enterprises global award in 2010. This award is the recognition to the living companies in knowledge management. Finally, social investment of September of 2010 amounted to COL$53,000 million.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn over the presentation to Adriana Echeverri, who will comment on financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Let's move to slide 12. As Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez mentioned, results for the quarter remained positive with increases in operating income of 32% and net earnings of 42% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Higher crude oil prices and the rise of exported volumes drove the growth of 16% in total sales when compared to the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>On the costs side, during the third quarter there was a total increase of 15% when compared to the same quarter of last year. Variable costs increased mainly because of hydrocarbon purchases, the input of low sulfur content diesel in NAFTA, as well for amortization and depletion coming from new capitalizations and higher production.</p>
          <p>Fixed costs when it tied reflect more activity through contracted sales both for direct, as well as joint venture in association contract operations, as well as maintenance, work hours and depreciation, is all inline with the higher production.</p>
          <p>Speaking of operating expenses, they decreased due to lower exploratory expenses and fewer dry wells. However, there was an increase in commercial and trade expenses derived from the economic recognition related to cancellation of natural gas deliveries to some counterparties, due to operating and weather factors.</p>
          <p>As a result of the above mentioned, we had an operating income of COL$2.3 trillion with an operating margin of 33%, which compares to COL$2.2 trillion and 30% respectively of the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding non-operating results, there was a net loss of COL$556 billion in the third quarter. This result was mainly due to a loss of COL$293 billion in subsidiaries accounted under the equity method. There was also a net loss of COL$128 billion explained by peso revaluation, net allowances for COL$25 billion and a net financial income positive COL$98 billion and there were other minor expenses for COL$10.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Net income for the third quarter was COL$1.7 trillion as Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez mentioned, 42% higher than the one that we had in the same quarter last year and net margin was 20%. Finally, the increase in volumes and prices generated an EBITDA of COL$4 trillion for the quarter, which is 32% higher when compared to the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look to segment results shown in slide 13. Exploration and Production segment generated COL$1.8 trillion of net income led by already mentioned increasing crude oil production and pricing. EBITDA for this segment for the third quarter was 3.8 trillion.</p>
          <p>Moving to Refining and Petrochemicals segment, it reported a net loss of 190 billion in the third quarter. The most relevant aspect of this segment during this period was the reduction of imports of premium diesel, since the hydro-treatment plant of Barrancabermeja refinery started production. The imports were around 40% and now are expected to be around &#x2013; 40,000 barrels per day, sorry and now are expected to be around 11,000 barrels per day only.</p>
          <p>Transportation segment generated a net income of COL$74.8 billion in the third quarter of this year, thanks to an incremental volume of crude oil, biodiesel and other fuels to be transported.</p>
          <p>Finally Supply and Marketing segment reported a net income of COL$39 billion coming from higher traded volumes of crude oil and premium diesel.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to slide 14 to have a brief overview of the company's cash flow and balance sheet as of the close of the third quarter. The company continued having a strong cash generation, initial balance for the quarter was COL$7.9 trillion. Operations generated additional cash for 8.7 trillion. Our resources were enough to fund operations for COL$6.1 trillion, organic CapEx of COL$1.5 trillion, dividend payments of COL$1.2 trillion and the acquisition of BP assets in Colombia for COL$1.2 trillion additional. The ending cash balance was COL$6.8 trillion.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains with low levels of indebtedness. Assets amounted to COL$60 trillion and liabilities to COL$24 trillion, including dividends and financial debt. Gross financial debt over EBITDA ratio was 0.34.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 15, here we show the main results of our subsidiaries for the quarter. Total sales for the Corporate Group during the third quarter amounted to COL$9.9 trillion. Besides Ecopetrol itself, highest revenues came from Reficar, Hocol, Propilco and Ocensa.</p>
          <p>Group net income amounted to COL$1.7 trillion and subsidiaries with a higher net income were Hocol, Savia and Comai.</p>
          <p>Group EBITDA was COL$4 trillion with an EBITDA margin of 41% higher than last year mainly due to the positive operational results of the whole Group.</p>
          <p>Now I turn over the presentation again to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's go to the slide 17 to review the outlook for the remaining of the year. In exploration, we expect to drill 23 exploratory wells and to reach the goal of acquiring 15,500 kilometers of seismic equivalent. Average Group production for 2010 should reach 615,000 barrels per day driven by the growth in our main fields Castilla, Rubiales, Chichimene, Casabe, as well as our mature fields in the Magdalena Valley.</p>
          <p>In Transportation, we expect to conclude the partners to the Oleoducto Bicentenario, make the purchases of materials and long delivery equipment for this project. In the same way we must conclude the Ocensa expansion to 560,000 barrels of oil per day and start the operation of the Oleoducto de los Llanos capacity increase between Rubiales and Cusiana to 240,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>Finally, the car truck loaded facilities in Ayacucho and Banadia will start operation. We also expect to obtain the legal authorizations to conclude the acquisition of BP assets in Colombia and in December we will disclose our investment plan for 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial results EBITDA should be &#x2013; should reach 40% by the end of the year. In summary, we are optimistic on achieving the goals for 2010 and continue reaching the milestones set for the coming year.</p>
          <p>The session is now open to questions from our participants. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Frank McGann from Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon. Just two questions really, one is just to confirm that the production in the third quarter included nothing for the BP assets and do you think those might be included in fourth quarter production? And is that included in your 615,000 per barrel a day estimate for the year? And then secondly in terms of year end reserves, I was wondering -- I know you obviously can't give a number now, but what you are thinking in terms of additions that could be related to either the work you've been doing in your &#x2013; in the fields this year, what you've learned about the reservoirs and from your exploration activity, as well as perhaps more importantly the recovery factor and your moves to improve the recovery factor. What kind of effect that could have on year end reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank. You are completely right. The BP production isn't included in the third quarter and isn't included in the projection for the end of the year. It's not included, okay, nor in the results of the third quarter nor in the projection for the end of the year. And in terms of the reserve data, the only data we can mention up to now is maybe to remember the goal that we mentioned at the beginning of the year, that is the addition of 350 million of reserve for the year. That is just the estimation that we announced at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well maybe then you could just &#x2013; in terms of your work to improve the recovery factor, what &#x2013; how quickly &#x2013; I believe in the New York meeting you said that the recovery factor is currently 18% and the goal is to get it to 30. And I'm just wondering how quickly &#x2013; how much can you improve that on a year-by-year basis and what might that translate into reserves perhaps?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I have a couple of questions on the exploration plans. One, related to Brazil. What are the next steps for the wells in the Itauna field? And the second question is when do you plan to start doing exploratory work in your CPE-2, CPE-4 and CPE-8 blocks? I'm trying to gather whether you have seismic work done already or -- and when do you expect to start drilling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm fine, thank you. Regarding the Itauna question, we are drilling ahead right now. We are 4,000 meters drilling ahead and as you know the total depth will be around 5,400 meters. So, the plan is to continue drilling and to reach the goal, which as a result might go up without permission. So, and in summary we're drilling ahead and we are very encouraged with the results. Regarding second question, regarding the exploration activity in the CPEs, we plan to drill a couple of wells in the CPE-2 and CPE-4 and maybe it was acknowledged the CPE-8 is operated by Talisman. We are promised <mark type="inaudible" /> and also their plan is to drill another two wells. So in total we plan to drill six wells before the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So, that means that you have seismic imaging already, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know for a stratigraphic test we don't need necessarily seismic. The idea is to get some information and with the information we can plan better on the seismic for next year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, let me just get this straight up, I'm sorry. So, it's two in CPE-2, two in CPE-4, those four are strats?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the six &#x2013; the six of them will be stratigraphic wells?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just wondering what your plans are for Hocol and Savia, right now. What you're thinking in terms of production potential there over the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right now the Hocol's production is around 27,000 barrels per day. They have a goal to be at 56,000 barrels per day in 2016. And the goal for the next year is around 30,000 barrels per day. And in the case of Savia, right now their production is around 16,000 barrels per day. They are planning to go to around 20,000 barrels per day the next year, and their goal for 2015 is 50,000 barrels per day, Frank.</p>
