        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Let's begin the Results Presentation 2012. As usual, I'll review the highlights and the group's results and then Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will give you a more detailed overview of the different business areas. And finally, I will conclude with our vision and our priorities for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>The economic environment in the year was complex particularly in Europe where we've had to overcome extremely high tensions and loss of confidence in the euro; tensions which have lessened in the last month after the progress achieved in the proceeds towards the European Banking Union and the launch of support instruments such as the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:01) or the OMP's of the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p>Better performance of the United States with moderate growth but above all, of Latin America, an area of which the IMF forecasts significant growth for next year, particularly for Brazil which would go from about 1% growth in 2012 to 3% in 2013.</p>
          <p>In this context, our priority was always to strengthen the balance sheet from three points of view: provisions, liquidity and capital ratios. And to do that, we have taken advantage of the group's strong ability to generate earnings.</p>
          <p>Main highlights for the year were, first, the strength of the upper part of the income statement with pre-provision profit at &#x20AC;23.56 billion, growing for the 10th year running and is 32% higher than in 2008. Second, the effort made to provision, particularly in Spain and specifically for the real estate sector, raising our coverage levels enormously.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, a higher solvency. We have combined this provisioning with capital ratios rising for the sixth year running, up to 10.33%. The group's capital solvency has been demonstrated by the Oliver Wyman stress tests.</p>
          <p>And fourthly, improved liquidity. We have reinforced our liquidity position, focusing particularly on Spain, where our loan-to-deposit ratio is now below 100%. And we have returned &#x20AC;24 billion in funds, total received by Santander and Banesto in the first LTRO auction, which was the maximum that was allowed to be returned. After all that, recurring ordinary profit was &#x20AC;5.25 billion in the year, &#x20AC;2.21 billion after special provisioning.</p>
          <p>Let us now review each of these points in more detail. First, the group has continued to generate solid earnings. Pre-provision profit was &#x20AC;23.56 billion for the year. That's 1.6% higher or 4.4% if we exclude the perimeter and the exchange rate effects. I should point out three aspects. First, we estimate that this figure puts us amongst the top three large international banks. Second, the year's performance has enabled us to maintain an excellent track record and a pre-provision profit of around &#x20AC;110 billion for the last five years. And thirdly, we are tackling the crisis posted by our more commercial revenues which have improved each and every year since 2008, which is very different from most of our competitors. A second point to be made was the fact that 2012 was an exceptional year for provisions. At the group level, we have assigned almost &#x20AC;19 billion, particularly in Spain with &#x20AC;9 billion, and more specifically for real estate provisions with &#x20AC;6.14 billion.</p>
          <p>With this, we have ended the year with provisions higher than those required by the Royal Decrees. These strong provisions, combined with those in previous years mean that in Spain, we have assigned since the beginning of the crisis over &#x20AC;23 billion to specific provisions for loan losses and real estate, which account for 10% of our total loan portfolio in Spain. This provisioning effort has had a significant impact on the year's profit. The &#x20AC;6.14 billion gross, net of taxes &#x20AC;4.1 billion, of which &#x20AC;1 billion against capital gains and &#x20AC;3.05 billion charged to ordinary profit. This has brought down our accounting attributable profit in the year to &#x20AC;2.2 billion, a number which would be &#x20AC;5.25 billion if we consider recurring profit.</p>
          <p>As for capital gains, they mostly came from the divestment of a Colombian subsidiary, the reinsurance operation in Q3, and the sale of the Canalejas building. They do not, therefore, include capital gains to be derived from the alliance in Spain with <mark type="ph" /> Elevan for cars (06:09) and Aegon for bancassurance which will be recorded in the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>These provisions, together with the bank's deliberate strategy to reduce its real estate balances brought about a strong drop in our net exposure. In 2102, it declined by &#x20AC;12.4 billion. Since 2008, the reduction was &#x20AC;28.5 billion or 69%. In parallel, our total coverage for our real estate exposure rose to 47% at the end of 2012 from 22% in 2011 and only 3% in 2008.</p>
          <p>As for its makeup, the problematic balances, that is the combination of doubtful, substandard and foreclosures, are covered up to 50%, an outstanding risk, that is, those up-to-date with payments are 39% covered. In the Annex, you will find more detailed information on balances and coverage levels in the different loan types.</p>
          <p>The strong reduction both in loan balances and foreclosures set us apart from the industry as shown by the latest data released in September. This trend also puts us as the bank with the lowest real estate exposure amongst our peers and with very high coverage ratios. A significant part of this process was posted by the sale of property which has enabled us to reduce our exposure more quickly. In the year, we have sold 33,500 units, of which 31,000 were flats, either through our own retail channels &#x2013; Altamira and <mark type="ph" /> Senna (08:05), or through the developers themselves &#x2013; all of which have contributed to a reduction in the volume of foreclosed properties or loans at risk. In fact, 18,500 were recorded in the group's balance sheet as foreclosures.</p>
          <p>This amount is more than double the sales made in 2011 and has enabled us to reduce foreclosures for the third quarter running, ending the year with a reduction of &#x20AC;700 million gross, which is the first time since the beginning of the crisis that we've seen a reduction in total volumes. The group granted mortgages that financed around 60% of the amount of foreclosed properties.</p>
          <p>The increase we've seen in real estate coverage has had a positive impact on total risk coverage in Spain, which is now up to 71%, 26 percentage points higher than in 2011 and back to the levels of 2009. This improvement, together with that obtained in the year in the UK Sovereign and Santander consumer finance has brought the group's total coverage ratio up to 73%, which is 12 points higher than in 2011.</p>
          <p>For our NPL ratio, the group ratio was 4.54%, the same trend as in previous quarters continues. Spain and Portugal have continued to show the same trend we mentioned in previous presentations. Spain hard hit by the rise in real estate loan NPLs. And Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will describe.</p>
          <p>Brazil and Chile have also shown rising NPLs particularly in the first half of the year. Since in the fourth quarter in Brazil, levels were virtually unchanged. And in Chile, the trend flattened.</p>
          <p>On the upside, we have Sovereign Bank, whose ratio has increased notably in the year, or improved, rather, in the year. Mexico, the UK and Santander Consumer Finance have remained more stable.</p>
          <p>Third point I would like to cover, our capital ratios. We closed the year with core capital ratio at 10.33%, that's 31 basis points up in the year and up for the sixth year running. I should also point out that we've created 84 basis points pre-capital before provisions, 50 basis points from Mexico's IPO. Part of this increase was counteracted by provisions and also the depreciation of some currencies. And lastly, if we look only at Q4, capital ratio dropped 5 basis points because of the depreciation of the Brazilian real. We have maintained, based on our solvency ratios, befitting our business model, the structure of our balance sheet and the group's risk profile.</p>
          <p>Fourth point is improved liquidity. It is one of the group's priorities for 2012 and we've done this with two drivers. First, we've improved our commercial gap by &#x20AC;42 billion in Spain and Portugal. This improvement was due in part to the foreign lending because the systems continue to deleverage, partly due to an increase in coverage funds, but above all, to our ability to attract deposits through our retail networks. The second driver was a very conservative issuance policy through which we have attracted &#x20AC;43 billion in medium and long-term debt and securitizations in the markets. As a result we've seen a strong improvement in liquidity ratios and in our funding structure, enabling us to return all the money that Santander and Banesto had obtained in the first LTRO auction in December 2011, &#x20AC;24 billion, which we have mainly kept in deposit in the European Central Bank at 0% interest as a liquidity cushion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the group's results, on the screen as usual, you can see our income statement with the variation from the accounting standpoint and after subtracting the impact of the perimeter and the foreign exchange effects. These two effects have a negative impact of between 2 and 3 percentage points in the upper part of the income statement and 8 points on recurring profits.</p>
          <p>Same conclusions as in previous quarters, we'd like to emphasize the strength of the upper part of our income statement with 4.4% growth in net operating income on a like-for-like basis, positive trend which does not feed through to the bottom line because of three factors: higher loan loss provisions; the rise in minority interests in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile; and thirdly, and most significantly, the impact of higher real estate provisions in 2012.</p>
          <p>Before I review the main lines of our income statement, I'd like to point out that exchange rates had a significant negative impact in this fourth quarter, particularly it is responsible for 75% fall in gross income in Q4. If we subtract the exchange rate impact, basic revenues &#x2013; that is net interest income, fee income and our insurance business &#x2013; have remained virtually flat in the quarter. And within that, we've had the best quarter in the year for fee income, mostly in the UK and Latin America, and income from our insurance business was also higher than in the third quarter. If we look at the different areas, the fall occurred mostly in Spain and Portugal due to a slight fall in spreads in the corporate center because of a rise in funding costs. The remaining areas changed very little.</p>
          <p>Of note, the UK, which after several quarters falling, has been stabilizing its revenues in the third and fourth quarters. And as for Latin America, and as Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez will explain, we had an excellent quarter for Mexico and Chile and a decline in revenues in Brazil because of lower growth and pressure on our spreads.</p>
          <p>As for costs or operating expenses, they also remained very stable for the group overall, with differences in different territories: a rise in Latin America because of Brazil with the signing of the wage agreement in September, and Mexico because of seasonal factors in new branches and employees; and on the other hand, a slight fall in expenses in our European units with a drop of &#x20AC;100 million in the corporate center because of lower bonus payments and also the deferral of some projects.</p>
          <p>And finally in provisions, in the chart, you can see the effort made by the group in the last quarters, through loan loss provisions and provisioning for real estate exposure. In loan-loss provisions, a rise of &#x20AC;229 million in Q4, mostly or almost completely in Spain. The rest of the countries have remained very stable. And Brazil's went down for the second quarter running. Additionally, and as I've mentioned before, the group has provisioned in the last quarters, to increase exposure to real estate risk in Spain &#x2013; to increase coverage for real estate exposure in Spain &#x2013; to a level higher than that required by the Royal Decrees.</p>
          <p>I will now give the floor to Jos&#xE9; Antonio &#xC1;lvarez so he can review the different business units.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As our CEO has pointed out, I will be reviewing the highlights of the different business areas within the group. I usually begin showing the breakdown of profit by geography. Picture has not changed significantly in this last quarter. Brazil brings in 26% of the group's profit, that's on the emerging market side, in Poland 5%. Spain brought in 15% of profit, the UK 13% and the U.S. has remained around 10%.</p>
          <p>Starting as usual with Continental Europe, the income statement reflects the difficult economic environment, and our CEO mentioned, with low economic growth, continued deleveraging particularly in Spain and Portugal, low interest rates and high level of regulatory and political uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Profit, was &#x20AC;2.3 billion, 1% up on 2011, because certainly the upper part of the income statement performed well with net operating income up 8%, sustained revenues and costs under control in all units and higher loan loss provisions, much higher in Spain and Portugal.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the different units within Continental Europe. Santander and Banesto's Branch Network have performed well as we will see later, absorbed however, by larger provisions which were required at this point in the cycle.</p>
          <p>Portugal, also in a difficult economic context, saw its profit comes down by 29%. However, Santander Consumer Finance had excellent performance in a very difficult market with car sales falling all over Europe, and it was able to increase its profit by 9% and significantly increase its market share. Poland's contribution to the group has also increased, 44%. This is because of a perimeter effect &#x2013; we only consolidated nine months in 2011 &#x2013; but without this perimeter effect, the increase was also very significant, 21%.</p>
          <p>Let's look at each of these units, starting with the Santander network. I want to emphasize the ability to attract deposits and retail commercial paper for a total of &#x20AC;20 billion. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio at the Santander went down below 100%. Lending fell 4% gross, 7% net, due to the fall and generation of additional real estate risk and also increased provisioning and coverage. If we look at profit, we saw an increase of 7% in the year. Revenues have remained significant, supported by customer funds and larger spreads on loans. And, however, there has been a fall in interest rates with the one year Euribor, which has brought costs up. We have seen an increase in term deposits particularly, which has increased the cost of funding. Loan loss provisions increased in the quarter but remain below those of the first half of the year. So in short, a difficult context with strong deleveraging but good growth in deposits, sustained revenues, flat operating expenses and provisions &#x2013; ordinary provisions &#x2013; stabilizing.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Banesto. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I will give more detail than usual because they won't give a detailed results presentation, although they will have a conference call tomorrow so they can answer any questions about the information we'll be providing you with today.</p>
          <p>Similar trends to those of the Santander network, deposits up 4%, lending down 7%, so its loan-to-deposit ratio improving by 11 points. Lending, we have seen differences in the different segments, relatively stable loans to individuals and businesses, down 2%, but a very significant fall in real estate lending and loans to large corporates, 10% down, 34% down, respectively. As for deposits, very good performance for individuals and SMEs, a fall in corporates. Clearly, Banesto performed much better than the industry as it has done in the last few years with some of the best ratios in the sector. Its coverage rose by 20 percentage points in the year.</p>
          <p>As for profit, Banesto has very good performance in the upper part of its income statement, with basic revenues growing 2% and net interest income up 8%. Costs almost flat, profit &#x20AC;94 million because loan loss provisions were higher than in 2011. But at the group level, from the management perspective, when we talk about Banesto, we do not include the provisions for real estate which are made at the central level. If we look at Banesto's individual figures which do incorporate all these provisions, the bank made a loss of &#x20AC;955 million. The difference between the two figures, you can see on this slide. If to the &#x20AC;94 million attributable profit, we add the real estate provisions charge in the individual accounts and incorporate the part corresponding to losses of minority interest and consolidation adjustments, we get the &#x20AC;955 million in losses I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>If we look at the year-end accounts of Banesto, we see that it's a very solid brand. Its capital ratio is 9.2%, core capital higher than that of the end of 2011. Strong liquidity as well with significant volume of deposits and long-term funding. It has also returned everything that it borrowed in the first LTRO auction in December. Its NPL ratio is better than the industry. Its ability to generate revenues is also better than that of its peers in the last years. And its cost/income ratio is the best in the sector. So, Banesto is a very solid brand which, in the last years, has had much better trends than its competitors.</p>
          <p>However, as you know, we have announced the integration of Santander, Banesto and Banif, 2013. And as we have said before, this is an integration which we think will create value for Banesto's customers, shareholders and employees. Also at the group level, it consolidates Santander's leadership in Spain and will enable us to take advantage of the concentration of the banking sector to improve our profitability and efficiency.</p>
          <p>There will be four basic drivers as we said when we announced the operation. Large synergies, over net &#x2013; 10% of net operating income in Spain in 2012 &#x2013; significant efficiency improvements, boost for the higher potential segments such as private banking and companies, and a gain in market share which is already above our market share in branches.</p>
          <p>And with all of that, we'll repeat what we said when we announced the operation. We expect return on tangible equity in Spain in 2015 to be between 12% and 15%, creating value for our shareholders. We said at the time that we expected this to increase EPS by 3% by 2015.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the business in Spain overall, that is, this combines all the businesses, the Santander Branch Network, Banesto, GBM Spain, Santander Consumer Spain and Banif. Total of gross lending amounted to &#x20AC;206 billion, &#x20AC;194 billion net of provision, half of which corresponded to companies without real estate purpose and 1/4 to mortgages.</p>
          <p>Total deposits amounted to &#x20AC;202 billion, including &#x20AC;11 billion in retail commercial paper, of which &#x20AC;85 billion are demand deposits. These figures put our loan-to-deposit ratio at 96% after a very important improvement in our commercial gap, down by &#x20AC;40 billion in the year.</p>
          <p>If we look at the growth in deposits, as I said when I reviewed the Banesto and Santander networks, 2012 was an excellent year. We gained market share, over 200 basis points market share, this &#x2013; in all segments &#x2013; you can see in individuals, deposits rose 19%; private banking clients, 13%; institutional deposits, 14% and corporates 6%. So, a very good year for deposits.</p>
          <p>And if we look at lending, lending fell overall by 6% but big differences between segments. Gross lending with real estate purpose fell 32%. The individual household mortgages and consumer loans, down 7% due to household deleveraging. On the other hand, we have seen reasonably stable lending to companies and to the public sector with quite a lot of activities in sectors such as loans for exports, and the payment to suppliers fund established by the government. Finally, balances with large corporates have fallen, too, although it's not on the table, because of continued deleveraging by corporates.</p>
          <p>If we look at the quality of our lending in Spain, real estate sector NPL ratio has continued to rise because of the effect of the denominator in this ratio, because the outstanding balance for the second year &#x2013; for the second quarter running &#x2013; has fallen &#x20AC;208 million in the fourth quarter, but since the total volume has also fallen, the ratio has continued to rise. As you can see our lending with no real estate purpose has a much lower NPL ratio, below 4%, relatively stable NPL ratio for mortgages and pretty stable for companies and consumer credit. So overall, as you heard from our CEO, Santander's credit quality is substantially better than our peers in Spain and the whole of the industry in Spain.</p>
          <p>If we look at NPL entries, I'd say there's no real change here, both in individual mortgages and other individual loans, entries has fallen slightly, and we see a slight rise, although not very important in company NPLs which will be our priority focus for 2013.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Portugal, Portugal as you know, is undergoing major financial adjustments supervised by the EU, by the Troika. The country has undergone a significant recession with its GDP falling by 3% in 2012 and a significant fall in internal demand. The banking sector has been recapitalized and we have seen fairly significant effects already, particularly fall in the cost of deposits which began in Q1 2012 and which has continued to accelerate, whilst deleveraging continues. In volumes, trends are very similar to those of Spain. Deposits are up 2% and lending down 9%. As a result, loan-to-deposit ratio improving significantly.</p>
          <p>In results, basic revenues similar to 2011, gross income rose 7%, but here there is the effect of that tender offer we made &#x2013; I think it was Q1 or Q2 last year &#x2013; which distorts the comparison. Basic operating expenses down 5%. We've significantly contained our costs. We've increased provisions using the results of that tender offer I mentioned earlier, and so profit was &#x20AC;124 million, which is clearly very different to the levels obtained by our Portuguese competitors, most of which barely broke even or had losses.</p>
          <p>So in short, Santander total has continued to manage a very difficult economic context. We see this deleveraging continuing in the coming quarters with revenues remaining fairly stable. We will continue to reduce our expenses. Provisions will remain high. I'm sure in the year, we'll begin to converge towards more normal levels.</p>
          <p>Santander Consumer. High recurring profit, the volume of the deposit to &#x2013; lending-to-deposit volume &#x2013; has remained quite stable. 55% of our activity is for lending for the purchase of a car. There's high diversification by country, diversification also by product, and we have reached brand agreement with producers which are allowing us to do better than the rest of the industry. Growth evolution and risks, the NPL rate remained stable, 4%, which is very good for this type of business and coverage remains at around 110%.</p>
          <p>I do want to point out that this business has improved its self-funding capacity. You will remember that it was the only unit who's &#x2013; who got funding from the parent company &#x2013; at about &#x20AC;20 billion and that has been reduced to &#x20AC;4 billion because we have developed the ability to raise deposits and also to securitize in Nordic countries. In 2013, probably, the unit will self-finance and won't require funds from the parent company. Attributable profit &#x20AC;727 million, 9% more than 2011, a much higher profitability than the competition. Profit was somewhat lower in the fourth quarter because we had to make provisions in Italy because of the sale of some portfolios. Therefore, given the performance, we hope that the unit will continue to do better than the competition.</p>
          <p>With regards to Poland, the economy grew at 2%. In 2013, it will continue to grow more than the Eurozone, but at moderately low paces. The activity &#x2013; lending activity &#x2013; has increased, but the most important thing is the change in the mix because current accounts have increased by 13% and there was a reduction in time deposits, which are more expensive. In lending, we are focused more on individual borrowers, up 9%.</p>
          <p>I remind you that, as I said earlier, in 2011 it was not consolidated in the group and therefore, I will be referring in the <mark type="ph" /> booklet (34:11) to the variations, there was a growth of 11% in the net interest income, 22% net operating income and profit up 21%. If we look at quarter by quarter, well, we &#x2013; in the fourth quarter we had a record profit &#x20AC;93 million. Trust income remained the main driver of profit. Our goal in Poland is to complete the merger with the Kredyt Bank and deliver the volumes and results that we announced when we announced the merger with Kredyt Bank.</p>
          <p>For UK, the environment continues to be difficult from the macroeconomic and regulatory points of view. In the UK, we're going in a selective fashion. The mortgage portfolio fell 5% because we changed our policy with regards to interest on the mortgages, and therefore, the mortgage book fell 5%. In SMEs, that we are focusing on and our objective is to gain market share in this segment, we are growing 18%. This will be favored &#x2013; this strength &#x2013; by our participation in the funding-for-lending scheme. And we are opening new regional centers for companies.</p>
          <p>Flat deposits, our focus on reducing the most expensive and volatile. Type A, growth of 5% in retail deposits in 2012 due to the 1-2-3 strategy. This whole range 1-2-3 <mark type="ph" /> were all there (0:36:01) world has been very successful and we will continue to work on that strategy in 2013. With regards to results, the profit in the UK was &#xA3;952 million. The year saw a fall in revenues already coming to a halt, very good management of costs which fell in real terms, and provisions which improved in the second half of the year compared to the first half.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to revenues, there are positive factors which we will continue to see in the next few quarters which have allowed us to halt the fall and stabilize them. There has been an improvement of yields of the front book, reduced pressure in the liquidity buffer which will help to improve future revenues and better fee income which had its best quarter in the fourth quarter. With stable revenues and management of costs, allowed a slight rise in profit in the fourth quarter. In 2013, we started with a similar trend. All of that will affect the net interest income. Growth trend has been improving since &#x2013; will improved since &#x2013; as of mid-2013.</p>
          <p>Brazil, the macroeconomic environment has been quite different to what we expected and what the market expected, too, at the beginning of the year. Growth on GDP was at about 1%. I remind you that a year ago we thought that it was going to grow by 3%. But once again, we think that it's going to pick up in 2013 and grow at about 3%. Interest rates at historic <mark type="ph" /> growth (0:37:41) 7.25%, and inflation almost 6%.</p>
          <p>In regards to activity in Brazil. At the end of the year, the last part of the year, the growth was lower. We were growing at two digits and at the end, we grow at 6% in lending and deposits, and this has been an industry trend particularly more for private banks, not so much for public banks which grew more.</p>
          <p>Profit, at $2.841 billion. The top part of the income statement is very sound. Basic revenues grew 12%, hurt by lending, management of credit spreads and mix of products, half the level of inflation and half the rate of revenue. Therefore, this cost-to-income ratio improved. Net operating income was 17% higher.</p>
          <p>The group performance at the top part of the account is not reflected in the final profit just because of higher provisions and minority interests. Provisions was in the first half of the year and declined in the second half. In the fourth quarter, net interest income fell because of a drop in interest rates, lower credit spreads sector wide and the smaller volume impact. In the next few quarters, if we're right about the economy, we think that lending will grow again by two digits and we think that this will offset results this year.</p>
          <p>Costs partly reflect the signing of the wage agreement in September and provisions fell a little. NPLs increased slightly in the fourth quarter as we adopted more rigorous criteria in the renewal of operations. For the fifth quarter running, there was a positive evolution in loans and in a regular situation less than 90 days overdue which, for 2013, should be reflected in the cost of credit.</p>
          <p>We see an environment with some pressure on spreads, business volumes that will grow during the year, fee income growing at double-digit rates, personnel and general costs increasing at below inflation.</p>
          <p>The rest of Latin America, Latin America ex-Brazil, growth was significant two digits, 10% growth in loan and 12% growth in deposits. Attributable profit was &#x20AC;2.68 billion, 9% less than 2011 if we eliminate the perimeter effect, then they would have increased by 9%. This growth underscores the strength of the income statement with gross income of by almost 15% and improvement in efficiency ratio and growth of more than 10% in the net operating income after provisions.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter recorded the highest gross income in the last two years and a profit before minority interest higher than in the second and third quarters. In general, all countries performed well in the upper part of the income statement and double-digit growth in profits in almost all cases.</p>
          <p>Mexico, good macroeconomic environment for the business, stable interest rates, inflation on target, and strong growth. 3.6% is what has been forecasted for 2013. 2012 was a year of expansion in which we gained market share in loans to SMEs, consumer lending, mortgages, and demand and time deposits. We see this trend continuing in the future.</p>
          <p>With regards to results, growth was between 15% to 20% in net interest income, gross income and net operating income and profit. The gross income was particularly solid due to the increase in net interest income and in fee income. In the fourth quarter, gross income continued to do well, and increased for the seventh quarter in a row. Costs increased because of the usual seasonal impact in the fourth quarter, as well as a greater commercial activity with 600 more employees in the quarter and we've opened 47 points of sale.</p>
          <p>Provisions increased due to the credit mix, greater share of consumer and SMEs, a project finance operation and some worsening in consumer finance due to a specific campaign. The risk premium remained low, and very good NPL/income ratios which we expect to continue this year. In short, a very good business evolution which has future earnings and we think this will remain in the coming quarters, excluding these elements of provisions which are quite specific for that quarter.</p>
          <p>Chile, good macroeconomic environment, growth 5%, interest rates 5% and inflation 1.5% in 2012. We think that the inflation rate will be 3% in 2013. There has been a significant improvement in our activities in this quarter in deposits and we continue to focus on retail deposits that are growing 12%. Faster pace of lending in the fourth quarter, we'll be much more selective, focusing on basically SMEs and high income customers.</p>
          <p>Results, profit fell because of a lower than expected inflation and higher provisions which reflected the deterioration of the sector's credit quality, lower loan-loss recoveries and a more conservative policy than some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Sharp rise in the fourth quarter, profits due to more net interest income, benefiting from higher inflation. Basic revenues grew 50% over the third quarter. Lower provisions with stabilized risk premium at high levels and that will continue to be so in the next few quarters before we see a gradual reduction. These two effects produced the highest quarterly profit in 2012.</p>
          <p>For 2013, we see positive elements for the income statement like higher inflation, some recovery in business volumes, although not too intense, and slower growth in costs.</p>
          <p>The rest of Latin America performed very well. Argentina closed the year with increases in all the margins, with a very good track record. The fourth quarter profit was $119 million. In Puerto Rico and Peru, profits rose by more than 30%. Uruguay's profit more than doubled through &#x2013; though from a small base in 2011. The profit of International Private Banking grew 6%. So, we see a very favorable picture which will continue this year.</p>
          <p>United States, we think that the economy will continue to grow at about 2% with interest rates still very low and we think we'll remain at those levels until 2015. Although this is especially the financial sector improves the spreads, but the group made $1.042 billion in 2012, of which Sovereign Bank contributed $606 million. Loans and deposits grew by 5%. Profit was $190 million in the fourth quarter, recovering its momentum after the extraordinary charge from Trust PIERS in the third quarter. Credit quality remained excellent, reflected in the shortfall in provisions in 2012 which fell by 35%.</p>
          <p>Santander Consumer U.S.A. contributed $436 million; lending grew 15% with a strong rise in new loans, which offsets the accelerated amortization of the portfolios acquired and enable a stable contribution to the group to be maintained in the last quarters.</p>
          <p>Comparisons for 2011 are affected by two important effects: the use of provisions in the first quarter of 2011 and a perimeter effect of $50 million quarterly average between 2012 and all the quarters of 2011 due to the reduced stake in Santander Consumer USA.  In the coming quarters, recurring revenues will continue to grow based on a balance sheet which is more balanced by business, improvement of IT systems and in a large range of products and services.</p>
          <p>Finally, corporate activities, results were lower than in 2011 because of reduced gross income and higher provisions. The lower gross income was mainly due to the impact on the net interest income of a higher cost of credit of issuances in wholesale markets and maintaining a liquidity buffer in the European Central Bank of &#x20AC;352 million. And then the reduction in income accounted for &#x2013; by the equity asset from Metrovacesa with the charge of &#x20AC;100 million. The higher provisions were due to the amortization of the goodwill in Italy, &#x20AC;156 million, and the real estate fund, &#x20AC;169 million. Also costs from the SEB integration in Germany for &#x20AC;50 million. That explains the variation of almost &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>I hand back now to the CEO to give us the conclusions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, provisions that were made in 2011, Santander faces better conditions a year, which will be another very demanding one for managing banks in the countries where we operate. Beginning with the Eurozone, here we're already seeing a gradual recovery in the confidence of markets in the Euro which will help to offset a very weak macroeconomic environment. Progress toward banking union and a greater integration are already beginning to be felt in the markets, particularly in the peripheral countries with sharp falls in risk premiums.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the recapitalization of banks and the private sector adjustment already completed will join the impact of the structural reforms underway to recover growth in the last part of the year. In the rest of developed countries, the dynamics of recovery will continue with the U.S. at the head if a definite agreement that is finally reached on the fiscal cliff. And the UK will grow more than in 2012. Emerging markets will continue to make a difference. Latin America's average growth will accelerate to around 4%, spurred by the recovery of Brazil. In Europe, Poland will register positive growth compared to a flat Eurozone.</p>
          <p>In short, we still see weak global macroeconomic scenario, but that will improve during 2013 for a more solid recovery in 2014. The regulatory fear with new liquidity and capital demands is trying to adjust to the current situation and not halt the recovery. A good example is a new definition of the liquidity coverage ratio known in January which, along with other changes, will be gradually implemented until 2019.</p>
          <p>In 2013, the different growth scenarios will require Santander to manage things in a differentiated manner, tailored to specific conditions in order to develop the growth foundations for the coming years. It will be vital to strengthen our pre-provision profit. In Spain and Portugal, we still have recession and deleveraging. Our priority will be to execute the merger between Santander, Banesto and Banif in the time frames and form expected. For this purpose, teams are already in place, agreements for labor unions reached, various commercial actions with customers are being carried out, et cetera. In business, the focus will be on spread management, above all, improving the cost of funds and throughout the risk cycle where we see a normalization of the cost of credit as of the second half of 2013 and in 2014.</p>
          <p>Santander Consumer Finance points to solid profits and levels of profitability, above that of its European peers, backed by country and product diversification and excellent management of the whole risk process. We will continue to gain market share in new car financing in Europe as we did in 2012. And we expect the area to be self-financed by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>In Poland, we have two objectives: deliver the results from the merger with Kredyt Bank and gain market share in lending, taking advantage of the greater muscle of the franchise.</p>
          <p>The United Kingdom has to manage a very demanding macro and regulatory environment. Selective growth, more focus on profitability than on volumes and improving the spreads of the front book particularly in deposits, that will be key for boosting revenues in the second half of the year. We will focus on increasing individual customers' linkage via our 1-2-3 range and select.</p>
          <p>And Latin America aims to provide solid rises in revenue, volumes and spreads in a good macroeconomic environment which we'll have to maintain adequate levels of credit quality. In Brazil, the higher economic growth expected will impact business positively. We see double-digit growth in volumes, personnel and general costs rising below the rate of inflation, and the gradual improvement in credit quality as the economy improves. Management of spreads will be key.</p>
          <p>Mexico began 2013 with a stronger franchise and an expansion. The objective is to maintain solid trends in volumes and results.</p>
          <p>In Chile, we expect greater activity mainly on the liability side with selective growth in lending to the most profitable segments and products.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in the U.S., the objective is to strengthen commercial and retail banking with a larger range of products. This will enable us to grow in volumes and offset an environment of lower spreads. We also see a good performance in the cost of credit as the excellent evolution of credit quality will be maintained and operating expenses will grow less than in 2012.</p>
          <p>In short, we believe that the worst part of the cycle is already over. Real estate exposure is fully provisioned. Financial costs point on a downward trend as a reduction of the risk premium and the lower wholesale funding feeds through to business. We see signs of recovery of the confidence in Europe and higher growth in some countries such as Brazil. We are increasing the commercial capacity in our main unit to take advantage of the new cycle. All of this should be reflected in a gradual increase of our activity and our results, more notable from 2014 onwards.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We're going to start taking questions that we received over the Web and then if we have time and if we get the questions over the phone, we'll try to answer those as well. And we are going to organize the questions by concepts and we're going to start with questions about the regulation prospects and strategy.</p>
          <p>There are several questions on plans, existing plans. Jaime Becerril from JPMorgan asks whether we still have plans for an IPO in the U.S. and in Poland, and if we have any plans for the UK? Antonio Ramirez from Keefe is asking about the timing of the IPO of consumer &#x2013; Santander Consumer Financing in the USA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the world of IPOs, there are no news, nothing new to mention. We still have the same idea of doing an IPO in the UK, but we have no date for that. In Poland, we will follow the plans that we already have. We don't expect to do an IPO on the short term. We're going to place the shares that have already been committed with the supervisor, with the regulator.</p>
          <p>In the United States, the IPO of part of Santander Consumer Finance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:06) in the United States, that will be done from the second to the third quarter of this year, depending on technical aspects and also depending on the market circumstances. The idea is to do a placement, private equities are not going to happen. We're going to reduce our stake, but not by very much. We are not going to sell 65% that we have now. We will sell an amount that we still have to define, but it's not going to be very much. And that's what I can say about IPOs.</p>
          <p>In Spain, well, I can say that what we've already said on previous occasions, we are studying very carefully all possibilities that arise in the market, and we will be presenting offerings, but this has to be prudent, serious, sensible, and that is all I can say. We have no other news on that front. And I think I answered all your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca and Britta Schmidt from Autonomous are asking about all the noise in Italy surrounding the Antonveneta transaction. Any comments on our part because different names are being rounded including Santander, do we have anything to say about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a lot. It's true that the bank carried out a successful divestment with Antonveneta at a time when, if you will remember, the Italian bank had a lot of appetite for growth and for acquisitions. We were on a different point of the cycle and we're in quite a different mood altogether. But obviously, all of these things are being discussed in the media have no basis as time will show.</p>
          <p>As for our payout policy, oh, there's two questions, sorry, about growth in volumes for the group but if you agree since we're going to talk about each of the units, we can answer those in turn instead of giving the global figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As for payout, there's two questions, Mario Lodos from Sabadell and Daragh Quinn from Nomura. Given the better capital ratios, are we considering once again, paying dividends fully in cash or maybe to scrip to cash, what is going to be our payout policy in the future, in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that will have to be defined when the time comes by the Board. And in fact right now, what we've decided stands and what we haven't decided, hasn't been decided, so I can't really give you anything more accurate than that. We will continue to offer scrip dividend, at least in 2013, and probably partly or wholly also in 2014, but I can't commit either because I can't really, since that's up to the Board when the time comes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving on to the financial management capital ratios part, there's a question from Britta Schmidt with regards to the breakdown of extraordinary revenues in 4T, I think Jos&#xE9; Antonio explained them, corporate center level. If you need any additional clarification, let us know and we'll send you the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As for capital, there are several questions, Antonio Ramirez, <mark type="ph" /> Carlos Peixoto (1:00:51), and others with regards to the full and core capital in 4T versus three, what's the currency impact of real? These are all the questions surrounding why the core capital ratio fell in 4T &#x2013; in Q4 rather.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's true that in Q4 as compared to Q3, there has been a fall of 6 or 7 basis points in our core capital. The main reason behind that is in fact the exchange rate effect, that we have hedges, that hedges sometimes are spot, others are forward, others are options. I mean, our hedges with options, there's usually some variability that we take on. In the quarter we've been negatively hit, particularly by the depreciation of the real and that's the biggest effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>About capital, there's a couple of questions more. Antonio Ramirez is asking whether we're willing to increase capital if we were to make an acquisition in Spain such as Catalunya Banc. And then there are several questions from David Vaamonde from Fidentiis, <mark type="ph" /> Mario Lodos (1:02:09)  and Carlos Garcia about capital, Basel III impact, fully loaded, and CRD4 impact which is exactly the same thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of the first question, I'll answer and say no, we're not going to increase capital. The second question, impact fully loaded Basel III, well, as we've said before, in other quarterly presentations, the bank will, at all times, with Basel III, remain an over 9% core capital ratio.</p>
          <p>Question from Carlos Garcia from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; about deferred asset volumes. You will see a breakdown as we do every year in the report, both on the asset and liability sides, the trend will be very similar to that of previous years.</p>
          <p>And a question from David Vaamonde, Fidentiis about the core capital ratio of the parent. The parent has a ratio of 10.26% exactly, as the Santander parent core capital ratio of just about 10.1%, which was <mark type="ph" /> 3% (01:03:28) in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antonio Ramirez is asking about critical requirements for banks in the UK. Can we expect a greater impact on risk-weighted assets of the parent or do we think there will be greater capital requirements to cover that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't think we're going to need any additional capital or that we're going to have to cover with more capital. We are very comfortable with capital in the UK. We have a capital surplus, in fact. So there's no reason to think that &#x2013; or no reason for concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to finish with capital ratio questions, we have a question about assets at risk. Do we see any improvement with the current transmission ratio of 44% of assets-at-risk to total assets? I suppose they're referring to the regulatory context. Whether we think this ratio will change and do we expect it to rise or fall and how?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this ratio, this 44% ratio, depends on two things: regulations on the one hand and management on the other. We are constantly working from the management side to keep that transmission ratio at whatever level it should have so it will not have any idle capital. And so that assets-at-risk will be those that the bank has chosen and that they will be managed rigorously and with an eye toward optimizing there.</p>
          <p>Quantity as for the regulatory side, I don't think there's any news about that except the fact that there's an international tendency to set a sort of single book of rules so that everyone will have the same weighting for assets-at-risk. So, there will be a level playing field for risk-weighted assets for all international banks. But beyond that, I don't think that there's going to be any particular proposal or issue at the regulatory level, globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. About liquidity, there are several questions about the LTRO. As you can imagine, there's a lot of questions. Rohith Chandra from Barclays, Axel Finsterbusch from JPMorgan and Mario Lodos from Sabadell are asking about basically two concepts, the repayment of the &#x20AC;24 billion in LTRO, the rationale, will we be repaying any more?</p>
          <p>And the second question is the impact on our income statement and whether we have anything deposited with the ECB and how much? And to finish with the questions about the LTRO and so on, whether we have returned outside &#x2013; from outside Spain &#x2013; specifically in Portugal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, as we said in the presentation, we have repaid or returned yesterday, the &#x20AC;24 billion we had taken up in December, in the LTRO in December. Whether we plan to repay any more or return any more, we are using it as a cushion basically for insurance. Basically, we have it deposited with the ECB in the same amount we took up. At year-end we had &#x20AC;35 billion and we still have deposited with the ECB a significant amount after paying those &#x20AC;24 billion back.</p>
          <p>So, the decision of whether to repay any more or return any more, the answer would be probably yes, but it will depend on the <mark type="ph" /> admission from (01:07:38) markets. And the impact on our income statement, well, it costs 75 basis points, charged to the corporate center as I said, and the liquidity buffer had had a negative impact on our income statement as I said. As for Portugal, we've not returned anything. We still have &#x20AC;5 billion the LTRO. The situation has improved significantly there as well, but we haven't decided to return that for &#x2013; just for safety's sake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a question about &#x2013; from Ignacio Sanz at UBS &#x2013; about ALCO portfolios. Can we elaborate on the size of those ALCO portfolios? How much do we have in the different divisions and &#x2013; or is our position there? I suppose that means both maturities and volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, ALCO portfolios overall, you have that in portfolios available for sale. As you know, as we always say, we don't hold any to maturity and so the ALCO portfolio is in portfolios available for sale.</p>
          <p>Total for the group I think is &#x20AC;92 billion. Most of it, I'd say, 60% to 80% is public debt and the split is &#x2013; in Spain about &#x20AC;24 billion, parent has maybe &#x20AC;18 billion, &#x20AC;19 billion; Banesto, &#x20AC;4 billion or &#x20AC;5 billion; Portugal, &#x20AC;2 billion; Brazil, &#x20AC;11 billion. So, these are the main portfolios. Poland, &#x20AC;2 billion. These are the main portfolios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch and <mark type="ph" /> Francisco Riquelme from N+1 (01:09:30) are asking about capital, what are our expectations for organic capital generation this year and how do we expect our core capital ratio to evolve in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, it's always hard to predict how markets are going to evolve, but this year we generated about 80-some basis points before provisions. And since this year, we don't expect as big a provisioning effort as this year, we expect those 80 or 90 basis points to be our ordinary, organic capital generation maintaining the current payout policy, which is already in place for this year, so that's basically what we expect. In terms of organic capital generation, of course, that could vary based on other things like risk-weighted assets, exchange rates and the usual element, but what we expect is around that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;rick Teschner from Natixis is asking about the impairment of our goodwill in Italy, is there any goodwill left? And the answer is no. With provisioned within that remained and is there are any other type of goodwill at risk? What we considered at the end of the year is that there is no other goodwill needing to be provisioned right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carlo Digrandi from HSBC is asking something along a similar line. With respect to risk-weighted assets, have we seen the full impact of the advanced models or IRB? And do we expect due to some other reasons that there might be a fall in risk-weighted assets in the forthcoming weeks or have we seen that already?</p>
          <p>Moving on to risk quality. There are general questions at the group level in terms of what we predict for the cost of risk in the next two years. And more specifically, there are several questions about the cost of risk in Spain. Britta Schmidt from Autonomous, Daragh Quinn from Nomura and Antonio Ramirez from Keefe are asking whether we still maintain our guidance of 150 basis points for the cost of risk in 2013? What is our forecast for cost of risk?</p>
          <p>And then, of course, there's questions about NPLs in Spain. We have questions about our forecast for NPL ratios, both in the year and by segments. Specifically, they're asking about SME's in some cases and others are asking about individuals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, in 2013, provisioning in there for the cost of credit in Spain specifically will not &#x2013; we expect that it will not change significantly, save for any extraordinary provision for the real estate parts. So, excluding real estate and speaking about our normal business, the cost of lending will remain at approximately the same levels as in 2012.</p>
          <p>The risk premium. We probably will start to see a slight improvement starting the end of 2013 which will be more tangible and feed through to our bottom line starting in 2014, converging or normalizing at levels of risk premium or a cost of lending of around 60, 70 basis points, which is where it should be eventually. But probably it will take us, in Spain, at least a couple of years to get to that level still, starting in 2014.</p>
          <p>In 2013, again, we expect it to remain more or less where it is now and to get it where it was in 2012, excluding again, of course, extraordinary provisions for real estate, which means that NPLs will continue to rise slightly in 2013, probably peaking towards the end of 2013, Q4. And since that always has a mismatch with provisions, we expect provisions to start following, as I've said, starting in 2014. That's for Spain.</p>
          <p>For the other countries, we don't expect any reason for concern. In fact, I imagine that there will be questions about Chile or about Mexico or about Brazil. And a lot of these trends were due to seasonal one-off effects and we don't really see any underlying issues in any of these economies beyond the Spanish case I've mentioned. I hope that's answered everything.</p>

          <p>Patrick Lee from RBC has two questions about the sale of real estate. Can we talk about property sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we gave you all the details in the presentation, but what about the discount like? I'd tell you the discount was at around 45%, 50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario Lodos has the same question. And Patrick is also asking about percentage which we're offering mortgages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said already in the presentation, but it's always below 60% of what we're selling, that we're mortgaging. So, over 40% is not financed through our mortgaging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In connection to that, there's two questions from Antonio Ramirez and Patrick Lee from Keefe and RBC, respectively. The first is asking about whether we expect to have to provision more for real estate loans or assets in Spain, all the way to the worst case scenario for Oliver Wyman. Are we covered now that we've met the Royal Decree requirements? And the second question is do we expect that the establishment of the SAREB might have some additional impact on your real estate activities, whether it be sales or prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, real estate provisioning is done and completed and so from that point of view, we don't need to provision any further in 2013 for this purpose. However, in our budget, we have included some potential portfolio sales at significant discounts, and so we have assigned &#x20AC;1 billion for 2013 in our budgets for that sort of thing, basically for accelerated portfolio sales or accelerated property sales within our own policy to accelerate sales. Why? Because we do not want &#x2013; we are concerned about the SAREB's activities in the property market.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Santander was much more aggressive than its peers. We sold a lot more properties than they did, and of course, we were more aggressive in our pricing policies. And in 2013, we will maintain that aggressive marketing strategy for us to anticipate or at least sell as much as we can and reduce our foreclosed and acquired property volumes before the SAREB starts operating successfully in the market, which will happen soon. But if we can get in there before the SAREB starts achieving cruising speed, so much the better, and so that's the policy we will maintain during 2013.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we don't need any more provisions because everything is fully provisioned and coverage is, in some cases, higher than required. Second, we have included in our budget a &#x20AC;1 billion penalty because of a more aggressive marketing policy that might be required. These we will finance from capital gains that are already, more or less, in place. And thirdly, 2013, we will continue with our aggressive marketing policy because we expect greater competition in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. As for credit quality, there's a question from <mark type="ph" /> Francisco Riquelme from N+1 (01:18:49) about refinancing levels, where we are, and will we be reporting based on requirements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, we will be reporting these figures and we will be including all the information when we publish the official documents at the close of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are several questions from David Vaamonde from Fidentiis, Jaime Becerril, about risk premiums in Mexico and Brazil. Andrea Filtri, the same thing about UK and Brazil. And since we're going to talk about the units, and there's quite a lot of questions about them, we'll look at it unit by unit, which is, I think, better.</p>
          <p>And there is one final question about LTVs from Carlo Digrandi from HSBC. Loan-to-values of our mortgages, about book, is about 52% in the Santander, work on the front book which usually is between 60% and 70%, and the last quarter was at 54%.</p>
          <p>Business areas. Moving on to business areas. Specifically in Spain, there are several questions that I will list. Quite a few about about deposits. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley, Axel Finsterbusch, Daragh Quinn from Nomura, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Teschner from Natixis, and Ignacio Sanz from UBS.</p>
          <p>And Patrick Lee from RBC again, asking about deposits and the questions are the following. Reasons for that increase, volumes, and prices, both looking back and looking forward. Asking also about the impact of the Bank of Spain recommendation on maximum spreads, and if that's so, what might be the impact on our net interest income? And thirdly, if I'm not mistaken, mean duration of deposits and how we will re-price them or are we planning to re-price them?</p>
          <p>And there's a final question by Jaime Becerril about the cost of retail funding in Spain 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's see if I can answer all that and not leaving anything out.</p>
          <p>First, in 2012, clearly, Santander had spectacular growth in deposits and to a large extent, this was due to the uncertainly in the market for a lot of banks which were getting a lot of press coverage, there was a lot uncertainty and there sort of was a corresponding flight to quality by a lot of savers and that has brought into Santander a clear competitive advantage. And, of course, that is part of the explanation. Another part of that explanation is the fact that we, like the rest of the sector, were very aggressive with pricing because the rest of the industry had very aggressive pricing strategy this year.</p>
          <p>And, of course as you know, it's been discussed that the Bank of Spain was going to set some limitations, but it's not true. The Bank of Spain has not set any caps on the price of funding nor has it forced banks to keep its spreads below a particular level. What the Bank of Spain has done is to tell the industry about its concern over income statements and the impact that the high price of deposits is having on those income statements because there are some banks, particularly those that have only a national perimeter, that are suffering operating losses and are therefore destroying capital, and that has implications on their solvency. And of course, the responsibilities of the Bank of Spain as potential supervisor is to announce that they might require banks with such practices to hold more capital. This is a warning across the board to the industry which has meant certain moderation in these practices.</p>
          <p>And so in 2013, and that's another question, we expect to see an improvement on the price of funding because we, specifically at least, see that the environment is less competitive and so we will be able to bring down our spreads on customer funding and that will have an impact. We'll have to wait and see what happens in the market but we do expect, undoubtedly, to see some additional revenues as a result of this change in the context.</p>
          <p>In 2012, our deposits grew by &#x20AC;22 billion as I think you heard in the presentation. And I don't know if I've left anything out. Was that all the questions? Oh, maybe you could say something about the cost of retail funding in general. Well, as a result of this, the cost of retail funding, we believe in 2013, on average, will go down in comparison with 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, as for lending, there are also several questions. Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley, Patrick Lee from RBC and Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;rick Teschner at Natixis, are asking on our outlook for lending, whether we expect it to grow? Whether lending to the real estate sector may contribute or subtract from that growth in 2013? Whether the personnel and spreads in Spain &#x2013; it's always about lending &#x2013; whether we think that that might continue or not, mortgages, how do we expect them to evolve given the current low interest rates? Do we have activated collars or caps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, net interest income out of &#x2013; in 2013 and 2014 in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well as for lending, I think in 2012, we were particularly hit by the fall in the Euribor rate and therefore, that reduced the price on our mortgage book which of course, had a much lower price, and falling quarter after quarter or month after month, depending on how you look at it. I think the Euribor has now, I think, touched rock bottom and probably may even rise slightly from now on. So basically, as far as lending, I don't expect there to be any more pressure on spreads than we had for mortgages in 2012.</p>
          <p>For other segments, basically, spreads are stable, more or less. And therefore, there, except for volumes or activity, I don't expect to see much of an impact on revenues. Besides volumes, it's true that now lending volumes are down, particularly because of real estate lending and slightly also because of lending for consumer finance. Not so for business lending, although overall, lending in the system has fallen. If you look at what the Santander has been doing in our business segment, we've not reduced lending to businesses in 2012. We've maintained our volume of loans to businesses, including the fund for supplier payment, which is a way to feed through loans to businesses ultimately.</p>
          <p>And in 2013, we expect spreads to remain fairly similar value. Perhaps slight improvement in the mortgage book because we don't expect the Euribor to fall any further and no real impact on other spreads. So, if lending volumes fall slightly so will revenues, but I think because of falling cost of funding, revenue should improve significantly.</p>
          <p>Plus fee income, let's not forget, have performed very well in 2012 particularly in the last quarters. I think that in 2013, we will see revenues rise significantly in Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving on to the units. We have three units with similar questions and we organize them basically UK, Brazil, Mexico. Questions about the UK, basically about two items on the income statement. Questions from &#xC1;lvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley, Patrick Lee from RBC, Antonio Ramirez from Keefe and Andrea Filtri, some are about net interest income, which has stabilized in Q4. Do we expect this stabilization to continue or do we think that there will be increasing weakness? What is our outlook for net interest income and its components? That's the first set of questions. And the second, sort of if there's any news about the risk premium or about NPLs that we feel should mention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give you an idea of what is happening in the UK. In the UK, we can see very clearly that there is an improvement in the profitability on the side of assets, but also in terms of the cost of deposits. The front book's of the new production is obtaining very good spreads in assets, in lending, and in deposits. This is only reflected in the revenue and we will see this even clearer in the future because, of course, the back book has a very important weight with regards to the front book. But I repeat, in the front book, we are seeing improvements in profitability in lending and improvements in costs in the deposits.</p>
          <p>Now, on the side of costs, the trend is good. We're growing below market. Our cost remains basically flat and that is very positive and we're also seeing stability in provisions, so we don't see anything alarming when it comes to provisions. But apart from that, we have obtained a better structure in our financing on the wholesale side, but also on the retail side.</p>
          <p>On the retail side, I wanted to underline the success of the 1-2-3 account which allowed us to grow in current accounts, grow significantly, but also on the cost of deposits because they increased because we went from &#x20AC;25 billion on the short term to the mid-term, but the structure has improved.</p>
          <p>The brand is improving very clearly in England. It is consolidated &#x2013; or consolidating &#x2013; in SMEs, for example, which is one of our strategic objectives. Lending grew more than 20% in 2012 and strategically speaking, this is excellent news. So, the brand is improving in the UK, so very good results in SMEs, very good results from our commercial campaigns, that's on the commercial side.</p>
          <p>And also we must mention that we have reduced our mortgage book by 5%, but we have to interpret this clearly. We are obtaining more profitability and the risk quality is better. We're being more selective. We are reducing the loan-to-value interest only. So, that is &#x2013; means more quality rather than worse activity. That's how it should be interpreted. It has been a good year in terms of spreads, in terms of costs, also in terms of provisions.</p>
          <p>And so if the question is what do we expect in 2013? Well, we won't notice this in the first half of 2013. The revenue will remain stable in the first half. But in Q3 and Q4 we will see improvements. So, in the second half of the year is where we will notice these improvements. So, that is how we see our prospects in the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From the UK there is one last question from <mark type="ph" /> Raymond John (01:33:32) on provisions for conduct remediation that we've made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We gave information on that when we announced the results of Q3. Do we expect to do more of that in 2013, and the answer is that we've already made provisions for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we talk about Brazil now, there are quite a lot of questions on the top part of the income statement, on the net interest income. Several questions, for example about, Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley and others ask about pressures on the margin. What do we expect about the NII? Do we think it is going to fall further? What about the revenues? And related to that, what is the growth outlook, that's from <mark type="ph" /> Francisco Riquelme (01:34:37), what do we expect that regarding the growth of lending in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect a 6.25% during 2013 and 2014.</p>
          <p>Well, Brazil in 2012, if we look at the whole year, the top part of the income statement has been very good. The net interest income grew 17% in the year. <mark type="ph" /> The process (1:35:12) were more revenues. And the lending growth has slowed down a little bit, by 6%, but that's in line of what happened in Brazil, generally speaking. But the top part of the account did very well with a growth of 17%. Costs also performed very well, in line with inflation, 5% is by how much expenses grew. And provisions grew quite a lot, but it is also true that they grew less in the last half of the year.</p>
          <p>And I think your questions focus on understanding better Q4. Well, in Q4 we had noticed an impact of the spreads on the revenues, although we're also seeing less provisions. Net interest income fell because of falls in the interest rate because interest rates fell; also because of pressure on the credit spreads; and also because Q4 was worse off in volumes but we hope that will recover in 2013 when the macro situation improves in Brazil. So, it is true that there is pressure on the spreads in the industry and falls in the interest rate and that has an impact on the net interest income, but it is also true that we expect the growth in volume in 2013 which can at least, in part, offset that impact.</p>
          <p>In Brazil on Q4, we also saw a strong impact on costs because of the signing of the bargaining agreement, because these agreements in Brazil are signed in September. And, of course, it has a seasonal impact on the fourth quarter, but provisions fall nevertheless, fall slightly.</p>
          <p>So, ever since the third quarter, and talking about the NPL losses in third quarter, and the second and the fourth quarter too, we're seeing a very good performance of loans in arrears of less than 90 days, which means that in 2013, we will see an improvement in the cost of credit.</p>
          <p>So, what do we see in the future? We see an environment with certain pressure on margins. We see volumes that will grow throughout the year. We see fees that will grow two digits. We see personnel and general expenses that will increase but less than inflation, and the cost of credit that will improve in line with the economic recovery. And that is my outlook on Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mexico, Daragh Quinn from Nomura, Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley, and Irma Garrido from Ahorro Corporaci&#xF3;n ask if, on two aspects, if there is a slowdown in activity in Mexico and why did costs increase &#x2013; or actually, provisions &#x2013; why did provisions increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fourth quarter in Mexico, I think, is a little bit misleading. It might give rise to the wrong interpretation. 2012 as a whole has been a very good year, with growth of 15% to 20% in almost all the lines in margins and profits. And with very sound revenues from fees and net interest income.</p>
          <p>So, the year was a very good year as a whole. And Q4, on the one hand, we see very good performance of revenues as we expected. But there are two things that we need to explain. It might be misunderstood. On the one hand, increase in costs and on the other hand, increase in provisions. What happened in Q4? Well, two things happened. With regards to the costs, we had a seasonal effect because of the increase in the number of branch offices &#x2013; we've increased our staff by 600 people because we opened 46 branch offices. And that impact was noticed fully on the fourth quarter and this is why in Q4 costs don't look very good. But as I say, this is a seasonal impact only. That's on the side of costs. And on the side of revenue, we did very well because they grew for the seventh quarter in a row. On the side of costs, this increase in the staff or the number of branch offices.</p>
          <p>And in terms of provisions, we had a bad Q4 because of three things, basically: because of the credit mix, consumer loans, SMEs, credit cards, our percentage is higher than that of our competition and that goes against us. It, of course, it's good for us in the first item on the income statement because it generates more spreads and, therefore, more revenue, but you also need to make more provisions for that; and then we had a one-off in a project finance that we had to record with a specific provision for that; and thirdly, there was a certain impairment in consumer lending with a campaign that Santander Mexico did and that had an impact on us. We stopped that campaign and from thereon, the indicators are performing better. So, we don't expect that this will last much longer in 2013.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the performance of the business, in the results where we will see that it will remain very good in the next few quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a couple of questions to finish. Some are based on liquidity. Antonio, perhaps, you could answer this question about liquidity and state what is the average cost of the debt that is maturing. How does that compare with new issues and whether the reduction of the commercial GAAP continues to be a priority in 2013 compared to the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the average cost, I think they're referring to wholesale funding. Wholesale funding is maturing at an average cost which is over than that of new issues. It is also true that new issues will be significantly lower than the volumes that are maturing because of the reduction in the commercial gap.</p>
          <p>Whether that is going to be a priority? We expect the commercial gap to fall in 2013 because of what the CEO explained. We will continue to grow in deposits at a lower cost and we don't think there is going to be much lending because we're lending this related to real estate and the households are deleveraging. So we think that the gap will continue to fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And now there is a question on whether you have any plans to make acquisitions in the UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Alfredo, what can you say about the cost? Because there's a question from Irma Garrido that the staff is falling in almost all areas, in central services, et cetera. How do you see costs performing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we've mentioned on other occasions, there are two dynamics in the bank. One of them is where costs grow which is in those units that are growing. Mexico is one of them, very clearly so. To a certain extent, Brazil as well. In Brazil, there is strong pressure for costs to increase. And Argentina as well, but there is an effect of a high inflation rate in Argentina. Oh, and also in Sovereign where costs are also going up.</p>
          <p>Well, with those exceptions, in the other units, we're always looking to improve our cost-to-income ratio and we don't think costs are going to grow very much. They're going to grow below inflation or even remain flat in countries where inflation is very low, like Spain, Portugal and the UK and other Latin American countries.</p>
          <p>In fact, in 2013, the jaws, as we like to call then, we think jaws will be very small, the difference between the growth of expenses and the growth of revenue because of countries like Brazil, the U.S. and Chile to a certain extent too. And Mexico, their costs are growing and in the other units costs are contained.</p>

          <p>Fine, well, we've come to the end of our presentation, there are no further questions. We hope we answered all of them. If that is not the case, please get in touch with Relations, with Investors and we'll try to answer all your questions. Thank you.</p>
