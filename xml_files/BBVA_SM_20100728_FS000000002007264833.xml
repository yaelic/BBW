          <p>Good morning to everyone. I am Manuel Gonz&#xE1;lez Cid and I am the CFO for the BBVA Group. As you know, today we have the presentation of the second quarter results; so our COO, &#xC1;ngel Cano, will be giving that presentation. But first of all, with respect to the latest presentations, there are going to be two changes today that I want to talk about. First of all, we talk about something that's purely technical in nature because of all the problems we had with the sound track in the conference call coming out of this room and also the problems we had with the coupling of lines, the last presentation, we decided we're doing everything over webcast now. So all the questions have to be over the webcast as well; we won't have people asking questions here or over the conference call. So, all the questions that can't be answered because of time limitations because afterwards we're going to be talking to the media so we have to keep things short, but Investor Relations will deal with any questions that are left in the &#x2013; at the end of the session.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that this is the first presentation of results. This is going to begin by Thomas Filesco who is now in charge of Investor Relations and Shareholder Relations. We sent out a note yesterday and we've all have been talking about this. And you know that we've got two departments. We've got the Shareholders Relations and the Investor Relations departments, but we've put them together. And Thomas Filesco is going to be heading up this new mega department. He has got a lot of experience and has held important executive posts in the group for the last few years and has also worked as a consultant to the administration in the past. So Thomas is going to be running the event and dealing with all the questions coming in over the webcast.</p>
          <p>So Carmen in a sense will be there in the background helping him and always available to you with all of her team doing the excellent work that they've always done, and so Carmen will continue to be working with Investor Relations. And we welcome Thomas today and wish him good luck in his new job.</p>
          <p>So I give the floor to the COO now, &#xC1;ngel Cano.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to this presentation of results for the BBVA Group, the second quarter results for the year 2010. But before talking about these group results, I think it's almost inevitable that we have to look at what's been happening in this second quarter, what we've gone through in terms of market and also talk about the presentations of results that we've had over the last few days with other banks. Recently, we've been seeing a clear impairment in the sovereign risk of several countries in the Euro area, Greece, Portugal and Spain, perhaps especially we've seen there looking at the spread against German bonds and what's been happening to the CDS'. We've seen the downgrading in the rating of some countries and some banks as well and financial entities. Some of them have had drops of more than 1.8, and that's led to much tighter wholesale markets. In short, medium and long-term markets have been closed to many financial entities and still are for many.</p>
          <p>And so, that's meant, among other things, pretty relevant reduction in revenues coming from wholesale markets for the international banks. And it's also led to an intermittently cost of deposits in the retail market because of these tightening wholesale markets and there is something else that we have also seen over the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Each of the banks that've been presenting results have been giving us NPA ratios that have been going up. However, we in the BBVA have been able to present the highest revenues we've ever had, and these record revenues, as we'll see later in the presentation, has enabled us to shore up the provisioning that we have for the group as a whole. And if we add to that the performance of NPAs with a sustained drop in the new additions as we increase our provisions, that's meant that we've been able to maintain our NPA ratios and in fact managed to bring them down, whilst others have seen their NPAs going up quite significantly.</p>
          <p>So, that's also led to the confirmation of our AA rating from Standard and Poor's. And this quarter as well, it's been very clear to everyone just how sound a bank we have when all the banks in Spain went through the stress test and we came out with flying colors despite the fact that probably our stress test in Spain was tougher than anywhere else in Europe. But now, we see that short, mid and long-term markets are open to the BBVA, recognizing the improvements that we've made in our balance sheet as we bring in more and more retail customer funds. So that's how it's looked for the group as a whole.</p>
          <p>But when we talk about each individual franchise, there too we see positive data in each of them, which really back up the overall picture. In Spain, we've seen a growth in customer funds on the balance sheet and our market share has gone up in lending as well. In our net interest income, we've continued to be one of the very few banks that has managed to maintain net interest income with positive growth, whilst other banks have had big drops in their net interest income. And we've definitely performed better in NPAs and in coverage than other banks in Europe and in Spain indeed.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we're seeing a recovery, a very gradual recovery, it's true, of business volumes in the country, and that's having an impact on banking activity as well, as BBVA gains in market share. What we are expecting on the basis of the past few quarters is gradual growth of the main items on the income statement, and you'll be seeing that this has happened in the results. And now, for the third quarter running we can see that our risk premium has improved as the NPA ratios have gone down.</p>
          <p>In South America, after several quarters, we've been seeing positive performance and quite dynamic lending and customer fund gathering with double-digit growth there. We can say that South America is continuing on the upward path that it has been in the last few quarters. In the United States, the operating income continues to improve and all the data that reflect the quality of our credit ratios have continued to improve against the last quarters.</p>
          <p>And then in Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management, what's probably most relevant is the quality of our revenues. These revenues are leveraged, as we've been telling you for some quarters now, on our customer franchise. Despite the fact that this quarter was very tough in terms of markets, the revenues for Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management have once again shown sustained excellent performance over time because of that. And Corporate &amp; Investment Banking have done especially well. So, we have a lot of good data to report in each and every one of our franchises.</p>
          <p>There are four highlights here when we are talking about the group performance. We are talking about the recovery business, minus 5 was the figure we reported in December, but since then we've been improving our performance constantly and that's had an impact on all the franchises, Spain and South America and Mexico and even the United States, because of better origination figures are seeing important gains in their loan book.</p>
          <p>In customer funds, we've been generating retail deposits in all of the group franchises of about &#x20AC;20 billion, which has made it possible to improve the structure of our balance sheet. And then in terms of the recurrency of our earnings, all the data I have been talking about so far and the boost in business volumes and very strict management of pricing has enabled us once again to show growth in our net income &#x2013; interest income against the previous quarters and against the average of 2009. We are talking about growth of 5%, as you can see here.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the last two years, which has been the time of crisis in general, we started at 5.5 billion in the first half of 2008 and two years later, we're at nearly 7 billion, in terms of the net interest income we have attained during the crisis. And we're seeing more than a 5% growth in fee income, both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, against the average last year. So, that shows that fee income is doing well, largely because it's based on services. The growth income is fee income, net interest income minus NPA, the dividends in Telef&#xF3;nica which came in this quarter, and the 15% that we bring in by the equity method. And we can see that we are growing 5.2% against the last quarter and we are 8% up on the average of last year, whilst our revenues are actually the highest that we have ever had. This is not only good in itself, but if we compare ourselves against our competition in terms of gross income over ATAs, there we are sustainably outperforming our peer group over the last three to four years.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the quality, the composition of this grows income, we see the net trading income has been pretty stable over time, which is quite different from what we see happening in our peer group where there has been a dip and ups and downs in that NPA over gross income, which means that once again we are presenting a widely diversified range of revenues in the group, which is very good for us because it means that we have much more recurrent, much more stable revenues in the group as a whole. About 46% of the revenues come from emerging countries and 54% from developed countries. If we add our performance in cost without taking into account the incorporation of guarantee last year and the divestment of office space over last year, we're growing 3.5%, which we means that quarter-on-quarter we're getting 4.2% growth and we're close to 8% growth which is above the average for 2009. And as I was saying earlier on talking about net interest income, since the crisis started we've been increasing our net operating income by 1 billion, which means that we can focus much more clearly on managing the quality of our credit assets and boosting our provisions.</p>
          <p>Four main headlines here then, we're seeing a reduction in our net additions to NPA as a result of the declining gross additions we'll see in a moment, plus improved recoveries. So our NPA ratio is improving; because of better management of our NPA ratio, we've been able to stabilize our risk premiums in the first months of the year. And as a result, we've been able to make stronger provisions.</p>
          <p>If we look at additions to our NPA, if we look at the weight in the first months of 2010 with the average of 2009, they're down 46% &#x2013; 56%. And that is because of this change in plan, which we are seeing in the first two quarters of net additions to NPA and also improved recovery of over 37%. And as a result of course, there is an obvious reduction in our NPA, 0.1%, not very significant but certainly very different to what we are seeing in the rest of the industry in the first months of the year. And as we said at the end of last year when we made that extraordinary provisioning, we said that we expect that we have seen a peak of the NPA ratio at the end of last year. Now we can confirm that in fact we have seen a change of trend and it's very homogenous in all the markets which have been hard hit by the crisis; Spain is down 0.1%; Mexico 0.3; the U.S. 0.1.</p>
          <p>As far as our risk premium, apart from the stronger provisioning because of a very evolution in our revenue, we see that our risk premium is just above 1.2% again &#x2013; which again has enabled us to provision extra 250 million in generic provisioning. And our risk premium, as we saw, for our NPA ratio is very stable in a market that had been hard hit by the crisis. Both Spain, the U.S, and Mexico are clearly ones that are down from where they were last year. So our coverage ratio is 2% higher, actually 4% if we compare it with December 2009, with the same level of provisioning, coverage and collateral that we have maintained over the last quarters.</p>
          <p>As far as the strength of our income statement, here you can see our net interest income, as I said, it's 36.5 billion. That's up over 200 million in comparison with last year. We have used the extra 207 million plus another 351 to reinforce our provisions, which are up 558 million in comparison with last year. We're still paying out the same cash dividend that we gave last year. So, we have been able to improve our core capital organically by 20 basis points in this period, offsetting the effect of the 5% acquisition of CITIC in this period. That's why our core capital, as you see, is 9.2%. Another important event this quarter &#x2013; well, actually last week, the results were published for the stress test tried out in all the European banks. I would like to underscore two things. First, that the good transparency of the Spanish test, published 100% of the data of the banks and savings banks in the financial sector, much higher than that of the other European countries which in average only published 65% of their results.</p>
          <p>As far as the strictness of that process, the financial stress tests were a lot more demanding in the macro and micro scenarios. The GDP scenario was to the decline of the economy in 2009, and further decline in 2010 and 2011, also the expected losses and the <mark type="inaudible" /> were much stricter than those &#x2013; that in the rest of Europe their collateral levels required were also much more demanding as far as land values. We were demanding 61% provisioning as far as housing under construction 50%, and even in finished housing 28% and that's referring to the last valuations available in the market. So, really talking about a very demanding scenario for provisioning in the stress test, but not just that, in terms of the forecast for pre-impairment income in Spain. In our particular case, in BBVA's case, it was 11.6% compared to the 11.6% decline in our pre-impairment income as compared to the plus 5% growth applied to the average of our competitors.</p>
          <p>And finally, equity; for equity they've applied it directly without taking into account any of the latent capital gains in our equity portfolio. So really a very demanding, a very strict stress test compared to our European peers. Our resilience in the group was amply demonstrated, and if you compare the scenarios of the Spanish stress test with those carried out in the U.S., in the past the impact on our total assets of this impairment was 4%. It was 2.9% in the U.S., certainly much higher than what we saw in the average of the EU and the U.K. And that's the result of course. We have demonstrated our ability to withstand this worst-case scenario. We're amongst the top three European banks in this resilience. And this &#x2013; we're considering that during this crisis we have not carried out any capital increase, have not required any further capital injections for our shareholders and continue to pay out cash dividend. And this is why our AA rating has been confirmed by Standards &amp; Poor's, because we are confirmed as being one of the most resilient financial institutions in Europe.</p>
          <p>Two additional comments; in the long-term market we've issued over 7.5 billion in this period and we have obtained in retail markets close to 20 billion in retail funding. And if we look at the maturities over the next three years, our long-term issues which are at around 10 billion, clearly below our competitors, that means that our liquidity position at the end of the second quarter is stronger than ever.</p>
          <p>And now as we have done in other presentations, I am going to give the floor to our CFO, so he can review the income statement of our different franchises &#x2013; businesses in the group.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, &#xC1;ngel. I am going to review the most relevant aspects, which &#xC1;ngel has listed at the beginning of his presentation in terms of our various businesses. If you look at Spain and Portugal, and considering the results reported by Spanish banks and Sweden's banks, in our case there are three aspects I would like to highlight, which I think underscore our condition with respect to the rest of the sector and which demonstrates &#x2013; which the BBVA does business in Spain but it is not like the rest of the banking sectors. There are three points that we would like to underscore. The growth of customer funds and market share gains in lending in the quarter, and that's within a system which is not growing overall, in fact it is shrinking somewhat, which is why we are seeing this increase in our market share, taking business away from our competitors because we see the current situation in the Spanish sector as a great opportunity for the BBVA. And we are delivering on those promises that we have been making for some time.</p>
          <p>The second major difference is the evolution of our net interest income, which has been performing excellently, especially if we compare it with our peers. There are huge differences. And the third element which I would like to underscore, which is pretty unique is the superior performance of our NPAs in Spain, which really makes the &#x2013; which really show the results of the efforts that we've made at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Looking now on certain aspects, mortgages, for example, our market share is up 22 basis points. But if you look from January to May, our revenues in new mortgage is 5.5% above our mortgage stock share. And if we look at June, we are actually signing 18% of all new mortgages in the country. Additionally, our share lending in the residential sector is up 25 basis points. So we are not losing market share, but quite the opposite in all sectors connected to the residential business.</p>
          <p>If we look at our customer funds on balance sheet, in the second quarter we have grown 7.9% in customer funds on the balance and we can say, the results have been published already, that our like of share in this sense is 56 basis points up and growing also with respect to the number in December, so really very good performance and very much better than our &#x2013; that of our competitors.</p>
          <p>As for net interest income, in Spain and Portugal adjusted did not include the wholesale business in Spain nor the contributions of our ALCO business in Europe, but that &#x2013; this business, our net interest income here is up, but then especially considering that our competitors have been &#x2013; have had several digit in drops in most cases when I compare with an evolution of our net interest income over average total assets of 2.27%, our COO mentioned back in December that this was going to happen and in fact we're again delivering and taking advantage of the stability, we're clearly outperforming the rest of the sector in Spain.</p>
          <p>And finally, as far as operating cost, we're clearly maintaining our operating income as a result of base check cost control, all the measures that we've been implementing, it's very long time now, so that we could remain &#x2013; our cost income ratio in the span of 36.4%, which makes us extremely competitive particularly in this context of sector restructuring. And then, another clear advantage is our NPA ratio which has been &#x2013; has gone down slightly, when for the rest of the sector NPA ratios are still rising significantly in the second quarter. And if we look at net addition dropping again in Spain for the second quarter running, so there are very clear indications that in our case we are not seeing that growth of the NPA ratios experienced by the rest of the sector in the first semester, which I think once again illustrates the effectiveness of the work that we did in December with the most vulnerable portfolios in Spain, especially our developer lending portfolio, which is why we're having this much better results now.</p>
          <p>And if we look at NPA ratios, not just in our retail business in Spain but overall for BBVA SA, so all of our businesses in Spain, and if we include all problematic assets in the wider sense &#x2013; just how we have to look at this, clearly our NPA ratio is much better than other sectors. So our results are very different from the rest of the sectors in Spain, and we have demonstrated our ability to reinforce our business, gain market share, improve our risk quality and take advantage of opportunities in this sector, which is undergoing strong restructurings, and how we're delivering on all of our forecasts quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Going into Mexico where we also have some very good news, I'll focus on three aspects. First, we're seeing a clear recovery of business in Mexico. We are seeing this month-on-month clear improvement. And we're also gaining market share with respect to our most relevant competitors. The quarterly trend clearly shows that our gross and operating income is rising, and finally also, and at the same time, quarter-on-quarter we are seeing the cost of risk, our NPAs improve as well. Looking at the business, we see that we're growing customer funds, up 5.2%, lending 4.2% already. We have been almost flat back in March and in fact, slight decrease in December in lending. And on the right-hand side you can see, we're gaining market share in Mexico in all business areas and in some of them there's been outstanding growth like in individual mortgages, taking advantage of the very difficult situation of building societies, providing individual mortgages in Mexico which in the current context are having great difficulty in obtaining finance which of course leaves very significant part of the market open for us. And as a result, our income is growing. You want to have to look at this slide, because that's our gross income, it's been growing quarter-on-quarter in constant euros. Of course, we're not looking at exchange rate effect at all. If we added the exchange rate effect, the trend would be even stronger, plus in spite of the fact that we're investing and we're spending, our net income &#x2013; our operating income is growing very significantly.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the lower items of our income statement, we're seeing a very significant improvement in loan loss provisions in Mexico, as we had announced &#x2013; our COO announced back in December that risk quality and risk premiums and NPAs in Mexico were going to be gradually improving throughout the year. And here you see it. I think this trend speaks for itself, Q4, Q1, Q2 in both aspect. So an excellent quarter in Mexico, which I think demonstrates that, and improved economic context, something that uncommon to take advantage of and gain market share and improve its revenues.</p>
          <p>And as for South America, it's very large, but let's focus on two aspects. Lending up very strongly and we are also growing our margins very steadily. If you look at lending, it's up 7% year-on-year and customer funds are up almost 9%. So you can see that business in Latin America is growing and as a result our operating income is up 7.7 &#x2013; our gross income rather is up 7.7, our operating income almost 5% up and our cost income ratio is still at 42.6% and there is room for improvement there still. And our risk indicators are extremely stable both in terms of cost of risk with improved coverage, improved NPA ratio, so there is a lot to be said about South America but to be brief, I will just focus on these aspects.</p>
          <p>Growth in the business &#x2013; margin is growing steadily and here you see our income statement. Just to mention one, our pension business. We had an excellent year last year, nevertheless this year it's growing further 16%. We don't often talk about this business, but yeah, it is generating excellent income. As for the U.S., I would like to go into a bit more detail here, because in the U.S. we are also seeing significant improvement we have in other business units. With our operating income up significantly, business is growing, revenue is growing and our NPA is also improving, for the first time in a while.</p>
          <p>And here you see some of these positive trends in loan origination, and see the bank's business overall in the U.S. And here we are reporting not just contact and guarantee but also Puerto Rico and our wholesale branch in New York. So, we are still seeing growth in lending affected by the drop in corporate lending and wholesale lending, down at least 0.3, but in terms of the really significant aspect for our business and the revenue that we are generating, the growth in comparison with the second semester of 2009 has been very significant; 6.9% up the commercial, 12.4% consumer lending and 11.3% in residential real estate individual mortgages. So, we see very positive trends, and if you look at it month-on-month it's even more apparent. And as a result &#x2013; and in terms of net interest income it's up 9.6%, gross income up 7.3%, operating income up 4.2% and we continue to improve our cost income ratio, which we will compare with our competitors in a moment. And risk indicators are stable. Our risk premium was slightly higher than in Q1, but it's still gradually settling down as we predicted. Our NPA ratio is stable, down a little in fact and our coverage improving.</p>
          <p>And now for a second, let's look at our performance and compare it with our campus peer group in the States, which you can see in this over here &#x2013; here you can see that in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, the bank has been growing whilst our peers are shirking in both deposits and in lending, although they are doing better in deposits, and our net interest income like-for-like with our peers is outgrowing that of our peers and our cost income ratio is well below the levels achieved by our competitors. We've done all of this without having yet completed the rollout of the new platform in the U.S., which is where we really begin to make substantial gains in efficiency and cross-selling. So, we've done all of that with significant improvements in all the indicators like cross-selling and productivity, especially in the repo channel where with the ratio of 2.5 products per customers and now we've reached 4.5 for new customers, and our stock has gone from 1.2 to 1.8. So, that as I said, has been done without rolling out the new platform that we have in the pipeline.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management now. As the COO said before, this quarter has not been easy for the wholesale banks, as we've seen, as others have reported significant drops in the second quarter against the first. But unlike other wholesale banks, the kind of business that we have has meant that we've suffered less and we've done very well in Corporate &amp; Investment Banking above all, which means that we can report some fantastic results here. In Corporate &amp; Investment Banking then, our net interest income with a drop in lending has grown at 16.4 and our fee income at 22.6 and our operating income at 22%. So, that kind of growth is quite extraordinary really. Risk quality as well is very good. And then in Global Markets, you can see that we are showing more recurrent revenues and therefore are more resilient than other banks, okay. We have lower volumes, but we are more resilient and our customer revenues have gone up 7% year-on-year in Global Markets.</p>
          <p>Very important now is to look at Asia. Asia is beginning to generate earnings, not just because of its contribution to CITIC, which has generated a gross margin of more than 25% of our revenues coming from Asia through our own network with the organic growth of our wholesale business in Asia. Asia now represents 18% of the earnings in the area. And if we look at it, we can see that most of the revenues do filter down to the bottom line and if we look at the kind bottom line we've got there and we can compare that with out investment in China, you can see that we really are getting a return on investment.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the consumption of capital as well, we are doing very well and we can say that in three years we have now got to a stage where we're no longer seeing any dilution in the ROE for the group as a whole. As more joint ventures come online as well, we will see more dynamic growth in this region of the world.</p>
          <p>So, that was really what I wanted to say about the different business units. And now, I'll give the floor again to the COO.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we open the floor or the microphone to questions coming over the webcast, I wanted to give you a quick summary of the quarterly results but in terms of earnings, the highest revenues ever in the group. We've been able to strengthen our provisioning, especially in generic provisioning, and that added to the quality of our assets, both because of bringing down the NPA ratio whilst increasing coverage, means that we've got a consistent reduction of net additions and higher recovery over the last few months. Our level of solvency with generic capital generation and the positive performance of liquidity and the results of the stress test all show that we have reasons to get that Standard &amp; Poor's rating confirmed. And the balance sheet of the group looks very strong, which means that really the results of the quarter as we see them are clearly excellent and really there is nothing to overshadow them at all.</p>
          <p>And what are we expecting now in the group over the next half-year? Looking at Spain and Portugal, here we are expecting to see growth in market share, in lending and customer funds. As we consistently improve our business volumes, leveraging our plan one, our strategy plan for the Spain and Portugal franchise, which is based on a customer-oriented business model, which has helped us so far to boost our market share in lending and customers funds. Our NPA ratio will continue to be much better than those of our peers, we are sure of that, which means that our cost of risk will be stable. And then we're expecting to show superior performance in cost as well.</p>
          <p>Looking Mexico, business volumes will continue to improve in both lending and customer funds, which has an impact on the balance sheet there. And as Manolo said, we can expect to continue to see quarter-on-quarter growth over the next few quarters. And once again, we can take advantage of the improvement in the use of banking services that we're seeing in Mexico after it went through the crisis in 2009.</p>
          <p>In South America, very much the same, the recovery of business volumes with growth over the next few quarters as our cost of risk continues to remain stable and quite low in the USA. Manolo has already talked about the platform. We're going to continue to work on rolling it out, so that we have the same platform that we've got in Spain, which will mean that we will be able to roll out our customer-oriented business model faster and more efficiently, which will mean quarter-on-quarter growth in all operating margins.</p>
          <p>And then in Wholesale Banking &amp; Asset Management, there we're expecting to see greater volatility on the market as a whole, but of course the franchise that we have that's so customer-oriented, we expect to outperform our peers even more than we did in the second quarter. And again, because we are leveraging this customer franchise, we've got much more relation banking model, which should help us in that area as well.</p>
          <p>So Thomas, if you'd like to come up here, perhaps we can now deal with the questions. So, if you want to handover the first questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've been trying to group together the questions in net interest income. David Vaamonde from Fidentiis; Tom Rayner from Barclays; Britta Schmidt from Autonomous; Antonio Ramirez from Keefe; asked more or less the same question. How have you managed to maintain such strong net interest income performance in Spain despite the drop in customers? That's the first question. The second; what about your outlook portfolio? Does that have an impact on your net interest income? And those are really the two main questions that come up from all the different people that I mentioned there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our net interest income in Spain, first of all, we were already expecting this trend. We saw it from the beginning of the year, so it's no surprise to us. Our prices and our financial costs are the lowest in the industry as a whole. The growth in business volumes in both and lending and customer funds and also the pricing management that we have that's very strict means that we've managed to improve our performance in net interest income consistently. And then, as to our ALCO portfolio, the impact on the net interest income this quarter is similar what we had in the first quarter of the year and it's showing the same trend that we were expecting to get for the year as a whole as we've said last quarter, which would be very similar to 2009. Manolo, do you want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just that the contribution of the assets and liability in corporate portfolio are about the same &#x2013; that's all over the world, and in Spain and Portugal we're only booking the margins it's obtaining from its business in the float of new business and the stocks &#x2013; because of the repricing of stocks that we're seeing Spain which is quite important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of asset quality, once again, Tom Rayner, Britta and <mark type="inaudible" /> asked several questions. Non-performing assets, are you expecting interest rate stable in Spain for the rest of the year? Are you expecting any write-offs in the future? And there are also questions about the impact from the new Bank of Spain circular, which is expected to come out soon. And then there is another question about the drivers for recovery of non-performing assets here in Spain. What are the main drivers that you've used in modeling the estimates for NPA recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you deal with the second and I'll deal with the first, and you take the last one, okay. Non-performing loans then. For the rest of the year, well, when we started the year we began with all the extraordinary provisioning we had from last year of the &#x20AC;1.8 billion that we had set aside especially, and we were saying &#x2013; well, we're just trying to anticipate the worst case scenario that we expect for the next few quarters, anticipating the very worst possible drop in these assets and we wanted to peak in NPA before anyone else in the sector, so that we wouldn't permanently have to have an eye on what was happening there.</p>
          <p>So what's been happening over the first two quarters? I think the market has confirmed that the worst in &#x2013; of the assets on our balance sheet were already reclassified in December. And last quarter, I already told you this, but if we hadn't anticipated this problem with the reclassification of doubtful loans in December last year, how many assets would have been reclassified as doubtful into the first half of the year. Of those 1.8 billion, 495 million would have been classified as non-performing in the first half.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean to say that the other 1.3 would never have become non-performing, it's just that there was a gradual process underway. And so, we're just confirming what we were expecting to happen by looking at the kind of growth rates we're seeing in the NPAs of our competitors, whilst we have shown much more stable ratios to the market and with the good performance of recoveries and therefore the net additions we get month-by-month, we've had this slight drop, even towards the end of the half year.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Bank of Spain circular, on the basis of the information we have and the calculations, we expect the impact to be pretty moderate according to our estimates, so it shouldn't be significant. And then the drivers, Manolo, do you want to talk about the drivers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the recovery of NPAs in Spain, I think that's what the question was about, in the second quarter we've seen recoveries of 2.8 billion, which is slightly below what we got in the first quarter because of the dates of Easter week which fell in the second quarter, and 88% of the recoveries have been in cash, and that's very important. It's higher even than the figures that we've been reporting before, whilst 12% came in repossessions. So, 15% has come from repossessions in the first quarter and 12 in the second.</p>
          <p>As to whether we are expecting any write-offs in the future, looking at the kind of asset quality we have, we can say we're not expecting any. We think that we've got good asset quality. So, we don't need write-offs in the future. Maybe I could just add another comment with respect to the quality of our results. At the end of last year, which has had an impact on the beginning of this year, we brought in the recovery team we have in Spain to work together in the retail and in the SME business. And so, they are all aiming for the same target. So, they've been able to exclusively focus on recoveries in all of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as funding, David Fernandez is asking whether we think that we might issue bonds right now below the prices that were obtained a few weeks ago, so how do we expect wholesale funding market to evolve, for European banks in general and for Spanish banks in particular?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Manolo, I'll leave that question for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's quite easy to answer that question. If you look at the trends in the markets and loans spreads and sovereign risk and so on in Spain in comparison with two weeks ago, obviously the situation is improving, improving greatly. And in fact, we are able to issue at all times, in fact we've been the only Spanish bank that has recently placed a relevant issue that was significant, over 3 billion. And the depth of the orders and of the investors who were on the book was really very significant. So, the BBVA now has full access to every wholesale market plus of course also we're growing very significantly in our resale funding structure as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking about Mexico as a business unit, Jaime Becerril from Redburn is asking, I would like to hear about the cost of funding in Mexico in the quarter and how that has evolved. Other questions about Mexico, Juan Carlos Lopez Scovo is asking, what do we expect to see in net interest income towards the end of the year and what opportunities will there be? This is the question from Carlos Aquil from Pichaud of listing BBVA Bancomer in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start at the end and then Manolo can answer the first part of that question. Listing, well, clearly right now we don't see what we think that listing the BBVA in the Mexican market would mean diluting the value for our current BBVA shareholders and they would not be able to benefit from the growth we're going to see in the next quarters, which is going to be one of our major strengths. As I said in my presentation, we will be seeing growth over the coming quarters, but also over the coming years in Mexico's contribution to the group and we would not like to deprive our shareholders of the benefit that that's going to generate. So we really have no plans right now to have IPO for Bancomer in Mexico.</p>
          <p>As for net interest income, as we said during the first quarter, we expect to see growth throughout the rest of the year. Remember the trend in 2009 and the beginning of 2010. 2009 went from better to worse and 2010 is going from worse to better, which means that quarter-on-quarter we will see growing impact on our different income streams, particularly on net interest income. By the end of the year, we expect to see similar level to 2009 in terms of net interest income.</p>
          <p>And as for the rest of the questions, some interesting points about the quarter in Mexico. In the second full quarter 2010, our customer spread in Mexico went up 31 basis points and that was a significant turning point because we had seen until now a shrinking of our credit &#x2013; of our card market, which was being replaced by other businesses like mortgagees and consumer lending, which have a lower margin. Also the reference rates in Mexico have remained constant. In the quarter, they haven't really changed, 4.94 in Q2, it was 4.92 on average in Q1.</p>
          <p>And so the customer spreads in lending have been responsible for our net interest income improvement in the quarter, since customer spread in terms of funding has not changed in the quarter. Having said that, our margins in this period with rates lowered 4.9, which are very low for what was usually the case in Mexico, spreads on average now for our whole customer fund structure are about 3.04 in Q1 and 3.05 in Q2. So again, these are spreads over a 4.94% rate. There you can see more or less the costs that we have customer funds in Mexico and how unlike other businesses we own in Latin America, our income statement for Bancomer in Mexico is generating a lot of income through customer funds and not just through lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then for dividend, Daragh Quinn from Nomura and Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch are asking about when we might be carrying out a 40% payout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We said in the last quarter and at the end of last year that payout overall was at the lowest level we'd ever see for payout in the group. The first quarter, the interim dividend we paid out recently is the same as last year's. For now, that's the decision that has to made by the Board and we basically do not expect to see any changes in payout in the coming quarters, and we have until the end of the year, particularly in the AGM, when they decide on the complementary dividend to decide on this point. We need to have more information about how markets and profits will evolve and how market was stabilized overall before we raise that payout level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just add to that. You have to remember that our 30% payout is dividend in cash, and we're talking about payout with cash dividend because it's not the same to talk about total dividend to what the COO just said, is cash dividend yield, that our shares are offering &#x2013; or providing right now, which is extremely attractive in comparison with other European banks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Continuing with the quality of the assets, Alejandro from Barclays is asking whether the recoveries of NPAs have dropped in the quarter, and is this what we are to expect for the next quarters as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I think you have the figures somewhere there, Manolo. But in the meantime, I'll just say that there are two aspects to our recovery volume. As Manolo said, you have the additions in the quarter of the repossessions in the quarter, higher in Q2 than Q1. Overall, it was 700 million but Q1 was clearly higher than Q2 and that's why recoveries are higher in Q1 than Q2, because of the number of repossessions. It's 444 in Q1 and 239 in Q2. Without that, cash recoveries, as Manolo explained earlier, which represent about 80% of all recoveries in the period, would be at a very similar level or in fact higher in Q2 than in Q1. But it's because of the evolution of repossessions of non-performing loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arturo de frias [Evolution Securities], referring to our net interest income, says that your dividend income in the corporate center was not &#x2013; was weak, which is not entirely unexpected, given the tensions of the financial markets. But what expectations do you have for net interest income in the corporate headquarters in the coming months? Is it falling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at our net interest income for our corporate activities or businesses in this semester, clearly below that of the first semester last year. And that's because of the very positive impact we had in the first semester of last year because of the mortgage re-pricing with respect to lending costs and how that effect is now exhausted. We spoke about trends in net interest income on our balance sheet overall in the years, and we explained that in 2009 our net interest income was greatly enhanced by a one-off really, which is how long your mortgage portfolio takes to re-price the new rates versus dropping rates on your lending cost.</p>
          <p>But that effect is now over and so we are absorbing that effect, but if you look quarter-on-quarter, our net interest income is reasonably stable and basically what we have here &#x2013; the basic element we have here is our net interest income brought in by our asset and liability management portfolios and &#x2013; versus the cost of financing the group's strategic investment and all the other bank portfolios. And since the contribution of net interest income from asset and liability management is quite stable or in fact down slightly but only very slightly in the quarter, these are the effects you have to keep in mind when looking at that income coming from corporate activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as lending quality, Carlo Di Grandi from HSBC is asking which elements make you predict a better evolution of non-performing assets for BBVA than from its peers, better than we have now and in comparison with your peers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, today we have in general in all our franchises outperformed our competitors in absolute terms and as a trend, and our competitors. If we look at all our franchises and therefore at the group level, exact same thing, better results than our peers in NPAs as a whole. And that's thanks, amongst other things, to the write-offs we made in Spain and in the U.S. of those doubtful assets that we thought were of worst quality and would eventually become impaired.</p>
          <p>As for the evolution in the coming quarters, we expect to continue to stand out from our competitors over the next quarters, since we have a very strong level of recoveries in all our franchises. I spoke earlier about Spain, but in general we're seeing the same kind of success and recoveries in the U.S. and in South America and Mexico. And so we will continue to see this difference grow in the coming quarters. The thing is that we anticipated all the write-offs with our worst-case scenario analysis of our asset base. We also have very strong recovery teams, which are fully very &#x2013; fully integrated in all our franchises. And thirdly, and very relevantly, the kind of collateral underlying those assets &#x2013; those doubtful assets make recovery much easier than if we didn't have that collateral.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just add, and it's connected to what &#xC1;ngel was just saying about collateral, I'd like to add something about the structure and the quality of our portfolio, the developer business in Spain, we said this before, but I think now as the of the stress test have been published and all the information that we've been disclosing, you can see very clearly that our position is very different compared &#x2013; in terms of the quality of our portfolio, because the level of developer land credit in our portfolio is only 8% and only 29% of that is land exposures. So really, the quality of our portfolio is quite a lot better than that of our peers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as for funding, Claire Kane from Global is asking, what percentage of our deposit balance sheet &#x2013; what percentage deposits in our consolidated balance sheet, and specifically for Spain, is there a loan to deposit target in the Spain and Portugal balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am just finding the exact figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the mean time, Daragh Quinn is asking about the strength of our capital ratios and is asking whether we expect to continue to generate between 15 and 20 basis points of core capital organically every quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will answer this second question. We have been reporting between 15 and 20 basis points. I don't know whether it will be 15 or 20, but even with 15 we feel very comfortable in the next quarters in terms of organic core capital growth. For some quarters it could be 20 basis points, but 15 and given the growth in business we are experiencing, it could well be the average for the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>And as for your question about funding, the ratio of deposits to total assets with end-of-quarter numbers is 45.3, which I think is the highest percentage amongst all European peers. Additionally, and as far as targets for our domestic business, Spain, those ratios, we think that it's a very good ratio considering the kind of business we are doing there. It's retail business, it's completely covered, even surplus deposits and off-balance sheet assets. And in money market funds, that's a very close substitute to deposits. And it's a business which also includes some institutions and corporates, whereas the medium and long-term mortgage business, which is funded with maturities that are very similar to those funded with deposits. So it's a funding and maturity and liquidity structure that we think makes complete sense so that our portfolio funding, medium and long-term, will not be based on very short-term or short maturity structures. So, we think that this ratio for our kind of business is really perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then about regulation, we've got another couple of questions. Luis Pe&#xF1;a from JB Capital wants to know what we think about the potential impact of the Basel III. I agree, this could be &#x2013; they were approved on Monday. Are they going to have an impact on the group? And from Bacchus, we have a question about the calculation of the effect of the new circular in Mexico, with respect to the reduction of fee income. This is a circular that was published quite recently there. Would it have an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Manolo, do you want to talk about these regulatory issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So talking about Mexico and the fee income regulation there, no. Yes, Basel III, what came out yesterday, we interpret it to mean that the sector has had to recognize what's happened because of the looser capital requirements. But now the execution periods have changed as well, and in most cases they are now pushed forward to 2018. So, the sensitivity of the regulators to what's going on in this sector is clear, realizing the harsher regulations in this kind of environments could lead to deflation in the economy.</p>
          <p>And so for the financial sector as a whole, especially in Europe and if we look at the growth forecasts in Europe, what happened on Monday or what was published on Monday was very positive and I think the market has reacted as we would expect. Having said that, we also get benefits with these new standards. One of the biggest impacts would have been the treatment of investment in financial entitites of more than 10% with a capital consumption of one-to-one. Obviously, this is now not nearly so tough and given the way that we are currently treating this, deducting goodwill from these investments from core capital, we think that we are not going to have any impact from the new standards on our capital ratios &#x2013; our core capital ratios.</p>
          <p>And we also think we're helped because of the changes in the regulatory liquidity ratios recognizing &#x2013; and this is something that we've been demanding for some time now, recognizing the different way that we treat deposits so they're more stable, and other assets are treated in a different way, because we're a retail bank and that's different from non-retail banks. So with the definition of retail &#x2013; of ratios, especially the one-year retail ratios, we are benefiting from that as an international retail bank, and that's quite important because of the kind of volumes we're talking about.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the circular we're talking about on fee incomes in Mexico, that circular is &#x2013; it's difficult to know exactly what it will mean, but we don't think it will be especially relevant for our franchise in Mexico. We're talking about something that might be between 700, 800 million pesos. So it will be quite low, especially when it's then put into euros. But we've only got preliminary estimates, and we think that at the end of the day, really it probably won't even reach that kind of level. But it could be 700, 800 million pesos' impact in a full-12 month year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let's go to the last question then, because I think you've answered all the others and some of them, as the CFO said at the beginning of the presentation, have to do with details and there I think it's best for our Investor Relations department to get in contact with you directly. So the last question comes from Matteo Ramenghi from UBS, who asks about funding, saying that there's been a significant increase in deposits in Spain. And he thinks that this could be due to the fact that there's been a shift from investment funds to deposits here. What kind of guidance could you give on the impact that this could have on the income statement for the future, if there were that shift and if that shift continued?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we haven't really seen this shift from funds to deposits, or at least it's not a relevant shift. Earlier, when I was saying that the gain in market share in both lending and deposits has to do with the plan we put out a few months ago, the plan Uno, we've announced it to the media two or three months ago. And it's made it possible for us to manage customers with an integrated vision of everything they're doing, which means that our prices are very customer oriented and quite different depending on how many products they have with us, how much cross-selling we do, and what kind of share of wallet we have. So, prices can vary from one customer to the next now, and that is the advantage of having this integral vision.</p>
          <p>And then on page 18 of the documents that you've had &#x2013; maybe you haven't had time to see it, but this will give you greater peace of mind, you can see resident customer deposits and then in other resident, that's private sector customers without public administration, there too we are also growing in deposits. And you'll also see that we've grown 3 billion in current accounts, 7 billion in term accounts, so that's growth in the quarter. So these figures speak for themselves, I think.</p>
          <p>And you can also see that investment funds we've gone down 2 billion, of which this shift that you are talking about from funds to deposits has been less than 1.4 billion. Consequently, I could say that raising deposits in the private sector here in Spain hasn't reflected any shift from funds, rather a natural trend that's going on. And yes, there has been some move away from funds and we have taken that up in our customer deposits, but that's a minimum part of the growth we've seen in customer funds, which has been based on genuine customer funds in current and term accounts. I think the main thing here is our focus on customers.</p>
          <p>Although it's early to speak about the impact of this plan in Spain and Portugal in the second quarter, in the quarter, we could say we've had this Plan Uno, this Plan One. More than 40,000 customers have increased their share of wallet or have become what we call multi-product customers. And that's a pretty high figure. The drivers behind this market share gain in customers and in deposits are those that you can see in the financial statements for this quarter. There are three of them; mortgages with our market share that Manolo was talking about before of over 20 basis points; and then transactional banking that has to do with very liquid accounts, especially payroll accounts, with a lot of new payroll accounts coming in; and then deposit management, working with our customers so that we can have more sustained business volumes with them over time. So we are bringing in a lot of business, we're bringing in customer market for share of wallet, which means we can consolidate the market share gains that we've had over the next couple of quarters here in Spain.</p>
