      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica's 2011 third quarter results conference call.</p>
          <p>It is my pleasure to share this call as new Chief Financial and Corporate Development Officer. Today, I have with me, Julio Linares, Chief Operating Officer; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of the new Telef&#xF3;nica Europe; and Santiago Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America.</p>
          <p>Also with me are the heads of the new global units, Telef&#xF3;nica Digital and Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources led by Matthew Key and Guillermo Ansaldo, respectively. Miguel Escrig, our CFO is also attending this call. During the Q&amp;A session you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>The results released today show that our diversification and scale enable us to deliver strong revenue growth and solid profitability, despite ongoing economic pressure and severe regulation in some of our markets. We are particularly pleased with a very strong commercial activity recorded in the last quarter leading our customer base to reach the 300 million mark.</p>
          <p>Revenue till September was up 5.4% year-on-year on the back of outstanding performance of Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America and sustained growth in mobile data. Despite increased commercial investment in contract and mobile broadband, our underlying OIBDA margin was 36%, with limited erosion year-on-year as guided at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>By regions, Latin America is already the largest contributor to key financial metrics and quite soon will represent 50% of our results driving Telef&#xF3;nica's growth.</p>
          <p>Within Europe, stabilization of underlying trends in Spain needs to be highlighted. While the very good performance in Germany offsets the slowdown in other European countries.</p>
          <p>I would also like to highlight the new organization announced in September, which will allow us to bolster growth and to further improve efficiency.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me stress that we fully confirm our goals for 2011 and our shareholder remuneration commitments.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to slide number four. Both Q3 2011 and Q3 2010 are quarters impacted by very large extraordinary items that materially affect reported results. Therefore in order to facilitate year-on-year comparisons, we are showing a P&amp;L in underlying terms. That is, adjusting the distortions derived from such exceptional items, investments in Spectrum and non-cash impact from PPAs.</p>
          <p>In these underlying figures, we are not adjusting the impact from changes in our consolidation perimeter nor effects. In these terms, revenue rose sharply at 6.8% if we exclude MTR cuts ahead of peers.</p>
          <p>OIBDA exceeded &#x20AC;16.7 billion, flat year-on-year as we decided to ramp up commercial activity to foster future revenue growth. Excluding regulation impact, OIBDA would have grown 1% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Net income was over &#x20AC;5.4 billion, down 10.6% year-on-year due to the increase in depreciation and amortization and financial expenses. And as a proxy to cash flow generation, operating cash flow pre-Spectrum topped &#x20AC;11.2 billion and Spectrum outlays were less than half compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number five, our diversified portfolio allowed us to deliver solid profitability and healthy cash flow generation. Revenue growth was driven by our Latin America business, which already account for around 45% of consolidated figures in underlying terms from revenue to operating cash flow. It is important to highlight our lower dependence of Spain, which now is just 28% of our sales some 55% of our OIBDA.</p>
          <p>And by services, we made further progress in enhancing our revenue mix, with broadband and services beyond connectivity, already representing over 26% of revenues on the back of their double digit year-on-year growth.</p>
          <p>In organic terms, as slide number six shows, revenue grew 0.3% up to September or 1.6% excluding regulation impact. OIBDA declined 4.6%, while operating cash flow dropped 8.6% year-on-year as we increased CapEx in fixed broadband and mobile broadband. These organic results put us on track to fulfill our 2011 guidance.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number seven, I would like to highlight that net financial debt has decreased about &#x20AC;1 billion in the quarter, falling slightly below last year end level. Over &#x20AC;2.5 billion of free cash flow has been generated in the quarter and free cash flow generated in the nine months through September was &#x20AC;5.7 billion, up 11.6% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight that up to September, cash repatriation from Latin America has reached to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. So net financial debt stood at 2.49 times rolling OIBDA at the end of the quarter and at 2.55 times, when it's including commitments, slightly lower than previous quarter after recent repayments.</p>
          <p>Effective interest cost of our debt stood at 4.58% excluding FX results. This is 24 basis points lower than in the first nine months of 2010 on a comparable basis, is only 37 basis points higher than in the first half in spite of current unfavorable debt market conditions, and is well below our guidance.</p>
          <p>Next slide, number eight, shows the limited impact from currency fluctuations year-to-date benefiting from Telef&#xF3;nica's active FX management policy and adequate diversification.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flow has been adversely impacted from FX movements by just &#x20AC;34 million in the first nine months with appreciating currencies offsetting losses from those divisions depreciating.</p>
          <p>On top of that, such movement is compensated by reduction in debt not dominated in euros. In order to protect our solvency, we proactively manage the currency mix of our debt to reduce the FX sensitivity of our leverage ratio.</p>
          <p>In this sense, as of September, our debt in non-euro dominated European currencies approached two times OIBDA in those same currencies. And the rate in Latam currencies, ex-Venezuela was slightly above two times operating cash flow generated in the region.</p>
          <p>In slide number nine, let me highlight that we have a solid liquidity position that withdraws any pressure for refinancing of 2012 maturities. We can comfortably manage long-term debt maturing next year that amounts to &#x20AC;7.1 billion. At first, we have an extension option on 2 billion preferred shares maturing 31 of December. Second, the biggest maturity, a syndicated loan tranche for &#x20AC;2.4 billion based also in December, so with more than one year to address its refinancing. Third, &#x20AC;1.8 billion equivalent debt matures in Latam where local funding markets are not under stress. Fourth, &#x20AC;6.4 billion credit lines maturing beyond 2012 more than cover the sum of banking and Latam debt maturities of the year. And fifth, only &#x20AC;1 billion Telef&#xF3;nica <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:26) matures in the first 11 months of next year and that has been already covered by the &#x20AC;1 billion bond issued in October.</p>
          <p>We also enjoy a &#x20AC;4.1 billion cash position excluding the cash of Venezuela and it is also worth mentioning that we have been reinforcing our liquidity position by increasing our undrawn committed credit lines by &#x20AC;1.3 billion in the quarter, most of them long term to a total of &#x20AC;9.2 billion. In any case, we will continue with a prudent early access to various markets as we have done during the year where we have raised close to &#x20AC;11 billion so far.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our operating results starting on slide number 10, where I would like to stress the very strong commercial volumes recorded in the third quarter. Our strategy targeted at increasing the value of our customer base translates into two key data points. Contract mobile customers accounted for roughly 50% of mobile net adds in the first nine months of the year and mobile broadband penetration has already reached 15%. Figures for our European operations exceed by far the average for Telef&#xF3;nica while the lower data penetration in Latam is a huge upside opportunity for us. Especially worth mentioning is the rapid expansion of the mobile broadband base up 76% year-on-year being a key growth leader for the future of Telef&#xF3;nica Digital.</p>
          <p>Moving to page number 11; mass marketing of smartphones, which capitalizes from the larger availability of handsets with competitive prices and on tier pricing in all of our markets, is bearing fruits, as showed by the sustained ramp up in mobile data revenue, which posted an outstanding 20% year-on-year organic growth. Mobile data revenue already accounts for 30% of mobile service revenue with rates reaching 25% in Spain and Latam and over 40% in Europe.</p>
          <p>Particularly strong is the booming growth of non-peer-to-peer SMS revenue, which stands now at 52% of total data revenue and limits the cannibalization risk from new applications. We so far continue to have a negligible impact in our geographies. Actually, the peer-to-peer SMS revenues continued to increase over 4% year-on-year up to September. It is also worth highlighting that Latin America is delivering a sharp 32% growth in mobile data sales despite low mobile broadband penetration.</p>
          <p>Let me now walk you through the performance by regions starting with Latin America in slide number 12. The most relevant feature of Q3 in the region is the very strong commercial momentum with total net adds beating previous historical records, increased volume across all businesses and even higher activity than in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Total net adds rose by 60% versus the third quarter of 2010, while the growth was over 10% quarter-on-quarter. But it's not only the absolute number what makes the quarter exceptional, but the good quality of the customer base expansion with focus on the higher value segments.</p>
          <p>In the mobile business, in Q3 mobile broadband gross adds almost tripled 2010 figure and contract gross adds were 25% higher, while in the wireline business we continued delivering double-digit growth in fixed broadband with a significant ramp up in Pay TV net adds and a successful protection of our traditional lines. All these led to sustained acceleration in total customers' growth, setting the basis for enhanced top line growth in the coming future.</p>
          <p>Slide number 13 sums up the financial results in Latin America. Reported revenue growth was over 18% up to September on the back of the excellent top line performance posted by Brazil, which already accounts for 50% of our results in the region. Excluding Mexico, revenue would have risen a sharp 21% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Underlying year-on-year growth in OIBDA was 11%, again driven by the increased contribution from Brazil leading to a solid 36.1% OIBDA margin in the first nine months of the year. In organic terms, revenue growth was close to 5% driven by the very strong performance of data and broadband across businesses, which already account for roughly 25% of fixed and mobile revenues with outstanding and sustained acceleration in mobile sales. OIBDA declined 0.9% year-on-year in organic terms with a sharp increase in commercial activity dragging 4.4 percentage points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>On top of that, annual comparisons were impacted by the lower contribution of regional projects and non-strategic tower disposals and by insurance compensations related with the earthquake in Chile a year ago, which altogether dragged 2.6 percentage points in OIBDA growth year-on-year. Finally, the weak performance of the Mexican business also drove OIBDA down. Stripping out these effects, OIBDA growth would have been very strong.</p>
          <p>Moving into our Brazilian operations, we are very pleased to note that one year after taking full control of Vivo, we are now even stronger and we continue to widen our leadership in Brazil. In Q3, we posted record commercial volumes with mobile net adds up over 70% year-on-year and 50% quarter-on-quarter. More importantly, we continue to gain market share in the high-value segments with close to 37% share in the contract segment and 43% share in the mobile data space.</p>
          <p>Improving volumes and quality at the same time would not be possible without our differential asset base particularly in 3G coverage where we are well ahead of our competitors. It is also worth highlighting the launch of new products like push-to-talk, which has gained a lot of traction in just few months and the projected launch of fixed wireless services in 31 cities outside S&#xE3;o Paulo along the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>On the financial side, revenue and OIBDA performance was stellar in spite of increased commercial costs. Total revenue rose 5.4% up to September with especially remarkable performance of mobile service revenue which continue to ramp up quarter-on-quarter driven by booming data revenues. On top of that, fixed broadband and pay TV revenues posted a very strong annual growth already accounting for 20% of total revenues. OIBDA growth stood at 7.8% with margin expanding year-on-year to 36.3% despite increased commercial investment as we are leveraging integration synergies.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Brazilian integration on slide number 15 and after finalizing the corporate restructure in early October, I'm pleased to announce the increase of the original guidance provided a year ago for the expected synergies. After increasing in July, our target for operating synergies, we are now upgrading the net present value of expected tax and financial synergies to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. So all in all, we expect now to reach synergies with an NPV between &#x20AC;4.4 billion and &#x20AC;4.8 billion well over 50% of the total value of the deal and ahead of our initial forecasts.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to slide 16 and quickly review the performance of our operations in the Southern and Northern regions in Latin America. In the South, commercial activity, in the third quarter was strong across our footprint with strong revenue growth in Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Colombia and sustained acceleration in mobile service revenue across markets.</p>
          <p>In the North, our operations in Venezuela posted solid revenue and strong margins, while Mexico performance continues to be weak. We are already adapting our commercial proposition in Mexico to the drastic cuts in MTRs, having launch new tariff schemes that should contribute to accelerate the capture of mobile market share as well as to accelerate the cannibalization of fixed traffic in the coming future.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Europe, I'll start with Spain on slide number 17. During the third quarter, we launched new commercial offers across businesses to enhance our competitive position which are already delivering positive results. The new integrated fixed broadband offer introduced in September have clearly set an inflection point in net additions while the new mobile offer launched in July has led to lower churn levels.</p>
          <p>Regarding financials, I'd like to stress the stabilization in comparable trends. As revenue recorded the same decline as in Q2, 6.6% while OIBDA deterioration was contained quarter-on-quarter delivering a marginally improved OIBDA margin. Please bear in mind that 2011 results still do not reflect the benefits of the new social agreement signed in Q2 which should lead to additional cost savings. Therefore, the healthy OIBDA margin reported is also a reflection of our rational approach to commercial expenses and particularly subsidies in a context where some of our customers are just focused on volume and are heavily deteriorating their margins. Our strategy has allowed us to continue reporting revenue, OIBDA and operating cash flow shares well above accesses market share.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 18 to cover our Spanish fixed business. In the broadband market, the new commercial offered launched in September has led to a significant ramp-up in gross adds. Therefore we expect our fixed broadband access base to record a better performance in coming quarters. In pay TV, our enhanced content proposition, including all the football league, is also being reflected in our strong net add figures. So we are seeing improved commercial trends which are compatible with a better performance of our connectivity ARPU which remains stable quarter-on-quarter. Again, our new offers are very attractive for our customers but are not value disruptive for us.</p>
          <p>In terms of revenues, Q3 year-on-year performance continues to be driven by similar factors to those we have seen in recent quarters, though we recorded a slight sequential improvement on the back of the better broadband business I already mentioned and improved trends in traditional revenues.</p>
          <p>Regarding our mobile business in Spain and despite the adverse economic conditions, I'd like to highlight a very strong growth delivered the mobile data. Mobile growth on accesses rose close to 50% year-on-year up to September while data ARPU recorded a solid improvement driven by the strong performance of connectivity services, which already represents 75% of our data revenues in Spain.</p>
          <p>The good data performance is also helping to manage ARPU in the contract segment, which already accounts for 69% of our customers delivering stable ARPUs quarter-on-quarter. Our focus on this segment is driven by our policy to maximize the value of our customer base with significantly higher relative ARPUs, and lower churn versus prepaid, and churn should improve as the new tariff launched led to a 30% growth in churn for those customers who applied for the new rate.</p>
          <p>Finally, a very strong performance in data should be further empowered by the new data centric offer recently launched. We are bundling voice, SMS and data being the first in the market to launch bundles with unlimited SMSs and offering lower prices for those customers who have fixed broadband with us, therefore boosting cross-selling opportunities.</p>
          <p>In the U.K; in the third quarter, we regained commercial momentum in a challenging environment with no signs of competition relief. Contract mobile net adds increased over three-fold quarter-on-quarter following the launch of the new smartphone tariff structure at the end of August, while we get churn low at 1.1%.</p>
          <p>Smartphone adoption continued growing, reflecting the good acceptance of our renewed tariff portfolio, reaching a 36% penetration in September. It is remarkable that 60% of the customer segment has already contracted one of our three bolt-on tiered pricing choices, the majority of them on the &#xA3;6 to &#xA3;10 price range. This is central to data revenue growth acceleration to close to 10% year-on-year driven by the non peer-to-peer SMS revenue increase of over 38%.</p>
          <p>Top line continue to be under pressure, impacted by the slowdown in customer growth, sustained out of the bundle and tariff optimization amid customer confidence weakness and a significant heat of regulation. Regarding profitability, we posted a solid OIBDA performance, up 5.1% year-on-year with a 27.3% margin in the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>In Germany, turning to slide 21, we continue posting very good results gaining value market share as we leverage a strong commercial momentum on our renewed tariff portfolio, best-in-class customer satisfaction and the flexibility of My Handy handset commercialization model. It is also worth to highlight our partner distribution channels which are driving the low-end smartphone segment with &#x20AC;100 devices.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the remarkable contract mobile net adds over 250,000 in the quarter. This, combined with increased usage of data services, led to an acceleration of mobile service revenue growth from 5% in the first quarter to 9% in the third quarter excluding the negative impact from MTR cuts. In addition, OIBDA posted a year-on-year organic increase of 2.3% reaching close to 25% margin in the third quarter with the benefits of business restructuring and large scale and further efficiencies offsetting increased commercial spend.</p>
          <p>To close the review of our European operations, let me highlight the sequential operating and financial improvement across the board posted by Telef&#xF3;nica Czech Republic as shown on slide number 22. Solid commercial performance in focused areas was maintained in the third quarter. In mobile, we outperformed in the contract market after recording positive net adds driven by mobile broadband customers uptick. It is also worth to highlight the fixed broadband performance on the back of the VDSL launch which is helping to protect the existing customer base and to better manage ARPU. As a result, we have increased our fixed broadband market share by 2 percentage points year-on-year. In addition, line losses continues to decrease sharply.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, Czech revenues showed a sequential improvement and in Slovakia we recorded another strong set of results. Profitability remains stable year-on-year. Thanks to cost efficiencies consolidating the best-in-class margin in the Central and Eastern European region while the operating cash flow generation continues to be very strong exceeding &#x20AC;0.5 billion up to September.</p>
          <p>Let me now briefly explain the new organization approved in September which will accelerate the execution of the strategy presented at the Investor Day. The creation of Telef&#xF3;nica Digital and Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources will reinforce our status as a global player and leader in the digital world and will allow us to capture the most of the opportunities afforded by our global scale and industrial alliances. At the same time, we are simplifying and managing the business geographic mix leading to the configuration of two large regions, Europe and Latin America. Reporting along this new structure will begin in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>The first new global unit is Telef&#xF3;nica Digital, a brand new organization with a mission to create the power for Telef&#xF3;nica to outperform in the digital world and reinforce our profile as a growth company. Telef&#xF3;nica Digital aims to create new propositions and revenue streams and provide value to customers beyond pure telecommunication services. We are starting from solid foundations, basing in the same cluster both existing assets like Terra, JAJAH, Tuenti, <mark type="ph" /> Telef&#xF3;nica I+D (27:20) and the verticals featuring digital services in key growth areas such as financial services, machine-to-machine, cloud, security, health, media and advertising. We are now in the process of assessing and prioritizing the opportunities where we can make breakthroughs and add value to Telef&#xF3;nica.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica Digital will exploit our leadership position in markets where we are present leveraging on our 300 million direct customer relationships and will also explore over-the-top opportunities in the right markets with the right partners.</p>
          <p>The second new global unit, Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources aims to leverage the full potential of our global scale to maximize business profitability. We have already making significant progress on global projects but we aim to accelerate the generation of additional synergies and to maximize the benefits from scale economies. We are already working on a few flagship projects, focusing our efforts on fewer but with higher value impact opportunities.</p>
          <p>First, we will increase the level of our standardization in global sourcing to further increase the level of aggregation in global purchases leading to significant additional savings.</p>
          <p>Second, we will further advance in the global management of IT infrastructures, progressing in transformation and providing enablers to the regions to carry out their business with competitive advantages in terms of cost and service quality.</p>
          <p>Third, we will apply more radical approaches in the management of our operating assets. For example, we aim to further advance in network sharing, reaching new agreements and going beyond the traditional site sharing in some cases and we will continue with the sale of non-strategic net core elements such as towers in the areas where they do not provide a competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will speed up the growth of our MNC business, reaching our natural market share.</p>
          <p>All these organizational changes are being implemented and we have set clear priorities in the short-term to drive growth and profitability and to improve our financial flexibility. In Latin America, Santiago and his team are focusing on maintaining our operating and financial leadership in Brazil, while negotiations with the Colombian government to merge our fixed and mobile businesses are underway. This transaction when finally approved should lead to significant synergies and debt reduction. Turnaround in Mexico is another key target for the short-term.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a and his team are working to balance stronger commercial momentum with free cash flow protection in Spain. While in the U.K., the main goal is to enhance our commercial activity. In Germany, the whole team is focused to keep on gaining high value market share, while in the Czech Republic, we aim to continue delivering a superior cash generation.</p>
          <p>Regarding Telef&#xF3;nica Digital and Telef&#xF3;nica Global Resources, both Matthew and Guillermo are working fast to quickly launch their units to foster growth in the digital world and to fully leverage scale benefits.</p>
          <p>Finally, my first priority in my new role is to improve financial flexibility, exploiting several levers and building on our strong free cash flow generation. We will productively manage our assets base. We will also increase our focus on profitable and efficient investment, where we will continue to have a very strict working capital and tax management. All of these will allow us to reinforce our growth profile and to deliver on all our commitments which we reiterate.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we are building the foundations for future revenue growth. We are on track to meet 2011 guidance leveraging our diversification and strong growth in mobile data, we continue to have a sound free cash flow and a strong liquidity position, our new organization will bolster growth and efficiency gains enhancing execution, we will pursue an active portfolio management to optimize use of capital and improve financial flexibility and the strong free cash flow generation will allow us to comfortably reiterate our dividend commitments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The first question was on the P&amp;L account, how concerned are you with all the austerity measures that could be introduced in Spain with a new government starting on November 20th and do you feel confident on the possibility of maintaining the trend that consensus is looking at for EBITDA in 2012? Second, &#xC1;ngel, you were saying about the financial flexibility. How important is the credit rating that Telef&#xF3;nica has right now, and do you see the net debt to OIBDA declining materially over the next 12 months?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jesus, I'll take your first question on Spain and the overall economic situation. We do not expect any improvement in the short run. Competition is not showing either any sign of competitive relief. So, we are focusing highly on remodeling our commercial strategies with tariffs. You know that we have been launching new tariffs on the contract side.</p>
          <p>On the mobile side, we have been launching a new fixed broadband proposition as well. And very recently, as of yesterday, we launched a full range of new tariffs on bundling mobile both voice and data. So, no major changes. We are not expecting a major improvement in the short run, but we keep going and commercial activity is improving, our commercial momentum is becoming stronger. So we are not exploring and we are not considering improvement, but we'll keep going to the same direction commercially speaking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is &#xC1;ngel. Jesus, on the leverage ratio, we have reiterated our target for debt OIBDA ratio for year end. The exact level by year-end will depend on the financial market rates, especially on FX, but also on interest rates. Will also depend on further improvement targeting the working capital, also, on the base of commitments on new pre-retirement programs and the OIBDA evolution in the last quarter. I should say that we don't have just the ambition of generating cash flow to pay the dividend, but to have some leeway for other purposes and also including some debt consolidation. So we reiterate the leverage ratio for yearend as we have expressed.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks. Two questions. First of all in Latam, it seems like the cost of growth for couple of quarters now has been consistently higher than expected. Is this a sort of sustainable trend or could we see a point perhaps next year where we start seeing EBITDA growth accelerating faster than revenue growth as opposed to obviously this year's trend.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on what you're saying around disposals. It would be helpful to understand how broadly you are thinking. Are all of the current assets in-scope including things like the China Unicom stake? And then just to clarify your dividend guidance in relation to that, I know you're saying you want to pay the dividend out of cash flow, could that be cash flow that includes cash generated from disposals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim this is &#xC1;ngel let me take your question first about when and if the OIBDA decline that you have seen this quarter might turn around. I think the answer is two-fold. First, market is growing faster than we had originally planned and we are doing better in general terms than what we originally thought. That has required especially in a place like Brazil, that we step our higher commercial efforts. This is a welcome development in the sense that acceleration in growth is going to mean higher penetration and a better result for those already present at the relevant market shares like it generally tends to be our case.</p>
          <p>On top of that we have had on this quarter a number of different irregular events that have coincided in the sense that they are non-recurrent or they don't happen every quarter. That might have lowered the EBITDA picture which I think that underlying you can say is proceeding at the right pace. Whether we will regain acceleration in order to grow sometime next year will continually depend on what happens with the market growth and with the attitude of other competitors, who are of course also trying to reach the same goals.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the investments, we're working in several projects, to maximize the value of non-core assets and to optimize the use of capital. Given the volatility that we're seeing in the markets, we would rather not disclose which are those projects or the timing of those executions. But I should say that the final target of this sale is to optimize our portfolio rather than a must to complete our remuneration commitments.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. Two questions from my side. The first one is on the EBITDA trends, obviously we've seen just over 1% decline in the margin and your three-year guidance suggests a small decline more or less flat margin. I was wondering whether you can give us some color on how you expect the margins to progress beyond 2011 and will the improvement be a result of specific efficiency measures beyond the one you announced in Spain or whether that's a result of non-commercial investment in Latin America and other parts of the footprint?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the Spanish business. The regulator reported close to 90,000 mobile number portability deficit for every one of the three months in the summer, and I know in the past you are very focused on churn, but it has been rising this year. So my question is would you be willing to allow churn to increase further or do you believe at this time the priority is to stabilize the KPIs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question &#x2013; this is Julio Linares. When we provide our guidance for this year, we prioritize top line growth, an effort to capture growth opportunities in our footprint. Because of that taken into account the uncertainties that we show in the market, our own macroeconomic competition and consumer behavior, we provide addressable guidance to be able to manage those uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Reality has been tougher than we thought and we saw that it was tougher because of the macroeconomic evolution, because of regulation and because of competition. Additionally, the consumers were very sensible to pricing and indeed optimizing their tariffs. On the other hand it was great, the growth in mobile broadband, though it has a significant impact on the growth side because of the commercial effort regarding smartphones. Because of that we have this kind of margin and OIBDA evolution. And of course, we are using all the levers we have in order to improve these efficiencies, particularly now taking into account our new organization for Global Resources.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question about Spain and churn. For us, we focus on churn on the different segments and as a result we do answer on different fronts. First of all, in terms of the new product and services that we have been launching, we are starting to get traction as I was telling you before and that's showing significant improvement in net add figures and reducing down churn namely on the broadband &#x2013; fixed broadband side. So you will see some traction and some improvement in the coming months.</p>
          <p>On the contract side, with this &#x20AC;0.06 tariff that we launched a few months ago is starting to show a good signal as well and therefore on the contract side, the churn on the mobile side is getting better. The new tariffs again that we launched yesterday bundling voice and data on the mobile side again will help us on that direction. So the pending issue would be on the prepaid side where we have now become very tactical. You will see some campaigns from us from here till year-end, but we won't be disclosing them now.</p>
          <p>So churn, it's always our focus, but we are also very keen on value and therefore for us, we are managing churn on the different segments. So you will see some improvement on the different products and services. We will keep you posted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess the first question is just on shareholder returns. On the commitments to pay shareholder returns at a similar level beyond 2012, so I think &#x20AC;8 billion annually. I guess just in the context of the organic EBITDA trend today which is over minus 4% and rising interest costs, are you still confident in your ability to pay that level of shareholder returns beyond 2012 and what might cause you to think differently about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we are reiterating our shareholder remuneration in the light of the strong free cash flow generation that we are seeing. The first nine months, as I said before we reached &#x20AC;5.7 billion of free cash flow which is up 11.6% year-on-year. We expect free cash flow performance for the full year. We do not provide free cash flow target, so cannot provide the free cash flow payout for the next year, but as a reference last year after spectrum we generated &#x20AC;8.5 billion free cash flow, &#x20AC;175 per share <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:00) &#x20AC;7.9 billion of that So what, it would be 38% of free cash flow generated in a year like 2010. From 2013 onwards, we still have not decided what would be the split of shareholder <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:21) between dividends or potential share buybacks and will be decided later one taking into account investors' interest and also market conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. My second question, if I could switch to the U.K., it looks like minute volumes there are now falling 11% year over year, and the relative performance has deteriorated. I just wonder if you can talk around the prospects for improving that relative revenue performance in the U.K. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question. The answer obviously is yes. We keep focusing on volume rather than on value. But, we need to acknowledge that during the last month, the deceleration in service revenues has been mainly based on the reduction on the base growth, and therefore, we have already launched <mark type="ph" /> the inner focus and new set of ties (45:18), mainly on the smartphone field on the contract side where we specifically aim to regress market momentum. And, in fact according to the latest figures that have, we are getting traction on that side, both in prepay and in postpay. So, yes, we are focusing on that and, yes, we are taking commercial action.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got two questions, please. First one is regarding the workforce reduction on the new collective agreement in Spain. As the benefits of that come through in 2012, should we expect to see this invested in heavier commercial investment as we've seen in Brazil and in Mexico in the last quarter or should this feed through perhaps into a stabler EBITDA trend as you see market conditions at present?</p>
          <p>And, the second question is just regarding mobile data. Back in April, you provided some very interesting information about the percentage of customers who were hitting the caps in their tiered data plans. I wonder whether you have any other updated information around that to give us some sense of what proportion of your smartphone customers are now trading up through the tier mix? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first question on the workforce reduction in Spain. The process is being run and is progressing according to a schedule. So, we will see the benefits of that reduction go through into the P&amp;L account during 2012 progressively because you're going to depend on ath the end of the day, this year how many people will be registering for that and secondly at what time of next year they will be leaving the company, and therefore, we will have a time impact all along the year.</p>
          <p>The use of that &#x2013; of those savings of those efficiencies is going to be decided on an annual basis depending on market and commercial conditions. But, you should expect those efficiencies to flow all along the year, not at the beginning of the year but throughout the year 2012. And, we will keep you posted on the process.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question, I'm trying to answer for the whole Telef&#xF3;nica Group. Right now we have penetration of mobile broadband and in dongles, smartphones and tablets altogether of 15% of our total base. With this penetration, we are above expectations both in accesses and ARPU levels.</p>
          <p>And, the ARPU that we are getting with this kind of mobile broadband customers is 1.5, average mobile ARPU, which is in line with information that we provided in our investors conference in London. Profit that we have seen in this mobile broadband customer base is better than average profit and it is well in line with information that we provided at that conference.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions from me, please. First, you reported 0.3% revenue growth in the first nine months. Do you consider this to be within the definition of up to 2% revenue growth? And, secondly, you have upgraded your Brazil synergy targets, which is a positive. But, can you give us some time &#x2013; some color on the phasing of the incremental synergies? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes. And, in terms of the synergy extraction process, remember what we can share with you is that what we have upgraded is a non-operating part of them, now that we have been able to clarify a bit better how the full impact of the reorganization process is going to be. But, unfortunately, we are not in a position to disclose at this very moment exactly how we are going to be <mark type="ph" /> following (50:27). Those will be, however, event driven; meaning, by the time we report the results and we file the tax returns or we refinance the earnings &#x2013; I'm sorry, the synergy values will be more visible than they are today.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A very good afternoon. Two questions, please. First on Latin America, when do you expect to see the benefit of the higher commercial activity come through in terms of revenues, and therefore, when do you see &#x2013; when do you think we can see more accelerated revenue growth coming from Latin America? And, secondly on Spain, it seems total voice traffic seems to &#x2013; the decline seems to have accelerated in the quarter compared to last quarter. Can you give me an update what is happening and is there any chance this could turn around in the near term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Torsten, this is Santiago. Let me take your question on Lat Am first. The sequence of events should be: we get new adds, especially those related with contract in the contract segment or with new products like mobile broadband that eventually translates itself into higher revenue growth. And, how fast that process happens depends crucially on how well penetrated the market is. So, it will be very market specific. It is hard to generalize because I might be off in one market and in, in some others.</p>
          <p>Brazil is probably at the tail end of that process and because Brazil weighs so much, I think it's going to be sooner rather than later that we can see some acceleration in growth. We have seen, for instance, this quarter that we've had very good top-line numbers in Brazil that with the wobbles and the ups and downs that aren't to be expected from a very competitive environment probably should be in the trend going on. We are also very happy that our leadership in the new products like mobile broadband is so far unfettered and it's going to be very hard to catch up on us because of the investments that we've been able to make in the past. And, eventually, those revenue growths should of course translate themselves when markets stabilize into OIBDA and then the rest of the account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, your question about voice traffic evolution spend; it's true, it has been &#x2013; the decline accelerated a little bit in the third quarter and that's why we have reacted with this bundling strategy both on the wireline and on the wireless. And, as a result &#x2013; because we have increased the attractiveness on the amount of minutes that we are bundling, we expect to have a better evolution of our MOU during the next quarters. In fact, after the launching of the &#x20AC;0.06 tariff, we have gained some traction, and we hope that with the new tariff sample that we launched yesterday we will get some traction as well there. But, you're right, during the third quarter voice traffic declined a little bit more than in the second quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you. Two questions please. First, with regards to organic EBITDA trajectory which has deteriorated throughout the year for the reasons you've highlighted. Q4 2010 on my number is going to be a tougher comparable. So, I was wondering in which part of the business you were expecting a recovery so that you can offset that tougher recover &#x2013; comparable and stay within guidance.</p>
          <p>And then, second question regarding LTE auctions in Brazil; apparently, the schedule is moving ahead and I think the Ministry of Telecommunication was talking about the possibility of a new entrant in Brazil mobile through LTE auction. Maybe if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the timing and the kind of different players that you envision in the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question, what we expect is that in Spain, we will not see major changes in revenues. On EBITDA performance, we will leverage on our commercial activity that we expect to improve in this fourth quarter, thanks to our new commercial proposition launch in the market as well as the sales of some non-strategic assets. And, in Latin America, we will see improved trends as we capitalize the strong commercial activity recorded in the last quarter particularly and the synergies in Brazil that are progressing well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mathieu, in terms of the expected LTE auction, the Ministry of Telecoms in Brazil has said that by the end of April next year there should be an auction. That is not a proposition but it is an indication to be in the 2.5 gigahertz space, and we are still unsure about what the other conditions about coverage, required investments or quality would be. But, there will be a few more of those. We have the intention, of course, to participate and whether or not there are new entrants or new bidders remains to be seen. We certainly think this is a good investment for the future, although quite frankly might have been a bit early relative to the recent auctions and the still ongoing deployment of 3G. But, nevertheless, whenever it is auctioned, we will participate.</p>

Could you just update us on the amount? And, then secondly, you provided net debt in Spain, U.K., Czech Republic. I believe Germany has to hold cash. But, currently, where &#x2013; does it matter at the group level where the cash balances sit in terms of liquidity or is it &#x2013; are you able to manage refinancing, et cetera, without much larger dividends from Latin America?</p>

          <p>Okay. This is &#xC1;ngel Vil&#xE1;. On the repatriations, we have repatriated &#x20AC;1.7 billion from Latin America. Last year, by the same time, we had repatriated &#x20AC;1.1 billion. And, what we said at the end of the second quarter conference call, we by then had repatriated &#x20AC;1.4 billion. We said we were expecting to double that figure by year-end.</p>

          <p>This is Miguel. Regarding your question on our cash. It is mainly located in Latin America as the cash that we have usually in Spain or in Europe, it's used basically to pay down the credit lines that maybe withdrawn later on. Anyway, we have centralized cash management and so although the cash is owned by Latin American companies, a big part of that is lent through our central cash unit management so that it can be used also at the holding level.</p>

          <p>Giovanni, it's Santiago here. I think it's not prudent to say when the acceleration in trends is going to happen. I think the direction is quite clear though. It might be next, it might be the following, but certainly all the requirements are in place, but I would rather not comment right now to an immediate acceleration in trends.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, can I quickly follow-up on the synergies? Is there any synergies already &#x2013; are you already taking &#x2013; making use and executing a portion of those synergies on the fiscal and financial side? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most operational synergies are taking place gradually. They are happening after the integration which is very recent and some of them are going to be extracted by things like &#x2013; let me talk to you as an example &#x2013; by long distance being split between S&#xE3;o Paulo and outside of S&#xE3;o Paulo, which previously had to pay taxes because they belonged to different company and now they are all within the same company. This is an obvious very clear tax saving, that is &#x2013; because it's now going to be internalized. And there are many others like that, not thousands, but there are many others like that that happen as services gets old. The financial and the tax events as I think I mentioned before are more event specific and they'll happen more likely next year than this year.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions on regulation. The first one in Europe, in a speech Neelie Kroes at the beginning of October mentioned two options or two possibilities with regards to incentivizing investments in the next generation access investments and the first one was a reduction in ULL copper prices. And the second one was an inevitable increase in the wholesale and retail fiber base prices in the medium term. I was wondering what are your views on these two possibilities, on the first one, maybe in the short term and the second one on whether it's acceptable over the medium term?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on Brazil and Anatel launched this unbundling consultation process in August. I was wondering if you can give us an update, if you have more visibility now on the priorities of Anatel, the type of cost methodology they are thinking of, and whether Telesp or Telef&#xF3;nica Brazil would be interested in becoming an unbundler outside S&#xE3;o Paulo in the new framework? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your first question, we really believe that to artificially try to reduce prices in the market through wholesale or through unbundling local loop is not the right solution to incentivate investment in the new generation. We really believe that there are other frameworks that will be much better in order to stimulate that kind of new infrastructure development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; Luigi, it's Santiago here. In terms of unbundling process, in Brazil it just started. It was announced but I think by early next year we should have much more clarity about how we'll win. Is it going to be applied? Prices are to the best of my knowledge are still not known and the Telef&#xF3;nica strategy is still not fully developed but I can give you some indications, is that outside of S&#xE3;o Paulo, we have very little if any interest in using that instrument without knowing the prices. Maybe if the pricing is attractive, we have to take a second look that. But our current strategy is to use the fixed wireless technology to access the market outside of S&#xE3;o Paulo as we have just launched in some of the southern states of Brazil two weeks ago. So we don't have still full clarity. It is coming. The conditions are unknown and we will in all likelihood not participate heavily &#x2013; at least not heavily on the outside of S&#xE3;o Paulo market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. Couple of questions in Spain. The first one is given that you've highlighted in the third quarter the commercial investment in order to try to gain commercial traction throughout the market, I was wondering, if we should expect parts of the savings generated in Spain as a result of restructuring to be reinvested in order to regain market share in 2012 or rather we should expect that to flow through the <mark type="ph" /> BP (64:01) line?</p>
          <p>And the second one is you said that you commercial &#x2013; the latest commercial offering fixed broadband in Spain has given some good results. And actually if I look at the numbers released by the Spanish telecom regulator, it looks like it's a fixed &#x2013; the fiber deployment which is really tracking very good results. So I don't know if your initial coverage target has changed at any point in time through the latest quarter. Maybe give us some color on your target coverage for 2012 and how the fiber deployment is working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first question about how we're going to be treating efficiencies next year. First of all, efficiencies are not just going to come from the voluntary reduction program on the workforce. We have further plans in Spain, namely on the handset reduction in terms of the amount of handset that we are buying externally in terms of the capital that we have. We have already announced that. We will keep centralizing more of our purchasing effort and therefore we expect to generate more savings thanks to the action of the Guillermo Ansaldo's team on Global Resources.</p>
          <p>So you will see more savings than debt or more efficiency process running in Spain and all around Europe than just the workforce reduction. And for sure, we will reinvest some of those in commercial activity, because we see the market, we see value on the market. We have seen value on the commercial offer, as I was telling you before on the fixed broadband, both on fiber and in DSL and for sure, on the mobile side namely in contract.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we intend to be much more efficient next year but not just with the reduction of the workforce, with all those plans and yes, we intend to reinvest part of that on the commercial effort because we do see value and growth on that side.</p>
          <p>And on the second question, on the results, we are getting traction on the fiber. We are happy with the fiber deployment and with the speed of deployment, it is not huge. We are going step by step, but it is going very well. And on the &#x20AC;24.9 offer that we launched at the end of August, beginning of September, the numbers of the evolution of net adds that were negative for a while is starting to show better results. And I hope that from here to the year-end, you will see the traction on that product. But yes, we are optimistic and yes we are getting better results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Regarding the evolution of the company debt and the amount that has been paid down by the nine months generated. I was wondering considering that in the foreseeable future we do not see the capacity of the OIBDA rising any stronger and obviously with CapEx commitments, your capacity to generate more operational cash flow is probably limited. I was wondering whether after 2013 you are considering other shareholder remuneration formulas outside the cash and the share buyback? Mainly I am thinking of <mark type="ph" /> upscript (68:04) issues.</p>
          <p>And the second item would be related to Argentina. I was wondering whether you'll give us sort of more color related to the possible hyperinflation or the excess inflation that could be happening in that market and whether you're able to contain that at the OIBDA level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, with respect to the first question, regarding shareholder remuneration after 2012, we have still not decided which would be the split of such and as I said before we would take into account market conditions, any best of preferences when the time arrives. You spoke about a potential split dividend. What I can say is that we are not contemplating in our agenda split dividend given the low valuation levels that we have in Telef&#xF3;nica share price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and in terms of Argentina, two comments. One is that Argentina is still not a hyperinflationary economy by accounting standards. Inflation is quite high, but official inflation is slightly lower than whatever we all recorded or expected inflation. This is not a new trend. This has been going now for a number of years and as a result of that, we've been able to adjust the non-inflation exposed part of our business quite dramatically, meaning non-regulated or lesser regulated prices have taken a bigger role in our basket of products, specifically the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (69:45) that remains &#x2013; we started to remain frozen <mark type="ph" /> the figure is there (69:48).</p>
          <p>There has been and there will continue to be an impact on cost, because costs are adjusted if not in full to inflation at least very much so, and so it is a difficult thing to comment. On the other hand, the increased tendency of Argentineans to spend on a back of a better economy and high inflation is helping alleviate that trend somewhat. So considering that inflation is not a working development, we still think that in Argentina it is a less unfavorable event than it might be in other regions.</p>
