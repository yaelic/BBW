          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Sean Ryan, Manager for Fixed Income Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Bob Shanks, Ford Vice President and Controller; Michael Seneski, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including K. R. Kent, Executive Director, Investor Relations; David Brandi, Assistant Treasurer; and Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a couple of items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media Websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are present on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis, and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U. S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly, and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Vice President and Controller, Bob Shanks. Bob?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Shawn. On slide 1, let's start there. Our third quarter business performance was marked by automotive growth, solid profitability and positive automotive operating related cash flow. Both volume and revenue were higher than a year ago and we earned a pre-tax operating profit of $1.9 billion, with our automotive and financial services sectors each profitable.</p>
          <p>Net income totaled $1.6 billion and automotive operating related cash flow was a positive $400 million. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing automotive debt by $1.3 billion in the quarter. Market share was higher in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific/Africa, compared with a year ago. Overall, we had a solid third quarter and first nine months.</p>
          <p>We also concluded an agreement with the UAW for a four-year contract, which was recently ratified, that improves our competitiveness in the U.S. We accomplished these results while continuing to invest for future growth, focused on developing outstanding products with segment-leading quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design and value. Although this is increasing costs in the short term, it's in line with our plan. These actions also are driving higher volume and stronger transaction prices.</p>
          <p>So in sum, we're well on track to deliver our guidance of improved total company pre-tax operating profit and automotive operating related cash flow for the full year compared with 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to slide 2 which summarizes our third quarter business results compared with a year ago. Vehicle wholesales were 1.3 million units, up 93,000 units or 7% from last year. Revenue was about $33 billion, an increase of about $4 billion or 14%. For comparison purposes, we have excluded Volvo wholesales and revenue from 2010.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $1.9 billion or $0.46 per share, which was $111 million lower than a year ago. The pre-tax operating profit was reduced by about $350 million for unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges for future periods. These adjustments occurred because of the significant decline in commodity prices near the end of September. This is a non-cash charge that will either reverse should commodity prices increase or be offset by the benefit of lower commodity prices in the future.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Ford, including unfavorable pre-tax special items of $98 million, was $1.6 billion or $0.41 per share, which is down slightly from a year ago. Automotive operating related cash flow was $400 million positive. In the first nine months, vehicle wholesales increased by 9%, compared with the same period a year ago; and revenue improved 15%. First nine months pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $7.7 billion, a $652 million improvement; and net income attributable to Ford was $6.6 billion, a $227 million improvement. Operating and related cash flow was $4.9 billion.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion of automotive gross cash and with automotive gross cash exceeding debt by $8.1 billion, which was a net cash improvement of $10.7 billion compared with a year ago and $100 million higher than the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 3 and a review of automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow, as I mentioned, we ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in automotive gross cash, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the end of the second quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $400 million, which reflects the flow-through of our pre-tax automotive operating profit of $1.3 billion, offset partially by unfavorable working capital changes and higher net capital spending.</p>
          <p>In addition, we received $600 million of distributions from the Financial Services sector and realized unfavorable other cash changes of $700 million, explained primarily by the adverse impact of exchange on our non-U.S. cash balances. Our cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions was $200 million.</p>
          <p>Net debt payments in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion. We also made payments of $200 million to non-U.S. funded pension plans. In the first nine months, our automotive operating related cash flow was $4.9 billion and cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions totaled $7.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 4 summarizes our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the third quarter. Automotive debt was $12.7 billion, a reduction of $1.3 billion from June 30. This reflects payment of the remaining $1.8 billion balance of the term loan debt, offset partially by an increase in low-cost loans to support advanced technology. It also includes a favorable exchange translation impact of $100 million. Our net cash as of September 30 was $8.1 billion and automotive liquidity was $31 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 summarizes first nine months results and our planning assumptions and key operational metrics for full year 2011. Our latest outlook on industry volumes is 13 million units for the U. S. and 15.2 million units for Europe. In terms of our other operational metrics, quality remains mixed due to the near-terms issues in North America, which we're addressing, and we're on track to achieve quality improvements in our international operations. We expect U.S. and Europe market shares to equal or improve from last year's results and we expect total company pre-tax operating profit to improve compared with the $8.3 billion that we earned in 2010.</p>
          <p>Based on our latest assessment, we expect the increase in structural costs compared with 2010 to be about $1.6 billion. And as a result of the recent hedging adjustments, we now expect the increase in commodity costs to be about $2.2 billion compared with last year.</p>
          <p>We now expect our operating margin to be about 5.7%, lower than the 6.1% that we achieved in 2010. This is due primarily to the impact of our commodity hedging adjustments. We also expect automotive operating related cash flow to improve from 2010's $4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the first nine months. We now expect full year spending to be about $4.6 billion as we continue to realize efficiencies from our global product development processes. Our product plans remain fully on track.</p>
          <p>Our first nine months performance was solid and we expect to continue to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter, with each of our operations profitable for the full year.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to now turn it over to Mike Seneski.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. We'll now turn our attention to Ford Credit's quarterly performance. You'll note some modifications to the data presentation, which were made in an effort to provide further consistency between our fixed income and 10-Q disclosures.</p>
          <p>On slide 6, you can see that our third quarter pre-tax profit was $581 million and net income was $350 million. Our September 30th managed receivables were $82 billion, slightly lower than year-end 2010. Managed receivables are about $4 billion lower than the second quarter, reflecting primarily changes in currency exchange rates and lower dealer stock levels. We continue to expect year-end managed receivables to be in the range of $82 billion to $87 billion.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs for receivables in the third quarter were $45 million and the worldwide loss to receivables ratio was a very low 21 basis points. I'll speak more on this in a few minutes. At September 30th, the allowance for credit losses, or reserve, was about $600 million or 73 basis points of receivables.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we paid $800 million of distributions to our parent, Ford Holdings LLC, of which $200 million was utilized for debt payments and $600 million was distributed to Ford Motor Company. Year-to-date, we have paid $2.7 billion of distributions and expect to pay about $3 billion in total this year. We will continue to assess future distributions based on our available liquidity and managed leverage adjectives. Our managed leverage was 8 to1 at September 30, 2011, up from 7.5 to 1 at June 30th. At the end of the third quarter, our equity was $8.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 shows the $185 million decrease in third quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago. In line with our expectations, the results are more than explained by fewer leases being terminated and the resulting vehicles sold at a gain and lower credit loss reserve reduction. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit decreased by $23 million compared with the second quarter, more than explained by the same lease factors, offset partially by changes in market valuation adjustments to derivatives, which is included in other.</p>
          <p>For full year 2011, we continue to expect to be solidly profitable, but at a lower level than 2010, reflecting the lease and credit lost reserve factors. The profit contribution related to these items is about $165 million in the third quarter and is expected to be around $80 million in the fourth quarter. These factors are not expected to be significant in 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 shows our quarterly trend of charge-offs, loss to receivable ratios, and our credit loss reserves. Charge-offs in the third quarter were $45 million, down $50 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting lower repossessions in the United States and lower losses in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by lower recoveries in the U.S. Charge-offs were down $4 million from the second quarter, reflecting lower losses in Europe and Asia-Pacific, offset personally by higher repossessions and lower recoveries in the U.S. The third quarter loss to receivables ratio continues to perform at historically low levels. The loss to receivables ratio was down from the same period a year ago and down from the second quarter 2011, reflecting the same factors just mentioned. The credit loss reserve was $598 million, down $375 million from a year ago and down $75 million from the second quarter of 2011, reflecting the decrease in charge-offs.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail and lease business, which comprises approximately 70% of our consumer portfolio. Over 60 day delinquencies were 15 basis points in the third quarter, down one basis point from the same period a year ago. Repossessions in the third quarter were 12,000 units or 1.93% of average accounts outstanding, up slightly, reflecting seasonality. Severity at $6,300 in the third quarter, was $300 lower than the same period a year ago, and $200 lower than the second quarter 2011, primarily reflecting improvement in auction values in the used vehicle market, offset partially by a higher mix of 72-month contracts.</p>
          <p>The loss to receivables ratio in the third quarter decreased from the same period a year ago, reflecting lower repossessions offset partially by lower recoveries. The loss to receivables ratio was higher than the second quarter 2011, due to higher repossessions and lower recoveries. Charge-offs in the third quarter were $34 million, down $26 million from the same period a year ago and up $11 million from the second quarter of 2011, reflecting the same factors just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 10, this shows the lease residual performance for our U.S. Ford and Lincoln brands. Lease return volumes in the third quarter at 16,000, were almost 60% lower than the same period last year, reflecting primarily fewer terminations and a lower return rate. The third quarter lease return rate was 48%, down 13 percentage points compared with the same period last year and down 7 percentage points compared with the second quarter of 2011. In the third quarter, our strong auction values for 36 month vehicles continued, up $425 per unit from the same period last year and equal to the second quarter. Our worldwide net investment and operating leases was $10.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, up from $10.2 billion in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Mike. Our full year funding plan, and I'm on slide 11, is largely complete despite challenging market conditions. Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue assessing a variety of markets, channels and investors.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we completed $7 billion of funding, including $4 billion in the public market and $3 billion of private transactions. We have completed another $3 billion of funding during the month of October, including our second public floor plan transaction. Year-to-date, we have completed $27 billion of funding; included in these numbers is about $650 million issued under our unsecured retail notes program.</p>
          <p>We also renewed $5 billion of committed capacity in the third quarter and about $19 billion year-to-date. We have now completed most of our renewals for 2011 and continue to see lower costs across all our facilities. We are pleased with the recent rating upgrades, including S&amp;P's upgrade of FCE bank to investment grade. Our liquidity remained strong and we will maintain cash balances and committed capacity to meet our business and funding requirements in all global market condition.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows our trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the third quarter, managed receivables were $82 billion. We ended the quarter with $12 billion in cash and securitized funding was 52% of managed receivables. We are projecting 2011 year-end managed receivables in the range of 52 &#x2013; I'm sorry, in the range of $82 billion to $87 billion and securitized funding is expected to represent about 53% to 50% of total &#x2013; 57% of total managed receivables. It is our expectation that this percentage will decline moving forward, due to our ability to source term funding from the unsecured markets at favorable terms and the effect of our fuel notes converting to unsecured.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows our 2011 term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs. Year-to-date we have completed $27 billion of term funding. About $15 billion of this was public funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including over $5 billion of unsecured debt, and two fuel issuances totaling $2.5 billion. Year-to-date we have completed about $12 billion of funding through our private securitization channel across all our major asset class classes and regions.</p>
          <p>We project full year public term funding in the range of $17 billion to $20 billion, consisting of $6 billion to $8 billion of unsecured debt and $11 billion to $12 billion of public securitization. In addition to the public issuance, we are projecting $12 billion to $14 billion of funding from our private sources. Based on the market environment and our recent upgrades from Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's, we will continue to elevate mark markets and our funding mix.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity, which includes unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines, and our asset backed bank capacity. As of September 30th, we have $43.1 billion of committed capacity and cash. After excluding securitization, cash, and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was $35.3 billion, of which $16.9 billion was utilized, leaving about $18 billion of liquidity available for use.</p>
          <p>Committed capacity at the end of the third quarter was $31.2 billion; about $700 million lower than the second quarter. Our renewal strategy continues to protect our global funding needs. We ended the quarter with about $4.2 billion of excess committed capacity, providing a funding source for future originations and flexibility to transfer capacity among markets and asset classes where most needed.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 summarizes our third quarter results. Ford had pre-tax operating profits, excluding special items, of $1.9 billion. Net income attributable to Ford was $1.6 billion. We ended the quarter with automotive liquidity of $31 billion, including $10.2 billion of available automotive credit facilities. Automotive debt was reduced by $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting the repayment in full of our term loan. We ended the quarter with cash, net of debt, of $8.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit's pre-tax profit was $581 million and net income was $350 million. Ford Credit paid $800 million in distributions in the third quarter and is on track to pay a total of about $3 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, Ford Credit has completed $27 billion of term funding. And we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $18 billion. We are continuing our progress toward investment grade credit ratings as evidenced by our most recent rating upgrade.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call back to Sean to start the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle, representing J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Just a couple of questions. One, you guys are guiding towards European profits in fiscal '11 and if I'm looking back, that requires kind of a flat year-over-year fourth quarter EBT which was, I believe, about a $100 million loss last year to get you to right at break even. You guided flat production year-over-year and given some of the comments off the first the call of pressure on margin, incentives and more fleet, it sounds like raw materials mix and pricing are moving against you. I'm just &#x2013; my question is if we're going to do a flat profit year-over-year to get to that profitability on flat production, what am I missing? Is there any structural savings or should mix pricing or raw materials move positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob Shanks. I mean we're not going to be specific about the amount of profit that we're projecting for the fourth quarter for Europe. But we have been profitable year-to-date, including the loss that we had in the third quarter. We're expecting to be profitable for the full year and to be profitable in the fourth quarter. And that's going to be driven mainly by market factors and that's largely around volume and we do expect to see positive net pricing also in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Although given the external environment, that continues to change on a day-by-day basis. I think we'll have to wait see what actually transpires. Partially offsetting that's going to be some cost changes. Some of it's going to be commodities, which has been an issue all throughout the year. And then we usually also have seasonal increases in structural cost across the business in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis and we expect to see some increase in the full year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. It just sounds like it's too early to tell; I was going to ask for your European outlook because obviously the stock market's trading off that, but you gave me the too early to tell and I agree with that.</p>
          <p>Yeah, moving on to Ford Credit, is profit still supposed to be hit by, I think it's $1.1 billion because of the lack of lease residual gains and draw down on the loss provisions? Is that on &#x2013; a) is that still in the cards, and b) is that going to be kind of &#x2013; is that kind of guidance? I mean, you guys did $3 billion last year, does that mean we're going to do $1.9 billion in Ford Credit this year, or is that just that isolated impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Eric, It's Mike Seneski. Previously you're right, we had guided about $1 billion lower year-over-year for the credit loss reserve and lease factors. What we're trying to stitch through now that we're about three quarters through the year is more of an absolute basis. And so we made $581 million this quarter and what we're saying is, in that $581 million is about $165 million related to the credit loss and lease factors that we're not going to expect to see on an ongoing basis. In the fourth quarter, we'll see about $80 million in the total levels.</p>
          <p>So in sum, we're still on par for about $1 billion lower year-over-year, but as I've told you before we're starting to move more towards a more steady state environment. And in that steady state, we've still got a little bit ways to go, and there's about $165 million of that in the $581 million this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great color. And then this may be a really dumb question, but your Ford Credit's equity dropped by $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I know there's a lot of moving pieces. But net income was $0.4 billion less $600 million in dividends. I would have kind of gotten to like a 300 mid on &#x2013; hit on equity, not the $1 billion that we saw. Is there something I'm missing in that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually the distribution is $800 million.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a little bit more. The difference is exchange, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously we had a big movement in the dollar towards the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I'll cede it after this, but I've got to ask. I mean loss to AR is extremely low. We've benefited as a whole, all of the captive auto guys and banks and credit unions over the last year through raising underwriting standards in '08, '09. Looking at the world as we see it today, and you guys have such strong capital, such a clean portfolio; any move to lower underwriting standards going into 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Eric. You know that our underwriting standards have been consistent. They've been consistent through the crisis, they're consistent now. As you know, we already purchased what you'd say is three out of every four kind of subprime customers for our dealers. And we believe that that consistency is what allows us to perform more in the marketplace. Our dealers count on it, our customers count on it, the motor company counts on it, and our investors count on it because we know that a Ford deal is a Ford deal because of the way we originate.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I guess I had a question similar to what Eric was touching on there, and more of a housekeeping item. But you do say in a release that you paid $800 million, I guess, in dividends in the quarter, but then in net cash flow it shows $600 million. What's that difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Brian, Ford Credit's parent is actually Ford Holdings. Ford Holdings has Ford Credit and several smaller financial services businesses, like Ford Land. And because of that, we pay a dividend to Ford Holding and then Ford Holdings remits to the parent company. $200 million of our $800 million distribution went to pay off a Ford Holdings debt. The bulk of the consolidated &#x2013; of the Ford Financial Services consolidated debt is Ford Credits but a small portion is Ford Holdings unique. And the debt payment made in the third quarter was specific to a Ford Holdings obligation that was originally issued in 1991. So bottom line is got a bit of a parent and we've got to pay some debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then two more kind of housekeeping items. What is the size of the EIB loan at the end of third quarter? And what is the size of the XM facility? I think it was like $275 million; just wanted to see both those two amounts. And then I had just a general question on pension after this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The EIB loans in total were about $700 million and the XM loan was about $250 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question is just big picture around pension funding and in your comments in the earlier call today about just trying to get down to $10 billion in debt. I mean, and then obviously I think the equity analysts pretty much asked every way they could about when you're going to pay a dividend. But just maybe if you could prioritize how you're thinking about where you want to spend your cash. I mean, you have dividends, you have a pretty big pension hole, which everyone includes as part of your capital structure anyway. And then, last but not least, but you have goals to reduce your debt. So can you kind of give us an idea as you're framing out 2010, your priorities for cash? I mean, all those things sound important, but I mean can you kind of rank them for us.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think and if you look at what we've said and how we've acted, it's clearly about improving our overall balance sheet. And when you think about debt reduction, and we've done a significant amount of that over the last couple of years, pension and when we stated the $10 billion target for mid-decade, we also talked about how our goals with our assumptions would be to get the pension funds fully funded as well and also restart a dividend in the near term. I think all of those go together from the standpoint of our overall balance sheet and capital strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then did I hear you right that you expect to pay about $3 billion in dividends from Ford Motor Credit to Ford this year in total? You've done about $2.9 billion in total, so it's only about another $100 million in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've actually done about $2.7 and we said we'd be around about $3 billion so could be a little higher. Obviously we'll evaluate based on market conditions and our managed leverage objectives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess following up on the ratings question and your dividend comments today. I know in the past you've said that you wanted to wait to get to investment grade before considering a dividend and you're saying now that you don't need that as a requirement. Could we interpret from that that the transition to investment grade is occurring at a different pace than what you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think which you can infer to that is the fact that we can only control what we can control, and that's executing our business plans. And so dividends are a part of that and our ability to do it is not constrained by any agreements or any documentation that says we have to be investment grade in order to pay a dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And from an outlook standpoint, in your plans for 2012 is there any assumption about what your ratings will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we have assumptions within our own plans but not anything that we're willing to disclose publicly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Again, you know, it's very much dependent upon the rating agencies and their views and, again, we can execute our plan and they will react when they react.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a general business question. I know Eric asked about Europe and I guess I have some similar questions about Brazil and maybe if you could just expand on what you saw there on the third quarter and what you think &#x2013; how that market might evolve over the next year or so. There's a lot of talk about the competitive situation getting a lot tougher there and anything you could offer or expand on that would be great. And then I've got a couple other Ford Motor Credit questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Bob Shanks. As we indicated in the deck that we shared earlier this morning, South America so far this year has made about three-quarters of a billion dollars. And they're generating an operating margin of over 10%. So &#x2013; and they have, I've forgotten the numbers, but it's nearly 30; 25, 30 quarters in a row of profitability, so I mean they have a very long history now of reliable, consistent profitability with good margins, good returns.</p>
          <p>What we saw in the quarter and have started to see in the quarter is some pressure on margins and I think it's coming on the cost side from the normal local inflation as well as commodity cost. And normally that's recovered through the ability to price, but what we're seeing due to the overall competitiveness of the market, which is increasing, is we're probably not able to price quite as, I'll say automatically as we once did.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and I think the other thing to remember about our business is South America this year largely, I think for most of the year, will have no new products. So unlike the other regions, although I guess Asia-Pacific doesn't have too much either this year, that makes a big difference in terms of pricing power in a given period. And they'll start to pick up some of the new global One Ford developed products next year.</p>
          <p>So I think we're kind of in a transition period going from this relatively old lineup into a lineup that's going to be refreshed pretty quickly and pretty dramatically over the next couple of years. And in that transition period with very healthy profits and margins under a little bit of pressure right now, but I think the business looks good and we just need to continue to work on efficiencies and costs and make sure we can get as much revenue as we can, particularly as these new products come on line toward the end of this year and into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The answer to this question may be the same as to the Europe question, which is probably too early to tell, but there's a lot of capacity coming into Brazil as I'm sure you know and a lot of &#x2013; almost all of the incumbents are doing the same thing in terms of refreshing their product lineup. So I'm just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about in the next couple of years and how you see &#x2013; will the market be able to grow fast enough to absorb this additional capacity and where you see margins going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. Clearly, there is more capacity being directed to the market because it is a very profitable market for anyone that's &#x2013; or most anyone, at least, that's participating there. We've also started to see a lot more interest in the market from the Chinese and some of the other more developing type OEMs. And so that's putting pressure in at the low end.</p>
          <p>So I think that there clearly is going to be pricing pressure, but I think the thing to remember is South America has &#x2013; at least our South American operation has really been pretty much of a stand-alone operation from a product standpoint and they're going to really move very quickly into the whole sort of One Ford world, where they can enjoy the benefits that we're already seeing in other parts of the world in terms of picking up global platforms and global top halves.</p>
          <p>And I think that will be at least a partial benefit for us as we do have to continue to work on the cost side, because I do think that your supposition is right is that from the pricing side of business, whether it's driven from more competitors or excess capacity or whatever, I think it will be a little bit different in the future than it has in the past. But we expect to be a strong player and make strong returns and strong profits going forward and it will be driven by, I think, a product renaissance based on One Ford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic. Great, I appreciate it. That's helpful. And then with respect to the Ford Motor Credit side of things, when you look out in terms of used vehicle prices, when you do your forecast for a 36 month leased vehicle coming off lease, when do you &#x2013; when would you start &#x2013; when would we start to see some deterioration in used vehicle prices, just based on &#x2013; leaving the economy aside, but just thinking about the car park and number of vehicles coming off lease and used &#x2013; new car sales three years prior and all that. If you could expand on that, it would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think the best thing to look at is ALG publishes basically quarterly their view of what the market is going to look like. And right now, I think they're saying by 2014 they expect about a 10% to 11% decline in auction values from where they are today. So I think that's a good fair representation of how you should look at it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. Couple of questions. First, on the more accounting clarification here on the $350-ish million headwind on the commodity side related to hedging; that &#x2013; those losses are tied to, I assume, unrealized non-cash losses mark-to-market, so those would be non cash flow or unqualified hedges. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Presumably, you've got a lot of your hedges that are a cash flow and all that noise, the unrealized noise, flows to the balance sheet and you would have a level of unqualified hedges and that's been the pattern over the last several years. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's pretty clean. On a foreign exchange side we designate our hedges on the commodity side, we don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then interest rate is mostly designated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Designated means qualified?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, at Ford Credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I'm talking more at the Ford level though. So then looking back, have you guys isolated the gains on the mark-to-market; unrealized gains on the non-qualified hedges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they haven't been material. In the previous quarter, I think it's less than $20 million cumulatively through the first half. And it varies a little bit positive, little bit negative each quarter. We just had such a dramatic change in commodity prices the last two weeks of September, that drove the mark on the hedges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, just going into Ford Motor Credit and the dividend up to the parent, now Moody's came out earlier in the month and said &#x2013; and cited some structural issues at Ford Motor Credit with asset encumbrance, et cetera; and indicated that there might be a notching between Ford and Ford Motor Credit. I know you can't control the agencies, but just sort of as you look forward and you're looking at the level of encumbered assets, the fuel note program, et cetera, et cetera, if you &#x2013; if Ford Motor Credit remains at the, in the BB area, will you look to bolster the balance sheet a little further to sort of I guess compensate for the lack of &#x2013; or high level of encumbered assets? And by that I mean maybe shutting down the dividend and maybe even boosting &#x2013; or lowering leverage somewhat to compensate for those issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we've said and what we believe is over time we're going to continue to bring that securitized percentage down to &#x2013; as a part of balancing our overall funding strategy. We have, over the last three or four years, built up a very expensive securitization program with multiple channels, multiple asset classes around the world that we actually think is a huge liquidity value for us. And so taking it down to a reasonable level that allows us to continue to have access to all those liquidity sources and in addition to the unsecured market we think is the best strategy to protect Ford Credit's overall liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll take that number down from where it is to day, but we're going to do in a way that maximizes the overall liquidity to the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>As of &#x2013; leverage, we have a asset-based approach on and a judgment of the risk associated with those assets. We've set &#x2013; 10 to 11 to 1 is our target; we're at 8 to 1 now, so we've got lots of room. And as the funding environment continues to improve, we'll continue to walk that leverage up.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions. One, what was driving that lease return volume decline, which is rather dramatic? And since you said that won't repeat in 2012, would that suggest that that return volume will stay at about under 50%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, there's a couple of things going on here. One is the absolute level of leases that will come back to us. And if you remember back in 2008 and 2009, the whose market slowed down leasing pretty dramatically. So because of that, I'm going to talk total as opposed to just U.S. Ford and Lincoln, we had about 400,000 &#x2013; 408,000 terminations in 2010. This year we're only going to have about 240,000 terminations just because of the lower amount of leases in '08 and '09.</p>
          <p>Next year, those terminations fall even further, down another 50% or so, to about 110,000. So that's a function of the number of leases being placed in the market. And on top of that, the customer has the choice at the end of those leases on whether or not they want to keep them or return them to us, and that's going to be function of the used car values. And so what we're seeing as these used car values continue at kind of historically high levels, a lot more customers are choosing to keep those vehicles. So you're seeing that return rate for this quarter come down even lower, down to 48% for U.S. Ford and Lincoln vehicles. So those are the two aspects that are driving it; so it's lower number of absolute level of leases and higher auction values.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So given what you said about used car values, probably that ratio is going to go up over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our historical return rate is about 70% and it's going to, as used car prices go up higher than people's expectations, the return rates going to be lower and vice versa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question back on to our keen hedging, does that suggest the math is that if commodity prices that you hedge remain the same, you will &#x2013; that 350 would reverse next year and you'd get a further benefit in overall commodity costs? Does the math work that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the commodity prices stay the same as they were at the end of the third quarter, over the next 18 to 24 months, which is the period of time that we hedge, those would roll back. So as the hedges amortize, that mark comes back to income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But since you put on the hedges against higher prices and you've taken a charge because those didn't materialize, that also would suggest, aside from the roll-off, that commodities prices would actually go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and we don't hedge 100% of our exposure so commodity prices going down is a good thing.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. On the first call, there seemed to be some confusion regarding margins for the full-year outlook. If we go back and look at your second quarter guidance, you were &#x2013; for structural and commodity costs, you were guiding to about $4 billion higher for the year. Now that's about 3.8 and margins are obviously 5.7% versus the 6.1% or higher that you were guiding to on 2Q. Can you just walk us through what really has changed here and if there was any assumption after 2Q regarding the UAW bonus payout in your margin numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, we originally guided to &#x2013; if you go all the way back to the beginning of the year to a margin that would be equal to or better than last year, which was 6.1%. And as the year has progressed, at least versus our expectations, we have seen much higher commodity costs than what we had expected and so we've been working internally to offset that and thought we had that largely in the box. But with this last sort of hit that we took of about $350 million of commodity hedging losses and given the fact we're getting closer to the end of the year, we believe that we just won't have the time to offset that new news.</p>
          <p>Part of the abil &#x2013; the way we were going to be able to achieve that despite the fact that they were commodity costs higher than what we had expected was we had seen some back-off, if you will, of where we thought commodities were three, four, five, six months ago. But now with this commodity hedge loss impact, it's caused us to have to take the outlook down to 5.7% and that difference between the 5.7% and 6.1% is not quite, but nearly entirely explained by what happened in the latter part of September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm just a little confused, though, because I understand the commodity portion, including hedging, has gone up. I mean you were guiding to $2 billion, now it's $2.2 billion, but structural costs forecast has gone down by $400 million. So net-net, you're actually better by $200 million. So &#x2013; and you were guiding on 2Q that margins would be 6.1% or better. I guess given that the structural &#x2013; the net of the structural and commodities have come down it still doesn't quite &#x2013; doesn't fit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, because as you know, I mean there's all sorts of different things that go into margins. The revenue, the other contribution cost elements, warranty, freight, material costs other than commodities, structural costs, all of that and even other income and expense. So we were able to manage the combination of all those things such that at the time that we were in the market sort of in September, I think Louis and myself, both were at some conferences and we were pretty satisfied that all of those factors and the way that we were managing them would have enabled us to at least get to the 6.1% equal year-over-year.</p>
          <p>And then in the last part of September with the commodity hedging loss adjustment of the 350 and looking at what we see for the balance of the year and the amount of time that we have, we just felt that we needed to guide to a slightly lower number, because we're running out of time to offset these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. One last occasion was &#x2013; back in your previous guidance, did you assume anything for the UAW bonus payout that's going to hit in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We obviously in our plan have assumptions around the &#x2013; what we thought the contract would have meant in terms of financial impact but I wouldn't share that with you in terms of how that compares with the actual contract. We're very, very pleased with the contract because we do believe that it's very competitive and as we said last week, the impact on our cost is very, very small with 1% per year. So we're very, very pleased with the outcome of the contract.</p>
