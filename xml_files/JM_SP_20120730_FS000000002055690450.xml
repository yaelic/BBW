        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, nice to see you here. Thank you for coming. I'm going to do the usual, which is a relatively formal presentation, and then open the floor to you for questions. So, do feel free to ask such questions as you want however formal the presentation beforehand may have been.</p>
          <p>I'm James Riley, for those of you who don't know, the Group Finance Director, and I'll give you an overview of the group's performance for the first six months of 2012. Firstly, just to remind you of the structure of Jardine Matheson, although I'm sure most of you are familiar with this. Jardine Pacific, Jardine Motors and Jardine Lloyd Thompson and Jardine Strategic are held directly by Jardine Matheson. Jardine Strategic then holds direct interests in Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental, and Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, through which the 50% interest in Astra is held. In addition to these holdings, Jardine Strategic holds a 55.1% interest in its parent Jardine Matheson, which has increased from 54.8% at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the immediate interest held in each of the group companies, the effective economic interest that represents for JMH from an accounting perspective and the share of profit which each &#x2013; which came from each of our group companies in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>A couple of definitional points before I get into the results. The group uses underlying profit attributable to shareholders as its key earnings performance measure, and to keep things simple, I'll refer to this as underlying profit. This measure, as you know, excludes non-trading items, which we identify and explain separately in order to provide you with a clearer understanding of the ongoing business performance of the group. And you should also note that any dollar figures mentioned will be U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>When we last met in this forum in March, we talked about the uncertainty facing the global economy, and I think you would agree that uncertainty continues. Against that background then, I think the first half has seen a mixed performance from our various group businesses. Jardine Matheson's underlying profit for the first six months of 2012 was $714 million, 1% below the same period in 2011. And underlying earnings per share were down 2% at $1.97.</p>
          <p>The group's revenue, including 100% of the revenue from associates and joint ventures, was $30.3 billion compared to $27.4 billion in the first half of 2011. Non-trading gains in the first half totaled $71 million and included a modest uplift in investment property values in Hongkong Land, offset by the loss on the restructuring and partial sale of the group's interest in Rothschild Continuation Holdings. This compares with non-trading gains of $1.477 billion in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>The group's strong financial position has enabled the board to declare an increased interim dividend of $0.35 a share, an increase of 6%. Before discussing the results in more detail, I'd just like to highlight some of the key developments within the group during the first half. Hongkong Land is progressing well on a number of developments across the region. In Singapore, it has completed the third office tower in Marina Bay Financial Centre, which is now Singapore's largest integrated mixed-used development in the new downtown area with 3 million square feet of prime Grade A office space; and in Jakarta, its joint venture development of a fourth office tower is also nearing completion.</p>
          <p>In Beijing, Hongkong Land is now in the planning stage for its first prime commercial site in Wangfujing which is being developed as a prime retail center incorporating a small luxury hotel. Also in Beijing, Hongkong Land has increased to 30% its interest in a prime Grade A office building development of some 120,000 square meters to be built in the CBD core area of the Chaoyang District.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm is expanding its portfolio of operations into new markets. In Cambodia, it acquired a 70% interest in the Lucky Supermarket chain, which own five stores in Phnom Penh and one store in Siem Reap. In the Philippines, it acquired a 50% interest in Rustan Supercenters through a 50/50 joint venture partner with the Tantoco family. Rustan operates 10 hypermarkets and nine supermarkets under the Shopwise brand as well as 13 Rustan supermarkets.</p>
          <p>Another development has been Dairy Farm's Indonesian subsidiary, PT Hero, obtaining the franchise right to operate IKEA home furnishings stores in Indonesia. The first store is expected to open in 2014 in Tangerang, West Jakarta.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental announced four new management contracts in the period: one for an existing property in Atlanta, our new developments in Bodrum, Marrakech and Chengdu. This gives the group 45 hotels in operation or under development around the world. Within the next 18 months, new hotels are scheduled to open in Guangzhou, Taipei, Shanghai and Milan.</p>
          <p>At Astra, investment is being made in new automotive plant to meet increased demand. Astra Daihatsu Motor will boost annual production capacity to 430,000 vehicles, up from 330,000. While the fourth major cycle plant, Astra Honda Motor, will boost annual production by 1.1 million units.</p>
          <p>JEC acquired Thermal Private Limited, a specialist air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation engineering contractor in Singapore, while Zung Fu is maintaining its momentum with development plans to expand its Mercedes-Benz outlets in China from 25 to over 30 in the near future.</p>
          <p>Finally, in June, consequent on the reconstructuring of the Rothschild Group, Jardine Strategic exchanged its 21% interest in Rothschild Continuation Holdings for 12% interest in Paris Orl&#xE9;ans, the listed French holding company of the enlarged group. Subsequently, Jardine Strategic sold slightly under half of its holding, leaving it with an interest of some 6%. This remaining interest will be dividend accounted in the future.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to the financial results in more detail. The group's revenue including associates over the period increased by 10% year-on-year to $30.3 billion as with last year, the largest revenue contributors were Astra and Dairy Farm. Hongkong Land's revenues were lower due to the reduction in residential completion.</p>
          <p>Now to underlying profit where the picture was somewhat mixed. On the positive side, there was strong growth from both Astra and Dairy Farm with the Astra growth being rather higher when it is viewed in rupiah terms. In addition, JLT performed well, and its contribution was enhanced by the increase in the group shareholder. On the negative side, the lower contribution from Jardine Motors was mainly due to difficult trading conditions in Mainland China. Hongkong Land's contribution was well down as we warned it would be at the time of the 2011 results presentation. And Mandarin Oriental and Jardine Pacific's contribution were also down.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I should mention the corporate line which includes the central costs and financing income and charges for Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic and Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage and income from smaller group investment. The net costs in this line has increased reflecting increased central costs. Overall, therefore, the individual results I have mentioned were a little mixed, but the total underlying results showed little change, 1% below the same period in 2011.</p>
          <p>Non-trading items for the half year totaled a profit of $71 million, the major component of this arose from an upward revaluation of Hongkong Land's investment property portfolio, which net of a deferred tax charge resulted in $127 million gain. However, it was offset by the loss of $56 million on the restructuring of Rotshchilds and subsequent partial sale.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to take you through the individual operating businesses before returning to the balance sheet and the outlook for the second half.</p>
          <p>First, the businesses we group as Jardine Pacific. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, the largest of Jardine Pacific's interests, where cargo throughput was in line with last year but profits were down due mainly to higher staff costs and depreciation charges on the new cargo management IT system.</p>
          <p>Jardine Schindler generated higher volumes and margins in existing installations, partly offset by higher operating costs. Jardine Restaurants' Pizza Hut operations in Hong Kong achieved good sales growth and higher profits, but this was more than offset by reduced year-on-year results from its Pizza Hut and KFC franchises in Taiwan. The group's restaurant interest in Vietnam remains small but are making good progress.</p>
          <p>JEC obtained a higher contribution from Trane Thailand, whilst its wholly-owned units were hedged due to higher sales and margins in Hong Kong and the Philippines. The acquisition of Thermal completed at the end of February contributed a break-even result.</p>
          <p>Gammon's earnings improved significantly in the absence of the provision we'd been having to make for problem projects in past periods, and its order book increased further to $3.5 billion. JOS recorded lower earnings, primarily in Singapore, where exceptionally strong profits made from certain products sold through the newly acquired SiS network could not be repeated.</p>
          <p>Both Jardine Shipping Services and Jardine Aviation Services struggled to make money in the difficult shipping and aviation markets. And overall, therefore, Jardine Pacific's underlying profit for the first half of 2012 was $70 million, 6% lower than in the corresponding period.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Jardine Motors, which recorded an underlying profit of $5 million, a reduction of 86%. The decline, as I've mentioned, was mainly due to losses in Mainland China arising from a combination of factors. Our principal Mercedes-Benz and their local partners have been keen to grow market share in the China market, where Mercedes currently lags its traditional competitors. This focus on volume at a time when a number of its major models are towards the end of their life cycle has seen increasing price discounting, and combined with the need to reduce stock levels, resulted in margins being sharply lower. We believe all Mercedes dealers in China are experiencing similar pressures, and are hopeful that there will be less of a push for volume at any cost in the future. The issue is not yet resolved and is receiving significant management attention, but Zung Fu, which now has 25 outlets in Southern China still has a further six under development. And this expansion will be continued for the time being, although of course, it will be kept under review in the light of the poor operating results.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong and Macau, profits were flat, with higher deliveries of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and a strong order book. The dealership network in the United Kingdom achieved a better performance in the first half with higher vehicle sales.</p>
          <p>At Jardine Lloyd Thompson, business gains and disciplined cost control enabled the company to produce another satisfactory performance for the first half of 2012, notwithstanding a weak insurance rating environment and a challenging economic background. JLT announced an increase in its underlying profit of 12% to &#xA3;63 million. The good performance, combined with Jardine Matheson's increased shareholding, meant that JLT's contribution to the group in the first half underlying profit increased by 45% to $41 million.</p>
          <p>JLT's specialist risk and insurance operations achieved a good result for the first half of the year, particularly in emerging markets and reinsurance. Underlying trading profit in sterling rose 14% to &#xA3;80 million, and trading margin improved from 23% to 24%. The employee benefits business, which now has a more international reach, recorded a 7% increase in trading profit with an unchanged trading margin of 19%.</p>
          <p>That completes my review of the businesses held directly under Jardine Matheson. I'll now turn to Jardine Strategic which achieved underlying profits of $769 million, an increase of 1% from the same period in 2011. The board has improved an interim dividend of $0.07 per share, an increase of 8% from last year. The net asset value per share we show for Jardine Strategic is calculated by reference to the market value of the underlying investments held by the entity. And as of June, this was $51.76, up 7% from the 31st of December.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2012, the Hongkong Land's underlying profit was 13% lower at $318 million. And improved earnings from its commercial properties were offset by a decrease in residential development profits. Despite the Hong Kong market being subdued, rental reversions in the group's central office portfolio were generally positive and vacancy at the end of June was 3.1%. Its luxury retail portfolio remained fully let, and it was principally responsible for the uplift in property valuations at the half year.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, the office portfolio was almost fully leased, with the exception of the recently completed third office tower of Marina Bay Financial Centre, which is some 70% committed. In Jakarta, the group's joint venture development fourth office tower is nearing completion and is 88% pre-let. In Wangfujing in Beijing, planning is progressing on Hongkong Land's first significant commercial project on the Mainland.</p>
          <p>In the residential sector, 18 additional apartments of the Serenade in Hong Kong were sold, of which eight were handed over to buyers. In Singapore, MCL Land had no residential projects complete during the period, although two projects are now expected to complete in the second half. A recent sales launch of a new project by MCL Land was well received and of its six previously launched projects under construction, all but one are fully sold.</p>
          <p>In Mainland China, the 50% held Bamboo Grove in Chongqing, a further 474 units have been handed over to buyers since the beginning of the year with some 250 units scheduled for the second half. In the next phase, due for completion later in 2012, 69% of the 640 units have been pre-sold. Sales also continued at other projects in Chongqing and Shenyang and at Maple Place in Beijing.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm continued to trade well with sales including 100% of associates increasing by 10% to $5.5 billion in the first six months of 2012. Underlying net profit grew 12% to $243 million. There were good results from its retail operations in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In Mainland China, 7-Eleven produced improved sales, and further resources are being made available to support the development of the Mannings health and beauty chain.</p>
          <p>Restaurant associate Maxim's produced a good first half results in Hong Kong as well as improved performances from its cake shops in Southern China. In Malaysia, the Giant hypermarkets and supermarkets made a steady contribution, and there was a good result again from the Guardian health and beauty chain. Profits in Singapore were a little changed while in Indonesia, there were impressive increases in both sales and profits from all formats.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental's underlying profit for the period was $29 million compared to $33 million in the same period in 2011, which had benefited from a $16 million of branding fees partially offset by $11 million of pre-opening expenses for its Paris hotel. Mandarin Oriental's Asian hotels performed well in the first half of 2012 with improved performance in most properties. And Tokyo continued to recover from the impact of last year's natural disasters.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult market conditions in Europe, resilient demand from the leisure sector helped compensate for the reduced corporate business. While in North America, the group's overall performance saw some improvement.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's underlying profit attributable to shareholders was up 5% at $511 million. Astra's contribution to underlying profits rose 6% to $518 million, as its good overall growth was partly offset by the weakening of the rupiah. The underlying profit from Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's other major interests grew by 12% to $31 million. The market in Singapore contracted due to the low government pressure on new vehicle sales, although the profit from the group's motor operations rose following good performances from Mercedes-Benz and used cars.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, Tunas Ridean's earnings improved, but Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang in Malaysia reported a lower profit in the face of intense competition in the luxury car market. In Vietnam, Truong Hai Auto Corporation's contribution fell due to a 28% decline in unit sales and higher interest expenses in a much weaker market.</p>
          <p>Astra benefited from strong results from its motor car and heavy equipment businesses, which more than offset the lower contribution from its agribusiness and motorcycle businesses, which reported a 13% increase in net rupiah profit under Indonesian Accounting Standard for the period. Astra's contribution from its automotive interests was 14% higher in the first half of 2012. Astra's car sales rose by 32% to 302,000 units during the period, representing a market share of 56% compared to 55% in the first half of last year. As the Indonesian wholesale market for cars grew by 28%, this enabled the profitability of the four-wheeler business, particularly on the retail side to grow strongly. In contrast, the wholesale market for motorcycles declined by 9% to 3.7 million units, while Astra Honda Motors motorcycle sales improved slightly to 2.1 million units, with its market share increasing from 52% to 57%. Overall, the profitability of the motorcycle operations was down somewhat.</p>
          <p>June 2012, the new minimum downpayment regulations governing loans in the automotive sector in Indonesia became effective. Whilst these could have an adverse impact on automotive sales in the second half of the year, we're hopeful that the impact on four wheelers will be slight and that for two wheelers will be confined to the lower cost end of the market.</p>
          <p>Astra's financial services interests produced a 1% increase in contribution to profit. The amount financed through Astra's automotive-focused consumer finance operations grew by 10%, while the amount financed through its heavy equipment-focused finance operations grew by 32%. Default rates experienced by Astra's finance companies during the period remained fairly stable.</p>
          <p>Group insurance company, Asuransi Astra Buana, saw lower earnings despite strong growth in gross written premiums, due to higher commissions and claims expenses. Bank Permata saw net income rise 1% with growth in net interest income and fee based income partly offset by higher operating costs.</p>
          <p>The contribution from agribusiness recorded a 29% decrease. Astra Agro Lestari's palm oil production increased by 7% to a 636,000 tonnes, and total sales value increased by 7%. But average crude palm oil prices achieved were 2% lower, and the net income was affected by higher cost of production and operating expenses.</p>
          <p>United Tractors produced good results. In the construction machinery sector, unit sales of Komatsu heavy equipment declined 2% to 4,230 units in the face of competition from supply redirected to Indonesia from the Chinese market. Net revenues increased by 9%, however, due to the sales mix, price increases and strong after-sales revenues. Additional capacity enabled contract coal mining subsidiary, Pamapersada Nusantara, to achieve a 31% increase in net revenues with an increase in contract overburden removal. United Tractors' mining subsidiaries, which own eight coal mines, six of which are in development, sold 3 million tonnes of coal during the period, an increase of 38%, but a decline in prices and an increase in fuel costs impacted earnings.</p>
          <p>The contribution from infrastructure and logistics fell by 15% as the first half of 2011 benefited from the reversal of a tax provision. Astra's infrastructure interests produced improved results and its toll road near Surabaya, acquired in the third quarter of 2011, is planned to complete next year. Elsewhere, its car rental business produced improved returns as did Astra Graphia.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I should mention our other interests held under Jardine Strategic. There has been no major change in these holdings during the period except the restructuring of our Rothschild interests which I mentioned earlier. This restructuring left the group with an interest of some 6% in Paris Orl&#xE9;ans, and income for all of these investments will only be recognized when dividends are received.</p>
          <p>Now to the balance sheet and cash position of the group. The group's total equity has increased by 3% to $40 billion. Shareholders' funds also increased by 3% to $17 billion. The increase in shareholders' funds was primarily attributable to the group's retained net profit over the period. This contributed to a 3% increase in net asset value per share, which stood at $46.22 at the end of June.</p>
          <p>The group's net debt, excluding financial services companies, was $3.7 billion at the end of June, representing gearing of 9%. This is up from $2.4 billion at the end of December. The biggest net borrower within the group is Hongkong Land, with both Jardine Pacific, Jardine Motors and Mandarin Oriental also net borrowers. Only Dairy Farm of the operating companies had substantial net cash balances at the end of the period. The net debt relating to Astra's financial services companies also increased during the period, reflecting the continuing growth of Astra's motor sales operations.</p>
          <p>At the Jardine Matheson corporate level, we had net debt of $14 million at the 30th of June, improved from a net debt position of $130 million at the end of December. Jardine Strategic itself generated strong net dividend inflow for the period, creating a net cash position at the end of June of $550 million, up from $250 million at the 31st of December.</p>
          <p>Jardine Matheson, remember, takes its dividend from Jardine Strategic in cash, whereas Jardine Strategic takes its Jardine Matheson dividend in scrip. Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage's corporate net debt was $66 million, but this has since being turned into net cash as a result of the sale of an investment announced last week for $135 million.</p>
          <p>As we look to prospects for the second half, trading conditions for the group's businesses in Asia are mixed, and the businesses themselves remained relatively resilient. On the positive side, consumer confidence in Indonesia appears to be steady. Dairy Farm continues to achieve positive like-for-like sales in most of its markets. The shortage of supply in the Hong Kong commercial property market is supporting rental rates, and the prospects for residential property profit recognition are more positive than we anticipated at the end of last year. Against this, problematic global economic conditions make any positive comments for the future dangerous and make hopes of high levels of growth unrealistic. Any weakness in the rupiah or in commodity prices could impact our earnings from Indonesia. Ongoing government measures to restrain residential property markets likely put a damper on earnings from this segment in the medium term, although in the short-term, a significant demand to profit has been locked in. And the difficult trading conditions for our motor businesses in China remain, although we are hoping for some improvement in their performance. Put all of this together and our expectation is the group will be able to maintain its performance over the full year.</p>
          <p>The group, as I hope you will agree, remains well financed with a sound balance sheet and is in a strong position to continue to make good headway. That concludes the formal part of this presentation.</p>
