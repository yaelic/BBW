          <p>Good day and welcome to today's Fourth Quarter Earnings 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Mr. John Elicker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead Mr. Elicker.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Cindy, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us on the call. We're here this morning to review our fourth quarter results and as well as our full year results. Joining me on the call are Jim Cornelius, our Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Bonfield, our Chief Financial Officer, Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer, and Lamberto Andreotti, Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we get started and I turn it over to Jim and Andrew for prepared remarks. Let me just take care of some of the legal requirements. During the call, we may make various remarks about the Company's future expectations, plans, and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Periodic Reports on 10-Q. These documents are available from the SEC, the BMS website, or from Bristol-Myers' Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>In addition, any forward looking statements represent our estimates, only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John and good morning everyone. I'm going to make a few remarks about our financial performance last quarter and last year as well as our outlook through 2010. I'll also provide some context for the major financial impacts of last quarter and how they fit into our transformation to a Next Generation BioPharma company.</p>
          <p>From an operating standpoint our fourth quarter performance brought a strong conclusion to a good year. The 33% Q4 '07 reported revenue growth is really a 13% sales growth when you exclude the estimated impact of the launch of generic clopidogrel in 2006. We achieved this growth through excellent marketplace execution on our key products. From an accounting standpoint, of course we had to adjust earnings for four distinct and significant financial items. Three of these expected items stem from activities that directly support our BioPharma strategy. And each of these items I think was well flagged during our December Investors' Meeting.</p>
          <p>The fourth was not planned and resulted from an impairment related to our short-term investment portfolio, which unfortunately reflects the state of the global credit markets. Excluding these four items, the Company earned $0.35 and that exceeds the top end of our recent guidance range for the quarter and $0.01 ahead of the consensus analyst estimates for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I am going to touch on each of the four special items briefly. First, the sale of Medical Imaging, which we completed earlier this month, supports our strategy to actively manage our mix of products and businesses to better focus on specialty and biologic medicines. Following GAAP accounting procedures, we reported Medical Imaging as a single line discontinued operation, which had contributed earnings per share of $0.02 in the fourth quarter and $0.10 for the full year.</p>
          <p>Second, our October purchase of Adnexus Therapeutics supports our business development strategy to expand our biologics capabilities and pipeline. Internally, we call this strategy the string of pearls. It's as we look at potential acquisitions that can fuel our future growth. As part of the Adnexus acquisition, we recorded a one-time in-process research and development charge of 230 million that reduced our GAAP EPS by $0.12 last quarter.</p>
          <p>Third, we are right on track to achieve 1.5 billion in cost savings and cost avoidance by 2010 as part of our productivity transformation initiative. This collection of company-wide efforts is making us more nimble and flexible and better able to execute our Next Generation BioPharma strategy. We continue to streamline corporate and support functions, rationalize manufacturing, and better position our global supply network. For example, we announced last quarter the impending closure of two of our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Our productivity efforts further reduced GAAP EPS by $0.12 in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The fourth financial item, which accounts for $0.14 off our GAAP EPS, was due to an impairment of some of our short-term investments. The global credit crisis has impacted a small portion of our short-term investment portfolio. Our CFO, Andrew Bonfield, will provide more details on this in just a moment. At this point, it's important to emphasize that this situation with our short-term investments will not affect in any significant way the Company's liquidity or financial flexibility. The Company has more than enough cash to fund the strategy, and we expect stronger operating cash flows from the business to fund the higher dividend we are delivering to investors.</p>
          <p>Our Company is now at the beginning of a growth cycle as evidenced by the strong underlying operating momentum in the fourth quarter and for the year. We continue to realize solid gains from our key products and franchises that treat cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders and viral illnesses. In particular, PLAVIX grew by 13% when adjusted for the negative impact the competition from generic clopidogrel in 2006. ABILIFY grew by 28% in the quarter, sales of REYATAZ, which is part of our very successful virology franchise, increased 31% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Among the commercial successes driving our growth were several from our newer specialty and biologics medicines. We are pleased with the initial market uptick for IXEMPRA, which we just launched in October and ORENCIA's U.S. sales are strong as were SPRYCEL's oversea sales. Our life cycle development strategy to build pipelines within our products bore fruit in November when we gained approval to market ABILIFY as an add-on treatment to antidepressant therapy in adults with major depression.</p>
          <p>Our R&amp;D organization continues to advance our pipeline. We remain on track to submit Saxagliptin by the middle of this year, and we plan to present additional data at ADA this year. At ASCO, we expect a strong showing with new clinical data on SPRYCEL, IXEMPRA and ERBITUX. Strategically, we are executing our plan to emphasize specialty and biologics medicines. Just as we sold Medical Imaging and purchased Adnexus, we remain open to opportunities for possible alliances, partnerships, external acquisitions and other business arrangements that enhance our ability to make important medicines that help patients prevail against serious disease. Among our employees, the productivity transformation I described is inspiring a culture of continuous improvement.</p>
          <p>In light of our strong product growth, promising pipeline, and progress executing our strategy, we maintain a positive outlook. For this reason, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS growth average of at least 15% through 2010 from the 2000 base year subject to the same assumptions as we explained in December.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening. I'd now like to turn the call over to Andrew for a more detailed review of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jim. I will discuss our fourth quarter results and guidance before we go to your questions. As you have seen from our release, we recorded a loss from continuing operations of $0.07 per share for the quarter, which includes the impact from specified items and the sale of Medical Imaging now recorded as a discontinued operation. Adjusting for specified items and Medical Imaging, fully diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.35 for the quarter and $1.48 for the full year. This is above the top end of the range we guided you to in December.</p>
          <p>The full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share is posted on our website and I will discuss some of the specified items in more detail later on. Total Company sales from continuing operations were $5.4 billion up 33% or approximately 13% excluding the impact from generic clopidogrel in the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, we saw a 3% benefit from price and 5% benefit from foreign exchange and a 25% increase in volumes. Worldwide pharmaceutical sales excluding clopidogrel increased by 13% to 4.4 billion reflecting the strong sales of key products and a 4% benefit from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Our Health Care Group generated sales of $1 billion up 9% including a 5% benefit from foreign exchange. This excludes Medical Imaging, which as I mentioned a moment ago is now recorded as a discontinued operation. Sales in our U.S. pharmaceutical business increased by an underlying 11 to 13% to $2.5 billion. Sales in our international pharmaceutical business increased by 16% to $1.9 billion including a 10% benefit from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Worldwide, recorded PLAVIX sales were $1.4 billion up 177%. U.S. sales for PLAVIX were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact from generic competition, global PLAVIX sales would have been up 10 to 15% in the quarter behind molecules script demand growth above 6% in the U.S. Script growth trends for all other key products were also strong, ABILIFY, REYATAZ, and the SUSTIVA franchise all had double-digit script and sales growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales for ABILIFY were up 23% in the U.S. behind 11% script growth and the timing of price increases. International sales were up almost 50% driven by continued growth across Europe and a 16% benefit from foreign exchange. Sales of REYATAZ in the U.S. were up 15% behind 12% script growth. International sales increased by 52%. SUSTIVA franchise sales were up 17% globally behind the strong performance of ATRIPLA. ORENCIA generated sales of $75 million and U.S. sales were up 16% compared to the third quarter. Global SPRYCEL sales were $56 million including another strong quarter in Europe. BARACLUDE generated $99 million in global sales.</p>
          <p>International markets are performing well with sales just up $17 million for the quarter. IXEMPRA just launched in the U.S. generated sales of $15 million. Excluding specified items, the gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 68.7% due to the positive impact from strong sales of PLAVIX, our virology business, ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and BARACLUDE. Compared to the third quarter the gross margin increased by 40 basis points. Positive mix in our pharmaceutical business was partially offset by lower margins in the Health Care Group. The gross margin in the pharmaceutical business was 70.4% up 80 basis points from the third quarter. Gross margin for Mead Johnson was 61.9% down 140 basis points from the third quarter primarily due to unfavorable dairy prices.</p>
          <p>ConvaTec gross margins were 69% up 20 basis points from the third quarter. Marketing, selling and administration expenses increased by 4% for the quarter, mostly due to foreign exchange. Advertising and promotion spend increased by 16%. This reflects increased investment in PLAVIX, ABILIFY and ORENCIA DTC advertising and spending behind the IXEMPRA launch. Excluding specified items, research and development expense for the quarter increased 20% to $903 million. This reflects higher development spending, increased investment in science and medical personnel as well as field medical support. The effective tax rate from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes and excluding specified items was 22% and the full year rate was 20% which was in line with our previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased to $4 billion from $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter reflecting the impact from the Adnexus acquisition and the reclassification of auction rate securities to non-current assets. We did have a significant impact from specified items and discontinued operations this quarter. Three of these as Jim mentioned were previously identified. First, Medical Imaging, now a discontinued operation would have contributed $0.02 for the quarter and $0.10 for the full year. Second, the acquisition of Adnexus resulted in an in-process R&amp;D charge of $230 million. Third, we recorded a charge of $292 million related to the execution of our productivity initiative. This reflects the pending closures of several manufacturing facilities including two sites in Puerto Rico.</p>
          <p>Let me discuss the fourth item, the impairment charge related to our investments in auction rate securities, which have no impact on our financial flexibility. For nearly a decade, the Company has maintained a portfolio of auction rate securities, classified as marketable securities on the balance sheet. Whilst these securities have a long-term maturity they have been treated as short-term investments due to the ability to sell them at monthly auctions. Auction rate securities are structured with a variety of different asset types. The auction rate securities remaining in our portfolio at the end of the year include collateralized debt obligations, mortgages, corporate bonds and insurance securitizations, which were packaged as AAA/Aaa securities. BMS investments in this market have always traded at or near par value and have never had any liquidity issues. For the Company's investment policy we have historically only invested in AAA rated securities.</p>
          <p>During the latter part of 2007 due to the uncertainties in the credit markets some of these securities were not able to be sold at auctions and the sponsoring brokers did not make a market in the ARS securities. The third party evaluation models we have used amongst other factors have led to the 275 million in permanent impairment charge. I would like to note that there have been no defaults on interest or principal payments to-date and all of these securities currently retain at least one AAA rating.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to reaffirm that there will be no impact on our overall financial flexibility as we move forward. As you have seen in our press release, we are updating our full-year 2008 GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. Our GAAP guidance is now $1.36 to $1.46 per share reflecting the impact of Medical Imaging and our expectations related to the productivity initiative. We have changed our non-GAAP guidance to $1.60 to $1.70 per share. This change reflects the sale of Medical Imaging, which I have noted in our December investor meeting.</p>
          <p>Our line item guidance remains unchanged. As Jim mentioned, we are also confirming our three-year minimum 15% compound annual growth in earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis with 2007 being the base year. So in summary, our fourth quarter underlying operating performance was strong, key products, newly launched products and other healthcare businesses continue to perform well. The Company has entered into a period where we expect top line growth and improved operating leverage based on product mix and our productivity initiative. The strength of our business is reflected in our guidance for 2008 and our outlook through 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand up back to John for the question and answer session.</p>

          <p>Okay thanks Andrew. And now Cindy, I think we are ready to go to questions and just as a reminder, in addition to Jim and Andrew we have Lamberto and Elliott here for any questions you might have for them. Cindy, if we can go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we'll take our first question from David Risinger with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Looking forward in 2008 I was hoping that you could just run through the most exciting pipeline developments to watch from your perspective? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you David, this is Elliott. As you know, we are building out very important products that have made it to the market, to expand the label. So we're working significantly with ORENCIA and ERBITUX and SPRYCEL. We have data coming out this year on ORENCIA with regard to earlier treatment. In rheumatoid arthritis, we have hopefully an acceptance or approval in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. We have some exciting data on ERBITUX that you know we've all been following and presenting at ASCO in oncology data on ERBITUX and Ixabepalone. With regard to ERBITUX, I'm excited to talk about the data on lung cancer, we'll be working with health authorities with regard to earlier lines of treatment in colorectal cancer. With SPRYCEL we'll be presenting data on prostate cancer, we also have exciting trials going in breast cancer. We are working around the world on extending applications for ABILIFY, as well as ORENCIA. We will have some data at the ADA on both Saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. We will be filing Saxagliptin in the middle of the year as we outlined in December. We have Phase III data on Apixaban that will be described at the end of the year. We are also going to be getting some Phase II data on acute coronary syndrome.</p>
          <p>So, we are building out not only the marketed drugs with new indications and expanded opportunities in the future where they have already made it to market, but we will also be bringing the pipeline forward. In oncology, we are making a major play with ERBITUX. We will be talking about our data on Ipilimumab and we will have by the end of the year data on our transplant drug belatacept that we'll be reviewing internally and then be making a filing decision on that. So a lot of good momentum this year, earlier in the pipeline as I detailed December 5, I am excited about our progress in both hepatitis C and Alzheimer's, but that's earlier we will have more to say at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks David. Cindy we can go to the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Steve Scala from Cowen &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At the analyst meeting Bristol noted that top line data from the Saxagliptin renal study would be available in the second half of '08. AstraZeneca indicated on its call that this data was not on the critical path, but that does seem a bit unusual given the FDA's cautious posture. Do your recent conversations with FDA leave you completely confident that this data is not going to be necessary for filing around midyear? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think it might look confusing from the outside, but let me just point out. I can't possibly know the data that Novartis is looking at. I have heard of different safety issues; all I can say is I don't see that those safety issues in our clinical data on Saxagliptin. I will also say we worked very closely with health authorities around the world to make sure that they understand our filing strategy and that we satisfy them with regard to the exposure of the drugs under different conditions, and although we are still looking at our Phase III data, and I will add that caveat, I remain confident in our guidance we gave December 5, that we will be submitting in the middle of the year. So of course our partner AstraZeneca is saying the same thing.</p>
          <p>We have enough data on renal patients, we think, to advise how this medicine should be used. We haven't been asked for specifically any more data than what we planned to deliver. But we do have a practice of studying after we submit and after we have on the market more and more aspects of our drug, so that our physicians understand how to use it in a variety of situations, so that we can answer questions as deep as possible. And so the, we proactively initiated a renal study that will have data for, as you mentioned at the end of the year, beyond what we have already, but we plan to submit in the middle of this year, and that's all subject to perhaps ongoing data review, but I am confirming exactly what you asked me about.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Roopesh Patel with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew, I have a few questions related to the Company's exposure to subprime securities. So, if I understand correctly, there is $2.2 billion at the end of the year in cash and marketable securities. Separate from that, the Company had $811 million in auction rate securities, which you've written down. Can you give us a sense for how this $2.2 billion breaks out between cash and other short-term investments specifically CDOs and mortgages and whether or not there is any risk that you might have to basically impair the value of those? And then, just lastly, what is your interest, what is the interest rate that you are getting on the auction rate securities? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Roopesh. Let me try and give you an overview. The $2.2 billion that we had on our balance sheet at the end of the year was invested in money market funds, it was in bank time deposits, and there was $400 million of floating rate notes in that total. There was no exposure left of any auction rate securities and none of the underlying securities in the $2.2 billion have any exposure to subprime. Obviously, since we have gone through this review and impairment of auction rate securities, we have switched the portfolio and now at the &#x2013; as of today's date around about 60% of our cash on hand and cash and marketable securities is in T-bills and T-bill related funds that movement has been done.</p>
          <p>As we have seen the market fly to security, we have done the same thing. We have time deposits remaining on hand, which as those we keep looking at the bank counter party risk and will make decisions about what we do with our cash as those deposits mature. And then we have the $400 million of floating rate notes. On the auction rate securities the write-down, the $275 million is a permanent impairment, there was $117 million a temporary impairment note &#x2013; written down against other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. That is mainly due to liquidity issues. The auction rate notes that we have actually permanently impaired, we have written down significantly based on the third party valuations we have received. There is some remaining exposure obviously to subprime, but as I have noted none of those securities have yet defaulted in either interest or actually in principal.</p>
          <p>So obviously, we are hopeful that we will be able to realize at least what we have written them down to. The net balance on that balance sheet now shown in other non-current assets is around $400 million. Most of the $400 million actually relates to securities, which have a corporate bond or XXX insurance regulation securitization, which we don't expect to be affected by the current credit issues. So I think we've actually cleared out most of the exposure. We don't expect any further significant exposure, but obviously if the credit crisis continues to expand across the market, there may be risk to some of our corporate bond. So effectively, the 2.2 again just to reiterate there is nothing left in that related to auction rate securities, that is all cash and actually since the year-end we have added another $500 million to that with the receipt of the proceeds from Medical Imaging.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Roopesh. Can we go to the next question Cindy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Our next question will come from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Since your analyst meeting late last year, I have been trying to kind of think about what you will do with the proceeds from selling off or divesting the different divisions that you have that are currently profitable. And I guess, my question is, if you are going to pile those funds into unprofitable ventures like Adnexus it seems like that ends up dragging down your earnings in the intermediate term. But I'm wondering if that's the strategy you intend to do with an eye towards the long-term or really is the goal here to go more after profitable companies or nearly profitable companies and ventures? And then the second question is just on REYATAZ and the future performance of that product, how nervous should we be about that given that Merck's ISENTRESS has slowly been moving more from a salvage setting into a second land setting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on little more description on the string of pearls. So I think you've described it quite accurately. We have some very valuable brands, which are in their respective industries really extremely profitable. So if we are successful in selling them and paying the taxes then the objective is to find companies like Adnexus or possibly there are companies larger than Adnexus that have some current revenues and plug them in in support of the overall BioPharma strategy. So 2008 in a sense is a transition year as we execute that strategy. We have an obligation obviously to update our guidance should we have a successful sale, because we will be missing that revenue and earnings going forward. But hopefully wouldn't do this unless it's absolutely, absolutely in support of the future strategy, which calls for growth.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Lamberto about the Merck's launch, it is clear that out of the recent launches in HIV, the Merck launch is the one that we are monitoring more closely. We believe that their product is important, but we don't believe that it is very direct competition to our HIV franchise. The majority of their uptake will come from patients that reinitiate therapy after they run out of satisfactory treatment options or other highly treatment experienced patients and that we'll get it as add-on therapy.</p>
          <p>Obviously, they will continue their development in earlier lines of therapy where there will be more direct competition to both REYATAZ and SUSTIVA still we believe that we have solid, strong evidence on efficacy and resistant profile for REYATAZ to continue to grow it. The performance of REYATAZ in 2007 was very good. We increased the sales of REYATAZ versus prior year in the quarter by 31% and it if you take REYATAZ by the way, REYATAZ is by now the biggest protease inhibitor in the U.S. market. The &#x2013; if we combine REYATAZ and our SUSTIVA franchise, which include ATRIPLA, we can conclude that one out of two or more than 1 out of 2 patients on HIV treatment in the U.S. receive a Bristol-Myers Squibb product as a third party agent. So, we continue to work on REYATAZ, we have recently launched the new formulation, and we're confident of the strength of our product.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, this is Elliot, if I could just add to Lamberto's comment about our research efforts. Certainly, we're in a good position with very strong multiple medicines in a place where there are many combinations, as you see what we did with Gilead with ATRIPLA. We are looking at our different compounds and how they can be combined with things in our portfolio, and other people's portfolio. We hope to be saying more about that this year. So it's a very important strategy in the area where people take multiple medicines if you have a portfolio like we do, when new agents come out in different classes, it does present an opportunity, and we work on those as well as on the new mechanisms in this field.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim. Cindy, can we go to the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from John Boris with Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a couple of questions and thanks for taking them. Question for Jim, back to one that Tim Anderson had asked. Can you just give a little color on the demand for the assets, both the Nutritional and ConvaTec, and how you think about from a decision-making standpoint, the decision to sell, of course there's tax implications for a sale, relative to a joint venture or partnership. And I guess you have described this strategy of string of pearls being biologics, but if you were able to identify assets that were complementary to the small molecule side, you have got a great HIV franchise, as an example, now that you could bolt on there. Would you object to bolting on those types of assets in the small molecule side?</p>
          <p>Question for Elliot, just an update on the high dose PLAVIX trial. And then one for Lamberto on the launch of your antipsychotic in resistant depression on ABILIFY, just what the contribution of growth is and how that's rolling out and being accepted within the community? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me correct a misinterpretation of your understanding of string of pearls, we don't have any bias small molecule versus large; it's bias towards growth. The string of pearls strategy is moving forward with more concrete evidence and momentum inside the house, and I think we're pleased with negotiations, discussions that we're having with various companies. On ConvaTec sale, as I mentioned, it's extraordinary brand, highly profitable. We've taken a next step by officially putting an offering memorandum out, and I am not going to give the exact numbers but we have been overwhelmed by the early preliminary interest in buying ConvaTec from us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, this is Elliott. Also, let me just reiterate Jim's direction on the string of pearls, is to go after long-term growth and perhaps some short-term opportunities, of course. I don't think you will see an affinity for the type of deals like Adnexus, which is next-generation technology. You will see a focus of complementing our pipeline and our focus on unmet medical needs and where we need to present this Company in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With regard to your question on the current trial on PLAVIX also called OASIS 7, the same trial that we are doing with Sanofi-Aventis to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a PLAVIX LODINE dose of 600 mg followed by a short course of 150 milligrams and then 75 milligrams versus standard doses in the label of a Lodine dose of 300, maintenance of 75, in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI. The primary outcome of the study is a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke or MI of 30 days. Results are expected by the fall of 2008. We have been working very carefully with regard to the recruiting, and we understand that this is information that's &#x2013; that people are going to want to know with, to add to the large body of information on PLAVIX and deal appropriately with benefit risk in these patients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as ABILIFY is concerned, we are launching ABILIFY in the new indication of adjunctive treatment in depression in these very days. So, we do not believe that any of the growth that we have recorded for ABILIFY in the fourth quarter is related to that indication. We have a, with this indication we are entering a $10 billion market, the market for depression, where there is 40 to 60% not adequate response that is recorded by outside sources. We believe that we understand that already now there are approximately $1 billion of those $10 billion that come from atypical products like ABILIFY and the fact that we are present in that market &#x2013; in the market already with the other indications make us believe that presently we have approximately 100,000 patients and $200 million in sales. So, this is where the base from where we are starting, and we are obviously very excited of having the first indication ever for an antipsychotic, <mark type="inaudible" /> antipsychotic in this indication. We have restructured our sales force for ABILIFY and this has allowed us to have a much better coverage of the market. This has allowed us to add new 15,000 new physicians to our call list. And we believe that these are 15,000 new physicians that are important for the new indication.</p>
          <p>We are launching a very strong medical and educational and publication plan, and we will soon reach and educate patients. There are a lot of patients in the depression market that are unsatisfied with their present treatments and a proper communication to them, without them discussed their issues with their doctors, and we are making available to their doctors a good new product to prescribe. The overall performance of ABILIFY in the fourth quarter was good, I think it was good in both the U.S. and Europe, and as I said before, all that comes from the indications that we had received before. We have some additional indications coming for both the U.S. and Europe, and we are getting ready to launch both of them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a clarification on some of the investments again, has the investment policy been formally changed with regard to these types of investments and when does the temporary impairment become permanent, what are the triggers there? And then on a pipeline question, Ipilimumab, is a vaccine part of any of the regimens for the data that we expect to come out during 2008? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, the question on investment guidelines, we have always invested in AAA/Aaa securities and we will continue to invest in AAA/Aaa securities, this time being as far as possible T-bills rather than auction rate securities. So, yes they have been changed in that regard. On when does and what is the trigger for permanent versus temporary impairment? There are a number of factors has to be taken into account including the length of time the Company intends to hold the security the, whether there has been deterioration in credit quality? For those ones where &#x2013; for those bonds, where we have taken a temporary impairment, most of those had either a corporate bond backing or an insurance securitization backing, where we have not seen any credit deterioration as yet. That's why those impairments are seen as temporary, in other words there is liquidity issues in the market rather than actually underlying credit deterioration. Obviously, with those ones, which had &#x2013; those bonds, which are exposed to CDOs and subprime and residential mortgages where they have different layers of securitization. We obviously have said there is obviously credit deterioration in the market given the rate defaults on subprime mortgages, which will eventually have an impact on those bonds and so that's why we trigger the permanent impairment. And that's in line with FAS 115.</p>

          <p>Bert, this is Elliott Sigal. I don't anticipate the release of any data with regards to vaccines, in any registrational trials this year. We will be hopefully talking at ASCO this year on our monotherapy data for second line advanced melanoma with Ipilimumab and we will be seeing some data on the combination with the carbazine for first line advanced melanoma in the second half of 2008 and we haven't decided where those would be presented yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Just have two quick questions. First on ORENCIA, can you talk about the European rollout, any changes to strategy relative to the U.S launch either in terms of the segment of the market you're really targeting it on or the competitive agents you're focusing it on? And, then second can you just update us on the enrollment of the Apixaban AFIP studies please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, starting with ORENCIA in Europe, we had $6 million sales in Q4 four months is in line with our expectations. It is important to know that we do not have same label in Europe as in the U.S. and therefore it's a smaller target that we have there. We have reimbursement in all major European accounts with exception of the U.K. where we've a case open. We've nice in the rest of the European Union. We got prices comparable to those to that of the U.S. What, it's both countries but we are getting patients, 80% of our patients treated with ORENCIA in Europe are in the line after second T&amp;F and we have 20% of our sales coming from the first line.</p>
          <p>Going through the U.S., I think we are consolidating our plans and we are making them more aggressive and we see the results of this. We continue to focus on efficacy and durability. We have new data that allow us to focus upon those, and we continue to focus mostly on the IV market. Therefore, we are focusing on renegade. We have intensified our direct to consumer you may noted that we in November we launched a full DTC campaign, which seems to initially seems to be given positive results. And we have become more aggressive in our co-payers' systems program starting in October and the results as I said seem to be there. So, we have not changed our strategy. We continue to work according to the strategy we described in December and we start seeing the results from the intensification of our activities.</p>

          <p>Thanks Chris. Can we go to the next, oh I am sorry Elliot do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris had a question on Apixaban, I don't have a specific quantitative follow up, but qualitatively this program is off to great start. I really like the collaboration with Pfizer. We have two very expert excellent teams involved in this. I am pleased with the enrollment on atrial fibrillation, although it remains early days I will remind you that we have two studies in atrial fibrillation, one uses Warfarin as a comparator, the other uses aspirin. And those patients who can't tolerate or considered ineligible for Warfarin, this specifically is a very important area of unmet need and could expand the market. We have a very robust program as we've outlined it's being developed also for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis in both acute and chronic settings. So we'll first be out hopefully in the market with regard to the orthopedic market, the medical market for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and the chronic treatment of stroke prevention and atrial fibrillation. We will have Phase II data on acute coronary syndrome. We hope to target this some time in September of '08 for public discussion. We also have Phase III data for deep vein thrombosis prevention, which we hope to target for the ASH meeting American Society of Hematology in December of 2008.</p>

          <p>Cindy, can we go to the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Harlan Sonderling with Columbia Management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Andrew a question please on the ARS, can you tell me what the remaining, could you just give a some more detail on what the remaining liability is going to be beyond this $0.14 after-tax that you've taken today? What is your minimum and maximum that you're likely to report as a write-off in the future please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I indicated Harlan I think we've actually taken most of the impairment we expect as related to subprime mortgage and through related issues. The balance that we have on the balance sheet of $400 million, which is in non-current assets is mostly in insurance securitizations and other corporate bonds and we don't expect, you know sitting here today. There is no, unlikely to be any additional exposure, however obviously, if credit markets deteriorate and these sort of markets start having a problem, which we'll then be worried about broader things rather than just whether we're taking a charge but broader across the economy that would be when we actually took additional write-offs. So, unlikely to do anymore but obviously we have to be prepared to accept that if credit markets deteriorate there may be further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Harlan. And Cindy I think we have time for two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to ask another follow up question about the potential divestitures of the non-pharmaceutical businesses, just you know kind of bring it to a little bit more of a defined timeline here on the impact to the earnings and Jim if you think about the 2012 period where there is likely to be another patent cliff and something, let's say, more stable set of cash flows and earnings like the non-pharma businesses now, could be an important chunk of the earnings, how should we think about the balance between potentially trading off more volatility if you go for a string of pearls' strategy with any sort of proceeds from this versus being able to kind of think more about the unstability out in the period of the patent cliff? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So the whole strategy is driven by the patent cliff and a strong belief that the BioPharma strategy is the correct one for the Company. We obviously control the timing and whether we sell any or all of these assets. And so, we have two parallel activities, we've got the you know what do we expect to get from the various brands and at what time and that is concurrently running with the string of pearls active listing of companies and engagement and discussions about which companies fit which piece of our R&amp;D strategy, what areas do we need to complement, we are looking for adjacencies. We are looking for complementarity. So, could be and we said this in December that we don't sell any of them, but we have an active process underway, conscious decisions supported a 100% at the Board level to make this shift if it makes sense. To make sense we've got to have some things to buy and add as we did with Adnexus, which was a purchase of about $0.5 billion. It brought new people, potentially new product line, new capabilities and as we sit here today, the Adnexus acquisition couldn't be going better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim. I think Cindy we are going to go to our last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question today will come from Tony Butler with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much Jim, still on the same question that Jim Kelly and others had asked on the asset sale. You made a goal of 15% earnings through the end of the decade. You stated that in December and reiterated it today. Again, refresh my memory please on, is that based on having all of those assets, those three assets and an addition of pharmaceutical business within your umbrella and more importantly as you potentially sell those assets and earnings do change, do you think that 50% guidance actually goes higher and then the second question is just briefly around SPRYCEL, while you have had a label change to the 100 mg dose, the question is have you seen any change at the physician level based upon that dosing change at all? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the baseline assumption back in December based on the strategic planning that we had done at that time did include the various brands of the Health Care Group and you know, we will have to adjust that going forward if we were for example to sell all of them. We are quite conscious that the productivity initiative will contribute 1.5 billion, but we've already started Phase II of that. So, we are not sure what that will yield us, but we are going to have a continuous productivity effort round here and keep the 15% goal in front of all of our employees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as price is concerned the new dosing regimen of 100 milligram once daily was granted in Europe in September and in the U.S I believe a couple of months later. So, what we can say now is that we are only finally allowed to discuss with doctors, this important change and we believe that we will see some differences because this will allow to use SPRYCEL with similar efficacy and improved tolerability and the important section of the market &#x2013; is the one our chronic patient, this increase tolerability obviously is an important element that we'll facilitate the use in chronic patients.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well John, thank you. I appreciate all the questions and interest in our Company from my perspective couldn't be more pleased with the revenue results. I think all of you understand that revenue drives the business. So, some combination of the really good performance our sales people and their support teams are delivering along with as Elliot described. An unusually busy year on the clinical side suggests that all our goals can still be intact for 2008. I think Andrew has done a good job of fixing his organization, moving to a safer interpretation of what AAA means and we think we are in excellent position. The industry is going through some interesting and difficult times and we expect to be a winner in this industry. Thanks for your attendance today.</p>
