      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simone, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of BASF, I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2011 conference call. BASF had a powerful start into the year 2011. Global tailwind of continued economic growth boosted the demand for our products in all segments. As a result, BASF posted very strong sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>With me on the call today are Kurt Bock, our current CFO, who will take over as Chief Executive Officer of BASF today at the end of this Annual General Meeting; and Hans Engel, Member of the Board of Executive Directors who will become our new Chief Financial Officer. Kurt will summarize the key financial highlights and important milestones in the first quarter 2011. Subsequently, Hans will review the segment results in more detail. Kurt will then conclude with the outlook for 2011. Afterwards, both gentlemen will be happy to take your question.</p>
          <p>Today's conference call, ladies and gentlemen, will be limited to maximum of one hour since we have our Annual General Meeting which takes place right after this call. We have posted all the numbers and charts, which we'll discuss during the call, as well as the press document on our website, basf.com/share.</p>
          <p>And with this, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to hand the presentation over to Kurt Bock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Maggie, and also good morning from my side, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us. Global economic growth continued in the first quarter. BASF had an excellent start to the year, driven by ongoing strong demand and our ability to protect margins by passing on higher raw material costs. There was no significant impact on our business from the severe earthquake in Japan as well as the tense political situation in North Africa.</p>
          <p>In Q1, we increased sales by 25% to &#x20AC;19.4 billion compared with the first quarter of last year. Volumes rose by 5%; excluding oil and gas, volumes were up 9%. We were able to raise prices by 13% Cognis contributed six percentage points to sales growth.</p>
          <p>We reached an EBITDA of &#x20AC;3.4 billion, up 28%, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 17.4%. The earnings before special items came in at &#x20AC;2.7 billion, an increase of 40% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Special items of &#x20AC;182 million included in EBIT were mainly related to Cognis integration costs. The financial result included capital gain of &#x20AC;887 million from the sale of our stake in K+S. This gain was booked as a special item. We generated net income of &#x20AC;2.4 billion, lifting earnings per share to &#x20AC;2.62. Adjusted earnings per share came in at &#x20AC;1.94, mainly due to the one-time gain from the sale of our K+S stake.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we achieved important milestones. In March, our planned MDI facility in Chongqing was approved by the Chinese authorities. We've already started construction and we expect to finish the operational in 2014. It will be 100% BASF owned with an investment of about &#x20AC;860 million. MDI is a precursor for polyurethanes, and we expect polyurethane to grow faster than Chinese GDP over the coming years.</p>
          <p>To support our growth in China and the emerging markets, we are currently looking into further investment opportunities. With Sinopec and Petronas, we signed memoranda of understanding to explore further expansions of our joint Verbund sites in Nanjing and Malaysia respectively. In Brazil, we are evaluating new investments for acrylic acid, butyl acrylate and superabsorbent polymer.</p>
          <p>We also signed two Memoranda of Understanding in order to further strengthen our successful partnership with Gazprom. We will expand our gas production by jointly developing additional areas of the Achimov deposits of the Urengoy fields in Western Siberia. Furthermore, we intend to acquire a 15% stake in South Stream, which will support the growth of our gas trading business in Southeast Europe. In March, we announced plans to sell a major part of our fertilizer activities, which no longer fit with BSF's future strategic direction, and we also sold our, as mentioned before, 10.3% stake in K+S.</p>
          <p>With this, I will hand over to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kurt, and good morning also from my side. I will highlight the financial performance of the segments in more detail and focus on the business development in comparison to the first quarter of 2010. In the Chemical segment, we increased sales substantially due to ongoing high demand and price increases, which we implemented to offset high raw material costs. EBIT before special items reached a record level. In Petrochemicals, many of our product markets were still tight due to strong demand as well as planned and unplanned outages. We realized higher cracker margins in all regions. Acrylic supply remained very tight, resulting in significantly improved earnings. In Inorganics and intermediates, higher margins for ammonia and tight markets for butanediol and several amines supported our sales and earnings increase.</p>
          <p>In Plastics, we experienced strong demand in all product lines and achieved record earnings. In Performance Polymers, strong volume and positive pricing momentum, especially for caprolactam, drove sales growth. The Engineering Plastics business benefited from high demand from the automotive industry after the start-up of the Ecoflex plant in Ludwigshafen, sales of biodegradable plastics developed very well. As a result, EBIT before special items was up significantly. In Polyurethanes, higher demand, especially from the automotive and construction industries, resulted in increased sales and EBIT before special items. However, we have not yet been able to fully pass on higher feedstock costs in our sales prices.</p>
          <p>All divisions in the Performance Products segment except Paper Chemicals, posted a rise in sales, thanks to higher volumes and increased prices. Cognis contributed 29 percentage points to sales growth. EBIT before special items surpassed the earnings level of Q1 2010 by far, due to higher volumes and the excellent performance of the Cognis businesses. In addition, we realized cost synergies related to the Ciba acquisition and successfully repositioned the combined businesses. In Dispersion &amp; Pigments, sales increased significantly in all product lines. Demand for our pigments remain strong, particularly in Europe and Asia. EBIT before special items was clearly higher. In Care Chemicals, sales doubled mainly due to the integration of Cognis. Moreover, we experience strong demand for our hygiene products as well as for detergents and formulators. EBIT before special items improved sharply.</p>
          <p>Sales in Nutrition &amp; Health increased substantially, in part due to Cognis. We faced some price pressure, especially for Vitamin E. However, EBIT before special items matched last year's high level. In Paper Chemicals, despite the challenging business environment, we were able to increase prices. However, volumes were lower mainly due to our optimized product portfolio. EBIT before special items came in higher as the consistent implementation of our restructuring program is being off. In Performance Chemicals, sales and EBIT before special items increased substantially, thanks to strong demand, particularly from the automotive and refinery industries, as well as the inclusion of Cognis.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to give you a short update on the integration of Cognis, which is running at full speed. As you know, we have set ourselves ambitious targets. We want to achieve a 20% EBITDA margin in the Performance Products segment and make the Cognis acquisition accretive as of 2012. We expect one-time integration cost of &#x20AC;290 million until the end of 2013. An additional &#x20AC;120 million have been incurred from inventory step-ups. Of these costs, &#x20AC;80 million were already booked in 2010 and &#x20AC;158 million in the first quarter of 2011. On the other hand, we aim to generate &#x20AC;275 million of additional EBIT annually through growth and cost synergies. &#x20AC;135 million will come from growth synergies by the end of 2015. We will benefit from leveraging the joint customer base as well as extended solution and innovation capabilities. We aim to realize &#x20AC;140 million of cost synergies per year by the end of 2013. These are related to savings and procurement activities, the consolidation of administrative structures and the IT landscape, as well as the improvement of production efficiency.</p>
          <p>Volumes in the Functional Solutions segment were significantly higher, reflecting the global recovery of the automotive industry. Demand from the construction industry rose slightly, primarily owing to the robust building activity in emerging markets. EBIT before special items improved substantially. Catalysts' sales rose sharply, mainly attributable to higher volumes in mobile emissions and chemical catalysts as well as higher precious metal prices. As a result, our EBIT before special items came in far above the level of the previous year. Sales in Construction Chemicals grew slightly. We experienced a positive business development in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America, but North America remained challenging. Due to higher raw material and fixed cost, EBIT before special items did not match the previous year's level. In Coatings, the positive trend in demand continued for all product lines. However, raw material prices could not yet be fully passed on. As a result, EBIT before special items was only up slightly.</p>
          <p>Agricultural Solution started the new season successfully. Positive market conditions with higher soft commodity prices and the improved liquidity situation of farmers contributed favorably to sales and earnings performance. We achieved sales growth across all regions and indications. Our fungicide business in Europe and North America performed particularly well. The development of Kixor, our recently launched herbicide, is well on track. Despite strong overall demand there was price pressure on some herbicides in the North American market. Nevertheless, we have seen stable prices since last quarter.</p>
          <p>Sales in Oil &amp; Gas increased slightly, mainly due to higher oil and gas prices. EBIT before special items improved significantly. Sales in Exploration &amp; Production increased slightly. Higher oil prices with Brent averaging $105 per barrel compared to $76 in Q1 2010 compensated for lower oil production in Libya. End of February, we suspended our oil production in Libya. Nevertheless, earnings increased substantially driven by the higher oil prices.</p>
          <p>Since the winter in Europe was less severe compared to the first quarter 2010, volumes and natural gas trading decreased. However, gas sales were up as a result of higher gas sales prices. Earnings on the other hand decreased significantly as a result of lower demand and negative time lag effects. A look at the income statement shows that net income after taxed and minority interests rose by 12% to &#x20AC;306 million. Non-compensable oil production taxes amounted to $280 million.</p>
          <p>In Other, I would only like to highlight the positive business developments of Styrenics, which benefited from ongoing strong demand and higher prices. EBIT before special items in Other improved by &#x20AC;57 million.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand it back to Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Hans. And let me now briefly talk about our cash flow before we conclude with the outlook. Thanks to our strong business performance in the first quarter, we generated an excellent operating cash flow of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, up &#x20AC;900 million compared with Q1 of 2010. Despite improved business activities, cash tied up in net working capital decreased slightly by &#x20AC;260 million. This continues to demonstrate BASF's outstanding cash generating capability. Cash from investing activities was positive and amounted to &#x20AC;257 million. This included &#x20AC;917 million of proceeds from K+S disposal. CapEx came in at &#x20AC;547 million. As a result, we turned in a very strong free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the first quarter. From the beginning of 2011, we were able to reduce net debt by &#x20AC;2.4 billion to &#x20AC;11.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's come back to the outlook for 2011; what do we expect? We are increasing our Brent oil price forecast from $90 per barrel to $100 per barrel. We are assuming that the oil production in Libya will not restart during 2011. Based on this assumption, EBIT before special items on our Libyan oil production for the full year 2011 will be about &#x20AC;1 billion lower compared with 2010. However, as you all know, of these &#x20AC;1 billion about &#x20AC;700 million are non-compensable oil taxes.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2011, we still expect to generate significantly higher sales. Considering the suspension of the oil production in Libya, EBIT before special items &#x2013; now that's important, excluding non-compensable oil taxes provide a much more meaningful guidance for 2011. Thus, we aim to significantly exceed the 2010 EBIT before special items excluding non-compensable oil taxes, which amounted to 2.7 &#x2013; &#x20AC;7.2 billion. Finally, we are committed to our target to achieve a high premium on our cost of capital again in 2011.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention, and we are now happy to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much, Kurt and Hans. And now I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to post your questions. So we are opening the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time so that we can take as many questions as possible, and then of course you can always re-queue again and then we will take a second question. So with this, Simone, I'm handing back to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks; good morning &#x2013; for taking my question. It is on &#x2013; the guidance to me 100% sure here. Am I right that for the EBIT guidance the starting point is now &#x20AC;7.5 billion for 2010? You said a significant growth mean more than 10%, that means actually &#x20AC;7.871 billion is then for year 2011 guidance, and this is excluding already &#x20AC;280 million oil taxes, so when we add this &#x20AC;280 million oil taxes then the EBIT guidance, so to say, including oil taxes would then be &#x20AC;8.155 &#x2013; &#x20AC;8.151 billion at least for 2011, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Roediger, thanks for your question. It's very hard to understand what you said exactly. The starting point, which I mentioned in my little speech, was &#x20AC;7.2 billion, but I think you then added the non-compensable oil taxes in the correct way on top of that. What we tried to say, that we are still very, very optimistic for 2011 and the bottom-line is probably that our outlook today is slightly better than what we said at the end of February when we had our last conference call. So, things have changed a little bit because of the Libyan situation, as you know. So, the mathematics are a little bit more difficult.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have a question regarding the net working capital decrease. Why was that in the first quarter that you had a decrease of &#x20AC;260 million? Usually, that is a phase of increase in net working capital, not at least in this scenario where we have quite some inflationary effects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This time we had only a slight increase of receivables much lower than the accompanying sales increase. We had also a bigger increase than last year of payables and that is essentially explaining why we came in better than last year. And as I've said, we have &#x2013; we really try to push our businesses to further improve with regard to net working capital productivity there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that is then really achieved and we will not see tremendous change in the same quarter, so that is a structure improvement you achieved in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you all know, it's awfully difficult to forecast cash flows. We have &#x2013; I'm not aware of any, let's say, end of month &#x2013; end of quarter special effects, which we sometimes had, as you know, but we will see what happens in the second quarter of 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now &#x2013; our next question now comes from Rhian Tucker [Credit Suisse]. Good morning, Rhian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I'm sorry to focus on something a little bit negative in such a good set of results. I'm looking through the Others EBIT &#x2013; the Others division EBIT, and you had a strong improvement in the contribution from Styrenics and fertilizers not surprisingly. You had a less negative number from currency and hedging effect. And yet, the overall growth in EBIT was not that significant, it was only &#x20AC;40 million, &#x20AC;45 million. Can you explain what other effect was quite negative to cancel out those two positive effects, for me? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Rhian. Thanks for your question. There are two effects essentially. Again, we had higher costs of our long-term incentive program where we already booked a considerable number for Q4, as you know, and since the share price continued to go up we had to book again a sizable number. And the second point is that we put aside a two-digit number essentially for a couple of risks, which we are still seeing, which have not yet been completely specified, but will materialize over the course of 2011; that's a two- digit number as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, I guess as long as the share price keeps going up further that incentive program will keep penalizing EBIT, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Thank you for the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the next question comes from Christian Faitz [Macquarie Securities]. Good morning, Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just quickly, can you explain your pricing and volume strategy in Agro in the first quarter, since your two key competitors seem to have outperformed you at least in the first quarter, if I look at volumes and pricing? Also, can you give us your view of channel inventories at present due to the adverse weather conditions, both in North America and in Europe? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is very hard to answer frankly because we are in the midst of the season, and as you all know, Q1 numbers generally are not that meaningful. You really have to look at the entire season which we will only know by the end of June. So, I can give you no specific comment on the ground inventories, as you asked.</p>
          <p>Concerning the first question, yes, we thought the same feature. When you think about it, you have to keep in mind that we had very, very strong volume growth over the last couple of years. So if you take a longer-term view, we did not have some of the bumps some of our competitors saw in 2009 and 2010. We had continued volume growth and therefore, I think the base effect &#x2013; the starting point for BASF is slightly different. We also have a different portfolio. For instance, we are not exposed to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:01) which came down significantly in 2009 and 2010 and has a base effect.</p>
          <p>And then pricing, what is important for you to keep in mind, there was no negative pricing effect compared with Q4. What we see is a specific situation in North America, more specifically in Canada where we had price reductions, which basically reflects new competitive realities where we had to adjust prices already last year. And this now translates into this slightly negative price effect overall. The underlying theme is still fully in place, innovation and being able to get good prices for good products, which we see across the board. This is one exception besides Canada.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. But just quickly, what do you subscribe to the view of one of your competitors that if the current situation in Europe persisted, you would have problems on the general inventory side, not you alone but the industry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; Tony Jones from Redburn. Your cracker margins, as you pointed out, were very high in the quarter, and you're doing very well with pricing tab. Some of it was due to tight markets. And then what will be helpful, would be -- could you give us an indication of what you think market dynamics might look like in the coming quarter or so, because I know that some of your competitors were offline, so will that unwind and therefore are those margins sustainable please? That would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Hans. On the cracker margins, we have in fact seen strong cracker margins throughout the first quarter. We believe that's primarily driven by the strong demand that we've seen globally on the cracker margins, in particular for propylene, Benzene and the like. We've seen very strong pricing in the U.S. due to the situation there. Asia, still strong in demand; Europe strong in demand. So yes, there have been planned and unplanned outages during Q1, but we see also going into Q2 a continued strong business environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So should I assume your margin you've just reported can be rolled forward a quarter, because that's quite a lot ahead of where I currently see it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to entering Q2, as I said, we still see that strong environment.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Maggie. Good morning, Dr. Bock. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the cost savings programs and the restructuring, various different restructuring processes you have in place. So, can you just remind us where you are on the next program on the Cognis synergies in terms of timing this year and also on the Ciba synergies, i.e., of those plans how much have you delivered and how much is yet to be delivered? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, this is Hans. I'll take the Cognis synergies and the Ciba synergies to start with. On Cognis, by year-end we have delivered on a run rate basis roughly &#x20AC;350 million in euros. That is &#x20AC;350 million out of a total of &#x20AC;450 million, which we want to have fully achieved going into the year 2012. So, we are very well on track there. On the Cognis synergies, we say that we announced our detailed integration plans on March 25th only. We are now in full swing with respect to the integration. There is at this point in time not yet a lot that I can report on with respect to cost synergies. We intent to achieve &#x20AC;140 million in cost synergies by the end of 2014 &#x2013; 2013, sorry. And looking at the history that we have with respect to delivering on synergies that we are announcing, I can say rest assured we'll achieve what we announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Paul, with regard to your other question, our efficiency programs, which is Cognis, we expect an effect &#x2013; the total effect cumulative of more than &#x20AC;1 billion as of 2012. As of end of 2010, we had realized already &#x20AC;600 million and the run rate is approximately &#x20AC;300 million a year. So, you see another &#x20AC;300 million, &#x20AC;400 million of savings in 2011 coming to our bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Question on the order book, order flow really; when you speak to your divisional managers, you mentioned in previous quarters that either order patterns were shorter term and more sporadic, is your visibility on order book and is the feeling that is sort of building out and your visibility is improving or are you still seeing shorter order book than perhaps was the case a couple of years ago? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, actually we don't see any shift in order patterns right now. It's still very, very strong. We got a little bit confused this morning when we read the German paper because you might have seen in Germany the order intake has come down in the month of March...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, lady and gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Could you give us guidance for the second quarter compared to the first quarter and potential influence you expect from Japan? And then, could you also give us the current status of your Styrenics joint venture negotiations and maybe also a statement of &#x2013; or comments on the statement of Dr. Kurt Bock according to new acquisitions, which are now targeted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, it's tricky. These are three questions instead of one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe take the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, we don't really provide specific guidance for individual quarters and I would stick to that policy. We gave an outlook for 2011, and as Hans said just a minute ago, what we see right now going into the second quarter doesn't give us any reason to be particularly skeptical here.</p>
          <p>With regard to Styrenics, we are in the midst of forming &#x2013; setting up the joint venture. We have lots of works to do internally to carve out the business and then bring it into a new business combination with INEOS. We still have to wait for anti-trust approvals essentially in Europe. This is an ongoing discussion. Frankly, it's too early to say how this will &#x2013; and what kind of action might result from this. We are very optimistic for the formation of the joint venture, and underlying business trend so far has been very positive.</p>
          <p>And your last question, really quickly with regard to M&amp;A, I mean you know our underlying policy first comes organic growth, investments, R&amp;D, where we really generate lots of value. We have done a couple of acquisitions and right now, we are, as Hans explained, really, really busy integrating Cognis. And we also said that we would like to reduce our net debt a little bit in 2011. We already achieved this during Q1 by about &#x20AC;2.4 billion. But just keep in mind that, as of today essentially, we are paying &#x20AC;2 billion in dividend to our shareholders, if our shareholders approve our proposal at the shareholders meeting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning and thanks for taking the question; just on the fertilizer and so, could you just update us in terms of the likely timing of the sale as far as you can control it? And also it would be helpful to have an idea of, I don't know, revenues and profit that that business generated last year, if possible? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sophie, the process has started a couple of weeks ago. We sent out the teasers. We have received very positive, good feedback. It's simply too early to become more specific here. It's an ongoing process. We don't expect this to close before the end of 2011 depending on many issues obviously. But we are optimistic for the process and we are also optimistic for the business. The business &#x2013; the size is approximately 0.5 billion and it's a profitable business and they are great assets, both in Antwerp but also in France and in Ludwigshafen. As you know, the assets in Ludwigshafen are not up for sale. There we will doing a tolling due to our Verbund structure, but I think this is first rate fertilizer as we put on the market here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. This is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Thanks for taking the question. I am wondering if you could perhaps describe the &#x2013; kind of the market dynamics or the operating dynamics of crackers that you're seeing in the industry. I'm wondering if people are kind of running their crackers really to maximize production right now and doing the best they can, or are people being really clever about just kind of managing their inventory levels to not encourage over-supply in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy, this is Hans; you and I, I remember, had discussions on this already. Let me start with the way <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:02) is running the crackers. We are running the crackers primarily to support our downstream activities. So posing that question to us, yeah, you can get an answer. It will also be a qualified answer. There is no question about it. But there are other companies out there who are really participating in the cracker product markets to a much, much higher extent than we do. So can I tell you what they are doing actually? No. We are running our crackers at this point in time at high capacity utilization. We've already alluded to the very favorable margin situation and to the fact that going into Q2, we don't see a change there. At this point in time, demand is strong and this strong demand is driving the pricing situation and the margin situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then we'll just add one sentence, we also do not plan to add a new cracker to our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So with this now we're moving on to Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. I tried to reach this morning, but he was already in the morning meeting. How are you, Ronald?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thanks, fine. Yeah, it's obviously a busy day today. Quick question on consolidation effect potentially, there is obviously a new IFRS rule which forces through 50-50 joint ventures to put at equity and I was curious thinking about Nanjing or other effect, and when they might come up? So, can you guide us a little bit on that, any details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Ronald. Thanks for the question. This will become effective for BASF in 2013 only. We are still looking at the situation to fully understand what it could mean. At the end of the day, one consequence could really be that we have to consolidate those companies at equity. But I can assure you, whatever is going to happen we will inform you upfront in detail about possible effects, but right now it's too early to become more specific because it's still kind of an ongoing process.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Richard Logan from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Both within BASF and right across the whole industry, we've seen stronger than expected pricing par in the face of significant raw material cost increases. Firstly, I wonder what you believe is the key driving factor behind that, because it's not only BASF, it's like right through the whole of the sector. And secondly, how sustainable do you believe that is both for BASF and for the industry as a whole? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is certainly a core question. I mean you're absolutely right in what you're describing. We see good pricing power right now, which is obviously driven in the commodities businesses by supply/demand balance, which is very, very tight. And again, we haven't seen any change since the start of May, so it continues. By the way, when you look at our segments and we have six business segments, certainly our downstream business still have to cope with some of the cost increases they have to accept also for our internal capital deliveries. So we are not yet through with price adjustment throughout the entire value chain. As a company, in total we've managed to recover our raw material cost increases, but certainly not every single individual business. It's very difficult for us to tell you in general terms what is the driving factors behind this. Obviously, it's overall good economic development. We have seen in some cases a lack of capacity available due to technical issues, which hasn't really affected BASF, only in a positive way our capacities are available. So apart from the overall economic picture, I cannot really give you any specifics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that there has been &#x2013; there is much greater discipline or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:21) &#x2013; I mean that's certainly our impression?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes, I mean this has been the feature for the chemical industry now for a couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very strong feature, Cummins has become much more disciplined also with regard to their investment behavior. And we say this all the time and we've kept to that also during the crisis 2008 and 2009, for us it's always value over volume. It's really a value-driven strategy, what's behind BASF's economic success, and we're not going for volume at any cost. What you can say, however, there are particular products right now where you see record margins, which we had never seen before and clearly will those margins stay forever, that's hard to believe. However, it's very difficult to say for how long they will continue to stay. For the time being again we see no change, and we don't see any indication why it could change in the near-term future, but compared with historic margins they are really in some cases &#x2013; particular cases record margins and maybe that's a new normal, but that's too early to say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Following on from that actually, in terms of the areas where you're still facing margin squeeze, particularly the Construction Chemical business, I know Q1 is seasonally weak, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, but the lag effect there and obviously you're trying to get this margin squeeze through pricing, accommodated, et cetera. How long do you think the lag effect could be in the Construction Chemicals? And squaring that with the full-year guidance in that segment or that business for a strong improvement in earnings, because obviously you're still under pressure in Q1, I'm just wondering how you square that with the guidance for the full-year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter; this is Hans. I mean, with respect to Construction Chemicals, I actually don't know whether it's right to speak about a lag effect there when it comes to passing on raw material pricing. I think first of all, we've got to look there at the market and the demand that's coming from the market. And there we see continued weakness in North America, we see continued weakness in parts of Europe and there in particular in the southern parts of Europe. And I think that is what we have to take in mind first and foremost when we think about performance of Construction Chemicals businesses. The demand isn't there, it will be awfully difficult to do something on pricing. With respect to guidance that we've given for the full-year, the Q1 results don't lead us to change that guidance. As expected, Q1 on the northern hemisphere due to the winter situation is a very weak quarter. Yes, it was a very weak quarter, and our expectation is that that business &#x2013; it's not only our expectation, we've seen it picking up going into April and May now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have a question or perhaps it was a tradition that Mr. Hambrecht in the past gave always a little bit situation of demand-supply in the main value chain, perhaps like <mark type="ph" /> it really got (41:50) someone. So perhaps Mr. Bock you can follow up this tradition and explain a little bit how the situation there is, perhaps also split a little bit by region. And you mentioned that particularly our products have record margins and perhaps you can name that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question, Mr. Barth. I'm not sure yet what kind of tradition I want to develop, but at least I'll try to answer your question. Here, we see some good margins, for instance in Acrylics we see very good margins in capro, as you all know. And this is across the globe. There is no really difference between Europe, Asia and Europe and the United States, simply because there is also arbitration going on between those regions as we again also know. And with regard to the time, I mean we still have 10 people lined up here for questions. I would really refrain from going into much more detail.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. In the sort of recent past, you have been &#x2013; within your cracker portfolio long SME and short the higher cuts. Could you just give us, including an order of magnitude, what your status is today? I mean what's your &#x2013; in terms of your percentage propylene use, for example, how much is generated captively?</p>

          <p>So this brings us now to Mutlu Gundogan from Royal Bank of Scotland. Good morning, Mutlu.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everyone. A question on Performance Polymers; you are currently operating at full capacity in the polymer intermediates and engineered plastics chain and it has been the case for the last couple of quarters. So I was wondering if you are planning any capacity additions here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no, what you described as &#x2013; let's say, core engineering plastics business, we have no great capacity expansion projects underway. We are doing quite a bit in what we call eco product where we have new investments. What is going on all the time is capacity creep, so we are constantly fine-tuning our plants. Some of them in the intermediates business, as you all know, are quite mature. We are constantly fine-tuning them to extend and increase our capacity, and so far we have been successful doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Welcome.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we come to Annett Weber from BHF-BANK. Good morning, Annett.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a quick question, coming back on the pricing situation you said in an answer to an earlier question that in the downstream businesses there were some work to be done still. And my question now is, are you confident that you will be able to pass on the raw material cost pressures in these businesses as well? And have the pricing initiatives already been started? And until when do you expect these to be passed on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is an ongoing process, as you can imagine. To give you an example, our coatings business, obviously they have to cope with higher pigment cost. And it takes time, if you discuss this with your automotive customers, to adjust prices because very often we have long-term or medium-term prices which are adjusted only on an annual basis. It will take a little bit of time, as a general rule of thumb. And I think that's meaningful also from your point of view. You can assume that under normal business conditions, it takes us across the board two to three months to pass on our raw material costs unless it's a complete disruption in the marketplace, again which we don't see right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this brings us to Matthias Cornu from Exane. Good morning, Mathias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. I'd just like to come back on the Libyan assets, and thank you for the guidance of roughly &#x20AC;1 billion less EBIT I suppose for the next &#x2013; for 10 months are roughly &#x20AC;10 million run rate a month. But looking at your Annual Report 2010 and the Oil &amp; Gas supplement, and the results in North Africa before taxes were &#x20AC;1.3 billion, i.e. &#x20AC;110 per months roughly on a lower average oil price. So would you explain the difference between these two guidance? And also maybe just on the net income to confirm, below the fact you have non-compensable oil tax, but also the minority to Gazprom, can you give us the run rate on the net profit basis per month of what is the loss of opportunity this asset being stopped at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent question, Mathias. Let's start at the beginning 2010, yes, the numbers you mentioned there are absolutely correct, &#x20AC;1.7 billion in sales, &#x20AC;1.3 billion in EBIT, &#x20AC;1 billion then in non-compensable oil tax, and roughly 70% in net earrings. We stopped production completely at the end of February onshore and a week later offshore. And we've said that we have &#x20AC;280 million in non-compensable oil tax in Q1 of the year 2010. I think at this point in time, that is probably all that we can say. You look at roughly &#x20AC;1 billion in non-compensable oil taxes that we had in our EBIT before special items for the year 2010. Our assumption that we're working under at this point in time is there will be no oil production in Libya back on in the year 2011, and as I've said much more on the very difficult situation down there. I can say at this point in time, other than that that our assets that we have in Libya roughly &#x20AC;700 million net book value are fully insured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, and for Q1 if I look at the impact for just one month you said it stopped by the end of February, it was about &#x20AC;100 million loss of opportunity in term of EBIT, that's correct, based on the average oil price you had at that time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's roughly correct. I mean, I gave you the &#x20AC;280 million in non-compensable oil tax. I also gave you &#x20AC;360 million for the first quarter in EBIT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think you have all the numbers now, and we move on to &#x2013; thank you very much &#x2013; to Jan de Vroe from ING Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; good morning, everybody. Also from my side one question on the Petrochemicals or maybe on the Chemicals division more specifically. If I remember well, at your full-year results, when you were discussing the outlook for that division, you did see slightly &#x2013; or you saw higher earnings but some pressure on margins. Now, that has not surfaced evidently and you're also guiding for a very good Q2 in that sense. But going forward, in the second half of the year, would you resume or go back to your previous view that you had at middle of February? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's obviously very, very specific question. I mean, what I can say is that what we have in our books gives us some kind of indication for the next two to three months max. And beyond that, our visibility in the marketplace is quite limited in terms of what you get from you customers. We can only look at the overall macroeconomic picture and there, we don't see any reason that supply/demand should change dramatically from what we have today. But again, we don't guide specific quarters and we also don't do that for specific businesses or individual quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are now moving on to Jaideep Pandya from Berenberg Bank. Good morning Jaideep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just a question really on businesses which are still not doing as well as you expected. My direction is mainly Functional Solutions, but if you can just tell us which are the other areas where you would expect better performance going forward in Q2, Q3 or rest of the 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you picked the right segments only, Jaideep, because obviously there were some concerned at the end of Q4 about Functional Solutions. Coatings continues to operate at a very healthy level, also earnings wise. Catalyst has done very well in Q1, as we announced &#x2013; as we told you in end of February, both in terms of sales and especially in terms of earnings and market development. Where we are not yet completely satisfied, as Hans also alluded to, is Construction Chemicals, which predominantly is due to external market factors, especially here in Europe and the United States, and that is pretty much what we see right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we are coming to Laurent Favre from Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, all. Thank you for taking my one question. From Performance Polymers where you've had very strong volume growth and earnings growth, I guess you just said that you were not planning to add significant capacity. I think you are assuming significant capacity additions for this year as per your full-year guidance from Performance Polymers. Could you tell us what you're seeing right now on ground? Are those expected to best additions coming through or are they being delayed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am on aware that the situation will ease very quickly. We had obviously a couple of smaller investment projects in this area, but for instance a big product &#x2013; one big product here is certainly caprolactam where we will not add large capacity in the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are having the two final questions because the gentlemen then have to head off the AGM. Rhian, one from you; and last one comes from Andreas Heine. Rhian Tucker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry. Thanks for my follow-up question. Just going back to pricing power, I mean obviously Construction Chemicals has been something that's been highlighted where you didn't mange to increase prices to compensate for raw materials. Are there any &#x2013; and we know that Ag obviously year-on-year as weak pricing, but is there any other areas where you think that pricing has not compensated for the raw material hike? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rhian, let me come back to equity because we have strong pricing across the board with one exception, which is really, as I mentioned before, a very special situation in North America, herbicide type of family. Apart from that, certainly some of our downstream businesses are still pushing; I mentioned coatings, it's also true for some of our business in Performance Products where we have seen very good sales and also earnings increase. The earnings increase are also largely attributable to the Cognis acquisition, which really paid off very, very handsomely. But some of those businesses still suffer from a higher raw material cost and they keep pushing in the marketplace for higher prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what about polymers, did prices fully compensate the raw material increases there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In polymers, we are pretty much on track. We have seen price increases and strong volumes, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not really discussing individual margins here, Rhian. I have to ask &#x2013; understanding individual margins of individual business we really never explain that in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Andreas [UniCredit Group], last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking this question as well. Again on the outlook, if I make the mess and takes the lower end of what significant means an increase of 10%, then this is roughly &#x20AC;700 million. That's basically what you already achieved in the first quarter, but according to all the comments you've given, my understanding is that we do not &#x2013; should interpret the outlook as &#x2013; that the next three quarters should be only on par with last year, so probably a little bit more than that? And secondly on the 2012 18% EBITDA margin target, do you have to change this if you cannot start-up the production of the oil production in Libya in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to your second question, the first one I take as a comment, we certainly have to look into the situation if oil and gas will not &#x2013; the Libyan production will not come back in 2012 what could it mean for our overall EBITDA, our sales profitability, and if that is &#x2013; if that becomes clearer over the course of the second half we will talk with you and explain it to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can already today calculate the EBITDA margin for our Chemicals business obviously and see where we are and then take our comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the outlook, again I take it as a comment. It's &#x2013; as always it's very difficult for us to tell you what's going to happen in the second half of 2011. What we see today what &#x2013; again what we see today gives us no reason to be in any way more skeptical or more cautious than we were at the end of February. Is that helpful; I hope so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is.</p>

          <p>So ladies and gentlemen, this brings us to the end of our conference call. Before we close, I would like to invite you to our next event, namely the Round Table on Agricultural Solutions, which will take place on August 8th in the United States. So, please mark your calendars already. We would like to all take you to the U.S. and we will also be able to show some of the biotechnology cooperation that we have with Monsanto. So, I think this should be a very interesting and worthwhile trip for you. Secondly, I also would like to inform you that we had indicated to you that we are planning an event on Oil &amp; Gas. We are currently in the process of scheduling road shows including an analyst breakfast on the Oil &amp; Gas segment in the coming month. And finally, we will next report on our second quarter 2011 results on July 28, 2011.</p>
