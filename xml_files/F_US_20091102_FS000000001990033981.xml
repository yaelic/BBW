          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. David Dickenson, Fixed Income Investor Relations Manager. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Bob Shanks, Ford's Vice President and Controller; K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including David Brandi, Assistant Treasurer; Mike Seneski, Assistant Treasurer and Mark Kozman, Director of Accounting.</p>
          <p>Before we begin I would like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we'll be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis; final data will be included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and, in some cases, on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part of the Appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results is summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to turn the call over to Ford Vice President and Controller, Bob Shanks. Bob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Let's turn to slide 1 first, and I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results.</p>
          <p>As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales in the third quarter were 1.2 million units, up 57,000 units from a year. Our third quarter revenue was $30.9 billion, an $800 million decrease from a year ago. This includes an Automotive revenue increase of $100 million, which was more than explained by favorable net pricing and higher volumes, primarily in North America, offset by unfavorable exchange translation. Excluding the impact of exchange translation, Automotive revenue would have increased by about 8%. Ford Credit's revenue decreased by more than $900 million, reflecting a decline in receivables.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was about $1.1 billion, a $3.9 billion improvement from a year ago. Automotive results improved by over $3.3 billion, and financial services improved by $502 million. Our third quarter net income attributable to Ford was $1 billion, including favorable pre-tax special items of $108 million. We ended the quarter with $23.8 billion of Automotive gross cash, and we'll discuss this in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide 2, which covers our special items, which was a favorable pre-tax amount of 108 million in the third quarter. This was more than explained by $163 million of held-for-sale accounting-related adjustments for Volvo, reflecting the elimination of depreciation and related cost. In addition, we incurred net charges related primarily to global personnel reduction actions and the UAW retiree health care VEBA agreement.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide 3 now and look at our Automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $23.8 billion in Automotive gross cash, which was up $2.8 billion from the end of the second quarter. Our Automotive operating related cash flow was 1.3 billion positive in the third quarter. And this reflected the following: an Automotive pre-tax operating profit of over $400 million; capital spending during the quarter that was $200 million lower than depreciation and amortization; changes in working capital and other timing differences that were $1.2 billion positive, and this was explained by $1.3 billion of positive working capital, reflecting primarily payable increases as we returned to balances closer to normal and inventory reductions to lower ongoing levels; a $400 million receipt of a Canadian government tax refund was offset by timing differences related primarily to health care payments; and finally, we received a payment of $500 million from Ford Credit, reflecting up-front payment of subvention.</p>
          <p>The Automotive operating related cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter represented a $2.3 billion improvement over the second quarter of 2009. This reflects primarily improved cash from earnings, and the receipt of the Canadian government tax refund.</p>
          <p>Other changes in Automotive gross cash included personnel reduction action payments of $200 million, and pension contributions of $100 million; net receipts from our financial services sector of $600 million, and this included a $400 million receipt related to a Ford Credit distribution. This was part of Ford Credit's revised plan to make $3 billion of cash and non-cash distributions to Ford Motor Company through 2010, which is up from the previously announced $2 billion. Through the first nine months of 2009, $1.5 billion of this amount has been remitted.</p>
          <p>We also had equity issuances in the quarter that generated proceeds of about $600 million, related primarily to completion of our previously announced plan to issue up to $1 billion of an equity and finally, we received receipts of about $900 million in loans from the U.S. Department of Energy for development of more fuel-efficient vehicles, which was offset partially by net debt repayments of $300 million. Including these impacts, the total increase in Automotive gross cash during the quarter was $2.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide 4, which summarizes our Automotive sector's cash and debt position. At the end of the third quarter, Automotive debt was $26.9 billion, of which 1.6 billion matures within the next year. Our gross cash, net of debt as of September 30, was 3.1 billion negative. As we've previously disclosed, upon implementation upon the new VEBA agreement with the UAW, which is still subject to court and other approvals, our debt balances will increase for the notes issued to the new VEBA. There will be about a $2 billion payment around year-end, a portion of which may be settled in equity. Subject to final fair market valuation of the note, it's estimated presently that recognition of these obligations after the year-end payment will increase our debt by seven to $8 billion, and also increase 2010 interest expense by about $700 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide 5, which shows the status of our 2009 planning assumptions and operational metrics for the first nine months of the year. We expect that full year industry volume will be about 10.6 million units, consistent with our previous guidance and present economic outlook. Europe is now expected to be about 15.7 million units, which is higher than our previous guidance. On the operational metrics, U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury brand vehicles had the fewest number of things gone wrong among all automakers. International results, however, remain mixed, as Europe continues to address issues. They did, however, show a 9% improvement in things gone wrong compared with the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Automotive structural costs were reduced by $4.6 billion during the first nine months of the year. We now expect our full year structural cost reductions to total about $5 billion. We've achieved significant structural cost reductions over the past four years and going forward, we expect structural costs to be relatively stable.</p>
          <p>In terms of market share, our U.S. total market share was 15% and our share of the U.S. retail market was 12.9%. Europe market share was 9.2% in the first nine months. We expect full year market shares to remain at about these same levels.</p>
          <p>Automotive operating cash flow was 3.4 billion negative during the first nine months. Now, this is better than our prior expectations and nearly $9 billion better than the same period last year. We expect Automotive operating-related cash flows to be positive in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion during the first nine months, and we now expect full year capital spending to be about $5 billion or slightly less. The higher projected fourth quarter spending reflects the timing of our product launches as we maintain our product plans.</p>
          <p>Overall, we remain on track to achieve or exceed all of our 2009 financial targets, and almost all of our operational metrics. In addition, based on our recent performance and our present planning assumptions, we're now changing our guidance for full year 2011 from being breakeven or better to being solidly profitable, for both the total company and North American Automotive, on pre-tax basis excluding special items, with positive Automotive operating related cash flow.</p>
          <p>While we continue to have confidence that the global economy will be improving by 2011, the near term growth outlook remains rather uncertain. There's a high likelihood of a substantial decrease in European industry volumes as scrappage programs there are wound down. This decrease could more than offset U.S. volumes that may improve somewhat from this past quarter's levels. We expect to know more about the state of the global recovery and its impact on 2010 automotive industry volumes over the next few months. Following our normal process, we'll provide you with guidance on our 2010 planning assumptions and operational metrics early next year when we release our full year 2009 results.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now turn it over to K.R.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Bob. Slide 6 shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the third quarter of 2009. As shown in the left box, our third quarter pre-tax profit was $677 million compared with a pre-tax profit of $161 million in the third quarter of 2008. You can see in the right box our September 30, 2009 on-balance-sheet receivables were $93 billion, about $34 billion lower than a year ago. This decline primarily reflected lower industry volumes, lower dealer stocks, the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover and Mazda financing to other finance providers, and changes in currency exchange rates. Our September 30 on-balance-sheet receivables were about $6 billion lower than the end of the second quarter and managed receivables at the end of the third quarter were $94 billion.</p>
          <p>Our financing share of U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail installment and lease contracts was 30% in the third quarter, 16 points lower than in the same period a year ago. This decline primarily reflects changes in Ford's marketing programs and our reduction in leasing. Charge-offs for on-balance-sheet receivables in the third quarter were $240 million and the worldwide loss to receivables ratio was 97 basis points, up eight basis points from the same period last year, and I'll speak more on that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>At September 30 , the allowance for credit losses for on-balance-sheet receivables was 1.7 billion or 179 basis points of receivables. The allowance was about $100 million lower than the end of the second quarter and up about $200 million from a year ago. In the third quarter, we paid $431 million in distributions to our parent, Ford Holdings. Previously, we had planned to pay about $2 billion in distributions during 2009 and 2010 in total, but based on an improved funding environment, our lower, and our lower managed leverage, we are now projecting total distribution through 2009 and 2010 of about $3 billion. Of the $3 billion planned distributions through 2010, $1.5 billion has been paid through the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We will continue to balance future distributions with successful execution of our funding plan. At September 30, our managed leverage was 7.7 to one, compared with 9.6 to one at September 30, 2008. At the end of the third quarter, our equity was about $10.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax profits for the third quarter of 2009, compared with the third quarter of 2008. For the third quarter, Ford Credit reported pre-tax profit of $677 million, a $516 million increase from a year ago. Volume was about $300 million lower compared with a year ago, reflecting the decline in receivables. Financing margin was essentially flat compared to a year ago. The decrease in the provision for credit losses of about $300 million primarily reflects lower severity consistent with improving auction values, offset partially by higher repossessions.</p>
          <p>Residual losses declined about $400 million in the third quarter compared with last year. This improvement primarily reflects the impact of improving auction values, resulting in lower losses on vehicles returned during the quarter. The improvement in other primarily reflects lower operating costs of about $100 million, and net gains of about $60 million related to unhedged currency exposures, primarily from across border inter-company lending,, which are now fully hedged. There was a partial offset by a held-for-sale valuation adjustment related to the sale of our Australian retail portfolio on October 1 of about $50 million.</p>
          <p>Our International segment incurred a small pre-tax loss of $7 million in the third quarter of 2009, a $78 million decline from last year's profit. This decline is more than explained by lower volumes across all regions and the Australian portfolio held-for-sale valuation adjustment. Excluding this held-for-sale adjustment, our International segment, which is primarily Europe, was profitable in the third quarter. We expect to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2009 and end the year with managed receivables between 90 and $95 billion. Next year, we expect reduced profits based on lower average receivables and non-recurrence of favorable 2009 factors.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 shows quarterly trends of charge-offs and loss to receivable ratios for our on-balance-sheet portfolio. At this point in time, we have about $100 million of off-balance-sheet receivables. The top box shows loss to receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio and the loss to receivable ratio for the U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury retail and lease business. Worldwide, loss to receivable ratios is up in the third quarter from a year ago level, reflecting higher credit losses in Europe, primarily from higher losses in Germany. U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury loss to receivable ratio is down in the third quarter from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower severity and lower other charge-offs, offset partially by higher repossessions.</p>
          <p>Worldwide, third quarter loss to receivable ratios improved from second quarter, reflecting lower losses in Europe, primarily from lower losses in Spain, offset partially by higher losses in Germany. U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury third quarter loss to receivable ratios increased from the second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of declining receivables.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs for the third quarter were $240 million, which was down $56 million from a year ago and down $45 million from the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury retail and lease business. Repossessions in the third quarter were 24,000 units, which was up 3,000 from the third quarter of 2008, and up 2,000 units from the second quarter. Severity of $7,300 in the third quarter was $2,900 lower than last year and $1,100 lower than the second quarter 2009, primarily reflecting improvements in auction values in the used vehicle market. Over 60 days' delinquencies totaled 24 basis points in the third quarter, which was up one basis point from the second quarter, and down one basis point from last year. Bankruptcy filings totaled 13,000 in the third quarter, up 1,000 compared with the second quarter, and up 3,000 from last year.</p>
          <p>The credit quality of our contract placements remains very good. We continue to see ongoing stress in the consumer and commercial portfolios, and closely monitor our key loss metrics for any change related to product trends in the economy.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows the lease residual performance for our Ford and Lincoln-Mercury U.S. brands. Lease return volumes totaled 33,000 units in the third quarter, which was down 6,000 from the same period last year, primarily reflecting a lower return rate, which was down 18 percentage points to 70%. Lease return rates were also down 13 percentage points in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, primarily reflecting the improvement in auction values.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, auction values for 24 and 36 month leased vehicles at constant mix were up on average about $2,800 per unit, and $1,900 per unit respectively from year-ago levels, again reflecting the overall auction value improvements in the used vehicle market. Compared with the prior quarter, auction values were up by $1,200 for 24 and 36 month leased vehicles.</p>
          <p>Lease placements continued to shift toward cars and crossovers and away from full-sized trucks and SUV's. In the third quarter, cars and crossovers represented 97% of new placements, up from 71% in the third quarter last year and about equal to the second quarter this year. Our lease portfolio is presently 60% cars and crossovers, which is up from about 50% one year ago. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $16.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, which was down from $25.2 billion in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks K.R. I'd like to begin on slide 11 by reemphasizing that we continue to view Ford Credit as a strategic asset and are committed to funding the business under its present ownership structure. We continue to see positive momentum in the capital markets for the second consecutive quarter, evidenced by improvement in market access and credit spreads. Year-to-date, we have issued 4 billion of unsecured debt including 2.8 billion in the third quarter. We completed 10 billion of TALF-eligible trades in all of our main U.S. asset classes, including our first floor plan trade in October. We no longer are utilizing the CPFF [Commercial Paper Funding Facility] program, and we are executing our international funding plans, having completed securitizations in the public and private market, including nearly 5 billion in Canada.</p>
          <p>For our funding strategy, we remain dependent on capital markets access for public and private securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper, unsecured debt and hedging instruments. Our strategy on committed capacity is to achieve renewals consistent with the size of our balance sheet. We will continue to explore and execute alternative business and funding arrangements in those locations where we lack diverse funding capability, while also ensuring that Ford has continued support in these markets. Overall, the funding environment is improving and Ford Credit's funding strategy is focused on maintaining liquidity to meet short term funding obligations, including holding a substantial cash balance.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the trends in funding for our managed receivables. At the end of the third quarter, managed receivables were 94 billion. We ended the quarter with about 23 billion in cash, including 6.1 billion to support on-balance-sheet securitizations. Securitized funding was about 60% of managed receivables at the end of the third quarter. We are projecting 2009 year-end managed receivables in the range of 90 to 95 billion, with securitized funding representing 58 to 60% of managed receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows our current funding plan for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs or asset sales to our on-balance-sheet asset backed commercial paper program. We have completed about 26 billion of our term funding to date. About 17 billion of this funding was public, including 10 billion of TALF eligible securitizations. As I mentioned earlier, this also included two Ford Credit unsecured debt offerings totaling 2.8 billion in the third quarter. In addition, we have completed about 9 billion of funding through our private channels year to date, including two retail securitizations in Canada for about 2.4 billion. At this point, we have essentially completed our 2009 funding plan.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity, which includes unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines, a multi-asset facility and asset backed conduit capacity. As of September 30 , we had over 58 billion of committed capacity in cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was 44.6 billion, of which 20.7 billion was utilized, leaving about 24 billion available for use, given our present level of eligible receivables. Available liquidity as a percent of managed receivables is 25%, up about five percentage points from second quarter and seven percentage points from year end.</p>
          <p>As funding environment improves, available liquidity will be reduced to appropriate levels, considering the size of our balance sheet. At quarter end, our cash that is not related to securitization totaled 17 billion. Through the third quarter, we repurchased about 2.5 billion of near-term unsecured debt maturities, 1.5 billion of which was completed in the third quarter and was mostly maturities through mid-2010. During the third quarter, we renewed about 6.2 billion, or about 78% of our committed capacity that came due, compared with a renewal rate of 52% in the first half. Year-to-date, we have renewed about 17 billion, or about 60% of our committed capacity that has come due.</p>
          <p>In addition to our available liquidity, we ended the quarter with 7.7 billion of excess committed capacity. This excess capacity reflects our successful committed capacity renewals and lower assets. Of the 35 billion of total committed capacity, about 10% is up for renewal during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will work to right-size future renewals to appropriately balance excess capacity.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 is a summary. Ford had pre-tax operating profits, excluding special items, of about 1.1 billion, 3.9 billion improvement from a year ago, and North America operations had pre-tax operating profit of 357 million. Net income attributable to Ford was 1 billion, including favorable pre-tax special items of 108 million. Third quarter Automotive gross cash was 23.8 billion. Ford raised 565 million of new common stock in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>For Ford Credit, the pre-tax profit was 677 million and net income was 427 million. Ford Credit continues to provide funding to all of its dealers and customers. In the third quarter, Ford Credit paid 431 million in distributions to its parent. Ford Credit has completed 26 billion of term funding year to date, including about 10 billion of retail, lease and wholesale TALF-eligible funding and 4 billion of unsecured debt, of which 2.8 was completed in the third quarter. Ford Credit's liquidity available for use is about 24 billion, of which about 17 billion is in cash.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Dave begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil. Ladies, and gentlemen, we're going to start the question and answer session now. Katina, can we please have the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Carlson, representing Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, guys. Thanks. On Slide 13 you give us disclosure that you achieved $26 billion of funding. I think you said that that hit your full-year plan. Would you consider over the next few months, if the market behaves, maybe pre-funding some of the 2010 maturities and essentially going above the 2009 plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, this is Neil. If you look at the forecast, there's still a little bit of room to do some more if the markets perform accordingly, and so I think from that perspective, we said we're essentially complete, but we could be doing some more funding in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and separately I know you've not been able to give us a really great update on the industrial bank status. I think there was some recent legislation that came out, or that was being discussed.  in the Financial Stability Act, where I think the Treasury and maybe Barney Frank said that they may limit future industrial bank status from being achieved across the industry, and I'm wondering if that's coming into a play at all; if that maybe changes your plan or could that have any impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug, this is K.R. On the industrial loan ILC we actually have an application that is still pending. However, there is a lot of stuff going on with the Congress and potential legislation that would effectively, I guess, outlaw ILCs owned by commercial interest.</p>
          <p>The truth is on this one, while we've been pushing to get an ILC done for the last couple of years, it never was going to be a large portion of our funding, funding the business. I mean, we ended up getting to the point where our application was about $6 billion of retail receivables. I think of it more as a back-up plan for the retail ABS market, and if you think about 6 billion in receivables, that's really two or three transactions over a couple of years. So it's not &#x2013; in the end, it's not a big deal. We'd like to have had a ILC, but as I said, the application is still pending at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, and then finally on the leasing side, with residuals better and auction values up, is there a strategy maybe to continue to increase lease volumes in the market? I mean is there a need for that? Could that help the volumes or are you kind of at where you need to be there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did take our lease penetration down rather dramatically last year, when the auction market really fell off, and we've never left the leasing business. We've stayed in it all along. It had been reduced fairly substantially. Right now, what we're doing is continuing to work with the Automotive parent on what we should be doing related to the leasing, and I think in the fourth quarter we've actually added a few more vehicles that will offer Ford Credit leasing packages, and so we'll just continue to watch on it. There will probably be a little bit added in over time.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just looking at your loss provisions and your charge-offs, why are your loss provisions so much lower than your charge-offs? I know you guys are getting smaller, but as we get into a "economic recovery," we think that your book would not shrink as much as it has this year. I mean, are you guys showing confidence by allowing the provision to be below the charge-offs, and allow your allowance to drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you, call it a couple of perspectives on that. We did see charge-offs in the quarter down, a nice bit, down at 240 million versus last year, which was almost 300 million in the quarter. Effectively, what we're seeing here is some good news associated with severity from the auction market. So what we do, every quarter we go through what we call an adequacy study to take a look at what the appropriate level of the reserve should be, and it is a combination of how we have performed in the past, how severity is performing, where we think the market is going.</p>
          <p>And at this point in time, we're pretty comfortable with where our reserve is at. We do believe it is appropriate and it also recognize that the size of the balance sheet has continued to shrink, and just from the end of the second quarter we're down about $6 billion just in receivables alone. So at 179 basis points, we think we're still pretty much at appropriate levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then looking at that lease residual adjustment of 400 million, is that a gain on marking up your whole book, or just profits on those leases coming due?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be real clear on this, because operating leases are a depreciable asset, you can never actually mark them up. So you can never take back the depreciation that you've already incurred, for example, when we did the 2.1 billion impairment last year. Now, what does happen, though, is when those vehicles come back off lease and we sell them at a gain, we would recognize the gain at that point in time. So what you're seeing coming through in the third quarter is that the vehicles that are coming back are worth much more than they were last year, for example, and so you're picking up a bit of a gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So it's not the whole book, like we saw last year, getting marked down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. The impairment itself was a one-time marking down of the receivable itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And his is just the stuff that's coming due. And then one more housekeeping: is the 700 million in the other line at the bottom of the cash flow statement, I've totally missed. What is that? What is that comprised of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the DOE loan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, okay, and then finally, just kind of the top of the house type question. It seems like 2010 somewhat cautious outlook, driven by raw materials and a potential backdraft in Europe, and if that's the case, why are we growing production in the fourth quarter? Are there unfilled orders, or what's happening there? Because it seems to conflict one another.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob. We ended up the third quarter with very lean inventories, not only in North America, but in many parts of the world. A lot of that was related to the scrappage programs, including the Cash for Clunkers that we had in the U.S., so we are expecting industries to be, in the fourth quarter, pretty much in line with where they were sort of for the quarter, but we have to kind of restore and replenish our stocks and our inventories and that's what's taking place.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. Couple quick questions, one just on the cash flow statement. Can you break out for us how much of that 1.2 billion related to working capital versus how much was timing differences?</p>
          <p>And then the second question it is that relates to DOE loans, you have roughly, I think, 5 billion left and the last I heard from you guys, I think you were saying you'd get roughly that 5 billion split in 2010 and 2011. Can you maybe shed more light on possibly when you would be eligible for that remaining 5, and how that split would be?</p>
          <p>And then in conjunction with that, you do say pretty clearly in the press release that Ford is looking at other actions to strengthen the balance sheet. I'll give it a shot here, but can you give us some framework for &#x2013; is this like you're looking at things now, or you're looking at things over time, or what? Because you have a big jump in the optics here on balance sheet debt, which we all knew you had coming, right?, you were very clear with how that debt would come on balance sheet, but the reality of it is, is the optics still will show an increase in debt by year end, and so can you give us some sense for how you're looking at debt reduction going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the first one, Brian, from the standpoint of what the 1.2 in working capital and other. 1.3 of it's working capital, and so you have other timing difference, which offsets the Canadian tax payment that we received.</p>
          <p>As far as the DOE, we have received just under 900 million through the third quarter, and the way the rest of the 5 billion really gets spread out is between now through mid of 2012, and is really a pay as sort of as you spend it, we then get paid by the government for those projects that are eligible under the DOE. So it really is going to be calendar-ized between now and the middle of 2012 for the remaining 5 billion.</p>
          <p>And then as far as the balance sheet goes, first and foremost our objective to repair the balance sheet is going to be to generate positive results, which we did in the quarter. We also mentioned earlier the 565 million of new shares that were &#x2013; or new common stock that was issued to finish the $1 billion program that we started a year ago, and that's about all we're going to say at this time from the standpoint of what our plans are going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you were to have, if you were to issue shares, I assume at this point, you would have to &#x2013; the mechanics would be you'd have to file a shelf. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe that to be correct.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We would need to file prospectuses, from the standpoint &#x2013; but I think our shelf is an ongoing shelf.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your next question comes from the line of Josh Lipton representing Eaton Vance. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It looks like the receivables balance kind of levels out in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any guidance as to where it may go in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Josh. We'll give real guidance at the end of the year. When we do the year-end results, we typically give out what we expect for the guidance for the following year to be at that point in time. What I can tell you is that on our balance sheet right now, roughly we have about 4% of it being Jag and Land Rover, about 5% being Mazda. We are no longer originating any new business for those brands, and that will slowly wind its way off the portfolio, over the next two, three, four years.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we're facing is leases from a portfolio size perspective. When you look at the industry volumes, for example in the U.S. this year, the industry volumes in the U.S. next year, and you think about the portfolio from a Ford Credit perspective, essentially from a retail perspective, you're rolling the portfolio once every four years, so we're replacing a much lower industry volume year &#x2013; we're replacing a much higher industry volume year in the past with a very much lower industry volume year 2009 and 2010, which also has a bit of a dampening effect on the size of the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has the decline in your share of financing &#x2013; part of it was lease. Does that explain all of it, or is it &#x2013; part of it just higher underwriting standards and being more picky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I want to be really clear on one point: all through this crisis, we have not actually changed our underwriting practices, except for I'll give you one exception, and that is in Spain, where we have backed off a bit. So for our normal retail business, we have not changed our underwriting practice at all. We have backed off on lease a bit in North America, and so those are all built in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just kind of thinking about this going forward then, you're going to have a similar share, I guess, in the fourth quarter is your thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be in the same ballpark, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then you mentioned liquidity and kind of managed assets is at a healthy number right now. Any guidance as to where you'd like to keep that over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think we obviously, we've gone through a pretty strenuous funding environment over the last year. I think we're run liquidity up intentionally to protect for that. So I think the only guidance we'll tell you is it's going to come down consistent with the balance sheet and as the funding environment gets better, we'll work that down as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the leverage target as well, you guys have mentioned a much higher managed leverage target than where you are today. Is that kind of in the same domain, where it will probably go back to your target over time as liquidity hopefully remains adequate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Josh, all I can really say on leverage, we have an agreement with the parent that we wouldn't take our leverage above 11.5 to one, and right now we're sitting at 7.7 to one. So it's going to take a while for us to ever get back to 11.5 to one. We think that kind of range, 11.5 to one, is about the appropriate level, based on the riskiness of our assets, but I don't want to give you any kind of time period, but longer term, over time, I would expect us to be back to that level.</p>
