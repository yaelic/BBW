          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Presentation of BNP Paribas 2010 First Quarter Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. Slides of the presentation are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relations Web site, www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Philippe Bordenave, Senior Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to you all. As usual, I will start with few introductory remarks before taking your questions.</p>
          <p>First, let me say that actually quarter, it's my pleasure to take you through our results, which demonstrate first the new dimension of BNP Paribas after the acquisition of Fortis and the intense work that has followed, and demonstrate as well the strong underlying profit generation capacity of the Group, thanks to its diversified and client-centric business model further strengthened by Fortis.</p>
          <p>About Fortis, it's the first time we are showing the results according to the new divisional setup. You will never hear again of Fortis as separate division, because its results have been broken down into the different business lines of BNP Paribas including of course the newly created BeLux Retail Banking, the retail banking in Belgium and Luxembourg. You know that we issued the corresponding divisional restatements one month ago.</p>
          <p>So Fortis represents a breakthrough for retail banking, not only in Belgium and Luxembourg, but also in Europe-Mediterranean for example. It's also a transforming deal for investment solutions. As you have seen, it's raising the assets under management by nearly half and it's also a very significant item for CIB. So you should keep in mind that BNP Paribas Fortis cannot be reduced to only BeLux Retail Banking and cannot be reduced to simple synergies as well, because the Fortis &#x2013; the business of Fortis itself is there in different divisions. And by the way, the synergies are implemented fully on schedule. So far, &#x20AC;254 million of synergies have been delivered on a full-year FX basis. In the rest of these remarks, unless I said otherwise, I will comment on the evolution at constant scope and exchange rates, that is to say as the Fortis activities have been integrated at the beginning of the last year with full contribution to the first quarter 2009 earning to be on a comparable basis.</p>
          <p>So the net profit for the first quarter 2010 stands at &#x20AC;2.3 billion. I am on Page 5 of the presentation, and &#x20AC;2.3 billion, a rise by 39% compared to the same quarter last year at constant scope and exchange rate and the fixed net income bolstered by a bank this quarter. This was achieved mainly thanks to the healthy revenue development and the drop in the cost of risks, combined again this quarter with what is the trademark of BNP Paribas, that is to say, the strict control of the cost.</p>
          <p>Revenues were flat despite the very high comparison base in the first quarter of 2009 due to exceptional CIB revenues, you remember. Costs were down 3%, and the cost of risks were down 45%. As Slide 9 illustrates, this is the third quarter of decline in the cost of risk at the group level and this confirms our view that 2009 was a peak year for the cost of risk. You remember that we had said that while releasing our full year 2009 results.</p>
          <p>As a result of this trend, pre-tax profits rose including Fortis 55% to &#x20AC;3.8 billion. The environment is still characterized by an unfavorable economic trend in western countries, with low credit demand, high risk immersion on the part of investors and corporates, and a still elevated cost of risk. But in this challenging environment, the three main operating divisions deliver strong growth in pre-tax income; that's on Page 13. Retail Banking, plus 51%, Investment Solutions at plus 34% and CIB at plus 26%.</p>
          <p>So even within the big divisions, nearly all business units performed well and posted an increase of the pre-tax income with only two exceptions: BNL banca commerciale which continues to suffer from a rise in the cost of risk as we had announced, and Capital Markets and Advisory whose revenues in the first half of 2009 were truly exceptional, you remember, due to volume and market downs from the climax of the crisis, post-Lehman.</p>
          <p>In Capital Markets and Advisory, revenues were nevertheless excellent in the first quarter of this year thanks to the market share gains enjoyed in the different business lines. All the other business units grew their profits or returned to profits. I would like to stress especially that BancWest and Europe-Mediterranean were back in the black this quarter thanks to lower cost of risk.</p>
          <p>On Slide 53, you see that BancWest's asset quality is truly stabilizing and the need for further impairment of its investment portfolio is declining. As for Europe-Mediterranean, it's benefited from a decrease of the cost of risk in Ukraine where the environment is improving, in particular after the presidential election and also due to the favorable evolution of the steel price.</p>
          <p>The contribution of Fortis to Europe-Mediterranean is very significant with the addition Fortis Turkey and Poland, in two countries with a strong outlook for growth.</p>
          <p>A few words about BeLux Retail Banking, which is the best illustration of Fortis' addition to the group. On Slide 20, you've got the business trends. We have &#x2013; we are implementing, I would say, a new sales and marketing drive, which is creating good asset inflows and I think really that the confidence of client and staff makes a comeback.</p>
          <p>On Slide 21, you've got the contribution which is, if you compare it, structurally half of that of French Retail Banking in terms of number of clients, in terms of allocated equity, of revenues, of pre-tax income with a similar profile in fact, good asset quality. We're now seeing a low cost of risk even beyond the seasonality that pushed it, pushed the cost of risk especially low this quarter. Group sales, stringent cost control, which will help bridge this gap in terms of cost income ratio with the French network, and to start with, we expect to enjoy who helped created the positive 3-point jaws effect in 2010 compared with 2009, pro forma.</p>
          <p>Overall for the group, the business mix of the quarter after full integration of Fortis is a full confirmation of our BNP Paribas ideal cocktail. In all, 53% of the revenues were achieved in Retail Banking, 34% in CIB and in 13% Investment Solution. That is to say again, the one-half, one-third, one-sixth proportions we like.</p>
          <p>Finally, the solvency of the Group improved further with a Tier 1 ratio up by 0.4 points to 10.5%, and Equity Tier 1 up by 0.3 point at 8.3%. This was achieved mostly thanks to the capital generation combined with a slight decline in risk-weighted asset by &#x20AC;4 billion over the quarter.</p>
          <p>So I thank you for your attention, and I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Bordenave. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Jean-Pierre Lambert of KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three questions, the first one is on the cost of risk for Mediterranean Europe and BancWest. They dropped quite significantly in the first quarter. I was wondering if you considered that as a new base to look into the loan loss charges. That means Mediterranean Europe 138 and BancWest 163? Second question is related to Fortis CIB revenues in the first quarter. Last year just for comparison, I think it must be around 489 million. If you could give an indication of the split between equities and fixed income and financing if possible, so that we can have a comparison? And the third question is more general: The fixed income turmoil for the sovereign bonds, how did it affect the current activities in your fixed income business? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Pierre. Well, let's start with the cost of risk in Europe-Mediterranean and BancWest. So we are on Page 11 for the sake of reference. Yes, we have &#x2013; in both cases we have a sharp drop. I think the two cases are very &#x2013; coming from different place. At BancWest, we have a sharp decline in impairment charges on the investment portfolio. We have announced that already because last year we had really dense provisions against that investment portfolio which were very, very high so we were expecting that effort, provision effort to come to an end and it happened.</p>
          <p>The quality of the credit portfolio is stabilizing and showing encouraging early signs as I have mentioned. It's on page &#x2013; it's in the Appendices on Page 53. I think it's very interesting to see that first the non-performing loans, it's on the top right. As a proportion of total loans, non-performing loans are now stabilized at BancWest, and it shows how better we are faring compared with the peer group. And it's still going up at the peer group from 434 to 459 while it stabilized at 300-plus at BancWest. And it is very interesting because if the total non-accruing loans are stabilizing of course the new effort for provisions is going to come down. And the early indicators on the left-hand side, 30 days delinquency rates are starting to come down. In each category of loans, it's very clear in as far as consumer loans are concerned, but even in mortgages it's also slightly starting to come down. So I think we have encouraging signs and we can be relatively optimistic about the cost of risk at BancWest, I think. In Europe-Mediterranean, in fact the improvement is &#x2013; the deterioration last year and the year before came from Ukraine mostly, if you remember, and the improvement is also coming from Ukraine and we are &#x2013; well, as you know, we have a bank in Ukraine with some exposure.</p>
          <p>Ukraine went through a very difficult crises in 2009. We think that the environment is improving. As I said in the preliminary words, the fact that the demands from emerging countries are pushing up the price of steel is very good for Ukraine because Ukraine is a steel producer. It's really a country with just a &#x2013; strong steel-producing country. Also on the political front, I mean things have stabilized with a clear and fair election of the new president and now local government which is on the same side as the president so they can work together. So it's much better than last year. So we can also relatively optimistic about Ukraine.</p>
          <p>With that being said, of course in emerging markets, the uncertainty is always something which prevail throughout emerging market.</p>
          <p>Even if at the movement, it's a place, well, those countries are showing good growth trends, but maybe with some more fragility than more industrialized countries. And so the future is less, I would say, certain or less predictable than in other places. So this is what we can say about the cost of risks, I would say, in those 2 places. Now the second question was about Fortis CIB revenues, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. In the first quarter last year...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year on the breakdown between equity and fixed income and financing activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. So we can have a feel for the year-on-year trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the pro forma basis it's &#x2013; on a historical basis, it's difficult to answer the question and we have not given that figure because we had no &#x2013; because the breakdown, the divisional breakdown at Fortis in CIB was not the same than the one of BNP Paribas. So this why it was too difficult to rebuild. We did that up to a certain level of sales by division, but we were not able to do it below what we gave you. Sorry for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the amount was....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can take part. The activity and equity derivatives of Fortis was really limited, so the contribution of equity and equity derivatives to Fortis CIB revenues was minimal. You can take that as an answer. Then the breakdown between fixed income and financing, it's more difficult, and the border was more delicate to recover &#x2013; to rebuild. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's all right. So but the overall &#x2013; the total was about 489 million for Fortis CIB revenues in that first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where do you take that figure from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's based on the percentage developments you indicate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the percentage &#x2013; back on the percentage, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes. If you take &#x2013; based on the increase at constant scope and exchange rate basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's the right thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then your last question was about the current activity in fixed income.</p>
          <p>In the sovereign business, what's happening at the movement is that because of the, I would say, disruptions or fears in the market about sovereign debt, a certain number of countries' government bonds are traded &#x2013; are not very well traded. The liquidity has left. Bid/offer spreads are wide, very wide. And volumes have dropped. And so the business is clearly not very active in that situation.</p>
          <p>And by the way, it's &#x2013; ironically, it gives a new light on the belief, of the joint belief that government bonds were always a liquid part of balance sheets, because clearly, it's not the case at the moment for quite a significant number of government bonds.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, there is a kind of flight to quality &#x2013; on the good &#x2013; government bonds which are revealed to be government bonds of good, quote/unquote, countries. And the yield are going down and so the widening of the spread between certain &#x2013; the best rated countries and the most feared countries &#x2013; the widening of the spread is not only coming from an increase of the interest rates in the low end of the countries, but also coming from a decrease in the yield of the good &#x2013; the so-called good countries, if you will, which creates a very new pattern with the differentiation, and of course, more volumes on the one end, and less volumes and even some kind of illiquidity on the other end on the spectrum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a form of spillover into the activity of the corporate entities or the secondary markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet, no. It remains largely limited to government bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, it seems that the caller has stepped away from the phone. Our next question today will come from Guillaume Tiberghien of Credit Suisse. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, it's Guillaume Tiberghien of Credit Suisse. I've got 2 questions.</p>
          <p>One is following on from Jean-Pierre's question on the provisioning trends, would you mind commenting also how you think the CIB current level of provisioning is, compared with maybe what you think is a more normal run rates?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to emerging markets and more specifically in Poland, have you got any particular appetite to grow there at the moment? Or your find that what you bought from Fortis is enough for the time being? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so about CIB, cost of risk, it's on Page 12. We are back to 21 basis points, as a proportion of customer loans.</p>
          <p>While we &#x2013; CIB, it's extremely &#x2013; movements are extremely dramatic and violent, so it can vary fast from almost nothing or 10 basis points or around, up to 130, 140. And now it's back &#x2013; in three quarters, it's back at 20.</p>
          <p>We have, as we say in this page, we have really very few new doubtful loans in Q1 2010, so we feel &#x2013; while we don't see any bad indication at the moment, so &#x2013; at the same time, it's difficult to comment, because in CIB, one file can profit at any time, and it can be a big one, so you never know. But the environment is very positive, it is really improving. And the economic growth is picking up a little bit everywhere. So we &#x2013; we remain cautious, and we don't want to give you too much confidence, but we tend to be optimistic.</p>
          <p>About Poland &#x2013; yes, in Poland &#x2013; Poland is a big country in Europe at the half of New Europe. And yes, we have &#x2013; in the promise basket, we have found a very good bank, but with the market share which is very limited. 3%, around. So it's &#x2013; clearly, it's a country were we would be interested in growing, both organically, but also maybe by seizing some opportunities of external growth, if there are some.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I maybe just ask a follow-up on that point? If I look at your Equity Tier 1 ratio, your core Tier 1 ratio of 8.3%, below which level would you not fall through an acquisition until the uncertainty with regard to the environment and the regulatory outlook are clarified?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this clarification has to occur first, but it's now going to come relatively rapidly I expect because we &#x2013; I think that by the summer we should have some more clarification about Central Bank's mind about the so-called calibration of the Basel III framework. And so we expect to have clear indications or clearer indications in a few months time now so I think it will it will come rapidly. Up until then, it's clear that the priority remains to wait and see.</p>

          <p>Our next question today will come from Jon Peace of Nomura. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Can I ask 4 very quick questions, please? The first is on C&amp;IB revenues. You used to tell us that in a normalized quarter under the old disclosure, you would aim to achieve revenues between about 2.2 and &#x20AC;2.9 billion. I just wonder how you see that range currently under the new disclosure? The second question is on the cost of risk. Again a switch from risk-weighted asset to loans as the measuring tool. We talked a little bit about some of the divisions but just at group level, where do you see the normalized cost of risk versus the 83 basis points you posted this quarter?</p>
          <p>The third question is, you quite rightly highlight your favorable liquidity situation. Given obviously the pressure on interbank rates at the moment, would you be able to disclose your net stable funding ratio? And the final question &#x2013; I apologize, I've got to ask it, you've given us your exposure to Greece; would you be prepared to give it to Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only those 4? On the last question, I will start with, Jon.</p>
          <p>I mean we don't want to disclose figures beyond what we've said about Greece, because we really think that the situation of Greece is very peculiar, and that maintaining exposure on other countries would, at the moment, would just feed the rumor mill and fuel speculation without any real economic merits.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to your first questions, the CIB, yes, the 2.2, 2.9 you are referring to were given in the framework of CIB before the addition of Fortis and you, rightfully, you point that now figures are increased by the Fortis CIB addition. So I think we should rather want to say something like, if you take the same kind of range, I mean the fourth quarter and third quarter as the 2 ends of the range as we had said BNP Paribas before Fortis. So this is on Page 27. You see that with Fortis, the new range is, I would say, 2.4 to 3.4 expanse, so it's slightly higher then what we had said for BNP Paribas alone and it adds something like 10, 15% more.</p>
          <p>Then about the cost of risk for the Group, so we are on Page 9 of the presentation. I think it's very interesting to see that if you take a long view &#x2013; somewhat, you see that long-term view, it's not that long term but starting in the first quarter of 2008, which was the peak of the crisis, you will see that with the exception of the first quarter of 2009, that first quarters are always low in terms of cost of risk. There is a seasonality, which is well known, so it has come down quarter after quarter from 200 down to 83 now.</p>
          <p>What I would say is that, clearly the normalized cost of risk is much lower, and probably more in the region where it was at the beginning of 2008, in the region probably of 40 or 50 basis points. The only question is when are we going to go back to there, and it is the trend which has been seen, the quarterly trend which has been seen for the last 3, 4 quarters.</p>
          <p>It is going to continue? And are we going to come back to the 40 basis points as soon as in the next quarter? I'm not sure of that because &#x2013; first because as I already said, the first quarter is always lower than the other quarters. And second, because the economic situation remains somewhat fragile in certain parts of the world, and cost of risk is probably one of the most difficult parts of the P&amp;L to predict. So I &#x2013; but the normalized level, I would probably say that once the crisis is really over we should be down back to the 40 basis point level or something like that.</p>
          <p>Then about the interbank and liquidity situation, our liquid situation is very good and we &#x2013; well as you say, we always mention that we don't have any problem to raise money, and even on relatively low maturities, as we have explained on the Slide 33, with more than half of our yearly medium-term and long-term program being already completed and nearly half of the issues having a maturity of more than 5 years. And though, we are using a wide range of different products, I mean not only unsecured public issues but also retail placements in our networks and collateralized public issues, long-term repos and quite a lot of private placement, 45%, especially to a significant part of them linked with our derivative business as we can sell derivatives embedded in a bond or a note or certificate, if any, according to the need of our clients.</p>
          <p>The NSFR, I mean, I don't want to give figures on the current proposals of the Basel Committee because those proposals are a kind of mixed bag of different technical aspects, some of them being well-grounded and we are in favor of them, others being more, I would say, distributable and sometimes really technically flawed.</p>
          <p>So we are studying that I would say item by item with those provisos. If you consider the impact study as being the opportunity of trying and measuring the impact of each chapter, I would say each item, and than it will &#x2013; while the time for picking up the right ones and maybe improving a number of them is coming and this is something which has to be done in serenity, I would say, and in the framework of the Basel Committee and the regulators' work, and not in public.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just to clarify that point, I mean, to what extent do you think at this stage the  Basel Committee is going to be prepared to compromise on definitions or the timetable for implementation? And to what extent do you think they might come with a harder line and actually compromise relatively little with the banks? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really think &#x2013; I mean, compromise, I wouldn't use that word.</p>
          <p>I really think that in the mind of all the Basel Committee supervisors, the proposals which were put on the table were for discussion. And it was not just what they wanted to do, and it was not just a kind of fake discussion they wanted have with us, and with the governments, but it was really proposals.</p>
          <p>And they were from the very beginning, I think they were convinced that they wouldn't keep everything, if only because, on the liquidity side, especially, both the liquidity &#x2013; short-term ratio and the NSFR &#x2013; on both cases they had built something in a very short period of time, without having worked years and years on that already, like on the capital side. And so they knew that while there were a system of proposals &#x2013; were not following the same logic than the next &#x2013; the other one, so they were not necessarily compatible with each other.</p>
          <p>So they knew from the beginning that they would have to make a selection, and that selection would be done according of the results of our &#x2013; with the additional information given by the quantitative impact study, and also according to the evolution of the economy. Because also from the beginning, as I said, that they wanted the package not to harm too much the recovery.</p>
          <p>So I think that it's not a question of comprising, it's just a question of calibrating, which is the word they are using themselves, and trying to come up with a technically sound package, as appropriate and commensurate to the target, which it's a work they are in the process of doing by working on the QIS results.</p>

          <p>Our next question today will come from Max Le Gouvello of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, sorry, good afternoon, Philippe.</p>
          <p>A quick question regarding your great performance in the Equity Tier 1 derivative restructure recalled on the first quarter. I will be interested to have a little bit of color on which kind of products. That is include any write-backs on the large mark that you did at the time of Q4 2008 or Q1 2009.</p>
          <p>My second question would be regarding Fortis in Turkey. We still have no news on that side. And when you can expect to finalize a deal to integrate the 20Ts?</p>
          <p>And the last one is, can you elaborate a little bit more in term of the &#x2013; you still seem to be a bit cautious regarding the trends of the cost of risk on the French Retail. From what we have been able to see from your competitors and also some other regulators, individuals are fine, large corporates are still okay, so that's been &#x2013; most of the worries are the SMEs. Can you elaborate on that one please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Max. On HUD, no, it's not that much write-backs, in fact. We're seeing mark-to-market and there is constant hedging, so it's not that much write-backs.</p>
          <p>It's more, then, we had a very good &#x2013; first on the primary markets, we had very good levels this quarter, more than usually, because convertible bonds or convertible securities are in demand at the moment. And we are stronger in convertible than in normal plain equity, in terms of new issues, due to our derivatives position.</p>
          <p>Second, we made &#x2013; we see the return of the structures, if you will. We have a very good level of retail clients demand for capital-guaranteed products or very simple payouts. And you can, in that kind of retail products, you can put significant levels of margins. And so it's products which I would say, that is more burdensome to manage, because the period of subscription is wide.</p>
          <p>So you have some risk in the subscription period because you are obliged to open the subscription and to fix the conditions for 2 or 3 weeks, because the retail network needs that kind of time to gather the demand. But if it works well, and it did, the margins are very good.</p>
          <p>And then you should bear in mind that, more structurally, we are developing flow products in equity derivatives &#x2013; remember that our original strength is coming from the structures, but you remember as well that we have developed flow products over the last few years. We have expanded the product tranche. We have even both the primary dealership business in the U.S. and all that is faring well.</p>
          <p>So I think that &#x2013; well, it has been in fact the best quarter ever, and we are very, very pleased, and it's coming from a little bit of everywhere. And we are very satisfied by this comeback of equity derivative.</p>
          <p>On Fortis, Turkey, yes, we are still discussing. You know that the discussion is complicated, not because of Fortis, Turkey, but due to the fact that, on the BNP Paribas side, we have a joint venture, 50-50, with a Turkish entrepreneur partner. We have been extremely successful together over the last few years and so we want to &#x2013; I know we are &#x2013; we both want to keep this partner, I would say, on board, and to keep working with him in the next few years.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, we think that it's &#x2013; the merger of both banks is a tremendous opportunity for us in Turkey because it would create one of the very good Turkish banks, probably in the top 10, probably not that far from the top 5, even. And with a lot of potential for synergies, and in a market which is extremely promising, and which has shown some kind of stability and maturity in the crisis.</p>
          <p>So we &#x2013; for that reason, and that we want to try and combine targets which are a bit complicated, it takes time. But I would say it's evolving in the right direction, and so we are confident that we'll come to a positive solution for all of us.</p>
          <p>About the cost of risk in the French Retail, yes, we have &#x2013; the only thing we want to say &#x2013; we are at 37 basis points, so lower than the fourth quarter of 2009, but this is a seasonal effect, to a certain extent. Somewhat higher than the first quarter of 2009, plus 11% or something like that.</p>
          <p>Well, we see &#x2013; usually &#x2013; again, as I said a few minutes ago about the north sub business line, it's very difficult to anticipate cost of risk. But when we look at the history &#x2013; and this is a pure lesson from the past, and no more than that &#x2013; but we see that usually the cost of risk in retail networks is a laggard indicator of the economic situation, and keeps going up, even when the recovery is already there.</p>
          <p>So this is why we said and we still say that the cost of risk in the retail network in France and in Italy should keep growing this year, while now maybe less than &#x2013; we were positively surprised by the evolution of the first quarter, and maybe we are too pessimistic, but at this stage, we cannot say something else than that for the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I ask one question more on the investment banking? We have seen all the U.S. houses being able to disclose some very strong results on the fixed income side, and we know that you still have some target over there.</p>
          <p>Do you want to speed up the process and to hire more people quicker? Or are you still wanting to do it as you want over the 2 coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are in the process of hiring in the U.S., and in &#x2013; well, a little bit everywhere, by the way &#x2013; in Asia and Europe as well &#x2013; but especially in U.S., yes. In investment banking and especially sales teams, in order to keep developing our U.S. presence, yes? Investment banking, the business is more and more &#x2013; and will be more and more &#x2013; global. And so it's important for us to prepare ourselves for that.</p>
          <p>So even if at the movement, the markets are more regional, with the European market, the U.S. market and Asian market, and even 2 Asian markets because Japan is something &#x2013; which are different from each other &#x2013; and to a certain extent, working separately from each other.</p>
          <p>But otherwise, the trend is throughout globalization. We are extremely strong in Europe. We try to be stronger in the U.S. and in Asia. And clearly, yes, we are developing in the U.S.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Philippe. Two quick numbers questions, and then one perhaps broader question.</p>
          <p>In terms of BancWest, there was quite a nice margin improvement in the first quarter, but it looks like it's down to repricing of corporate deposits. Is there more to go for on that front? Are we going to see further margin expansion in coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And then second question, just switching to the Investment Solutions business. You saw another outflow within the Asset Management business in the first quarter. I have it in my head that in Q4, you saw one or two of the Fortis mandates departing. Is that an explanation for the first quarter outflows as well? Or is there something else underlying what we've seen there?</p>
          <p>And then perhaps just a broader question. Just in terms of your thoughts on future returns on equity, I might &#x2013; again, as I recall back in the rights issue process last year, and then I think with the Brussels Investor Day, that the suggestion was that it would be a real challenge to see returns on equity going back to the sort of levels that we've seen in the past, maybe sort of through the cycle 15 to 16%. But you're already up to 14.4% in the first quarter here. And obviously we'd expect equity levels to creep up with regulation over time, but equally there's a lot more to do on the numerator side in terms of foster synergies and general efficiencies.</p>
          <p>So I was just wondering whether or not you feel a bit more optimistic about sort of future returns, and you think they're likely to be better than perhaps you would have thought 6 months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello?  Sorry. Hi, are you there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, the answer to your question. The BancWest margin &#x2013; I would tend to say yes, because in the past, the BancWest margin was much higher than that.</p>
          <p>And the experience is that in the U.S., as all banks are working for profit, there is no mutual bank &#x2013; it's a country where people are all working for profit. So in general, the balance of the market is such that margins are somewhat better than that. So we &#x2013; the current 300 basis point is much lower than it used to be in the past, and clearly, picking up to 3.20 &#x2013; well, normally it should maybe indicate that we &#x2013; in the beginning of come back to a higher level.</p>
          <p>But we have already seen a few false starts over the last few years, and the last few &#x2013; I exaggerate &#x2013; the last two years. So we remain cautious.</p>
          <p>What is clear is that there is a recovery in the U.S. If the U.S. keeps recovering, which is a question for economists, not for myself. But if the U.S. keeps recovering, then normally the demand for new loans will increase. It's relatively sluggish at the moment. And in case the demand for new loans increases, normally margins should further go up. So we &#x2013; there is a clear possibility of that, I would say, at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just very specifically, short term, have we seen the full impact of that corporate deposit repricing in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No. Short term, you're right. Only corporate deposit impact could have some tail effect in the next quarter. That being said, it's short term deposit, so it's not a huge impact. The additional impact we can expect for the second quarter is not huge.</p>
          <p>And now the Investment Solutions outflows in asset management are coming &#x2013; they are mostly coming from money market, in fact, and to equity markets fund. So it's &#x2013; yes, it's partly from Fortis, but it's also partly from BNP Paribas. The most striking evolution is about the outflows from money market funds. And this is why it doesn't weigh too much on the profitably, because it's where the margins are the lowest.</p>
          <p>And it's due to the very, very low level of interest rate, and so money market funds in Europe are not very attractive anymore for clients. So retail clients already have, almost all of them have now moved to something else and something different. I mean, life insurance or another product which is paying a little bit more. And corporates are still using money market funds for commodity reasons, because it's very flexible for their treasury management. But nevertheless, they start looking for something else, because it's very, the return is so low. So this is what is driving the outflows from asset management.</p>
          <p>The return on equity, well, I would say that, if you set aside the regulatory changes which are looming, I would tend to answer yes to your question. I would tend to say that, yes, we are recovering relatively fast. And the outlook for say, coming back to 15%-plus return on equity is clear.</p>
          <p>That being said, we have &#x2013; and when we were making that answer six months ago, we had in mind also the regulation, which was in the making. And clearly, we will be &#x2013; well, we'll have to increase the equity of &#x2013; and compared with the past, the possibility of fine tuning the return on equity with share buybacks, for example, probably will be much more limited. So this is why I think, again, we can't give any guidance on the return on equity before we know the final set of regulation and the calibration of Basel III, which is currently still under discussion.</p>

          <p>Our next question today will come from Anke Reingen of Execution. Your line is now open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am from Execution. I just had three more questions, please.</p>
          <p>The first is on the exposure you gave of 5 billion of Greek government bonds. I just wondered if you were willing us to give us the split between AFS and trading? And then I was very interested in your slide where you basically tell us that 700 million of your revaluation within AFS and equity is due to bonds. Are you basically suggesting or would you be willing to say where this has moved to, as of like most recent?</p>
          <p>And then secondly about the deposit customer, deposit growth you saw across most divisions was certainly encouraging and sort of like do you think that's going to be sustainable and also going to be helpful for your liquidity ratios? Or does it come actually at some cost in terms of pricing up?</p>
          <p>And then lastly just I read your response to the Basel community for the capital proposals and I thought your comment was quite interesting with respect to the impact of market risk capital requirements for the end of the year and you talk about a very significant impact on market activities. Does this mean that for now, you think there will be any change or that's the current proposal basically I mean, the 50 billion, i.e. tripling of market risk-weighted assets is a number which is likely to come in higher, although obviously that depends on how the proposals will be worked out in the end. But would you still &#x2013; will you try for 50 billion? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Anke. Yes, about the Greek government bonds exposure, yes, I can give you the split. Around 500 million is the trading book, as we are the primary dealer of the Greek covenant debt, like we are of several other governments throughout the world. And it's 500 million, so the inventory, if you want, the working inventory is at 500 million. So the bulk of the 5 billion, 4.5 billion are available for sale and ALM bonds.</p>
          <p>The link to your next question about the AFS lack of gain, yes, it &#x2013; well, it means that while we have a lot different bonds in the portfolio and <mark type="inaudible" /> bonds and the fact that it has increased over the quarter is a combination of the fact that the proportion of the Greek bonds in the total was very limited and also, it was due to the fact that the market movements are complex and  the FX may offset each other.</p>
          <p>For example, as I said, if you look at the evolution of the yields of the different government bonds, you see that the Chairman government bonds, the French bonds and a few others, including the Belgian ones, including the Dutch ones, are going downwards, I mean. So their yields are going down and so their price is going up and this is due partly to the general evolution of the interest rate. But it's also due to the flight to quality, to a certain extent.</p>
          <p>And so the same movement which is increasing the yields of a certain number of government bonds is also decreasing the yield on other government bonds and the impact on the total inventory can be neutral or even positive.</p>
          <p>And on the customer deposits, I think we are in a low interest rate environment and in a low interest rate environment, sight deposits are always going up, because it's not worth managing your cash very strictly because it doesn't pay off, if you want. So more and more clients, especially retail clients or small corporate clients, are inclined to keep higher balances on their sight deposit and in some of the countries. In France, sight deposits are not remunerated. So the cost is nil and you don't need to increase the remuneration to attract those deposits, if you provide the clients with the good service for the rest of the banking service.</p>
          <p>So this is why I wouldn't say at cost, and not at all and I would tend to think the third quarter trend could continue as long as the interest rate environment remains very low, as it is at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now, thank you for having read our comments to the industry, because it was rather technical and heavy. The &#x2013; I think we, again, we are in discussion, all of us, I mean, all banks and we have not been the only ones, not only banks, but even corporate and also professional associations have provided the board of currency with answers and the European Union as well, with CRB number 4.</p>
          <p>So we are in the midst of all that discussion. So again, I think that it's not really a signal, I would say, meaningful to take the total bottom line of all the maximum application of all the measures as of course, again, this kind of menu, this kind of list has been given to us by the regulators precisely in order to be able to make a choice after the comments.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the last point, I thought you were also basically, because in the past you always were quite specific in terms of the impact of regulatory changes with respect to market risk capital at year end, and you always told us or sort like we're indicating or could be attributing of market risk-weighted assets. But it sounds as if this is less certain now given the discussion process?</p>

          <p>And then my second question is related to your CIB revenues. If you could maybe give us some color on the trend in April, maybe?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just to come back on provisions again, maybe on BNL, when do you think that the provisions would start peaking? They continue to increase, but do you hope to see a decline maybe end of this year?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on your provisions in personal finance, how confident are you on the asset quality of your 10 billion of personal finance booking in Spain and I mean, the cost of risk has been declining in the first quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter, but is that something we can be confident on? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I am sorry, but I am not going to answer to your first question for the reasons I have said already. And I am not going answer your second question either, so you are not lucky, sorry, because, well, we are releasing quarterly results and not monthly results.</p>
          <p>Your third question about the provisions on BNL, I would tend to think that the gain based on the historical experience and the lessons from the past, the time lag between the peak in CIB and peak in retail is yes, one year or so or a little bit more than one year. So I think it peaked in mid-2009 so the second quarter 2009 in CIB.</p>
          <p>I would tend to think that in retail networks, it should peak &#x2013; like BNL, it should peak, yes, by year end and even maybe somewhat earlier. Again this year normally, normally this year. Again, it's only the lessons from the past, and it's not an endorsement of any kind, because again, you cannot control the cost of risk, but I would say it's probable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then for the PS, yes, PS in Spain, we have, as far as Spain is concerned, we are indicating the PS on Slide 55, you have got the cost of risk as the percentage of outstanding in Spain for PS. And you see that it has peaked on the third quarter of 2009 at 434 basis points and is now coming down for the second quarter in a row 3.28%. We have taken, this is not just &#x2013; it's certainly getting, I would say, it's not by luck. I mean, we have worked a lot.</p>
          <p>I think it's the result of two things, it's the result, first of all, the fact that it started deteriorating very early, the consumer lending business in Spain started deteriorating as early as 2007, and we took very energetic action at that time. And as the loans are &#x2013; as the loans are <mark type="inaudible" /> because the maturity of a typical consumer loan is three years or something like that. The loans extended in early 2007. I would say before the beginning of the deterioration are now maturing early 2010, so it's really &#x2013; we are approaching the end of the back book, if you want.</p>
          <p>And the new production of loan has been really improved through several ways, strengthening the criteria, the risk criteria, dropping a certain number of partners, of retail partners which were &#x2013; where we were distributing loans that whose clients were not &#x2013; well, whose experience was that their clients were not paying very well. So we have improved our partnerships.</p>
          <p>And so we are &#x2013; well, we are relatively confident that the quality of new production is much better. So for &#x2013; and on top of that, we have taken significant steps in order to improve the recollection on Spain and we have increased the teams, we have improved the technology, I would say, the know-how and so we have improved the achievement in recollection. And so for all those reasons, the cost of risk is now go down and we think it's going to continue.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Pascal Decque of Natixis. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Philippe. Good afternoon, everyone. I have three questions, please. I am sorry I am going back to evolution of the cost of risk on one specific division. It's regarding BeLux. It's very, very low, I know there are many reasons for that, i.e. huge provisioning the past quarter. But could we have an idea of, say, the future cost of risk and potentially normalized one on that kind of activity in the future?</p>
          <p>The second question regard the revenues of the so-called order activities. I have some problem to rebuild the number last year, I found that wrong clean of every PPA or reservation on that. My number for the full year revenues of &#x20AC;300 million and one small clean of the PPA this quarter is &#x20AC;300 million, some problem to project my future number on this area? And the last one is regarding the potential or the change in regulation in derivative market. Could you give us at least a rough idea of the split between your OTC and a list of product per category, rates, credit, ForEx and equity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as for the cost of risk at BeLux, our view, yes, it's very low, I agree with you for the first quarter. We were surprised ourselves, I would say. I think again, it's the cost of risk on things you don't control quarterly. Yes, we expect &#x2013; while there is a seasonal aspect to it, because the first quarter is always low, I would say that in terms of normalized level, we would tend to think that the cost of risk at BeLux should be close to the French retail one and they should probably converge and even if at the moment, clearly, the cost of risk in Belgium is lower than in France.</p>
          <p>But we think that over time, it should more or less, it should converge and I don't know, maybe &#x2013; while in France, the normalized cost of risk in the non-crisis period, in the normal period, it has been something like 20 basis points or something like that in the past. So I think that this kind of 20, 25 basis points is something you can take for BeLux as well in the normal environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the order, yes. A lot of one-offs here and there, depending on the quarter and yes, they are the PP and so on, you are perfectly right. So at the end, we tend to &#x2013; you have to bear in mind that beyond all that, what do you have? You have the PPR revenues on the one hand, which is quarterly something like 60, 70 million, which are very, very stable more or less, but may change in quarters when they realize a capital gain when they sell property.</p>
          <p>And then you have the control Treasury revenues based on the pooled accounting which make that we are allocating capital and so paying the interest rate attached to this notional capital and at the same time, taking back the revenues of the real capital of the subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>So this kind of normalizing of the capital level of each division creates a situation where the corporate center is always higher at the beginning of each year, because at each end of year, we are taking back the revenues of each division, giving that &#x2013; another way to say that is to say that during the year, each division is enjoying the carrying profit, if you want, of its current P&amp;L, of its current results, which are positive in general. And at the end of the year, the P&amp;L is given to the corporate center and then the corporate center is paying the dividend during the course of the second quarter and also is paying for maybe acquisitions or paying for the new issues of subordinated debt and so on.</p>
          <p>So this kind of yearly movement of cash from the divisions to the corporate center at year end is always creating a positive result at the beginning of each year in the corporate center. So there is a seasonality in the corporate center. You have take that into account as well in your calculation.</p>
          <p>Then your question about the split, OTC versus listed. This is a very complex question. I don't have the precise proportion of that. But you have to bear in that mind to the way we are working on derivatives. And derivatives, our business is client-oriented and as such issuance, we tend to work on a OTC basis with clients. Virtually everything we do with clients is OTC basically. We are not a broker of listed derivatives, except &#x2013; well, there are some exceptions, but &#x2013; there are some exceptions. But the bulk of what we are doing is OTC with clients.</p>
          <p>And then hedging and dynamic hedging, and then the hedging is both on OTC with other banks or with other clients. If we are lucky enough to find another client exactly in the opposite &#x2013; exactly adding the positive interest of the first one, but also with banks, and on the listed markets, as well, when it's possible. Of course, these markets are less expensive, but at the same time, the contracts that some other guys are hedging is less efficient, is less tailor-made than what you can do with an OTC trade.</p>
          <p>And in general for one deal with a client, OTC, you need a lot of deals to hedge it, because it's a dynamic hedging, because depending on the evolution of the underlying product, you need to adapt and to adjust the hedge several times during the life of the OTC, the initial OTC deal with a client. So this is why the separation between listed and OTC is not like if we had two separate set of businesses, you have to bear that in mind.</p>
          <p>So overall, I think that OTC probably are presenting something like a little bit more than half of the total, or around half of the total for fixed income and probably less than that for equity derivatives. Probably 15, 20% for equity derivatives, which are more based on listed products, because the underlying is a listed equity fundamentally. So this is what I can tell you. Now if you ask that question in order to try and assess what could be the impact of some restrictions on the OTC derivatives...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to stress two things. The first thing is that there are two &#x2013; in the current discussions, there are two different aspects. You have the U.S. project, which is called the Wall Street Transparency Act or something that. Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act and which is at the moment, clearly aiming at even limiting derivatives to what is traded on an exchange. And this is very ambitious and it would limit derivative product sets to a very narrow one and virtually shut down all complex derivative markets in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And there is a European phone project of derivative, which is called EMIL, European I don't know what, EMIL, which is aiming more at trying to promote clearing of derivatives, not &#x2013; which is different from trading. And of course, I think the European view of that is that OTC, especially OTC with clients, with end users, would remain possible and just banks would be in use to clear those trades, those OTC trades, through clearing houses to limit the counter parties.</p>
          <p>And even if they can't do it because the derivative is too complex, too tailor-made and it's not manageable by a clearing house, because clearly exotic products cannot be cleared in a clearing house, because not always, the pricing itself is normally too difficult to manage. And then at least it should be declared in what they call a repository, trade repository house or trade repository, which is a place where at least there would be some transparency about the existence of those to trade, and it would allow a regulator to know what is going on, on the OTC market, because it's clear that the OTC market is both very useful for clients, because clients don't want to be obliged to pay daily margins, because it's extremely burdensome and it's something which they really are not prepared to do.</p>
          <p>And they need the derivatives, so their risk management, they want to keep doing that with banks on a OTC basis. But at the same time, the OTC market is not very transparent. So trying to combine those, both needs, if you want, by declaring &#x2013; registering the OTC deals in trade repositories, well, is something which would make sense. So this &#x2013; well, the discussions are going around that type of evolution.</p>
          <p>In our case, clearly, as long as we can keep working with clients on an OTC basis and provide clients with tailor-made products and bespoke derivatives, the impact on us would be small, I mean, few hundred millions per year maybe or something like that, because due to the constraints on the hedging side. But as long as we keep the client side more or less intact, it's impact on us would be small. More stringent regulation, like the one which is &#x2013; but at the moment only in the U.S., which is considered in the U.S. at the moment, of course would probably be more harmful. But we are very optimistic to &#x2013; at least for Europe, to keep the regulation a reasonable regulation.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two questions please. I think I missed some of the earlier part of the call due to technical reasons. Could you just update us on your strategic vision at Bank West, please? I've seen some headlines on you potentially being under the account for potential consolidation in the U.S. and you seem to be talking with a bit more enthusiasm about the business.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just a further question on funding. You and your domestic peers are pretty major users of REPO and then CP markets, commercial paper. Can you just give us a bit more color on how those markets are behaving at the moment in the context of the current stressors in the Euro zone? I know you feel very comfortable with your own liquidity situation, but I just wanted to hear your take on those markets at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, about BancWest, BancWest is clearly part of our core retail business. As you know, as I said at the beginning, it's very important for us to keep more than half of our business mix in terms of capital allocation in retail, more than half in retail and BancWest is playing a significant role in that business mix. And so we &#x2013; certainly, BancWest is an important part of the Group.</p>
          <p>In the current situation in the U.S., the price of banks is extremely low and the recovery has not yet translated into an anticipation of higher banks' P&amp;Ls. And as you &#x2013; as I have said as well earlier, clearly the achievements of BancWest are beating the average achievements of the industry, so a lot of banks are still losing money.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2010, something like half of our peers were in the red, BancWest is back in the black, but half of our peer group is still in the red. So we &#x2013; clearly, prices are low and while we are looking at some &#x2013; well, at that market and clearly, we have built BancWest progressively over time by acquiring small banks here and there in western U.S. and we could, if we have some good opportunity, it's something that we could do again in terms of, I would say, capacity implementation, capacity.</p>
          <p>BancWest is probably the only part of the group which is not impacted by the Fortis acquisition and so they have and they have the know-how &#x2013; or locally, we have the know-how of integrating banks. So it's something which is possible and we see the U.S. market as being still in the process of consolidating and so we have to position ourselves in that environment. So this is for BancWest.</p>
          <p>For the funding, while currently, really we have &#x2013; we don't have any problem in terms of funding or we don't see any significant change as far as our funding is concerned with the different instruments you are quoting. We &#x2013; I think that in those periods of fears, I would say, there is differentiation which is more and more operated and I would tend to say that its not the whole of the Euro zone which is under pressure, but more, I would say probably more part of it. And the same way, we see some gain, some government bonds being sold, but others being in demand of other governments, other countries. For the same reasons probably, we see &#x2013; while as far as we are concerned, we don't see any problem in funding. And while it's given &#x2013; well, it keeps being relatively easy to raise money at different maturities.</p>

          <p>Our final question today will come from Kian Abouhossein of JP Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I have a question on the process that you have in order to decide if you take a collective provision or you don't take a collective provision?</p>
          <p>And the second question, if you could give the duration of the AFS book on Greece, as well as the duration of your sovereign debt book or government debt book in AFS ex the insurance business?</p>
          <p>And the third question is on the Lincoln/Dodd bill, US swap push out, that would impact BNP Paribas. How do you see that and how would you react if such an extreme proposal would go through the Senate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The process &#x2013; I'll start with the easiest question. The process is very, very simple. We have two kind of collective provisions. The first one is quite automatic, I would say. It's the provision on a portfolio basis and certain banks are calling that incurred, but not yet reported losses. So it's &#x2013; in our case, we have &#x2013; our internal rating is on a scale from one for the best rate, the best clients, up to 12 for the doubtful loans and we have two levels of doubtful loans, 12 and 11.</p>
          <p>And so the current normal loans are from one to 10, but the 8, 9 and 10 categories are a kind of watch list, if you want, and clients which are rated 8, 9 or 10 slight improved we are &#x2013; we don't issue new loans for those clients. We can't initiate a relationship with that kind of client. So when we are downgrading clients in that region, 8, 9 or 10, which is a kind of interim situation, so it's not yet doubtful but it starts being fragile. Then on those outstanding amounts, classified as 8, 9, and 10, we are building collective provisions on the basis of expected losses. So it's quite competitive and of course, it's more for the 10 categories than for the 9 and more for the 9 than for the 8.</p>
          <p>So based on the probability of default of those clients and the loss given default for those clients, we base collective provisions with the reasoning that those clients, we extended the loans when they were not operated that way, when they were separated and now they have been downgraded, meaning that their situation is obviously less good then it was when we lent them money.</p>
          <p>And so this a kind of loss, but on the portfolio basis, to the extent that individually, each file is still a current file and working normally, but collectively, the probability for a certain number of them to become bankrupt or to become doubtful in the next period is increasing. And collectively, if we had this portfolio collectively, it is really embedding a latent loss. So this is the first kind of collective provision.</p>
          <p>Then on top of that, we have a second layer of collective provision, which is what we call sectorial provisions. And what we take &#x2013; we say sectorial, but it can be also on a geographical basis, so it's not only on an industry basis. And it's when a sector, an industry or a country or &#x2013; we did that for Ukraine for example, the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>When there is a hit, when there is something which is hitting part of our clients, even before the &#x2013; all the ratings are updated, because this process of updating the individual ratings will take some time, will take a few months. So even before this accident or this macroeconomic shock or whatever translates into a downgrading in the 8, 9 and 10 categories, we can take on the kind of judgmental basis, a sectorial provision. And in those cases in general, if it's significant, we mention that to the market because it's something relatively more exceptional than the automatic functioning of the first one. Is it clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's very helpful. Just, I mean, is it not fair to say considering that the CDS of Greece is assuming a probability of default over 50 that it would come into your lower end categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our &#x2013; sorry, Kian, but our functioning is based on our own ratings, not on the market prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when the market was heavily discounting France Telecom debt, for example, in 2003, we &#x2013; while according to our ratings, France Telecom was not 8, 9 or 10 rated, so we didn't take any collective provision for France Telecom at that time, just to give you an example. So we think we have &#x2013; it's our duty, we think, to have our own assessment of our own risk and not to rely on the market price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Now the duration, the duration of the Greek AFS, I would like to stress one thing. I am not going to answer to your question directly, because &#x2013; just because it's not &#x2013; to a certain extent, it's not completely relevant, because of course, part of the debt is short-term, very short term. But any way, we, in the framework of the current support plan of the IMF and the EU in the IMF and as always, by the way, in IMF-sponsored plans, banks are required and committed to maintain the level of their exposure stable throughout the duration of the plan.</p>
          <p>So even if we have a certain number of AFS which are going to mature in the next few months or weeks, we are going to replace them one way or another, in order to maintain our 5 billion exposure to the Greek government debt, small and stable, over the payer of the plan, which is a kind of rule of the game, which is usual for IMF-sponsored plan.</p>

          <p>Yes, it's really &#x2013; yes. I think that if it goes through, it really impacts the U.S. banks a lot, much more than the European ones. Because clearly it's again, a kind of remnant of the Glass-Steagall Act, which is most probably not going to be adopted in Europe and so I doubt that it would impact us too much to that extent. I mean, our European and Asian business wouldn't be affected. It would impact more in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Well, that being said, all the governments are very keen to stress that, that kind of banking regulation has to be adopted on a global basis with a level playing field and it wouldn't be fair for our U.S. colleagues, I mean, to be obliged to do that if we are not. So I think &#x2013; I doubt that this kind of extreme proposal can really go through.</p>

          <p>But it would imply that you would also have to separate at least your U.S. business, because you have FDIC financing for your BancWest operations?</p>

          <p>BancWest would remain on its own and it's completely &#x2013; there is no CIB at BancWest, so there wouldn't be any &#x2013; the separation is already made, if you want. And it would just imply for us to change the way we are working in the U.S. and probably to repatriate booking, well, more booking into Europe. As always, the swap book is already completely centralized in Paris, so everything which is dealt with is under the name of BNP Paribas Paris in the swap book.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions. The first one is related to Fortis synergies, could you perhaps give us a rough idea of what should be the split, sorry, of these synergies between the different divisions?</p>
          <p>Second question, just could you update us on the level of activity in April in your different division, especially in CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Brice. Yes, well, from the second question, again, I got it already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, no, no. But you know we, again, we are releasing quarterly results. I think it's already a fantastic effort at transparency, because we are releasing now something like 10 full P&amp;Ls each quarter, which is not the case of lot of competitors, especially for example, not the British banks. So we are not going to deliver monthly results before quite a while.</p>
          <p>So about your first question, the synergy, the split, well, the split, it's mostly CIB and Investment Solutions. The &#x2013; because the &#x2013; as you know, the retail, I mean the retail BeLux part of it is relatively small because we have limited synergies in the retail in Belgium, having no activities there before Fortis. So the bulk of the synergies are going to be made in CIB and Investment Solutions in those 42 million of the first quarter, it's something like two-thirds CIB and one-third or one-fourth Investment Solutions, something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask a last question, which I have top of my mind. The 5 billion, your exposure to Greek government bonds, does that include your exposure to Fortis AGI insurance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but you know the Fortis AGI is, we have 25% of its. So it's very small.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Philippe. One or two quick questions on BeLux Retail. I'd like to better understand the drivers between the &#x2013; well, behind the very strong growth in revenues?</p>
          <p>And then also the guidance in terms of juice effect of 3 points. You realized 8 points in the first quarter, so is it you being very conservative or is there some specific slowdown in terms of, I don't know, revenue growth or acceleration of cost growth we should expect? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good point. Good point. No, it's because I think that the first quarter of BeLux last year was a very bad quarter for Fortis, because it was in the midst of all the programs and you remember the difficulties of surrounding the acquisition project and the Fortis image at that time was bad. So it was not a very good quarter for them, so the basis for the comparison is somewhat easier at that time. And so this is why we &#x2013; true that we have beaten the cost-income ratio by far this quarter, but on average or for the year, it should be somewhat less. And this is why we are saying 3 points.</p>
