          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues. I would like to bid you a warm welcome to our annual media and investors conference of Volkswagen AG. As the title of our conference already indicates, we are welcoming the international analysts and investors and representatives of the banks for the first time here at the customer center of Autostadt.</p>
          <p>This is a sign of efficiency on the one hand, but also of transparency on the other hand, so as usual we will satisfy all of your needs for information today. What does it mean for the conduct of our conference? After the speech or the presentation by the members of the board, we will be inviting the media representatives first of all for a Q&amp;A session and after a short lunch break at around 12 o'clock, about one hour's lunch break, there will be a Q&amp;A session specifically for the analysts and investors.</p>
          <p>And my colleague Christine Ritz is going to guide you through this session. Work places for you and in case you haven't noticed it yet on the lower floor and of course they are at your disposal, the work places.</p>
          <p>Professor Winterkorn will be giving you a review of the past fiscal year in a moment and he will be followed by our CFO, Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, he will give you a detailed analysis of last year's performance and then Professor Winterkorn is going to give you an outlook for the coming months. I would like to ask Professor Winterkorn to take the floor.</p>

          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My colleagues and I would like to bid you a very warm welcome here in Wolfsburg to our annual media conference and investor conference.</p>
          <p>Since the fourth quarter of 2008 the global financial and economic crisis has had a firm grip on the automotive industry, like other sectors. Nevertheless, we are pleased to be able to give you positive news today because despite everything, 2008 was a good, a very successful year for the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>We made tremendous efforts throughout the entire company to achieve our ambitious targets and we did achieve them. Volkswagen was true to its word. The Group reported all-time record unit sales, sales revenue and earnings in 2008.</p>
          <p>Although on slippery terrain, we didn't slip or skid and we remain firmly on track. We are looking ahead already to the period after the crisis because one thing is certain, markets will pick up again and we are preparing very systematically for when this happens.</p>
          <p>But let's start with the 2008 fiscal year. The Volkswagen Group increased sales revenue by 4.5% to &#x20AC;113.8 billion. At 6.3 million vehicles we were able to post a new record in unit sales despite an overall decline in the market.</p>
          <p>For the first time we moved into the ranks of the top three in the global automotive industry. With an increase of 3%, our operating profit of &#x20AC;6.3 billion also set a new record. And one thing is beyond question: Without the dramatic slump in the markets in the fourth quarter we would have boosted our consolidated earnings up to an entirely new plane. Ladies and gentlemen, the Volkswagen Group has demonstrated that it can perform well even when the going gets tough and that is precisely our goal for the current year.</p>
          <p>It's not only the good figures that are responsible for our positive results for the 2008 fiscal year. We also reached new milestones in terms of quality. We systematically pursued the Volkswagen Way, meaning that we improved our processes, further cut our costs and again increased the productivity at our plants. We successfully debuted 52 new models, successors and product enhancements. This is an unbelievable pace which demanded an all-out effort from our team.</p>
          <p>And this work has paid off because our new products not only go down very well with our customers, they are also winning all key competitive tests and are being showered with awards and accolades by the automotive press, Green Car of the Year, winners of the Golden Steering Wheel in four categories, 11 Auto Trophy awards, the 2009 Golden Angel for the Golf and eight first place award winners for the Best Cars of 2009.</p>
          <p>All of this sends a clear message: The Volkswagen Group today has the most attractive and most successful model range of all automotive manufacturers and all this success is the result of a strong team performance. My colleagues and I would like to express our sincere thanks to all employees for the tremendous commitment and dedication they have again shown to our Group, our brands and above all, our customers. Strong products are the best selling point in difficult times, as you know. This is also shown by a look at our delivery figures.</p>
          <p>The global passenger car market declined by about 6% in 2008. The Volkswagen Group bucked this trend with an increase in deliveries. Our strongest growing regions were South America, Asia Pacific and China where we delivered more than one million vehicles for the first time in China, representing an increase of 12.5%. However, most recently the pace of growth has also weakened significantly in what were previously boom markets.</p>
          <p>The U.S. market slumped by 18% in 2008. With a decline of 4.5% the Group was able to improve its position in relative terms and gain market share. In Germany, our growth of 0.5% outperformed the market as a whole, which contracted by 1.8%. Our market share rose by 0.9 percentage points to 33.6%. In other words, every third new vehicle to hit the German roads in 2008 came from the Volkswagen Group.</p>
          <p>A look at the development of the individual group brands shows a mixed picture. This is due above all to the different segments in primary markets in which our brands operate. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand made considerable progress in 2008 in a number of respects, with new models such as the Passat CC and the Scirocco.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen's positioning is now more sporty and more powerful and younger than ever before. This is underscored not least by the further rise in our image ratings. Against this backdrop, Volkswagen's Passenger Cars brand maintained the previous year's high delivery levels at around 3.7 million vehicles. But, of course, market developments took their toll on us too. Deliveries fell by 3.1% in Europe and by 4.5% in North America. Central and Eastern Europe, South America and China were again the fastest growing regions.</p>
          <p>The highlight in 2008 was without question the new Golf. Experts agree the new Golf is the best Golf ever. It offers the greatest quality and is the most environmentally friendly Golf of all time. With emissions of a mere 99 grams of CO2 per kilometer, the Golf BlueMotion will be the environmental champion in the compact class.</p>
          <p>The good sales figures underscore that the new Golf is the right car at the right time and we too are very pleased with this vehicle because we were able to improve it across the board, while also cutting down on resources and costs.</p>
          <p>Audi continues to head for the pole position in the premium segment. Our colleagues in Ingolstadt posted the 13th delivery record in succession and the brand sold more than one million vehicles for the first time in its history. Audi recorded its strongest growth in Central and Eastern Europe and the Asia Pacific region. In China, where Audi leads the premium market, deliveries rose by more than 17%.</p>
          <p>The foundation for this success is that on average the Audi team launched one new vehicle every month in 2008. This has given Audi the youngest and I think the best model line-up today in the premium segment.</p>
          <p>The new Audi A4 recorded more than 250,000 orders in 2008, making it far and away the best seller in the German premium segment. In addition, Audi again successfully moved into a new segment with the Q5 compact SUV and it did so while further reducing production and development costs because this vehicle too is based on the modular longitudinal system.</p>
          <p>With their outstanding value for money and high utility benefit, vehicles from &#x160;koda do well even in times of economic trouble. As a result, &#x160;koda increased its deliveries in 2008 by a good 7% to around 675,000 vehicles. &#x160;koda recorded particularly strong growth in Russia, with an increase of 84% and the brand more than doubled its sales figures in China.</p>
          <p>Growth in India, one of the most promising markets of the future, was around 32%. The most important new model in 2008 was the Superb. Deliveries for the brand's flagship rose by 25%. The new generation sets higher standards in terms of outstanding quality, spaciousness and comfort and with emissions of just 136 grams of CO2 per kilometer, the GreenLine version of the Superb shows just how environmentally friendly large sedans can be.</p>
          <p>The SEAT brand at last has the right cars lined up at the start and that's why I can say that SEAT does not have a product problem, it has a market problem. The brand has been especially hard hit by the downturn in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>In Spain alone, where SEAT has a market share of around 9%, the overall market collapsed by around one-third in 2008. As a consequence, deliveries were down by 14.6% year-on-year to 368,000 vehicles. The brand was able to grow slightly in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>The new Ibiza made a successful debut in the market. For SEAT, this car represents a genuine quantum leap in terms of quality and design. With the Exeo, SEAT has added a supporting mid-size Sedan to its line-up. This car is based on the platform of the previous Audi A4 and is a prime example of how we leverage synergies in our Group. This collaboration with Audi, for example, cut development time and expenditure dramatically.</p>
          <p>Bentley celebrated its 10th anniversary as part of the Volkswagen Group in 2008. During this period the brand has recorded impressive growth. Following a good start to the year, Bentley too was unable to escape the painful collapse in the luxury segment. The overall 24% decline is due above all to its strong position in the United States, where around half of all Bentley cars are traditionally sold.</p>
          <p>Bentley is systematically adapting its production to the change in demand. The brand's core principle is still always to produce one vehicle less than the market demands and Bentley will continue to win over customers with exclusive highly personalized cars, such as the Brooklands which was launched in 2008.</p>
          <p>Lamborghini was again one of the world's most profitable automakers last year. Its deliveries increased slightly to 2,400 units. The decline in unit sales in the United States was offset by good sales in Europe and the emerging markets of the Middle East and Asia.</p>
          <p>Part of Lamborghini's philosophy is to present at least one exceptional new product each and every year. In 2008 the brand again upped the benchmark for super sports cars with the launch of the Gallardo LP 560-4, at the same time cutting its fuel consumption by 18%.</p>
          <p>In 2008 our colleagues at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles delivered more than half a million cars to their customers for the very first time. Sales in Europe were up slightly, mainly on the back of growing demand in Germany and Eastern Europe. Demand grew by around 24% in Brazil. The heavy trucks and buses produced in Mexico and Brazil recorded double-digit growth rates.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles is continuing to systematically expand its line-up. The Caddy is and remains the prime example for versatility and customer orientation. In 2008 this successful model series was extended by the environmentally-friendly Caddy BlueMotion and the all-wheel-drive Caddy 4Motion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, on the 22nd of July 2008 the Volkswagen Group increased its share of voting rights in Scania to 68.8% and consequently consolidated Scania. Volkswagen then acquired additional shares from Porsche Automobil Holding SE and increased its share of voting rights in Scania to around 72%.</p>
          <p>In the period from the 22nd of July to the end of 2008 Scania delivered around 30,500 vehicles to its customers. Some 50% of these vehicles were sold in Western Europe and about 20% went to Central and Eastern Europe. We are delighted that Scania is now the ninth brand under the umbrella of our Group.</p>
          <p>The integration of Scania has been successfully initiated on the basis of mutual trust and respect. Information and ideas are now being exchanged at all levels in a positive and constructive atmosphere. We have identified a large number of opportunities for closer cooperation, for example, in procurement and development and are working hard to implement these.</p>
          <p>Our investment in MAN has also developed favorably. In December we decided to sell Volkswagen's heavy trucks business in Brazil to MAN. We are convinced that together the two companies will be able to leverage their opportunities in the South American growth region even more systematically. This move means that the Group has now secured two strong pillars for its truck and bus activities, our successful investments in MAN and Scania.</p>
          <p>This will not affect the independent Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand, which will continue to systematically expand its light commercial vehicles business. We continue to have a strong strategic interest in this business.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, financial services are an important pillar in the Volkswagen Group in addition to our core automotive business. In 2008, Volkswagen Financial Services AG again supported the Group's growth path with customized mobility packages and through systematic internationalization. In a challenging environment our Financial Services Division performed well overall and again made a significant contribution to the Group's earnings.</p>
          <p>The growth of their portfolio by around 8% to 7.1 million contracts was particularly encouraging. Volkswagen Direct Bank, which increased its number of customers by around 26% to more than 1.2 million, also recorded very positive growth. We expect that the Financial Services Division too will have to face growing challenges in the current fiscal year as a result of the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>At the same time, though, we see considerable growth opportunities and not just in markets such as India where we recently established our own financing company. In Europe too, we aim to achieve a sustainable increase in the percentage of vehicles we finance or lease. The key to achieving this is even closer cooperation with the Group brands and this is something we will accelerate further.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, one of the reasons why the Volkswagen Group is more resistant to the crisis is because we can build on two strong shareholders with a long-term orientation, that is Porsche and the state of Lower Saxony. This makes us the envy of many competitors today more than ever. Our shareholders are not interested in short-term profit maximization, but in sustainable lasting growth, which is also in the interest of our customers and employees.</p>
          <p>Porsche Automobil Holding SE further increased its stake in Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft in 2008. At the beginning of January 2009, Porsche became our majority shareholder. We welcome this move because it follows a clear industrial logic that benefits both Volkswagen and Porsche.</p>
          <p>Together we've got what it takes to become the powerhouse of the international automotive industry. This automotive alliance offers tremendous potential, both in technical and engineering terms and in economic terms.</p>
          <p>This is shown by successful projects, such as our cooperation on the Touareg and the Cayenne, on the Panamera and on diesel engines, as well as the joint development of hybrid drives for SUVs. Although the path has been stony at times, we've made significant progress in recent months toward building our joint future and I'm sure that in 2009 we can and will press ahead with our partnership in what is going to be a difficult year for the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, following this initial overview of the 2008 fiscal year I'd like to now hand over to my colleague Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, who will elaborate on some key figures in detail. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dr. Winterkorn. Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to welcome you to today's annual media and investors conference here in Wolfsburg.</p>
          <p>Our company can again look back on a successful year in which we were able to exceed the previous year's results. However, 2008 was marked by economic turmoil for the automotive industry, especially in the second half of the year. So it naturally comes as no surprise that this development left its mark on us to, although we performed better than the market as a whole.</p>
          <p>Despite this challenging market situation we reached key targets we had set ourselves for 2008 and we were able to do this thanks to the tremendous commitment and hard work of all our Group's employees. 6.3 million vehicles sold worldwide in 2008 are evidence of the fact that our multi-brand strategy has paid off and that our young and attractive model range has indeed met customer's expectations. This means that we were again able to beat the previous year's record deliveries and we reached a new high.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen has a unique brand portfolio. It has a low consumption fuel efficient product range and an international footprint with local value added in key regions. Our ability to develop new models with innovative technologies and our solid financial base mean that we are well positioned compared with our competitors in the current crisis-ridden environment.</p>
          <p>Scania, which are now fully consolidated in fiscal year 2008, is another financially very successful company. It's now the ninth Group brand. It's fully consolidated and it further extends our brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen succeeded in further increasing sales revenues and operating profit in 2008. Volkswagen Group sales revenue last year was &#x20AC;114 billion, an increase of &#x20AC;5 billion year-on-year. The increase in our operating profit to &#x20AC;6.3 billion set another record. In addition, we again improved the return on investment in the automotive division to 10.9%, so we again improved it.</p>
          <p>Well nobody can predict with any accuracy how the current difficult situation will evolve and when it will end. And Volkswagen too will be unable to escape the impact of these developments. We do not yet appear to have reached the bottom, but we started at an early stage to weatherproof our Group.</p>
          <p>Thanks in particular to our systematic cost management and the optimization of our processes we have been able to safeguard our earnings power and hence ensure the Group's competitiveness in the long-term. Also, 2009 will be considerably more difficult than 2008 for the automotive industry and for Volkswagen we will continue to invest in our future and as in the past our investments will be selective and prudent.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a look at our income statement shows that we were able to increase sales revenue by 4.5% to &#x20AC;114 billion. Because the cost of sales rose at almost the same rate, the gross margin was slightly higher than in the previous year at 15.1%. I would like to note at this point that the cost of the sales includes depreciation and amortization expenses for 2008 from the purchase price allocation for Scania.</p>
          <p>Excluding these effects, the Group's gross margin would have risen by 0.6 percentage points to 15.6%. Distribution expenses rose year-on-year to &#x20AC;10.6 billion because of our intensified marketing activities. The increase in net other operating income by &#x20AC;847 million to &#x20AC;2.4 billion is primarily due to the positive effects from currency hedging.</p>
          <p>Overall, as already indicated, we thus recorded an operating profit of &#x20AC;6.3 billion. So in spite of the challenging operating environment we exceeded the 2007 figure once again. Net interest income was reduced by higher expenses from the measurement of financial instruments. By contrast, the share of profits and losses of equity accounted investments recorded an increase. Also, Scania is only included in this figure until the date of initial consolidation.</p>
          <p>All in all the financial result declined by &#x20AC;117 million compared to the previous year. Overall we recorded profit before tax of &#x20AC;6.6 billion, which is a slight improvement on the already high figure for the previous year.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense decreased by &#x20AC;501 million or 20.7% to just under &#x20AC;2 billion. The main reason for this was the change in tax rate as a result of the 2008 business taxation reform in Germany.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Group's profit after tax in 2008 amounted to &#x20AC;4.7 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 13.7%. I would also like to note at this point that you will find the presentation of the key figures and indicators for the fourth quarter of 2008 on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to examine individual items of our income statement in greater detail. The picture for sales revenue is as follows: In 2008 we've recorded total sales revenue of &#x20AC;113.8 billion, which is a 4.9 billion increase compared with 2007. Around &#x20AC;900 million of this increase is attributable to volume effects from our positive sales development, &#x20AC;1 billion to price increases and around &#x20AC;500 million to improvements in the country and model mix.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the unfavorable exchange rates impacted our sales revenue by &#x20AC;2.3 billion. The inclusion of Scania as from 22nd of July 2008 accounted for the largest share of the increase in sales revenue at &#x20AC;3.9 billion. The Financial Services Division made a positive contribution of just under &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>The performance of the individual markets varied widely in 2008. If we look at the regional breakdown of sales revenue we can see that growth in Europe, including the remaining markets, is at the same level as the worldwide average for the Group at 4.4%.</p>
          <p>In North America because of the negative impact of the exchange rate situation we recorded a 3.8% decrease in sales revenue. We were able to achieve disproportionate increases in the South America, South Africa region at 10% and in particular in Latin America at 12.2%, as well as in the Asia Pacific markets. I would also like to note at this point that the sales revenue figure for Asia Pacific contains only the deliveries to our Chinese joint ventures, the upfront deliveries, but not their own sales revenue in the Chinese market.</p>
          <p>This chart shows operating profit by brand and business field. The Volkswagen Group consolidated Scania as the ninth group brand on the 22nd of July 2008. The Scania brand's commercial vehicles and buses business is included in the figures for the Automotive Division. By contrast, the results of Scania's Financial Services business are reflected in the figures for the Financial Services Division.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Volkswagen Group's operating profit in 2008 increased by &#x20AC;182 million year-on-year. A particularly remarkable achievement is that Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi and Volkswagen commercial vehicles recorded a further improvement on the already high level of the previous year.</p>
          <p>I would also like to draw your particular attention to the positive contribution made by Scania. Despite the increasingly difficult situation for the capital goods industry in the second half of 2008, Scania contributed to the Group's successful performance with an operating profit of &#x20AC;417 million. This is impressive evidence of the strength and robustness of our new brand.</p>
          <p>Please note that the figures for the brands and business areas also include intra-Group transactions, especially intercompany profits, whose elimination is contained in the other category. Additionally, they contain this line other, which is called other, also contains the depreciation and amortization expense from the purchase price allocation for Scania.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a look at the reasons for the improvement in operating profit shows that volume, product mix and price effects had a positive effect totaling &#x20AC;100 million. Unfavorable exchange rates reduced operating profit by &#x20AC;800 million, especially because of the British pound.</p>
          <p>In particular the improvement in our product cost due to optimized procurement activities and productivity increases again had a positive effect on our operating profit. Over the course of 2008 we were able to record savings totaling &#x20AC;1 billion. This shows how systematically we are working on our company's cost structures and how we are continuously improving our margin situation.</p>
          <p>The improvement in fixed cost, ladies and gentlemen, made an additional positive contribution of &#x20AC;100 million to operating profit. The initial inclusion of Scania reduced profit by &#x20AC;200 million. This was because of the traditionally high depreciation and amortization expense in the initial phase following the acquisition from the purchase price allocation.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult situation on the financial markets and the associated higher costs for refinancing, the Financial Services Division again made a significant contribution to the Volkswagen Group's operating profit. Also it was &#x20AC;52 million lower than in 2007.</p>
          <p>Return on investment, ladies and gentlemen, is the core financial management instrument in the Volkswagen Group. It is the critical target variable for the financial assessment of all strategic and operational decisions. With an ROI, our return on investment of 10.9%, we not only earned our current cost of capital of 7.2% and thus generated a positive value contribution of &#x20AC;1.5 billion, but we also succeeded in exceeding our minimum required rate of return of 9%.</p>
          <p>And for the first time in the history of the Volkswagen Group we have reached a double-digit return on investment. I'm sure you will understand that we are particularly proud of this figure, which impressively underscores the fact that we have systematically increased our operating earnings power while maintaining our disciplined approach to investments.</p>
          <p>The Financial Services Division defied the crisis and recorded a very successful performance. Equity increased by &#x20AC;1.3 billion year-over-year to &#x20AC;8.4 billion. In addition to the positive profit for the year, the consolidation of Scania's Financial Services business and a capital increase by Volkswagen AG were the reasons for this growth. Because of the resulting higher average equity base, the return on equity before taxes decreased from 16.1 to 12.1%.</p>
          <p>In this context, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few brief remarks on our recourse to the Sonderfonds f&#xFC;r Finanzmarktstabilisierung or SoFFin, the German financial market stabilization fund. We monitored the capital markets closely and we came to the conclusion that conditions in the capital markets are being shaped by circumstances that have never been experienced before. We therefore decided to file an application with the SoFFin, the German financial market stabilization fund.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Bank has now received a guarantee facility of up to &#x20AC;2 billion from the SoFFin to refinance vehicle loans. Our objective in applying for the state guarantee is to safeguard the supply of loans or credits to our dealers and customers and thus cushion the effect of the financial crisis. The guarantee assumed by the SoFFin is the weakest form of support available from the fund and it is not linked to any state equity injections for Volkswagen Bank.</p>
          <p>Volkswagen Financial Services continues to have a sound capital base. The overall conditions for our refinancing requirements are still not optimum, but we can use stable market phases for capital market transactions.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the year, for example, we placed a &#x20AC;3.5 billion issue, the second largest in the Group's history, with a broadly diversified group of investors. The Volkswagen Group has thus already secured the significant portion of its expected refinancing requirements for the current year. So far we have not drawn on the SoFFin guarantee facility.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to the consolidated balance sheet, which for the first time contains Scania as the newly consolidated ninth Group brand. The Volkswagen Group's total assets at the end of the fiscal year 2008 amounted to &#x20AC;168 billion, which is a year-on-year increase of 15.5%. The Volkswagen Group's equity ratio rose because of the increase in equity from 22% to 22.3%.</p>
          <p>While the equity of the Automotive Division, after adjustment for minority interests which chiefly relate to minority interest in Scania, the equity of the Automotive Division amounted to &#x20AC;29 billion at the end of the year mainly because of the positive business development. This is 16.8% higher than in the previous year.</p>
          <p>At 32.6%, the equity ratio was slightly higher than in the previous year. The equity of the Financial Services Division increased by 18% to 8.4 billion and the equity ratio was therefore 10.6%. Group provisions rose from 34.3 billion at the end of 2007 by 3.7% to &#x20AC;35.5 billion. This enabled us to continue to take account of all identifiable risks.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd now like to come to what is probably the most important lever in the current crisis for managing the challenges that still face us. Because of the uncertainty about developments in the automotive markets over the next few months, our financial strength has top priority for us. What's crucial here is to safeguard our ability to take action at a financial level.</p>
          <p>Our net liquidity in the Automotive Division remains at a high level and provides us with a good financial basis. At &#x20AC;8 billion, however, net liquidity in the Automotive Division is &#x20AC;5.4 billion lower than at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, our acquisition of additional Scania shares; secondly, the increased investment in our operating business; and thirdly, the funds tied up in working capital, which are mainly attributable to high receivables and inventories as a result of the unexpectedly strong downturn in the markets at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Net cash flow, in other words, the difference between cash flows from operating activities and from investing activities, declined by 9.8 billion to minus &#x20AC;2.7 billion. Adjusted for the inclusion of Scania, however, net cash flow would have been slightly positive.</p>
          <p>The ratio of investment in property, plant and equipment or CapEx to sales revenue in the Automotive Division rose to 6.6% in the reporting period and was thus at the upper end of our expectations. Overall, investments in property, plant and equipment increased by &#x20AC;2.2 billion year-on-year to &#x20AC;6.8 billion.</p>
          <p>In addition to the new production facilities in Russia and India, we invested mainly in expanding our product range. This relates primarily to the further development of the BlueMotion range, the development of the Passat EcoFuel, which is a combination oil engine which can be fueled by both natural gas and petrol, as well as other low consumption technologies for the environmentally friendly car of the future.</p>
          <p>The main focus of our investments is on positioning the Volkswagen Group as a global economic and environmental leader among automobile manufacturers. We also spent significantly more on research and development in light of this strategy, with total R&amp;D expenditure of &#x20AC;5.9 billion, of which &#x20AC;2.2 billion was capitalized.</p>
          <p>An environmentally oriented range of vehicles and our excellent position in almost all markets worldwide enable us to leverage the strength of the Group and to systematically increase our competitive advantage. We too were surprised by the scale and dramatic nature of market developments in the final months of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our inventories increased significantly because of the fast pace of the slump in demand. In addition to the increased business volume, the primary reason for this was the unavoidable time lag involved in adjusting production to declining demand in the second half of the year. As a result we decided to align the company quickly and systematically to the current market situation.</p>
          <p>However, although we were able to release funds in the previous years, we closed 2008 with funds tied up in working capital totaling &#x20AC;2.3 billion. We are moving into 2009 with substantial net liquidity. We are continuing to work on safeguarding our cash flows from operating activities and matching working capital to the current volume situation. And we will continue to invest prudently in renewing and expanding our forward-looking product portfolio.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Volkswagen Group's profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG for fiscal year 2008 amounted to &#x20AC;4.75 billion. This corresponds to basic earnings of &#x20AC;11.92 per ordinary share. This result is an extraordinary achievement I believe.</p>
          <p>Although times will be tougher for us too in 2009, we are upbeat about the future. For this reason, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are proposing to the annual general meeting to increase the dividend of Volkswagen AG slightly to &#x20AC;1.93 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;1.99 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your kind attention. And now I would like to hand over or back to Dr. Winterkorn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. Ladies and gentlemen, when we met here in Wolfsburg 12 months ago, nobody could have suspected how this dramatic financial and economic crisis would shake the automotive industry to the core.</p>
          <p>Markets have collapsed around the globe and this massive downturn is continuing in the first quarter of 2009. The prospects for the global economy are deteriorating and Germany is in the middle of the worst recession since the Second World War.</p>
          <p>Nobody knows better how to cope with market cycles than we in the automotive industry. However, the current crisis outstrips everything I personally have experienced in 30 years in the automotive industry, that is the simultaneous dramatic slide in all major global markets; the profound loss of confidence at banks, in industry and among consumers; and the growing refinancing costs and the effects of the credit crunch on manufacturers, dealers and suppliers. And all of this is coalescing to form a highly explosive mixture.</p>
          <p>For the record, though, we must state that the financial crisis and its brutal spillover into the real economy is by and large self-inflicted. The lack of moderation and a continuous stream of excesses heralded a downward spiral that is shaking the financial markets to the core today. We are now seeing the return of a new realism.</p>
          <p>Everybody should by now have understood that responsibility, reliability and a healthy sense of proportion are the basis for everything, especially in business. Real values are experiencing a renaissance right now and this is something that we at Volkswagen welcome because this is the policy we have successfully been pursuing with conviction for many years.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it's a good thing that political leaders are demonstrating their ability to act in this critical phase. The German government has passed the largest economic stimulus package in post-war history and similar initiatives are underway in many other countries around the world.</p>
          <p>The committed pragmatic course adopted by the government is both right and necessary. However, a protectionist race to provide subsidies would be a dangerous development because it would distort competition and ultimately damage the entire European automotive industry.</p>
          <p>The bonus for scrapping old cars in Germany, the environmental bonus as it's called, shows how government can use pragmatic policies to stimulate demand. It is currently the best program for safeguarding jobs and protecting the environment and benefits everybody, customers and companies alike.</p>
          <p>In particularly, though, the environment wins because the best way to invest in environmental protection is and will continue to be buying a new car. That is why we are calling for this sensible initiative to be prolonged. Another reason is because the funds earmarked for this program will be financed by the additional VAT revenues the program itself generates.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Volkswagen has fared better than the competition so far, but we too are part of this world and cannot decouple ourselves from market developments for any prolonged period. We know it and we feel it.</p>
          <p>2009 will be an extreme year, a hard year for us, as well as for others. However, we also know that new rounds of negative forecasts, each more gloomy than the last, don't help anybody. Self-proclaimed and genuine experts alike are still in the dark about how long this crisis will last and how hard it will be.</p>
          <p>That's why at Volkswagen we have adapted a policy of sober realism instead of spreading panic, a healthy sense of proportion instead of random hectic activity. In doing so we are using all of the tools and instruments at our disposal to adapt our production flexibly to the change in demand. We want to and must keep our stocks at normal levels because every vehicle that we produce but do not sell ties up liquidity and endangers residual values.</p>
          <p>We are now reaping the benefits of our highly flexible Group-wide production system and the fact that Volkswagen has the right working time tools and instruments. We responded appropriately with an extended Christmas break, by using flexible time-banking accounts and by introducing short-time working where necessary. Our collective bargaining structures contain additional flexibility options, such as cutting weekly working hours and we can deploy these if needed.</p>
          <p>Our most important goal is and remains to keep our core workforce on board. This demands a great deal of flexibility from all sides and at this point I would like to expressly thank our employees and our labor representatives for their cooperative issues driven approach. The skills, creativity and commitment of our 370,000 employees are the basis for our success.</p>
          <p>Particularly in these times we must make an effort to attract the best minds to Volkswagen and that is why we will act responsibly in this crisis too and plan to recruit this year 2,855 new vocational trainees and 2,100 graduates across the company as a whole. Nevertheless, what's also clear is that the current situation demands hard drastic decisions. These include our decision not to prolong the contracts for agency temps.</p>
          <p>We know that this is painful for those who are affected by this decision and have performed well. However, temporary work contracts are a core instrument that allows us to adapt production now to the change in demand. Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever we must become even more competitive because this is what will decide our economic success and our ability to safeguard jobs in the long-term. And that is why we are systematically continuing to pursue the Volkswagen Way.</p>
          <p>In the current year we will again hold 7,300 workshops at our plants with the aim of improving work flows and processes and avoiding inefficiencies of all sort. This goal applies to the entire company too. We must and will improve productivity substantially in non-production areas. As well, duplication of work and inefficiencies in administration will be systematically identified and eliminated. Here too we will become leaner, faster and above all, more efficient.</p>
          <p>In the Volkswagen Group cost effectiveness is and will remain a permanent mission for every brand and every division and that is why we don't need any additional cost cutting programs right now. However, we are rigorously scrutinizing all costs and every single investment.</p>
          <p>Investments in additional capacity and baseloads are being postponed or canceled and we are putting the brakes on all expenditures that are not directly product related. What we will not be cutting back on, however, are our strategic vehicle projects because the future of the Volkswagen Group depends on them.</p>
          <p>Despite the current situation, the long-term goals that we have set ourselves for 2018 remain in force. We want to ensure that we, the Volkswagen Group, are leaders in the automotive industry. We want the most satisfied customers and the best employees and we want to grow profitably everywhere, highly profitably everywhere around the world.</p>
          <p>We have reiterated our strategy and focused it on the current challenges with our Group-wide 18 Plus program. 18 Plus stands for a more entrepreneurial approach through an uncompromising focus on our customers, disciplined cost management and a focus on our core future projects. It also stands for greater collaboration within the Group in development, production and procurement, as well as in sales and marketing and finally for more ecology, meaning environmentally friendly models and technologies. Our goal is to become the economic and environmental leader among automotive manufacturers. To ensure that the Volkswagen Group is in an ideal position when the crisis ends we are therefore bundling all our strengths and resources in three clear focus areas. First, further expansion of our vehicle line-up; second, our commitment to automotive growth markets; and third, state-of-the art technologies for environmentally friendly mobility.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, innovative, attractive and environmentally friendly vehicles are and will continue to be the key to the future of the Volkswagen Group. That's why we are continuing to budget more than &#x20AC;8 billion a year for development expenditures and investments in new models and environmental technologies. We remain committed to our new product initiative and will launch more than 20 additional completely new models by 2010. Where possible we will bring forward the market launch of vehicles that are ready, such as the new Golf GTI.</p>
          <p>In other cases we will let successful and profitable model series run rather longer. We will continue our highly selective approach to occupying new segments and niches. Successful models, such as the Volkswagen Tiguan and Scirocco, as well as the Audi Q5, show how much sense this strategy makes. And we're working intensively to diversify our regional portfolio.</p>
          <p>The world car is a thing of the past. Vehicle such as the Polo for emerging economies and the new mid-size sedan for the U.S. are the basis for growth. Starting in 2010 the New Small Family will create attractive new products in the A00 segment for both urban drivers in the west and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our modular systems or modular kits are the technical backbone for profitable growth. They ensure competitive costs, despite a high level of model and brand diversity. We have already successfully anchored the modular system philosophy at Audi. The A5, the A4 and the new Q5 are all based on the modular longitudinal system. The modular transverse system is the technical basis for the Group's future vehicle fleet in the A0, A and B segments.</p>
          <p>We're talking here about some three million units per year. In the Group we will develop more than 40 new models on this basis over the next few years. Our modular systems offer us a high level of flexibility, the flexibility we need, and at the same time they bring double-digit percentage savings in development, procurement and production, in other words, for both one-time and direct costs.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, personal mobility is and remains the engine of progress and economic development. People want to be mobile and their mobility must continue to be assured. The current crisis will not change this. The appetite for mobility is still huge, especially in China, Russia and India. That is why we're investing in our plants in these growth markets, as well as in efficient supplier structures and local distribution networks.</p>
          <p>Radical localization, high local content and a powerful distribution system are pivotal for profitable growth. Experts believe that Russia will be the world's third-largest automotive market by 2015. And our new plant in Kaluga starting in 2010 will be producing a version of the Polo that is tailored specifically to the needs of the Russian market.</p>
          <p>In Pune in India we're going to be officially opening our second plant at the end of this month with a capacity of 110,000 vehicles for the Indian market. In our second home market of China, 2008 saw the opening of our eighth plant in Nanjing and the launch of several vehicles developed in China, for China. This strategy is designed to double our unit sales there by 2018.</p>
          <p>In the United States we are sticking to our goal of selling around 800,000 Volkswagen and 200,000 Audi vehicles a year by 2018. Our new plant in Chattanooga will start producing vehicles specially tailored to the needs of our American customers in 2011 and I'm sure that by then at the latest the U.S. market will have recovered. And Volkswagen will be among the leaders of the pack.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the desire for efficient, environmentally friendly mobility is not just a fad. We have uncompromisingly aligned ourselves to this trend. That is why I can say with great confidence that the future of the Volkswagen Group is green. We have 132 models in our line-up emitting less than 140 grams of CO2 per kilometer. That's more than any other manufacturer. 29 of today's Group models emit less than 120 grams of CO2.</p>
          <p>In Germany, BlueMotion is by far the best known eco-label and our four efficiency-driven model series, Volkswagen BlueMotion, the e-models from Audi and SEAT's Ecomotive and &#x160;koda's GreenLine are spearheading a movement for saving without sacrifice.</p>
          <p>This aspect is important because when people buy cars in the future it won't just be their minds that make the decision, it will still be their hearts as well. And people want the entire range from clever sub-compacts through spacious family vans to luxury sedans.</p>
          <p>And the Volkswagen Group is positioned like no other automaker to meet these needs. And, ladies and gentlemen, there won't be any single car of the future in the medium-term. We'll see a mix of various drive concepts, efficient combustion, engines downsizing and DSGs, lightweight construction, intelligent electronics, natural gas vehicles, second generation biofuels, electric traction, hybrids, battery technologies, of course, too. And these are issues that will determine our future, ladies and gentlemen, and Volkswagen must be the technology leader in all of them.</p>
          <p>The further optimization of our TDI, TSI and TFSI engines is right at the top of our agenda because combustion engines, ladies and gentlemen, will remain the dominant technology for the foreseeable future. Volkswagen is driving forward this trend toward downsizing with small but powerful three-cylinder engines, as well as its eight and 12 cylinder engines.</p>
          <p>And yes, we will embark upon new paths and introduce SUVs and large sedans with state-of-the-art turbo charged and supercharged four-cylinder engines. In the long run the future belongs to electrification, e-mobility. However, I do urge the industry to come clean about this because no new technology ever hit the streets based on announcements alone.</p>
          <p>We are still a long way off from having the electric car for everybody that is affordable, designed for everyday use and above all safe. In the field of battery technology, in particular, manufacturers and suppliers have to overcome enormous challenges.</p>
          <p>At Volkswagen, development and production of electric motors is just one of Volkswagen's core competencies. Together with partners such as Sanyo and Toshiba we are selectively and rapidly expanding our expertise in battery technology. What we want to achieve is not necessarily the fastest, but the best solution for our customers. The first large volume Volkswagen electric car will appear on the market in the next decade with our New Small Family.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will systematically and prudently continue our new product initiatives. We are continuing to invest in our strategic growth markets, such as the United States, China, Russia and India. And at the same time we are investing massively, but selectively, in research and environmental technologies.</p>
          <p>But we can afford to do this all because the Volkswagen Group rests on solid financial foundations and because we have two strong major shareholders on board with long-term orientation. Let me put it this way, we are going to stay in the fast lane and our tank is full.</p>
          <p>For this reason I believe that the Volkswagen Group will take pole position in the period after the crisis when the markets pick up again. However, the most important selling point is and will continue to be our vehicle line-up. In 2009 we will launch a total of more than 60 new models, product enhancements and successors.</p>
          <p>In Geneva we unveiled the taste of things to come with the &#x160;koda Yeti, the SEAT Exeo Sporttourer and the Audi A5 convertible. We also presented the fifth generation of the Volkswagen Polo in Geneva. This is a car that's tailor-made for the current day and age. It's compact, high quality, efficient and emotional and all of this starting at just &#x20AC;12,150.</p>
          <p>I'm convinced and persuaded that the new Polo is the best subcompact in its segment. And in its BlueMotion 2 version it will be the most economical five-seater in the world at only 3.3 liters of consumption per 100 kilometers. We have brought forward advanced sales of the new Polo because of the tremendous interest in this vehicle and initial orders are extremely encouraging.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the first two months of this year show just how dramatic the situation is and will continue to be in our markets. The global market slumped by 23% and our Group recorded a decline of 15%. Germany is one ray of hope. The bonus for scrapping old cars here in Germany has resulted in a downright run on our dealerships. Measured by orders received, February was by far the best month for Volkswagen since German reunification. Deliveries for the Group rose by 11% and for our Volkswagen Passenger Cars they were up by 19.6%.</p>
          <p>So we shouldn't fool ourselves, though. The encouraging development in Germany at the moment stands in contrast to the continued dramatic collapse of the markets in the United States, Japan and the rest of Europe. For 2009 we are therefore currently assuming an overall market of well below the 50 million level. Last year the market was still 55 million new vehicles, while in 2007, let me remind you, it was about 59 million.</p>
          <p>Nobody can seriously predict how the markets will develop over the rest of the year and thereafter. The business outlook remains extremely uncertain and entails considerable risks. The Volkswagen Group's sales revenue will be below that of the previous year due to the declining unit sales situation. Rising refinancing costs and a deterioration in the country mix will serve as an additional drag on earnings. In such a situation we will not be able to reach the high level of earnings we achieved in previous years, but once again we expect to be in the black.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a difficult 2009 lies ahead of us, one of the most difficult years in the history of our company. Our stated goal remains for the Volkswagen Group to outperform the market as a whole and to gain additional market shares worldwide as a result.</p>
          <p>We have laid the foundations for achieving this. Together our nine brands not only have the necessary size, but also a technical, ecological and economic potential that cannot be matched by any other automaker. With nearly 180 models we now cover all customer groups and wishes across the globe and we have a unique highly efficient and diverse range of models in the pipeline. And last, but not least, we have the financial foundation for shaping our future ourselves.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Volkswagen is playing in the champions league, so there's no reason for us to be afraid of the difficult tasks that lie ahead. I'm absolutely convinced that the Volkswagen Group will be one of the winners in the crisis. We will continue to play an attacking game and we have our sites set firmly on our goal to be leaders in the automotive industry. Thank you.</p>
