          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Oracle Corporation Quarterly Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Amber. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call.

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken.</p>
          <p>I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.</p>
          <p>This quarter new software license revenue was $2 billion, up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars building off a 21% increase from last year. This was the result of a few things. First, in the last few weeks, really in the last few days of our November quarter, for the first time in a while, in some regions we saw an increase in last minute additional approvals required for previously scheduled and expected deals. As a result, we are putting in place better deal management so that we have the time and the approvals necessary to take this into account. Additionally, there was a 2% negative swing as the 1% currency tailwind included in our September guidance shifted to a 1% headwind for new software license.</p>
          <p>Technology new license revenues were $1.5 billion, up 4% in constant currency and U.S. dollars and applications were $569 million, off 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Within application revenue, ERP and CRM grew very well. Geographically results were mixed as Latin America and Asia-Pacific excluding Japan did well in constant currency in most products consistent with the growth in their economies, while the U.S., Europe and Japan were up a bit, flat or down. As I mentioned earlier, currencies moved a lot in different regions.</p>
          <p>In license we saw total new license growth rate of 1% in constant currency or flat in U.S. dollars in the Americas, and up 3% in constant currency or 2% in U.S. dollars in EMEA, while we saw 8% growth in J-Pac in constant currency or 11% in U.S. dollars. The quarter was not dependent on any large deals.</p>
          <p>Software license and product support revenues were $4 billion, up 9%. Support attach rates and software renewal rates continue at usual high levels.</p>
          <p>Hardware systems revenue was $953 million for the quarter, due in part to a product transition to T4 processor-based products as some customers moved to qualify the new servers and significantly slowed buying the older systems. We saw good early demand for the new SPARC SuperCluster but only released the product for general availability at the very end of the quarter, allowing us to ship only a couple.</p>
          <p>In sharp contrast, Exadata and Exalogic growth saw significant acceleration this quarter with triple-digit growth rates over last year's Q2. Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on the lower volumes. Total revenue for the quarter was $8.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency and U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>As for expenses, it was not a perfect comparison as in last year's number we got the benefit of $120 million in G&amp;A expense reduction as a result of SAP's expense reimbursement for settling a small part of our intellectual property theft lawsuit against them. Net of that, G&amp;A was flat.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $3.9 billion, up 3%, as we expanded operating margins to 45%. We believe there remains ample leverage in our business model and we believe we could be back at pre-Sun operating margins shortly.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.3%. EPS for the quarter grew 6% to $0.54 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow increased to a record $13.1 billion over the last four quarters, while free cash flow grew 45% to a record $12.6 billion. We now have over $31 billion in cash and marketable securities.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter we repurchased 33.1 million shares for a total of $1 billion. We have received an additional $5 billion in authorization for our stock buyback program, and the board again declared a dividend of $0.06 per share.</p>
          <p>Now to guidance. As you remember, we had an absolutely stunning third quarter last year, with new license up 29%, and non-GAAP EPS up 40% and GAAP EPS up 75%. Regardless, the fundamentals of the business remain strong, with pipelines growing significantly.</p>
          <p>Now I do read the daily financial news, so I'm going to take that into account for this quarter's guidance. With currency bouncing around, I'm going to give you constant currency guidance and as a convenience for you, I'll give what our U.S. dollar rates from the past few days. That currently amounts to about a negative 2% currency effect on license growth rates and on total revenue growth rates, but rates remained very volatile.</p>
          <p>Our guidance for Q3 is as follows. New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to plus 12%. So that's from positive 2% to positive 12% in constant currency and 0% to 10% in U.S. dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 4% to negative 14% in constant currency or negative 5 to negative 15 in U.S. dollars and that does not include the hardware support revenue. Total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant currency and 1% to 5% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 4% to 7% in constant currency and 2% to 5% in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.56 to $0.59 in constant currency and $0.55 to $0.58 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.54 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.44 to $0.47 in constant currency and $0.43 to $0.46 in U.S. dollars, up from $0.41 last year. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 26% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26.5%. Of course, it may end up being different.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Safra.</p>
          <p>This past Q2, Oracle sold over 200 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q3, we plan to sell over 300 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. In Q4, we plan to sell over 400 Exadata and Exalogic engineered systems. That would make our annualized Q4 engineered system sales approximately $1 billion. Then we plan to double that &#x2013; those sales again next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As our Engineered Systems business gets larger, it will drive revenue growth in our overall Hardware business. In Q2, we won some competitive deals because our engineered systems deliver much higher performance than IBM's fastest P-series computer. In Q2, we won other competitor deals because our engineered systems delivered much better cost performance than commodity Intel servers.</p>
          <p>Well, I'm going the start with Exalogic, the newer of our machines and talk about a few deals we won. At the University of Melbourne, they bought four Exalogic systems running our Fusion middleware where we beat Cisco Intel servers running VMware because the Exalogic systems were a lot faster and a lot more cost effective. But it was cost performance that won us that deal not peak performance.</p>
          <p>We won an Exalogic deal at the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. They bought five large Exalogic systems, full racks, to add onto their existing Exadata systems. They are standardizing now for a series of applications including identity management and a bunch of custom applications they're standardizing on Exadata and Exalogic.</p>
          <p>Amway bought two Exalogic systems, replacing IBM AIX on pSeries machines. The E-Business Suite, the Oracle E-Business Suite ran 12 times faster on the Exalogic machines than on the IBM pSeries. They are custom &#x2013; that's Amway's custom OLTP applications, which are &#x2013; were solo job applications &#x2013; ran 10 times faster than on IBM's pSeries machines.</p>
          <p>I know IBM's running a lot of ads saying they run faster &#x2013; that their machines run faster than ours, but I'd love to see their customer references because we haven't seen one. We've seen a lot of ads, no customer references. We have lots and lots of customer references where we're replacing pSeries and running much faster than IBM. I'd like to see one from IBM.</p>
          <p>Hyundai Motors, Hyundai Kia Motor Company, bought an Exalogic system. This was our first win in an account that has been a loyal IBM customer for more than 20 years.</p>
          <p>Exadata. Exadata came out quite a bit before our Exalogic machines, and some customers are beginning now to standardize on Exadata. A very large American smartphone manufacturer now has over 30 Exadata systems as they build their cloud. A large European bank has over 24 Exadata systems. ACNielsen moved their Wal-Mart data off their IBM mainframe &#x2013; off their IBM computer and onto an Exadata machine, where it ran queries 10 times faster, 10 times faster.</p>
          <p>We won &#x2013; four SAP customers moved their data onto Exadata to run their SAP ERP systems, and we're seeing huge performance gains as they move off conventional servers. At least one of those deals was competitive against SAP's HANA product.</p>
          <p>As Safra mentioned, our SPARC SuperCluster was delivered during the last week of the quarter, where Macy's bought two SuperClusters and the state of California bought one.</p>
          <p>Mark, turn it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, Larry, you talked about Exa- a bit. I thought I'd just put some numbers around it.</p>
          <p>First, it was just a very strong Exa- quarter. Our bookings for Exadata were a record; that includes Q4 of last year. The pipeline is the biggest we have ever had. We had the largest number of wins from new customers in Q2.</p>
          <p>Exalogic is ramping faster than Exadata. Sales more than doubled sequentially, and the first year sales for Exalogic are more than double the first year sales of Exadata.</p>
          <p>At Oracle OpenWorld, we announced two more Exas: Exalytics and the Oracle Big Data appliance, in addition to the SPARC SuperClusters that we just mentioned.</p>
          <p>We are now winning with Fusion apps in the Cloud. We won Brocade, Living Social and Rainbow Media in the quarter. 100 apps now available in the Cloud or on-premise. And we believe this to be a key differentiator.</p>
          <p>As Larry mentioned &#x2013; well, let me add that we have put 1,700 incremental sales resources into the field since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have shown strong expense discipline while adding these resources, while increasing our margins. Great new products and more sales resources drive more organic growth.</p>
          <p>On hardware, our introduction of the T4 SSC &#x2013; SSC for us is SPARC SuperCluster, have driven material pipeline for the back half of the year. As Safra mentioned, the T4 hurt a few orders for us in Q2 but the pipeline has grown materially.</p>
          <p>These are the most exciting SPARC products we have had in years. ZFS storage doubled year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter of consecutive growth for ZFS in a row. And again as we start lining up these pieces of differentiated IP, aligned with incremental sales resources, we will drive yet more growth.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Amber, if we can begin the Q&amp;A portion of the call now.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Question has to do sort of with the general backdrop here. It looks like the Americas had a very difficult comp this quarter and it doesn't get any easier next quarter. EMEA had a relatively easy comp this quarter. That actually gets more difficult next quarter. Asia PAC's comp gets a little more difficult too. So I guess, Safra, with the guidance, how do you get comfortable, you know, how do we get comfortable with your guidance? You obviously see a lot more than we do in the numbers and where it's going. But you've given guidance that, at least from our calculations, is a little better than normal seasonality from this quarter to next, realizing this quarter was a little bit below what you had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are a few things. The first one is clearly this quarter was not as we thought it would be and we've been taking a look at the deals that really should have closed and that would have closed, but for sort of a regular environment. And a number of them have closed or are on track to close this quarter. So we feel very good about it. We've expanded our distribution capacity enormously and so we have a lot more feet on the street. And we're looking at really the business overall and though I'm trying to bring in some level of conservatism because of just what I read in the &#x2013; about the economy, we are really comfortable that we will get there. That we should be there.</p>
          <p>There is no &#x2013; I mean, I suppose if there's a giant global financial meltdown, we shouldn't. But in looking at what happened this quarter, we don't actually expect that to repeat. And I think we'll have a much more normal next quarter. We have, as I said in the beginning, we've put in some measures so that we can monitor really what's going on and make sure we are on time with the appropriate approvals.</p>
          <p>Mark, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Solid pipeline, John, so it's quite strong. We're not forecasting a higher, if you will, conversion rate if you think of it from a pipeline perspective. And to Safra's point, we have more resources. So I think the combination of that aligned with our product portfolio, our product portfolio is just &#x2013; you know, John, I don't know how else &#x2013; I think we talked about it before. We just have the best lineup of products in the industry right now. So when you look across the apps portfolio, remember, we're going to market now with an apps portfolio that's only been refreshed over the past two or three months. You go to the T4 SSC product line, those were just released at Oracle OpenWorld. Larry talked a lot about the Exadata and I added on the Exalogic numbers from a momentum perspective. So you've got the lineup of product line, strong pipe and more resources. And we have confidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, has those new procedures that were put in place to sort of keep track and make sure these deals close, and Safra mentioned that some of these deals have closed, have they sped that up and has that also given you sort of the confidence...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to talk about what's going on in Q3. This is a Q2 call. But, yeah, I mean obviously we get to look at a lot of deals. Listen, this is the life we chose though in the context that there are always going to be big deals and it's our job obviously to get about the job of getting them closed but we get a pretty good view of them and, yeah, we feel good about the momentum that we've got. And I really have to fall into those key categories, which are how's your product line up? How's your sales resource lined up? And how is the pipe? Because we need pipe obviously going into the quarter. That's obviously our preliminary indicator. And those are the basic fundamentals behind the guidance, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you, and good afternoon. I wanted to follow up, Safra and Mark. You guys mentioned that in your comments to John about how you've been hiring aggressively and I think you mentioned you've hired about 1,700 people since the start of the fiscal year in your press release. Can you talk about, Safra, how you think about balancing kind of your EPS goals? And I'm not talking about November, but just as you look going forward over the next few quarters or next year. How do you think about balancing your EPS goals with the demand opportunity you see in front of you based on the pipeline and the product lineup that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with us it's always &#x2013; we're always very EPS-protection driven. If markets are more difficult, we're always the ones who are somehow able to bring in the EPS as a general matter. So we've taken a little bit of a lesson from this quarter and we'll continue to monitor it. Remember, a lot of this is our new product updates and support, product support and updates business. The overall business gets bigger. That is, of course, very profitable for us. And we think we can grow profitably.</p>
          <p>I want to point out that even in this quarter, our operating margins increased. Okay? Even in a quarter where we did not actually end up selling as many new licenses as we'd hoped, our operating margins increased, and we are really on track to get back to our pre-hardware company margins which puts us of course as still the highest operating margins in the software industry. And we have a $4 billion hardware business in us. So I'd bet on us to keep those earnings growing and protected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heather, just a follow up too. The 1,700, I want to make sure you're clear. It's a net number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't hire &#x2013; okay. So that is a net number minus attrition, 1,700 more people calling on customers. And to Safra's point, we've been very disciplined. Our margins went up while doing that. So to your point about protecting EPS, it is foremost in our mind to make more money while we do this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Larry obviously sounds very bullish on engineered systems and, Mark, you sound bullish on distribution. Yet the only thing that we're all scratching our heads with is the application's license number. You obviously sound pretty confident that the business will rebound in the February quarter. Just wondering if you can give us a little more color is it financial Services, public sectors or other verticals that are talked about within apps that is where you saw the pause? Or maybe you could take a vertical cut at it? I know you have a strong presence in industry vertical solutions. Is that where you saw the pause? And consequently what gives you the confidence that we might see a snapback in spending, if this hypothesis is correct, that it was narrow, that the weakness in application license was narrowed to a few pockets? That's it for me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, where we saw real strength is in CRM, where we were double-digit growth, close to 20%, and ERP did very well. However, where we had some weakness was in some of our vertical markets, which are longer sell cycle and which need to be managed very, very carefully. And so we think those are actually going to recover. I will tell you that generally in public sector, we are actually doing reasonably well in U.S. public sector, as they're very good customers for our engineer systems and things like that. So I think we actually expect a snapback more as we get into more regular management of those deals in the vertical markets, which are generally long sales cycle, larger deals, have to be managed well.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Just two quick questions. First for Safra and Mark, could you maybe talk about just the dynamics between the applications and database and middleware businesses in terms of license revenue? And kind of how you're thinking about that when you put together your guidance for next quarter's acceleration in license revenue growth versus this quarter? Just kind of maybe compare and contrast the two?</p>
          <p>And then to Larry, one of the things you mentioned was...</p>

          <p>All right. Thanks. Sorry about that. I was wondering if you can compare and contrast the database and middleware, and then the applications businesses, just in terms of guidance for next quarter and just the business trends that you're seeing there and how you think about that rolling forward?</p>
          <p>And then a follow-up for Larry, just in terms of HANA versus Exadata. You mentioned a win there directly versus SAP. Wonder if you can give us your thoughts on that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In general, we expect both database and applications to be strong next quarter, actually. The reality is that we've got extremely difficult comparisons, frankly, in both, and in database particularly, but we do expect really &#x2013; obviously a significantly better quarter in Q3 across the board. Larry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were a series of benchmarks at the customer where they compared HANA, SAP's in-memory analytical database, and they compared the performance of that against just our Exadata database machine, and Exadata was faster.</p>
          <p>Which I think surprised a lot of people because Exadata is not what we'd line up against HANA. That is not our product that we line up against HANA. We have a product called Exalytics, which is our in-memory analytic database.</p>
          <p>But it was interesting that our database machine, which is a combination of memory, flash and disk, outran HANA without Exalytics. With Exalytics, we're 10 times again faster. So we're fairly confident that if Exadata can beat HANA, Exalytics will beat HANA by even more.</p>
          <p>So again, that came as a surprise to us.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. My question's about the hardware business. It sounds like you saw a little bit of a product transition this quarter in the hardware business. Is the assumption in the guide that continues for the third quarter? And are you still pretty confident that the hardware business can grow into the double digits, even as potentially the macro environment gets a little softer into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are going through a transition. The transition &#x2013; we went through a microprocessor transition where it all begins, as we introduced T4.</p>
          <p>And that &#x2013; some people were looking at buying T3 delayed and qualified T4 and are buying T4. I think that hurt us a bit &#x2013; that definitely hurt us a bit in Q2. We think that's going to help us a bit in Q3 and help us even more in Q4.</p>
          <p>SPARC SuperClusters, again, we just were able to deliver right at the end of the quarter. But we think that's going to &#x2013; we're going to start selling that aggressively into the installed base, the Sun installed base, and we already have a large pipeline for that.</p>
          <p>On top of that &#x2013; but the big thing, the thing that really moves the needle are Exadata and Exalogic have been out there for a while. As I said, we sold 200 last &#x2013; in Q2. We'll sell 300 in Q3. We'll sell 400 in Q4. It's very easy to remember. Q2 200, right. Q3, 300. Four &#x2013; we didn't plan it that way but that's the way it's turning out.</p>
          <p>As that becomes a larger and larger percentage of the total, I mean clearly that's going to drive two things. It's going to drive top line and it's going to drive margin. And we think that's what &#x2013; we think the hardware business could turn around and show growth as soon as Q4. And we'll definitely go &#x2013; I think we'll &#x2013; I'm very confident it will show double-digit growth next year because we'll have all of these new products out.</p>
          <p>And I'll let Mark comment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only a couple. I think one, that the T4 migration from T3 was a big jump. You're talking about 2.5 times the performance on the microprocessor. And you could not upgrade in box. So that's a big deal for customers that when I buy something, I get some &#x2013; I've got a migration path, which we will have with T4 to T5.</p>
          <p>So a big &#x2013; we have a T5 &#x2013; the range of products now coming out give us a different position in the market. So now the fact that next year when T5 comes out, you'll be able to upgrade from T4 to T5, and that will sort of eliminate some of this pause that you just heard us describe, because now if I bought a T3, I have to go do a complete replacement to get to a T4.</p>
          <p>So these are just the things you have to do as you start to improve the IP and the product line. You've seen us improve ZFS. You've seen us do it with T4. You see that now manifesting itself in servers out there. You're going to see it show up in what we've done in tape earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>So we've refreshed the product line. This is all separate from Exa-. We've put more feet on the street. We feel very good about our competitive position. So that's where we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Mark, just on the sales capacity adds, you've been quite aggressive. Does Q2 give you pause to potentially slow that a little? Or are you still aggressively moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I think we would continue to be aggressive where it makes sense.</p>
          <p>We're in a unique position here. We're one of those companies that's &#x2013; I don't want to make this sound too corny but we're one of those companies people want to join. Salespeople want to be part of companies that have great products, that have a great market position.</p>
          <p>So we've got to make sure, to your point, that we're hiring the right ones. And that's what we're doing. We're trying to be very particular that we're getting the right folks. And of course, to your point, we're trying to make them productive and put the infrastructure in to assimilate and get them productive as quickly as we can.</p>
          <p>But we're going to be very, very aggressive at looking for good talent. But I want to make sure I add the point that was mentioned earlier. Within the context of disciplined expense management, we feel like we need more distribution, and we're going to continue to try to get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow up for Safra, just on the additional approvals that you needed. Was the common characteristic they just needed more time? Or are you starting to see some of the customers come in and talk about some of their budgets being more constrained and they're downsizing some of their projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we haven't seen what you said &#x2013; the second half &#x2013; what you've seen, which is downsizing. What we did see with folks where all of the sudden the CEO had to approve it or something like that, where before it was all set.</p>
          <p>So we haven't had them come back and tell us their budgets are down or anything. And as I said, in some cases, things closed literally the next day or a few days later, once the approval came in. But those things, when we do run them sometimes right to the end, you just run out of time.</p>
          <p>And we've seen this before, and I think that we can manage it, now that we understand it, and that we put it into the process again. I think we've got it handled.</p>

          <p>And we'll take our final question from Rick Sherlund with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Larry, could you reconcile the numbers you gave for Exadata and Exalogic? I think it adds up to 1,000 or 1,100. Didn't you say 3,000 just recently? And I think the company originally guided to 2,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you elaborate? Is it turning out to be a harder sell? Are you trying to figure out how to sell it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I think we're going to be &#x2013; we're growing Exadata about &#x2013; the growth rate is around 150% Exadata, and Exalogic even faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, let me make sure you're clear. What Larry said earlier was tripling the growth and installed base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tripling the installed base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And driving that. And that's the same metric we're on. So you're hearing the same number within the context of a different way of describing it.</p>
          <p>So let me make sure you're clear, Rick. There is no more difficulty in selling Exadata, and there is no issue with pipeline. It is quite the opposite. And we're also comparing what we book versus what we ship, so there are a couple of different numbers that are running around here.</p>
          <p>We are going after that same metric that Larry described before. You are seeing probably not anything more than us now manifesting <mark type="ph" /> that self (35:25) in quarterly numbers that are coming out. So it's very positive.</p>
          <p>I think the biggest news within it is &#x2013; no change in the Exadata trajectory, and I don't want to say this is a surprise &#x2013; but the speed of the Exalogic ramp is probably the &#x2013; it may not be a surprise to Larry, as he's nodding his head at me, but it is very, very positive. We are seeing a faster ramp of Exalogic than we did Exadata.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I still don't understand. Are you talking about selling more...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, Rick, if your question is &#x2013; we set a goal of tripling the installed base. That was our goal. And we probably won't triple it. We'll probably increase it by two-and-a-half times.</p>
          <p>If that was your question, are we going to triple? And then you added up the numbers, and said look, it made more like two-and-a-half than triple, that's right. We're only going to grow it by two-and-a-half times.</p>
          <p>We had a very aggressive set of targets, and we are taking huge amounts of share from IBM at their high end. We're taking share from Teradata and Netezza, everybody. This business again will be at a $1 billion run rate, if you annualize our Q4 numbers, and it will be $2 billion the following year. But will we have hit our units tripling? No, we'll probably fall a little short of that.</p>
