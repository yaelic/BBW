          <p>Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.</p>
          <p>However, before we begin with the opening remarks I'd liked remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the Frequently Asked Questions document which is available on our website or on request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $1.08. This is flat sequentially and $0.02 lower when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all prior-year amounts have been restated as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sales of Wilson and CE Franklin in the second and third quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we reported $0.04 of integration charges and $0.02 of charges relating to workforce reductions in connection with an initiative to rationalize global overhead costs. The Smith integration charges were a little larger than our historical run rate due to the fact that we incurred a number of agency terminations and facility exit costs during the quarter. Going forward we do not intend to highlight these integration costs separately as they are not anticipated to be significant.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Of this $567 million sequential increase approximately half of this growth came from the year-end surge in product, software and WesternGeco multi-client sales that we typically experience in Q4. Oilfield Services pre-tax income of $2.2 billion increased 1% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins were down 83 basis points as the positive effects of year end product sales were not enough to overcome the impact of the higher than usual seasonal slowdowns in activity and contractual delays experienced during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Sequential revenue and pre-tax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 8.2% sequentially and margins improved 31 basis points to 29.1%. These increases were largely driven by the traditionally strong end of year software and multi-client sales offset in part by the impact of lower WesternGeco marine vessel utilization. It is also worth mentioning that testing services, wireline and petro-technical services all experienced sequential margin growth as a result of more favorable revenue mix.</p>
          <p>Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.1 billion increased 2.2% while margin declined by 128 basis points to 16.8%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to robust drilling and measurement activity in the Middle East and Asia area and a strong performance from M-I SWACO in the Europe CIS Africa area. The margin decline was primarily due to contractual delays in IPM [Integrated Project Management] and an overall less favorable revenue mix.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.8% sequentially as a result of strong Completion, Artificial Lift product sales across all areas combined with new Framo subsea projects. Pre-tax margin was essentially flat at 15% as the impact of the strong Completions, Artificial Lift and Framo performances were largely offset by continued pricing pressure in U.S. Land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in the market.</p>
          <p>From a geographical perspective North America margin improved by 65 basis points to 19.2% while international margin declined 104 basis points to 20.5%.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion representing a $1.1 billion improvement as compared to the end of third quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.5 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of approximately $850 million.</p>
          <p>Yesterday our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in our annual dividend to $1.25 per share. This follows last year's 10% increase and the 19% increase in 2011, and reflects our commitment to generate and return excess cash to our shareholders. During the full-year 2012 we repurchased 14.1 million shares at an average price of $68.99 for a total of $972 million.</p>
          <p>We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter as our buyback activity for the first nine months of the year more than offset the dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs during all of 2012.</p>
          <p>CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012, which included an acceleration of part of the first quarter of 2013 CapEx.</p>
          <p>And now I turn the conference over to Paal.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Simon.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter results showed continued growth in key markets in addition to the typical year-end product, software and multiclient sales. However, while revenue grew sequentially by 5% to set a new record for the company, pre-tax operating margins slipped by 83 basis points, and I will elaborate on this as I review the operational results by region.</p>
          <p>Looking at the international markets, revenue grew by 6% sequentially while margins were down 104 basis points from the three-year high of last quarter. Overall service activity and product sales were strong during the quarter. However, results were impacted by the previously-stated seasonal slowdown and contractual delays, and also mobilization costs for several new projects. International service capacity remains tight in our Seismic, Drilling and Measurements, Wireline, and Well Testing product lines, while pricing in terms of revenue per rig continued its slow but steady progression during the fourth quarter, driven by strong execution, new technology sales, and proactive bidding on small- to medium-sized contracts.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, revenue was up 11% sequentially and margins up 30 basis points, driven by strong activity throughout the region. In Mexico, rig activity grew both offshore and on land, with additional coiled tubing and stimulation work focused on unconventionals, as well as a full deepwater well testing program. Activity in our IPM projects remained robust, and the ramp-up in our Carrizo and P&#xE1;nuco SPM [Schlumberger Production Management] projects continues according to plan.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we saw strong sequential growth driven by our Seismic and Well Testing product lines, while overall offshore activity continued to shift from deepwater exploration in the Santos Basin towards development and production enhancement work in the Campos Basin.</p>
          <p>In Argentina, activity also picked up during the quarter, driven by drilling and stimulation activity in the Neuqu&#xE9;n Basin and from the startup of a new IPM project in the Vaca Muerta Shale.</p>
          <p>In Venezuela, we have in recent years actively managed our activity levels relative to our receivables balance. During the fourth quarter we saw a significant slowdown in the rates of payment, and we are currently working closely with our customer to resolve the situation.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 10% sequentially while margins were down 91 basis points, driven by activity mix and startup costs for several IPM projects in the region. During the quarter, we saw the strongest growth in the Middle East, where activity on both land and offshore in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates led to record revenue levels in these countries.</p>
          <p>In Iraq, revenue grew over 60% sequentially, also reaching an all-time high as we started up the remaining rigs linked to our recent IPM contract wins. Operational execution continues to be strong on our well construction project in Iraq. However, delays in obtaining the needed regulatory approvals impacted startup timing for several projects, and consequently, profitability for the quarter.</p>
          <p>China again posted strong results, with the seasonal slowdown on land being more than offset by activity growth offshore in Bohai Bay and the South China Sea. The focus on unconventionals in China remains very strong, and based on the strategic moves we made in 2012, we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity going forward.</p>
          <p>And in Australia, we continue to grow in the fourth quarter as rig activity ramped up further in our IPM project in the Queensland coal bed methane, and also due to strong offshore drilling activity in the Northwest.</p>
          <p>In Europe, CIS, and Africa, revenue was down 1% sequentially and margins were down 203 basis points. In the North Sea we saw the start of the seasonal slowdown, in particular for seismic activity, which had a significant impact on the sequential results. However, we maintain a positive outlook on the North Sea for 2013, driven by both exploration and development activity in Norway and the U.K.</p>
          <p>In North Africa, further contractual delays also had an impact on fourth quarter results. While these delays continued into January, we expect the situation to be resolved during the first quarter. Sub-Saharan Africa had a good quarter on offshore activity in both West and East Africa.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2013, the outlook for the region remains strong driven by East Africa exploration, Angola pre-salt activity and Gulf of Guinea exploration and development work.</p>
          <p>Russia and Central Asia saw flat sequential activity driven by the start of the seasonal winter slowdown both on land and offshore. However, we see solid growth in the coming year both in Western Siberia, the Caspian Region and in Sakhalin and the first Arctic project is also expected to start up in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In North America sequential revenue was up 4% and margins were up 65 basis points driven by very strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico. In North America Land our results were again negatively impacted by lower than expected activity in Canada and by an 8% sequential drop in the U.S. Land rig count. In our Hydraulic Fracturing business the lower pricing levels continue to penetrate our contract base and further impacted margins in the fourth quarter. In addition, with the drop in liquids activity we also saw clear signs of pricing weakness in our drilling, coiled tubing and cased-hole wireline product lines during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Still the continued weakening of North America Land margins was more than offset by strong activity and excellent performance in the Gulf of Mexico where deepwater drilling activity reached pre-Macondo levels as expected. In WesternGeco we continue to operate one dual coil fleet in the central Gulf while multiclient sales saw the normal year end increase driven by the central Gulf lease sale scheduled for March of this year. Overall our strong operational and market share position in the Gulf of Mexico is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American margins.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group WesternGeco completed the first IsoMetrix season, which included three commercial projects. IsoMetrix results represented at the SEG annual conference in November of 2012 and the technology continues to attract a great deal of attention as exploration of difficult and complex reservoir prospects continues. The first Explorer Class vessel upgrade to IsoMetrix, the WesternGeco Vespucci, is currently underway and two IsoMetrix vessels will be available in 2013.</p>
          <p>In December 2011 we announced the purchase of the U.S. company ThruBit, which offers a pump-down openhole logging suite that enables <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:56) logging of horizontal wells. In 2012 ThruBit saw a rapidly growing client base and the 93% increase in revenue. Recently the technology has been successfully applied in the Bakken to optimize the stimulation design in the horizontal sections helping to improve productivity and to reduce costs.</p>
          <p>In the Drilling Group our drilling and measurement product line saw increased uptake of the NeoScope sourceless formation evaluation service. This technology offers a comprehensive suite of 12 formation evaluation measurements while eliminating the need for the traditional source and thereby reducing operational risk. The uptake has been widespread covering North American shale plays, Japanese methane hydrates, conventional reservoirs in the Middle and Far East and remote deepwater exploration work offshore South America.</p>
          <p>In the Production Group, Well Services introduced the SPARK frac fluid delivery platform in 2012 offering our vertically integrated customers access to Schlumberger's engineered fluid systems such as HiWAY while utilizing their own personnel and hydraulic horsepower. The uptake of the new offering progressed well during 2012 with over 1,100 stages sold to a growing customer base in both the U.S. and China and we expect continued growth for this offering in 2013.</p>
          <p>Also in the quarter we announced the creation of OneSubsea, a joint venture with Cameron to manufacturing and develop products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. This market represents a unique opportunity for growth as the new joint venture seeks to create a step change in the reservoir recovery through integration and optimization of the entire production system over the life of the field. The integration of the production system will be accomplished by combining superior reservoir knowledge and well bore capabilities with industry leading subsea technologies altogether delivering enhanced productivity, reliability and integrity. We anticipate closing the transaction during the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to the macro environment where there continues to be uncertainty. However, GDP growth outlook for 2013 remains in line with the previous quarter at the back of positive data points from China and the U.S. and a more or less unchanged situation in the Eurozone.</p>
          <p>Looking at the global oil market, 2013 demand is expected to grow at similar levels to 2012 excluding any major macroeconomic changes. The supply side will see further growth in North America while the rest of non-OPEC production will likely continue to face challenges leading to a fairly similar global OPEC production in 2013. Based on this we do not see any major change in the global spare capacity in the coming year and we expect Brent prices to remain in a broadly similar price band as seen in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the international gas markets LNG prices in Asia are expected to continue to benefit from high demand in Japan and China while in Europe the impact of lower demand is expected to be offset by declining domestic production leaving the market balance relatively unchanged.</p>
          <p>Looking at our industry, there have been no material changes to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter and we expect international E&amp;P spend to grow around 10% in the coming year. Based on a favorable activity mix and continued focus on execution we expect to grow our international operating income in excess of this number in 2013.</p>
          <p>In North America we see continued market uncertainty going forward. U.S. land liquids activity is expected to recover somewhat in the first half of the year but for the full-year we see U.S. land rig count slightly down versus 2012. U.S. natural gas production remains strong and at this stage we do not see a significant recovery in dry gas related drilling activity in the coming year. Based on this, the industry will still be faced with oversupply of hydraulic horsepower.</p>
          <p>In addition, the lower rig activity in the fourth quarter has already created pricing pressure in many of the non-pressure pumping product lines in U.S. land which will create further pressure on North America land margins going forward.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we expect the overall market trends of 2012 to carry forward into 2013 with solid growth in international spending and strong activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with the offsetting factor being continued challenges in North America land. In this environment our well balanced business portfolio, wide geographical footprint and strong operational execution capabilities position us well to capitalize on these trends and to continue to show good growth in overall earnings per share.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly another good move higher this quarter for international volumes but a little margin slippage, as you highlighted. It seems to me the contract delays, the startup cost &#x2013; this is all pretty transitory. Is that accurate? And if so &#x2013; take out the seasonal factors I guess, for a second, when do those type of startup costs and delays &#x2013; when do those abate or have they already abated at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I agree with you. The impact we saw in profitability in Q4 is down to mix, some of these transitory delays and the seasonal slowdown, as you're referring to. So most of these issues are more or less behind us in terms of what was unusual for Q4. We will continue to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea, Russia and China land in Q1. And the only other lingering issue that we have is the contractual situation in North Africa. But overall, the issues that were exceptional in Q4 are more or less behind us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good to hear. And then, we obviously agree with your international E&amp;P spending outlook for this year. What do you see as the biggest growth areas for Schlumberger this year? And are there any markets that you think could be particularly challenging as well, excluding North America land?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if we look at international next year, we will see the most significant growth in ECA [Europe/CIS/Africa] and MEA [Middle East &amp; Asia]. We will also see growth in Latin America, but the overall activity levels in Brazil is more or less flat year-over-year, so that will have an impact on Latin America growth. But if I look at ECA, we see significant growth overall in Sub-Sahara Africa where we have a very strong position, and we also see quite significant growth in Russia. So I would say ECA the main growth locomotive next year will be Sub-Saharan Africa and overall Russia, both land and offshore. And then in MEA, I would say overall the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, but also Kuwait, UAE, Oman will all be very strong for us. And in Asia, it's predominately China and Australia, which is going to be driving growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, Paal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to maybe hit you up on the North American front, and I know that there's still quite a bit of uncertainty on the U.S. land, but I think the indications are that there's going to be a pickup in sometime here in the first quarter. So with the pickup in activity on the horizon, wouldn't it be safe to assume that margins would pretty much hit their low points in aggregate for North America land in the first quarter? And if not, can you just kind of walk us through how you see things evolving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not ready to predict exactly when North America land margins are going to trough. There's one new element of uncertainty this quarter, which is further pricing pressure outside of hydraulic fracturing, right? But if you look at our view on 2013 for North America, we do expect U.S. land rig count to be up between about 100 and 150 rigs in Q1. And this is based on the feedback from our customers, that's in line with what you're indicating. Now in terms of activity for the full year, we still see U.S. land rig count slightly down versus 2012, while the well count will be slightly up. Now, if you look at Canada, the rig count is already over 500 so far in January, but we still see the full year also being down in 2012 versus &#x2013; sorry, down versus 2012.</p>
          <p>Now then the other major uncertainty in North America land is pricing, so it seems clear that we will continue to face oversupply of horsepower given the rig count outlook, so we don't really see any significant recovery in hydraulic fracturing pricing in the coming year. And then you have the ongoing uncertainty where we saw about a 5% pricing drop on average in the other product lines on land in Q4, and this is going to have an impact going forward. But I would say at this stage, the further evolution is not clear, and I think it's going to be a function of how quickly the rig count climbs back up going forward, right? So I would say that in North America land, there will continue to be margin challenges, at least in the coming two quarters, as far as I see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow up &#x2013; thanks for that. And as a follow-up, obviously the Gulf of Mexico has kind of been a positive dynamic. Can you give us some indications of what you might expect for, maybe, revenue growth in the Gulf of Mexico year-on-year, and is that all going to be driven by just the Oilfield Services product line? Or is it going to be some combination of Seismic and Services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we expect both drilling-related activities as well as Seismic to be strong in the Gulf of Mexico for this year. If you look at the rig activity, we don't see any major rig additions in H1 after we had the surge of, I think, seven additional rigs in Q4. But I mean overall, rig activity year-over-year will be up more than 20% with that Q4 addition. In terms of Seismic, we are continuing to run one Seismic fleet in the Central Gulf. We'll see what happens in terms of late sales leading up to the new sales now in March, but I'm also continuing to be positive on Seismic in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Paal, I wonder whether you could just elaborate a little bit more here on OneSubsea. You talked about the importance of enhanced recovery subsea a little while ago &#x2013; you closed the deal. Now that you've had some time to reflect on it, could you help us understand a little bit more how having access to OneSubsea will change the core business at Schlumberger or enhance it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, first of all, the creation of OneSubsea will allow us to make a much more significant entry into the overall subsea business. We have some very good I would say niche technologies and Framo has seen tremendous growth in recent years but it was evident that we needed to combine that with a much broader offering. And I think Cameron is going to be an excellent partner for us with that in mind.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a bit early to say exactly what the impact on the rest of the business is going to be. If you look at the rest of our business, a lot of that will be focused around the life of field part of subsea &#x2013; around well intervention, which is not something that we are immediately going to focus on in OneSubsea. But the fact that we are much, I would say, deeper entrenched in the business through this JV will allow us to move a lot closer to the customer side that focuses on these type of developments. Overall I see it as a strong positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it enhanced recovery at the tail end of a field that you think is the opportunity for Schlumberger through having access to &#x2013; I'm talking about impact on Schlumberger's core business, not what goes into OneSubsea? Or is it getting involved early stage in helping how to design wellbores and with, based on the knowledge that you have from the reservoir side and how that could impact the design of the field development? I'm still not sure if I understand exactly how it's going to enhance Schlumberger's business the most.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a good question. So it's actually both. So through the OneSubsea JV we'll obviously be much more involved with the customer discussions around how to develop these fields and it has to do with our reservoir characterization capabilities and it also has to do with our I will say wellbore capabilities around ESPs and intelligent completions. So I think both as reservoir understanding as well as the wellbore capabilities that we have will be integral to how these developments will be done in the future and then you add a much more intelligent wellbore to a more sophisticated production plant on the sea floor including both boosting and compression and potentially separation &#x2013; that is how the overall developments, in my mind, are going to be done in the future.</p>
          <p>So we will have that early involvement where through the JV we will potentially second people with reservoir background and well background into the project teams and then beyond that you have intervention and I would say later field activities that we will continue to be involved with as the life of the field progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it sounds as if you're trying to lift Schlumberger's position versus the oil company to a higher level at an earlier stage in how fields are developed. Would that be correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question would be on IsoMetrix. Could you give us any kind of feedback from these initial studies on how they have helped your clients solve more complex issues? Are there any examples of that now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's still early days, right? But we've done three commercial surveys in this season. I think it will take a little bit of time to process the data but the early indication from what we have seen from the data together with our customers is very positive, right? And the ability to, I would say, image the reservoir much more accurately will benefit in particular the prospects that are more difficult to image.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, finally Simon, I would just like to congratulate you on helping rein in the CapEx here and drive free cash flow and if you could also convince your guys to do some more buybacks then I think that would be very good for the share price.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, Paal, Simon, I don't know which of you want to address this one but I do want to follow up on Ole's comment on the lower CapEx and in particular as it relates to asset turns and the efficiency initiatives that are currently underway. There are two aspects in particular that I'd like to ask you to address. One is the reliability of the tools and two is just overall utilization. Both seem to be going up quite a bit with revenue growth forecasts up and CapEx down. Could you speak to those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Michael. Let me take just the overall CapEx. So as we said we will spend $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to what we spent $4.7 billion. It is the shift of activity obviously that impacted our decision to lower CapEx and we in 2012 had accelerated a bit in the Q4 what we were going to spend in 2013. But you're absolutely right. The efficiency plans and programs that we have will improve the tool turns and asset turns that we experienced in the past. It is an early stage in 2013 to see significant impact from this but it is a plan that is going to take several quarters, if not years, to get to an optimum situation, but it is reflected in 2013. The major part in 2013 is really more of an activity shift, acceleration in 2012 and to a lesser extent the performance that you referred to but performance eventually will be a major factor in determining the CapEx spend in Schlumberger and between the different segments. Is this good enough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's very good. Thank you. And maybe Paal for the follow-up, I'm curious if internationally there are any signs of an emerging interest in tight oil or unconventional applications to conventional reserves, or even shale oil. Is what's happened in the Bakken and Eagle Ford starting to go global yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's a general high interest of unconventionals all around the world. We find it in many countries. What &#x2013; where we stand today it's still in earlier stages in most places where there is all about data-gathering I would say exploration in terms of can these resources be developed in an economic and a viable way. If I look at the two countries, which are probably furthest down the road on doing something that is more material, it is China and Argentina. And China is predominately focused on the shale gas at this stage while I think there's more of a balance in Argentina between liquids and gas. So those are the two countries, which I think we'll see the most activity increase in the near-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So from a field standpoint it's still very much a gas focus but is it fair to say that oil is perhaps emerging from a science standpoint at this point? Or is it still too early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's still too early to say how predominant that's going to be. I think the interest is there for the shale. There's a lot more data-gathering and testing that needs to be done to see what the balance between gas and liquids.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>While the sub-sea tree market continues to grow, investors have been disappointed by the drop in Cameron's market share. Now that you've had a chance to look under the hood at their business what do you think of the prospects for share gain in trees by OneSubsea and what can Schlumberger do to help push for a greater share of awards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to make any specific comments about Cameron market shares or trees. I think we've had a very good dialogue and discussion with Cameron in terms of their view of the market versus our view the market. We have very coinciding views that it is very important to try and do something differently and focus a lot more on production optimization and recovery optimization. The tree will be a key part of that but there's also a lot of other aspects around the subsea production plant as well as I also referred to earlier in terms of the wellbore technology and reservoir understanding. So when it comes to the situation around Cameron trees market share, I think you need to talk to Cameron about that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Paal, with regard to your outlook, you mentioned that your expectation was for international E&amp;P capital spending to be up 10% and your growth in operating, international operating income to outpace the 10% growth in overall E&amp;P capital spending. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for international revenue growth? I would expect that you would also expect that to be up, outpace the overall growth in the E&amp;P capital spending as well? Is that correct or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's fair to say. I'm not going to go into the details of exactly what our numbers we are targeting, but I think it's fair to say that both revenues and operating income, we are aiming to grow that faster than that spend or rig count increase, right? Just for reference, if you look at our 2012 numbers, we grew revenue at 16% internationally and operating income by 31% at the back end of an 8% growth in rig count. So I'm not saying we're going to repeat those numbers, but I think there is potential, and we have capabilities of doing what I was just saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any reason to believe that your international incremental margins are going to be markedly different from the close-to-35% number that you generated in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's anything that is dramatically different in the international market 2013 versus 2012. While we can do the exact same incremental margins, we will obviously continue to focus on doing that, but I'm not promising anything at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last one for me. Can we talk a little bit about the Saudi outlook? Coming out of the third quarter call, you mentioned that activity in 2013 for Saudi was going to be strong, largely based upon the pretty considerable increase in activity over 2012 and persisting over the course of 2013. But you did not expect, if memory serves, for activity in Saudi Arabia to grow considerably in 2013 versus exit 2012. Is that the same position that you have today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think, based on our discussions with Saudi Aramco over the past quarter, we have changed it slightly, based on that respect. So as you said, at the end of the year, on about 134 rigs, which was pretty much in line with the plan that Saudi Aramco laid out early in 2012. We saw very strong Hanifa activity, <mark type="ph" /> ringlet (40:46) activity in the Q4. And also they're starting up a deepwater rig in the Red Sea in addition to the shallow water exploration that they have there. Now in terms of the outlook, we are expecting around 160 rigs, up from the 134. So 160 rigs by year-end 2013, that's the latest news that we have from Saudi Aramco.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 160 versus 134 is actually considerably better than what you saw coming out of the third quarter call, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Paal, I believe you see China as one of your fastest-growing GeoMarkets in 2013, and it is already a fairly good-sized market for you. Can you talk about some of the opportunities there, and can you also discuss the traction you've seen with the Anton Oil joint venture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can. So if you look at the market trends in China, for a long time we had a very strong position offshore in Bohai Bay. But on land our market access has been more limited, mainly due to the Chinese operators predominately using their own Chinese service companies to do their work. Now with the unconventional activity and the many new players entering there, this really opens up the land market. And at the same time, we're also seeing higher demand for new technology, and also under the IPM business model from our traditional Chinese customers as they embark on more complex land projects, right? So at the back end of these trends, we've done a number of strategic moves in 2012, as you know. The 20% stake in Anton Oil is one. The other thing we did with Anton Oil was that we formed a JV with them, focused on IPM projects <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:38) on China lands. So it is still early days for that JV, but we are actively pursuing work and it gives us another, I would say, entrance into the China land market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very helpful. And then on North America you mentioned the 5% drop in pricing in your non-pressure pumping product lines in Q4. Are you still seeing softness in pricing in Q1? Are you seeing any slowing of softness in Q1 or is it status quo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't really have a lot of information yet on Q1. So that's why I'm saying it's still uncertain. We saw that drop in pricing in Q4, which was partially linked to the softness in rig activity so it's unclear yet whether that is going to continue down in Q1 or whether the rig uptake which we are hoping to see will stabilize it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as a follow-on then on Pressure Pumping &#x2013; given the softness in pricing what would it take for you to consider unstacking equipment? Would you need to see long-term contracts? Or would you need to see better pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we operate on the product of pricing and utilization. So if that product is over our target or hurdle, we will reactivate fleets. We're not planning to do any of that at this stage but we're obviously continuing to follow the situation closely. In Q4 we kept the crew count flat versus Q3. So we didn't lay down anymore crews in Q4.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about &#x2013; you mentioned not only in the press release but in your prepared comments regarding you're starting to at least be proactive on bidding on the small and medium-sized contracts in terms of international pricing push here. Just curious what kind of success rate are you having so far in making that push? And what's really driving that in terms of you feel like now is the time to do that? Is it because we've pretty much booked, if you will, or seen in the rear view mirror the big, larger tenders that were a source of price competition last year? Those are behind us. It's now given you a better fairway to go ahead and push more aggressively on these small or medium-sized contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's fair. As we've talked about throughout the conference calls in the past year we have been pushing or testing pricing on these smaller to medium term contracts basically throughout 2012 and I would say our success rate has been reasonably good. You win some and you lose some whenever you try to push pricing up but I would say overall we're pleased with the contract wins we have for those type of contracts and that type of pricing strategy. So you're right to say that on the large contracts which is multi service line and also multi-year, multi-rig, it is still quite competitive but most of those contracts which still represent a relatively small part of our overall contract volume, most of those contracts are already bid. Most all of them are awarded but most of them are bid based on where we stand in the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And I guess just one follow up. I guess fair to say, Paal, given your comments around the operating income growth you see internationally I guess fair to think that your earnings growth 2013 versus 2012 you're still expecting that to be double digit &#x2013; double-digit growth this year. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say we're overall still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013. So this is assuming no major setbacks in the global economy and also no further significant setbacks in North America, all right? So I already highlighted the key growth drivers in international being ECA and MEA while the offsetting factor is going to be what's happening in North America land. But yes, overall we're still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013.</p>

          <p>Okay. If I could slip one more in. Everybody's trying to do the math in terms of just looking at your North America performance and clearly you note the Gulf of Mexico contribution. Is it fair to say maybe &#x2013; Simon it's a question for you &#x2013; a quarter of North America revenue this quarter is coming from the Gulf of Mexico? Is it that high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's correct that the Gulf of Mexico increased &#x2013; compensated for the drop in land, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But in terms of just the percentage of your revenue contribution North America from the Gulf it's about 25% this past quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit lower.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Paal, you mentioned the increase in the Saudi rig count this year. Can you characterize about where that growth is coming from? Is that primarily natural gas related?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't have the details on it. There's some obviously there's some natural gas in it but it's obviously still oil as well so I don't have the breakdown for you. I have the breakdown in terms of drilling and workover, the 160 is about 117, 118 on drilling and the balance of 42 being workover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you discuss some of your unconventional workover there? Is that starting to become a bigger part of your business over there? Are you sort of on the reservoir characterization stage? Or are you starting to kind of go at these wells and starting to look at doing some horizontal wells this year or are you expecting to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll leave most of the commentary to how Saudi Aramco wants to communicate around their unconventionals to them but we are enrolled with a project, which is still largely in the exploration type phase, right? So still it's limited in terms of oil activity what we are involved with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could just, a completely unrelated follow up, on your North American market you talked about your SPARK initiative somewhat contributing this quarter, can you just kind of give us a sense as to basically how many kind of pressure pumping fleets that would represent? In other words, how many fleets are you not using and using and applying SPARK? And also who are the ideal customers for this initiative &#x2013; for these initiatives?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so if you look at the number of 1,100 stages, it's obviously not a very big number at this stage and that number is also split between China and the U.S. so it is not a significant part of our overall capacity or revenue that is coming through this model but we see it as an interesting model as we continue to develop these engineered fluid systems &#x2013; frac fluid systems. So overall today it is not significant but it's a new business model that we believe could grow to be more significant over time.</p>
          <p>And the type of customers that we view this is typically the either smaller independent players you want access to higher technology frac fluid systems, or vertically integrated customers that we do this for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess my last question related to that is, there seems to be quite a bit of shift in operator behavior in North America over the last six months. What would you attribute that to? I hear a lot of talk about budgets being used up and whatnot, but is this simply just about field economics and their efforts to lower service costs? And if so, where do you think they are in terms of their goals of cost? Are they satisfied where service costs are now? You just mentioned pricing in some of these other products have come down. That sort of implies to me they're not really satisfied? How do you think about it in terms of their economics right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say all the customers in North America that I'm talking to are still looking for us to help them drive more cost out of the system, whether that is efficiency or technology. Exactly what transpired in H2 or in particular Q4 in terms of the lower activity, it could be a combination of lower commodity prices, in terms of the subset reference prices below the WTI. I also think that a number of these customers have been operating more sort of 100% cash flow and they felt it was prudent to scale back and then also you had quite a significant impact of the holiday season in Q4 so I think all of these elements were contributing towards the drop in activity so I don't think there's been a real material change to the economics but I think the proof of that is going to be what happens now in Q1 whether they're going to be ramping back up again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Paal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll go to the line of Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Paal how do you see seismic vessel supply/demand and pricing shaping up for the spring/summer season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at our overall market outlook for seismic remains positive. The capacity in the market still remains tight. If you look at our bookings for Q1 we're more or less fully booked and Q2 is filling up relatively fast so most of the pricing, sorry, most of the bids that we have won for Q1 and Q2 are more or less at the same pricing that we did in Q3 and Q4 which is about 10% up from that reference price of 2011 so it hasn't been a further increase in pricing as of yet. But we still see the opportunity now to test pricing further for what remains to be booked for Q2 and also for H2. So we remain positive in terms of our outlook for the market. I'm not really concerned about overcapacity in the market at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my follow-up question, Paal, is for the formation evaluation business in deepwater, I think your competitors were targeting a big push in that area given that this is the most exciting growth area in the global oil service market. Do you feel now that we're well into this upturn in deepwater with still &#x2013; a big part of it still ahead, that you've maintained your market share globally in terms of doing FE work on ultra-deepwater wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm very comfortable with both our technology portfolio, how we continue to execute in these type of projects and overall the rate that we are winning work at, right? So I don't think there's been any negatives around this. And in fact I think we continue to perform very strongly both in terms of market share, revenue growth and profitability. So I'm pleased with the progress that we're showing on the formation evaluation side on deepwater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is this an area, Paal, that could show above average price increases too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, pricing is already quite strong in these type of environments linked to the higher rig rates and also linked to the &#x2013; I would say high importance our customers are putting on operational integrity and reliability. So it could be that we could see more pricing power there but I would say pricing there is already quite strong.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow-up question on the Gulf of Mexico. You highlighted the strong growth in North America offshore. I was wondering if you could give us some sense &#x2013; obviously there's some seismic in there in the Gulf and mistake me if I'm wrong, but you include Canada and Alaska in there. Was all of that stuff between seismic in the Gulf of Mexico &#x2013; was there any big contribution from Eastern Canada or Alaska in that offshore revenue increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are included when we talk about the offshore in North America but both Alaska and Eastern Canada are relatively small compared to the size of our Gulf of Mexico business. I would say the predominant driver of the sequential increase in revenue is the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then another question on Mexico. As international markets go it looks like it's going to be one of the more positive ones for 2013. Could you give a little color or insight as to how you see that market developing over the next couple of years between some of the onshore activity and now they're getting more active offshore as well and what product lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean overall we're seeing pretty solid growth in activity in 2013 for Mexico both land and offshore. There is deepwater activity going on, there is conventional shallow water activity and then you have a range of class of activity on land all the way from the unconventionals in the North. You have normal third-party work and we have the IPM and SPM type of contracts.</p>
          <p>For 2013 in addition to the growth in activity what we're also seeing is we are facing significant tendering activity in the next couple of quarters and what we're also seeing now is that several smaller players from U.S. land is starting to show up in Mexico, which could make the whole tendering environment even more competitive. So we'll see how that plays out. But that's one aspect that we are looking at.</p>
          <p>The other key part for Mexico is also that Pemex continues its overall transition towards the production incentive type of contracts and we really like this model. And we compete quite well in those types of bids. And the latest we've heard from Pemex is that the Chicontepec SPM bid round is expected to be around midyear 2013 so we'll obviously be preparing for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could just have one more quick follow up. Paal, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. In your comments earlier did you say you anticipated about a 100 to 150 rig increase in the U.S. rig count in the first half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the customer feedback that we've had we are saying up between 100 and 150 rigs in Q1. That's what we heard from our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Next question's from Brad Handler with Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. I'm going to stick with the U.S. as well, please. You spoke about &#x2013; I think &#x2013; raising your stage count in the fourth quarter of 2012 for hydraulic fracturing. I wanted to confirm that, please. And I suspect you think that the stage that, that was a nice move in market share for you. I would imagine you think that with activity being down the way it was on rig side that the stage count was probably down for the industry. So can you confirm that and maybe quantify for us and then we can talk about how we got there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Brad, I didn't mention anything about stage count for Q4. I would just say that, so you haven't mistook (sic) anything around that. I would say that overall in hydraulic fracturing we've had a good, I would say, couple of quarters in terms of securing work so I wouldn't be surprised that our market share could be up somewhat. But in terms of stage count sequentially, I haven't mentioned anything about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Maybe I misread or misheard, no problem. I guess then, maybe just an unrelated follow-up, I suppose just more broadly on IPM, maybe asking globally, how might you expect that revenue to compare in 2013 to 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think IPM is one of our faster-growing product lines. We see a range of type of projects that IPM is getting involved with, all the way from just straight Integrated Service or project management for, say, deepwater drilling offshore, where we simply coordinate the interface without taking any project management risk to the project. But when we have a wide range of services on these remote rigs, for instance, that coordination role is one thing that IPM takes on. The other part is the traditional turnkey well construction, which continues to also grow in size for us, right? So we are very active with IPM, and it's doing very well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's fine. All right. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it back.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>After the Q3 results and the commentary you guys had around security and political turmoil concerns in North Africa and Mideast were kind of relatively muted in terms of your concerns overall for the region, can you just talk about how that's changed in the last three months, if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, with the events of the last week here, we are re-looking at the whole situation there. It is &#x2013; if you talk about Algeria and Libya, we are already operating there with quite stringent security measures in place, with what has happened in the last week, we are re-looking at that. We are very prudent in how we go about doing business in any part of the world to make sure that we can offer up the required security for the people that we put into work for us there. So it's too early to say exactly what the impact of this is going to be, but I would just say that in these regions with higher risk, we already have very stringent security measures in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then just a last question on an unrelated follow up. You mentioned around Venezuelan receivables and the payments there slowing. Has that changed your appetite for taking on revenue at this point? Or is it just something that you're throwing out there as an item to be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is an item to be aware of. We have a long-standing relationship with PDVSA. There are some challenges that they are facing in the country at this stage. We are committed to Venezuela for the long-term. They have a massive resource base, and we want to be there for the long-term. So we are currently just working very closely with them to try to resolve the situation.</p>
