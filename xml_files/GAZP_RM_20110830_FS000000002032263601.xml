      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you to yet another teleconference dedicated to the discussion of the consolidated financial reporting by Gazprom covering Q1 of 2011 and prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>My name is Andrey Kruglov. I am the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and in charge of the Finance and Economics Department of Gazprom. And here with me I have my colleagues and representatives of various management bodies covering the Accounting Department, Foreign Economic Activities, the Department of Economic Appraisal and Pricing, the Department of Marketing, Gazprom Export and the Department of Foreign Economic Operations.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind that for the purpose of teleconference, we have prepared a presentation, which is available on our website. And so, right now, we decide to make our presentation as short as possible, so as to leave as much time as possible for questions and answers, which I'm sure something that the investment community has accumulated during the past summer. So let's move over to the slide number three.</p>
          <p>It is evident that during Q1 2011, the net profit which is attributable to the shareholders of the company has grown by 44%, which enabled the company to take up the first place in this particular indicator amongst the global oil and gas companies remaining in the positive during the prior quarters during first three months 2011. The net cash flow went down to minus RR 1 billion, at the same time cash from the operational activities went down by 19%.</p>
          <p>The reduction of both indicators can be explained by changes in our working capital. The net debt shrunk by 4% by the end of Q1 2011 compared to the end of the year. While a very correlation between the net debt to the adjusted EBITDA went down from 0.64 by the end of 2010 to 0.55 during Q1 2011. As one might see on the next slide the amount of output of oil and gas condensate compared to Q1 last year changed insignificantly.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, which is number five, you may see the balance of our gas transportation system and its operation. And these charts reflect the physical movement of gas through the trunk pipeline and the commercial operations of the group in Q1 2011, the amount of gas which was transported through the gas transportation system grew.</p>
          <p>On slide number six, you may see the monthly dynamics of the volume of the gas sales in our main market, as well as the monthly dynamics of the amount of gas production. I would like to note that the amount of gas exports during Q1 2011 was above the average level, particularly into the former Soviet Union countries.</p>
          <p>Now, it would be rational to take a look at the structure of the gas supplies in between markets, which one may see on slide number seven. The main consumers of gas in the former Soviet Union countries are Ukraine and Belarus, while in Europe, its Germany. Speaking about the gas supplies to the Russian consumers, the biggest ones still remains the power sector enterprises as well as households.</p>
          <p>During Q1 2011, the total revenue from gas sales grew by 42% primarily through greater &#x2013; almost twofold in terms of the amount of gas sold to the former Soviet Union countries compared to 2010. The revenue from the sale of gas to Europe grew by 40% and from the sales inside Russia by 14%.</p>
          <p>And I would like to pass the microphone over to the Head of the Consolidated Reporting Department and Accounting, Mr. Mikhail Rosseev, who will tell us about the dynamics of the earnings and various changes in the working capital of the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon dear ladies and gentlemen. As was noted by Andrey Kruglov in his presentation, with this slightly positive dynamics in the sales in our primary segment, which was the gas sales, as one may note from slide number nine that additional contribution into the growth of our revenues was made by the sales of the gas and oil refining product as well as the heating and power.</p>
          <p>The main factor behind this particular result was greater volumes and favorable pricing environment. At the same time, over 80% of revenue in this particular segment falls upon the Gazprom operations, within the whole group. Revenue from the sale of heating and power grew by 20% and the main driver behind the growth variable in this particular segment is the growing <mark type="ph" /> tariffs (5:12) in selling power and heating.</p>
          <p>Now let me move over to the next slide. This is slide number 10, where you may note changes in our operational costs and expenses. The operational expenses compared to the similar period last year grew by RR 203 billion or 33%. At the same time, the main factors which influence the growing expenses was the greater expenses to acquire oil and gas, which is RR 121 billion and the total taxes paid which is by 43% or RR 30 billion.</p>
          <p>If we want to take a look at the growth of the operational expenses without taking into account these incremental growth of expenses in the above-mentioned two line items, that would be slightly above the inflation level throughout the period, which justifies to somehow the uncontrolled level on the half of the company over the operational costs. The tax expenses, which was quite well-known, it is related to the reconsideration of the MET tax as far as gas production is concerned.</p>
          <p>Now if one is to take a look at the overall expense dynamics, one may see the decline in the other expenses primarily related to the one-off events and factors. The first of which were the results of hedging, which was about RR 6 billion, I mean part of the companies within the group were applying hedging operations in Q1 and to minimize their risk of respective earnings amounted to about RR 6 billion. Additionally, about RR 5 billion &#x2013; additionally in terms of the reduction of our expenses, we ended up having because of the attribution of the earnings and the application of the derivative financial instruments.</p>
          <p>Now, we can go over to the next slide. And here I would like to draw your attention to changes in some of the figures in our working capital picture. During Q1 2011, the overall effect from changes in working capital amounted to about RR 84 billion. The negative changes in the working capital, which affected the net cash flow, is related to greater short-term receivables, and the reduction of the payables.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the receivables &#x2013; we thus grew through the year by about RR 54 billion, which can be explained primarily by a greater sort of volumes and the growing prices, which physically led to the current <mark type="ph" /> weakness (7:56) on the part of our buyers. The payables and the accrued obligations during Q1 went down and that was related to the fact that various accounting and settlements have been taking place with the contractors primarily related to the capital construction <mark type="ph" /> primarily (8:12) worked down in 2010, primarily.</p>
          <p>So, now let me pass the microphone back to Mr. Kruglov.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And in conclusion, a few words about the debt situation now that hasn't gone down, the debt ratios are at a comfortable level. The structure of the debt repayment has been balanced throughout various years, which is the result of a conservative financial policy pursued by the company. And considering the results of Q1 2011, the average rate in terms of all of our loans amounted to 6.8%.</p>
          <p>Now summarizing this presentation, I would like to say a few words about our outlook for 2011. First of all, we are predicting stable growth of net profit. Based on the results of the year, we would expect that the EBITDA figures would grow by about 30%, our net debt ratios will continue to decline. We are maintaining control over the operational activities of the companies, which alongside with the environment external situation will contribute to the growing profitability of the company. And we can see through the results of Q1, it may be premature to make conclusions at this point in time. But already now we note that the trend in terms of the recovery of the demand in terms of the energy is just stably moving towards the pre-crisis level.</p>
          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, we did our best to be as concise as possible in our presentation. And my colleagues and I would very happy to respond to your questions during the Q&amp;A. And we have about 45 minutes dedicated to the Q&amp;A session, which is almost the duration of the class of the 1st of September when this call resumes. Please go ahead. We are ready to take questions. Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Vadim Mitroshin from Otkritie Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question was about the investment program that the company has. Previously, it was stated that in September, Gazprom may reconsider its program for this particular year by making it more extensive. And so, with that regard, I would like to ask up to which value of this program may grow? And similarly could you possibly share what the investment program might be for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Answering this question, Mr. Kruglov said that he would like to bring us back to history. By the end of November 2010, the board of directors of the company approved the investment program for 2011 with overall amount of investments being RR 816 billion, out of which capital spend was RR 730 billion, while long-term financial investments RR 86 billion.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you quite correctly stated that on an annual basis, we are adjusting our budget based on the first half-year result. This September is no exception. In immediate future, we're planning the management board to go in discussion dedicated to this particular topic. But simply because they have been no decision made, so there is no situation whereby any decisions are being made right now. But responding to the question in terms of how much the investment program may grow, it may be grown to 1.2 trillion for 2011.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the third part was about the 2012, and here I would like to remind you again that according to Gazprom development plans, those are going to be peak years in terms of the amount of commissioned enterprises and facilities. And that covers our project in the east and west, the development of the Yamal Peninsula new transportation projects, one of which, specifically the first stream of the Nord Stream project is going to be commissioned. And the amount of investment projected for 2012 and 2013 is expected similarly to be at about 1.2 trillion &#x2013; well, largely over 1 trillion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Geydar Mamedov from GMS Moscow. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question comes from Goldman Sachs. And there are two questions. The first one is about the article which was published by Rusakova in the Gas Industry magazine, where an opinion was stated about the correlation between the gas prices through the refined product and whether this correlation should remain in the long-term export contracts. So the question is, what do you think about this article and what is your opinion about this correlation to the refined product staying in the long-term contracts and through the fact that it may remain in the long-term perspective. Now the second question is about Belarus and the recent news that quite possibly the step down ratio can be applied as far as the pricing is concerned for exports to Belarus. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will have answering your first question Deputy General and Director of our Subsidiary Gazprom expert, Sergey Kupriyanov. The second question will be answered by the Deputy Head of the Marketing Department, Alexander Mikheyev and the Head of the Pricing, Ms. Karpel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So my name is Sergey Kupriyanov and as far as the comment within the article is concerned and I should note that that was a collective authorship run by Vlada Vilorikovna Rusakova. So I don't believe that it's worthwhile offering a separate comment because that is an academic article, which contains various assumptions and some of them are definitely being supported by certain ideas and intentions of a number of players in the market.</p>
          <p>But as far as correlation to oil is concerned, this is something that does exist and is being applied to contracts and I am confident that it will remain <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:03) continues for a period of time simply because it has a very unbiased nature. The article stated that the prices are based on the oil prices, which is not very correct because the prices in the long-term contract have always been defined by the market and then their subsequent change is dependent upon the changes of prices for oil and refined products and parameters of the refined products. The liquidity of the trading platforms have been growing.</p>
          <p>So this is something that one should take into account and to a certain extent, the already existing contracts for the supplies of the Russian gas by Gazprom into Europe, there is a certain share of correlations like that, but in our contracts, the correlation to the refined products continue to be dominant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The answer with respect to the question about Belarus, it is worthwhile stating that the gas into Belarus currently is being supplied at the most comfortable level of prices for the foreign countries. And further on, I would like to note the sequence of events, which at the current point in time, Gazprom owns 60% of Beltransgaz and negotiation with the government of Belarus about the acquisition of the remaining share of stock of that company, which currently belongs to the Belarusian side.</p>
          <p>And in the case of a successful completion of this negotiations, and if the acquisition of the remaining stock is assigned, Gazprom will consider the possibility to introduce the formula, which will contain the step-down ratio for the price of gas as far as the consumers in the Republic are concerned, which is estimated in accordance with the agreement applicable to the natural monopolies in the area of the supplies and sales of gas as well as the pricing and tariff setting is concerned as of December 2009 signed by Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus. And the value of the step-down ratio will be defined in the course of the bilateral negotiations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Maxim Moshkov from the UBS in Moscow. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question, or rather three questions, are related first to exports. You were saying that by the end of the year Nord Stream will become operational. And so, it happens that 27.5 billion cubic meters will be added on top of the existing capacities. But at the same time, we know that Gazprom entered into contract for 22 billion. And so, there is a certain balance, which I believe could be utilized by the independent producers and specifically by Novatek. How could you comment on this particular situation?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:08). It looks like Novatek is going to take your market share in 2011 through the deal with Sibur. And so, the question is what is the market opportunity that you are giving up on?</p>
          <p>And the third question is related to the deal with RosUkrEnergo. Could you specify the volume and the prices which are going to be applied through the acquisition or sale of gas? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] You are absolutely correct. In the fourth quarter of this year, Nord Stream is going to be commissioned into operation and the capacity of the first mine is 27.5 billion [cubic meters]. But it doesn't certainly mean that on day one, the plant would be operating at full capacity. There will be a certain time required in order for this capacity to be built up. And so, these capacities are going to be developed step by step.</p>
          <p>Now as far as who owns these capacities, I should say that all of the capacity in as far as the marine part of it is concerned, half have been booked by Gazprom Export, and that has been related primarily by obligations in the new contracts. But one shouldn't forget that Nord Stream means also considerable increase in their reliability, safety, security and the flexibility of supplies, and additional flexibility as far as the current contracts are concerned, and to a certain part that also makes it possible to move volumes and apply diversification through various routing. So, on the current day, this is Gazprom-owned project. And as far as I know, there hasn't been any debate about making these supplies available to any third party.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So, as far the question about Novatek was concerned, I'd like to say that today Gazprom, as you know, is the organization which is having the responsibility for the supplies of gas throughout the whole country. And in this regard, in order to maintain its own portfolio, on an annual basis Gazprom makes independent acquisitions through its own network as well as through mezhregiongaz from the independent producers, amongst which Novatek is present. Therefore, the question of acquiring gas from Novatek to maintain the demand for gas is not a new issue, it's a standing issue and no changes are expected to take place.</p>
          <p>So, then the question related to the regional company in 2011, it is worthwhile noting that the share of independent producers including the mezhregiongaz in the Russian market during the past few years has been growing. However, the Gazprom is continued to be held accountable for the availability of gas in the Russian market. And so, we are taking this particular responsibility very seriously and a number of regions, including the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:42) region in terms of the amount of gases are taken from the independent producers, this amount has been growing and currently Gazprom and mezhregiongaz are undertaking measures to have an independent market appraisal of the assets that the regional companies have as well as submitting various applications to seek approvals from the Federal Antimonopoly Service as well as received the Board of Directors approval and other measures. And all of these is taking place with the participation of the representatives of Novatek.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the question is concerned about the acquisition of gas and sale of gas from RosUkrEnergo, I may only say that this particular transaction has a confidential and commercial nature and so they're not subject to a disclosure. But I can only state that the financial result as far as Gazprom is concerned is positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Andrey Gromadin from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two questions. The first one, could you disclose what was the volume of gas that you required from the Central Asian countries and from RosUkrEnergo in Q1, and what were the volumes that subsequently you sold? And the second question is about exports. Could you please tell what is the volume of exports which you would expect into these CIS countries and Europe within the current year without taking into account the resale of gas from RosUkrEnergo. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We will have Mikael Rosseev, who is the Head of the Accounting Department, as well as Sergey Chelpanov, who is the Deputy General and Director of Gazprom Exports answering your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The overall amount of gas which the group acquired during Q1 2011 was 32.8 billion cubic meters and 21 billion cubic meters. We are not disclosing the amount of gas which we acquired from individual supplies. So, we are only able to quote the total figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as the amount of the gas supplies into remote abroad is concerned, as I said, we are expecting this year the amount of about 155 billion cubic meters or maybe slightly more in 1 billion cubic meters. But as far as the Q1 is concerned, the amount of supplies remote abroad amounted to 44.2 billion cubic meters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as the CIS countries are concerned, about 28.5 billion cubic meters of gas was supplied.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question, additional question is whether it is understood correctly that on top of 155 billion cubic meters there will be additional 12 billion cubic meters which will be supplied, the one which was bought from RosUkrEnergo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The figure of 155 billion cubic meters is the amount of Gazprom exports obligations involves deliveries to remote abroad. On top of this particular figure, there are not going to be any more shipments.</p>

The first one is what is the current situation as far as the negotiations with the government are concerned and what is the expected increase of the prices for gas is going to be or you expect to happen next year in Russia and what will be the increase of the [indiscernible] (41:28) rate next year, if at all possible for you to disclose this information?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] As far as the first question is concerned, based upon the overall objective of raising the prices by 2015 in order to reach the parity &#x2013; profitability or equitable profitability for December 2011 compared to &#x2013; and as well as 2012, we are expecting for this particular rate to go up to 15%. But it doesn't mean that the amount of our revenue would also grow by 15%, there is a two-step price increase which is expected, 5% from January 1st, and July 1st we'll see 9.5%, but there is no final decision which hasn't been made. This is an expected measure. This is a draft which currently the Ministry of Economics is working on.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the level of MET is concerned, the talks about the MET changes are continuing with the Ministry of Finance. And again, there is no final decision yet. The Ministry of Finance has announced its expectations and its outlook in its draft tax policy document. And similarly did we, writing a letter to the Ministry of Finance with our justification and estimations about the way the MET rate should work out. The final decision is expected to take place by the end of September this year and that is when we are looking forward to having more clarity in this issue. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll have Mr. Kupriyanov and Mr. Mikheyev answering your question, but let me now translate the question itself first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are two questions. And the first one is about the terms undertaken by some of Gazprom's European counterparts to reconsider these gas supply contracts. And specifically, this is about E.ON and could you also comment about the arbitration and when is it that you expect any resolutions to happen?</p>
          <p>While the second question is this, you want us to take a look at the sale of gas in Russia, they are identical, specifically in Q1 2010 and Q1 2011 look alike RR 102.5 billion. Could you possibly comment inside this figures, has there being any change in as far as the segments of selling gas is concerned &#x2013; are concerned? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Yes, indeed as part of the contract with E.ON, the rate was applied for the external review of the price. The time which is officially prescribed by the contract to hold negotiations has been completely utilized even these negotiations continued to several months longer, but unfortunately no resolution has been achieved. And therefore formerly the arbitration procedure has been launched. And it is quite difficult to be precise about how quickly a resolution can be found because arbitration is somewhat of a situation, which is difficult to predict in terms of its outcome. But nevertheless, even as part of the arbitration procedure, we will continue consulting each other as for the best possible outcome. So just on the formal side of things, I'm sure that it may take more than a year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] No. As far as the comparison in between the Q1 2010 and Q1 2011, I may say the following that these supplies have grown quite insignificantly by about one percentage, and that is primarily because of the greater inflow from independent producers. But, in terms of the structure, this incremental growth came from households, but it is worthwhile noting that Q1 2010 was much colder than the first quarter of 2011 and therefore there hasn't been any significant growth of gas sales in Q1 2011 simply because the temperature environments were different.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] Gazprom is not publishing the Q4 labor cost results, but nevertheless we believe to see that in comparison to Q4 2010 and Q1 2011, the leather cost went down by about 30%. Could you please explain what is behind this particular decline? And in what way this particular line item may evolve through the remainder of the quarters in 2011? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Going back to the very beginning, right now, we are not expecting any significant changes in the labor cost structures in the company with exception of those which you may have seen in Q1 and to a large extent they are related to the reconsideration of the mandatory insurance rates. And as far as the Q4 is concerned, which definitely was much more significantly affected by the reconsideration of the pension reserves, which regularly take place in Q4 with a participation of the professional actuary. And that is why you see this difference between Q4 and Q1, and that is basically because of the reconsideration of the pension reserves and obligations, and that is how it affected basically the figures in Q1.</p>

          <p>Yes. Gentlemen, thank you for the call. I want to follow-up on the questions regarding European export contracts. During this call, actually we just had a headline come across that Greece has won a change in its contract with cheaper gas and lower volumes from Gazprom. I was curious if you have any comments on that particular contract?</p>

          <p>It is very strange to hear that this is a piece of news, which came just now because we finished our negotiations with roughly about six months ago. And we were able to found a commercial resolution to the situation we have undertaken certain steps in order to improve the competitiveness of the Russian gas in the Greece market. And we are currently seeing tangible results, which have ensued from this decision. Certain price adjustment has been done; however, I wouldn't dare describe the current gas that is being supplied to Greece as a cheap one.</p>

          <p>The &#x2013; we say congratulations on a very successful quarter completed and if at all possible there are two questions. The first one is about the current status of negotiations with China, what is it? And the second question is, which is the reason behind the Gazprom's interest towards the European power companies. And possibly you could clarify would the current CapEx figures include potentially acquisitions of the European power companies?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The first question with respect to the ability to achieve a conclusion of a contract with China, it is expected that a resolution may be reached by the end of the year. This is quite a serious and big contract with a possibility of exporting about 68 billion cubic meters. Two major gas pipelines, both the Chinese and the Russian side are interested in reaching the acceptable conclusion, but there are certain commercial issues which still require verification and primarily this is the issues of pricing.</p>

          <p>Good evening. This is Andrey Vyacheslavovich who is answering the second part of the question with respect to possible participation of Gazprom in the power projects in Europe. Currently, we are pursuing only one project with RWE company. We have signed a memorandum in July this year, and as part of implementation of the reached agreements, Gazprom and RWE are currently talking about setting up a joint venture, which would include the current existing as well as the newer power station which utilize both coal and natural gas and are located in Belarus, UK and Germany. We are expecting that after the commercial implementation of this project, RWE will be able to secure the supplies of the natural gas as competitive prices for its future operations.</p>

And in addition, I would like to conclude by saying if somebody hasn't had time to raise a question, you would be able to put it in writing and forward it to our department which is covering financial markets.
