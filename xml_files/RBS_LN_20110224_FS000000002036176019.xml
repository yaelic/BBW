        <plist>
          <p>Hi and good afternoon everyone, thank you for joining the call today. With me is John Cummins, the Group Treasurer and several members of his team. We had, as you know, the results presentation earlier today. We have a full set of slides from that up on the website and also I think you will be able to see that taped sometime soon, if not already. We also have a separate set of slides that you can go through for this particular call.</p>
          <p>I think what we wanted to do on the format today is I would just offer a few summary prepared remarks, turn it over to John to talk a little bit about the balance sheet, and then we will take any questions that you may have.</p>
          <p>So, starting off, we are now into the third year of our five-year strategic plan, and we've made, I think, really excellent progress. We've achieved significant balance sheet improvements, such as our loan-to-deposit ratio, which is now 117% for the group, and it's actually 96% for the core bank, which has already met our target of 1:1 in 2013. We also believe that the group is well positioned to meet future Basel capital requirements. We have a solid core Tier 1 base of 10.7%. If you look at the strategic plan, we are now ahead of the plan on all important measures. But clearly, we are not complacent; the world is still unsettled and we know we have continued work to do.</p>
          <p>Starting off with the group financial highlights, we saw an &#xA3;8 billion improvement from operations, to produce an overall operating profit of &#xA3;2.1 billion. Our revenues were up 10% for the year; that was paced by net interest income growth and lower non-core trading losses. Our expenses were down 4% due to tight cost management and we delivered very impressive operating leverage. We also had impairment losses fall by 33%, which is really a combination of two things, an improving economic environment as well as our risk mitigation initiatives.</p>
          <p>On a bottom line basis, for the fourth quarter, we were break even. We posted a very modest profit. And for the full year we up ended with a loss of &#xA3;1.1 billion. If you actually unpack that a bit though, we had an after-tax cost of our APS charge, which was &#xA3;1.1 billion, so excluding that we were break even for the full year as well.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, our core Tier 1 was a strong 10.7%; that was up from 10.2% at the end of the third quarter. We brought down risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter, which really drove that improvement. Our tangible book value for the year was about flat.</p>
          <p>Turning to the group asset quality, our impairment trend has been favorable throughout 2010. Non-core is down 41% for the full year versus 2009. Core is down 19%, so certainly that's driving much improved performance. But the one business counter to that trend has been Ulster Bank, where we took &#xA3;3.9 billion of impairments in 2010, if you look at core and non-core combined versus &#xA3;2 billion in 2009, so just about a doubling there. We would expect impairments in Ireland to remain high, at about these levels, through the first half before likely starting to fall in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>For the group overall, we see continued good signs for future impairments. One thing we monitor is the caseload that moves into our workout group and the trends there continue to be favorable. And if you actually look underneath the surface, while the non-performing loans have increased over the year, it really is in the property segment. If you backed out property the non-performing loans are 8% lower than they were in the year ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our core performance and, as you recall, the core is where we end up with our franchise value for the future. We have been pleased with the progress in our Retail and Commercial businesses, which nearly offset the anticipated fall in GBM revenues. We, obviously knowing the exceptional year GBM had in 2009, we anticipated they would come back to a more normalized performance, which is what happened. Throughout R&amp;C, we had higher net interest income, we had good cost control, and we had lower impairment losses, which really drove their improved performance. So for the year the core profit was &#xA3;7.4 billion, roughly two-thirds R&amp;C, and one third GBM. We generated a 13% return on tangible equity, which is not far off our target of 15%.</p>
          <p>It's worth mentioning also GBM overall, I think GBM had a strong year, given a challenging market environment. We have given guidance that they would have about &#xA3;8 billion in revenues on a normalized basis; they came in at &#xA3;7.9 billion. The return on equity in the business was 16.6% and so quite pleased with performance there.</p>
          <p>Turning to non-core performance, our losses declined by &#xA3;9 billion in 2010, which obviously significantly benefited the bottom line. This was a combination of better trading results as well as lower impairments. And both of those benefited from an improving external environment as well as our various risk mitigation initiatives.</p>
          <p>Importantly in non-core, the objective is to make it much smaller and close to disappear within five years. We dropped the assets by &#xA3;63 billion over 2010 or that's roughly 31% from where we started the year. We also had &#xA3;12 billion of signed but pending deals at year end, so if you overlay that, the reduction is 37%.</p>
          <p>Much of the progress in the future in 2012 and 2013, and also the associated costs, will depend on the recovery of the boarder commercial real estate market in the UK. We still have a fairly significant exposure to commercial real estate, while that's also down in the mid 30s percent, we are counting on economic recovery to refinance and work our way out of some of those assets.</p>
          <p>At this point, we are more than halfway towards the ending assets target. So we started at &#xA3;260 billion with the overlay of the &#xA3;12 billion pending. We are now at &#xA3;126 billion, so we are more than halfway towards our target reduction to about &#xA3;30 billion in 2013. And we have a target in 2011 to achieve a &#xA3;96 billion third party asset level there in non-core.</p>
          <p>So with that, I think those are the big highlights. Let me turn it over to John to discuss funding and liquidity. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bruce. We've made great progress strengthening the balance sheet this year. Our resilient franchises are building a stable customer base, funding base. We have seen deposits increase &#xA3;14 billion in 2010 and they now represent 58% of the group's funding, up from 51% a year ago. The majority of our divisions have improved their loan-to-deposit ratios over the last year. The Wealth and GTS divisions are net funders for the group. This group diversification enables us to be competitive in the pricing of our deposits.</p>
          <p>We have transformed our funding profile. The funding gap has reduced &#xA3;160 billion in two years. Additionally, we have termed out wholesale funding and 61% of our wholesale funding is now greater than one year. The NSFR stands at 101% and we're comfortable with the ratio of short-to-long-term wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we issued &#xA3;38 billion of term issuance across a very diverse group of products, currencies and maturities. We established our Covered bond program, issued just under &#x20AC;5 billion and we have also issued the largest RMBS deal of that year for &#xA3;4.6 billion, the largest deal since 2007. The diversification of our funding is key to our continued progress to a more stable funding platform. Also significant progress has been made in lengthening maturity, profile was over two thirds of our 2010 issuance at five years or more. The short-term funding continues to reduced by &#xA3;93 billion in the year as well.</p>
          <p>The keys to much of the improvement to-date have been our success in deleveraging through the non-core rundown, growing our natural customer franchises in deposits, and our ability to issue term debt in a variety of shapes and sizes. Our 2011 issuance plans call for &#xA3;20 billion of issuance, given we pre-funded some of the issuance for 2010. We expect this to split across both, public and private, secured and unsecured, and wide geographies. So far this year we issued over &#xA3;3 billion of term funding across the public and private markets, out to the &#xA3;20 billion figure for the year. We have also factored in the replacement of maturing CDS debt into all our plans and it will be fully repaid by July 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to liquidity, we continue to progress in increasing the strength of our liquidity reserves. We've exceeded our 2010 target of &#xA3;150 billion of liquidity reserves and we're on track to build a &#xA3;50 billion FSA eligible government bond portfolio currently at &#xA3;35 billion. There is also over &#xA3;50 billion in cash in central bank deposits and the quality overall of the liquidity reserves has continued to improve.</p>
          <p>So, with that progress report I will hand over to Bruce to conclude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John. So to sum up, we're pleased with the progress that we've made so far. Our core, Retail and Commercial businesses are recovering well and gaining strength while GBM has remained resilient in spite of numerous external challenges. Our non-core and our EU disposals have progressed well, substantially improving our risk position and reducing our complexity. And our balance sheet looks much better than it did across all key funding, liquidity and capital metrics. So, good so far but still lots to do.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, why don't we open it up for some questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Bruce. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Corinne Cunningham from Autonomous. Please ask your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, John. Just like to ask a quick question about coupon restarts. I know the conference call this morning talked about preference shares and hybrid coupons being restarted after the &#x2013; well once they are allowed to be, in May 2012. I'm just wondering what kind of circumstances or what kind of instances might actually prevent those coupons being restarted in that timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Bruce, let me take that, and then John you can elaborate. But look, our objective is to return to strong profitability as soon as we can, and then ultimately to start paying a common dividend. So we have a few things to do before we get to that point. When we get out of the EU stop period in 2012, our current recovery plan would have us being sufficiently profitable that we could reinstitute those coupons. It's important that we do so that once &#x2013; all those coupons have to be turned on before we can start paying a common dividend. And that would take about six months after the point that we turn them on in order to get there.</p>
          <p>So, to answer your question directly, I guess if we were at a point where we had significant stress or our profitability had not been restored adequately then we, as a management team, or a regulator, could always determine that it's not appropriate to put that coupon back in place, but our baseline assumption now is that we would.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Lee Street from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon. One broad question and two quite specific questions. Firstly, in terms of this year, one of the key themes we see in the market has been secured versus unsecured debt. Can you give any comments on how you think of the optimum mix of unsecured versus secured debt, and any limits you may face there regulatory, rating agency or other?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the SLS, I see that you say that you don't use it for business funding purposes, but can you give any color on how much is outstanding and what the maturity schedule of it is?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, following on from the previous question, in terms of restarting coupons and starting dividends, that obviously links into dividend stopper language. In terms of capital stopper language, what would be the earliest you could start to either a) call Tier 1 debt securities, or b) undertake fresh liability management? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first one and I'll give John the next two. But in terms of the secured debt versus unsecured debt, I think clearly the market now is, I think, favorably disposed towards secured debt. There's certainly a lot of competition in the unsecured debt space, both banks trying to improve their funding position and term out, and governments have a lot of issuance going on. So we have certainly moved in that direction. We have a covered bond program that we instituted last year. We issued about &#xA3;3.5 billion under that program and we anticipate something at least comparable again this year. I think a lot of it depends on where spreads are, you have to keep your name in the marketplace to some extent. But it's hard to say exactly what's optimal. If we look at what we did last year, John, I think it was &#x2013; what were the split between secured and unsecured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly around 50/50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and 50/50. And we do a lot of privates as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mostly unsecured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's part of our formula so far in meeting a successful issuance plan last year is that we have a lot of arrows in the quiver and we go secured, we go unsecured, we go private, we go public, and we do a lot of deals in different currencies. John, you want to take the next two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the SLS, obviously we're restricted from giving out numbers on the SLS, but we are comfortable, we actually don't use it for funding, we use it for part of our liquidity portfolio, as for the T-bills, and we are very comfortable. We are on track, ahead of track to manage down our SLS drawings from the Bank of England and the latest FSR report it did include an amortization schedule for all the SLS. And you can see there that all the banks are ahead of that. And on the Tier 1 securities, we will be able to call those after expiry of the capital stoppers on the 1st of April 2013 and an expire of the EC call ban on the end of April 2012 for the Tier 2 securities.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Richard Thomas from Merrill Lynch. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello, everyone. Thanks for the call. A few questions from my side, first, some fundamental stuff. Can you give us perhaps a bit more color on your guidance for Ireland? You say that things might get better in the second half; is that wishful thinking or is that actually based on trends that you can foresee? Can you also give us a little bit more information about your commercial real estate exposure, what you think the outlook for that is? I mean you did mention that it's a bit interest rate dependent, or economic cycle dependent, but can we have a little bit more color because that is a question that comes up quite a lot.</p>
          <p>And then, could you give us also some sort of guidance on where you think you are in terms of getting your ratings upgraded, which obviously is a very important thing? And then finally just to confirm, John, I think you just said to Lee, can you &#x2013; on the calls, will you start to call everything from May, is that what you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I answer that question now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, do that one first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have the ability to call, whether or not we call will be decided at that time, in light of those circumstances. So we are just saying that's when the ability to call comes back, we're not saying we're going to call straightaway or anything else. It is very much a process; we need to get regulatory approval as well and that is &#x2013; it is a hypothetical question in terms of what we would do at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me go back to your first two questions. Yeah, on Ireland, I hope we're not guilty of wishful thinking, maybe there is a little bit of that mixed in. But clearly we have seen some underlying trends. We were actually thinking we were nearing our peak impairments in Q4, based on some of the underlying data that we had on the condition of borrowers and the economy. And you saw unemployment had actually peaked and had started to fall a little bit, Q4 versus Q3.</p>
          <p>And then obviously the turmoil erupted again and now there's all the political issues that they are sorting. When you actually look at trends in non-performing assets, I think we envision kind of the first half still being tough. But we are making certain assumptions that the political situation gets sorted and the economy, which is starting to show some signs of life, as you recall, it's a very open economy, exports have started to pick up, there is a highly skilled labor force there, and I think that will eventually start to gain some traction.</p>
          <p>The big problem in Ireland, as you know, is the commercial real estate development that took place there was far in excess of what should have taken place. And so you have a situation where supply exceeds demand by quite a bit. And so you're working through evaluating where each of those projects sits particularly the ones that are development lending. We have the development lending book over in non-core and it's 75% non-performing. We are calling out a top of that around 90% and so we have to continue to migrate that extra 15% and take provisions against that, and we will probably be increasing provisions from 44% a bit higher. That would take us through the first half of the year. And then I think absent any big flare-up on the residential portfolio, we should start to see things come down.</p>
          <p>So that's really our thinking as to why we think things will come down, because the book that's been most on fire is going to be fully non-performing and provided for adequately. And then what's next? And hopefully the residential book hangs in there.</p>
          <p>On commercial real estate there are some schedules in the annual results document that show that we've brought the overall size of our commercial real estate book down by 11%. It's now in the mid-80 billion sterling range. Within non-core that is currently at about &#xA3;43 billion or roughly half of the overall commercial real estate exposure in the Group. So we're orienting that towards run down ultimately and so far, we've knocked that number down by a third, so most of the reduction in exposure in commercial real estate has happened so far in the non-core area.</p>
          <p>I think we'll continue to make progress here and we have maturities that stage out through '11, '12, '13, '14. One of the reasons we laid out a plan in the beginning and looked at our view on the economic cycle, and we stacked commercial real estate later, was the sensitivity of value in commercial real estate to the economic cycle and to where interest rates were. And we still think that offers us the best opportunity to lag that a little bit and wait for economic recovery, in terms of minimizing those frictional losses and ultimately disposing of those assets.</p>
          <p>So I think we're in a reasonably good position across all the asset classes, and I think we've made some progress on commercial real estate. But it's certainly the one that has the most potential variability in terms of impacting our P&amp;L in the next couple of years. You had one other question, which I think was rating upgrades. John, do you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, obviously we continue to discuss with the agencies on a continuous basis, our potential for upgrade. Obviously, these are very strong balance sheet numbers. There is also, as you know, consultative papers from some of the agencies. And we will continue to make our case that we wish to see further upgrades as we can see the strength in the balance sheet and in the quantitative numbers we delivered as well as improvement in our progress and our forecast track record. We are on track. We've improved a lot and we continue to have that dialogue with the agencies. But it is never a situation where you improve the numbers then you automatically get an upgrade. But we are asking all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the important thing is, if you look at our efforts around risk reduction both on the left side of the balance sheet and the right side of the balance sheet, we started from a terrible position. So the reasons that RBS got into trouble, so they made a, maybe an ill-timed acquisition, but the whole amount of capital that was supporting the balance sheet and then the terms structure of the funding and the amount of wholesale funding really was not very robust. And so one of the key things in designing the recovery plan was to set up non-core, de-lever and run down the loan book, have plans to grow deposits, term out that wholesale funding, and just pay down the amount of wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>We've actually made very dramatic progress on that and so our short-term wholesale funding is roughly in line with our liquidity portfolio, which is where we want it to be in 2013. So we started as a real outlier to our peer group, and we've now brought ourselves back at least from a capital, liquidity and funding standpoint in line with our peer group. Having said that, we still have some risk concentrations, including what I just talked about in commercial real estate, in some single main concentrations, that were still need to work off on the left side of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>But it's been significant progress for rating agencies look at all that and they take that in. They want to look at everything. They want to look at your governance practices, your risk management culture. And so we've obviously been working very closely with them to show just how we're changing for the better along all those dimensions. But as John indicated, there is usually a lag from the new reality and then the recognition of the new reality. And so we're hopeful that if we keep making progress that the rating catches up to exactly where we are.</p>

          <p>Hello, hello Bruce, hello John. My first question is about capital. You very helpfully have provided this Basel II slide about &#xA3;88 billion to &#xA3;100 billion risk weighted asset equivalent add-ons. And at the same time, you are targeting obviously the flotation of the insurance business for, before Basel III. If you can't, given the difficulties you have been facing in the insurance business, what would this add or how many basis points of core Tier 1 would it result in. And if &#x2013; and also, would that color your decision at the time for the APS? And, finally, related capital, I mean, is there a bottom line capital ratio you would want to manage to, at a core Tier 1 ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, all good questions. Let me just start out about the impact of that RWA add-on. So that &#xA3;88 billion to &#xA3;100 billion, effectively where we are today, if you just impose it today, would be about a 125 basis point hit to the core Tier 1. Some of that, about 60% of that hits GBM and about 40% of that hits non-core and eventually goes away. So that's a positive. With respect to insurance, the capital deduct for insurance, would actually be a negative that's avoided through the sale. So in effect the way the capital regs work today, we get to double lever that investment. And so the impact on core Tier 1 really is positive from two standpoints. One is we avoid the updraft that would come in under the new regs, and (b), if we get to sell at above tangible book, we either get rid of goodwill and/or we create a gain on that sale. So just the numbers around that, so you have the rough parameters on that. We have a tangible book in insurance of about &#xA3;3.1 or &#xA3;3.2, call it &#xA3;3.2 billion and we have goodwill of about &#xA3;800 million. So the total book value is about &#xA3;4 billion.</p>
          <p>If we actually achieve the turnaround, which I think if you've listened to this morning's call, the underlying figures and performance in insurance is turning around, and we are feeling increasingly confident that we are going to get there. But if we are able to sell this business at 1.25 times tangible book, we would get rid of all of that goodwill. We'd cover that &#xA3;800 million of goodwill. If we sell it for more than 1.25, so let's say we sold it at 1.5 times tangible book, and we sold it for &#xA3;4.5 billion, we would get a &#xA3;500 million gain, which would be accretive to our core Tier 1.</p>
          <p>So then the question is, well, what has to happen for you to get transaction values in that zip code? Right now I would say our underlying ROE in the business is probably high single-digits. We need to continue the turnaround plan, which is why we think staging this in the second half of 2012 is sensible. So that will give us six good quarters under our belt and continued traction in the turnaround plan so that we can get the ROE back up towards the mid-teens.</p>
          <p>And then you can go look at what you think a mid-teens ROE for an insurance company ought to fetch, but I don't think 1.25 times tangible book is a big stretch. And I think you could easily see numbers higher than that. So that's the game plan; not a huge impact on the core Tier 1. The avoidance of a negative, and then we'll get rid of some goodwill and potentially get a gain on the sale.</p>
          <p>And your second question was on the capital ratio target. Look, we're at 10.7%. I think we want to stay with a very strong capital ratio for the obvious reasons. I think there's really three. One is, we'd like to exit APS. And so if you strip off the APS benefit of 1.2%, we're really back at 9.5%. And then we have the RWA impact of Basel 2.5 and 3, and so that's potentially another 1.2%, so you could have your 9.5% at 8.3%. And then we also have non-core still, it's 12.5% of the balance sheet, on its way to 10%, but still you need to have capital for that. We aren't paying dividends. We're not paying the preferred. We are returning to profitability. And so we are going to be able to have internal cash generation that makes that capital ratio even stronger, so we can absorb the APS exit and we can deal with turning those coupons back on as we indicated, and also absorb that RWA impact.</p>
          <p>So that's really the game plan. So I guess it's hard for me to say where exactly we set the target at this point. The Basel Committee is talking about the SIFI buffers and so where the regulators think we need to have a minimum; that will be one consideration. And then we'll just have to think through these other considerations and pro forma them out, and manage our capital accordingly. But I think, at this point, we're happy at 10.7%, and we are erring on the side of having a capital cushion until some of these things sort out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's really helpful. And in terms of your internal projections, now if we do accept the reality of &#xA3;500 million run rate for GBM a quarter, instead of &#x2013; which is 10.5% odd ROE &#x2013; instead of the target 15%. Given all the headwinds that Stephen Hester talked about this morning and given the possibility of subsidiarization, all those things hanging over. I mean, how much is that going to change or your capital targets, will you actually have to run down more of the balance sheet if you don't get in these GBM earnings drivers and therefore retained earnings drivers? That's the second part of my question.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on NPLs or REILs, just something I noticed is that the delta, the positive delta, the increase in NPLs outside the UK is more than what's in Ulster Bank, the change in Ulster Bank and the tiny change in the U.S. business. So I'm just wondering, is that the old chestnut of Spanish property again? Or is that something we should start re-worrying about your Spanish developer exposure? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so I have given you credit for four questions here, so I'll answer these and then move on to the next person. But with respect to GBM, I wasn't exactly sure of the logic in the beginning about how the numbers roll. So let me just tell you what &#x2013; I'll just put the baseline out there so you have it clear. But we have said in the past that we think GBM is about a &#xA3;2 billion a quarter, &#xA3;8 billion per annum, top line, they came in at &#xA3;7.9 last year. And it was, I think, a tough environment, given all the concerns about the periphery in Europe and people taking risk off for a good part of the year.</p>
          <p>So we're not calling out any change to where we think GBM can perform, from a top line standpoint. They also have a very good cost-to-income ratio, probably best in peer group. And so that drives a pretty favorable ROE. The one thing we have to contend within GBM is this updraft of RWAs. So if you say the number is 100, about 60% of that goes to GBM. GBM goes from 140 to 200, in terms of their RWAs and that would take the 17% ROE down to about 12%. What we would have to do, just like any other investment bank and all investment banks are grappling with this as the framework changes is, how do you reorient your business in order to make that backup, so you can earn an ROE that's near your target and a lot of banks target 15%. So that's to come, to follow. We think we have some ideas on that and we have smart people sorting that. But we haven't fully figured that out until things settle, as most other banks haven't fully figured this one out yet. The good news there though I think for GBM is that we start from a good standpoint. We start at a pretty good return for the business.</p>
          <p>On REILs outside of the UK and Ireland, I don't think there is anything really noteworthy there. So there is no serious issue in Spanish real estate or in anything in Europe that I would call out. So you can talk to IR Department for further background on that, but I wouldn't think it's that noteworthy. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Ms. Louise Pitt from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, good morning Bruce, good morning John, thanks for the call. I just had a couple of questions. The first one is can you just elaborate a little bit on your focus for the U.S. Retail Banking franchise and whether that's in growth mode or not? Because obviously we've seen a lot of potential acquisitions here in the U.S. of smaller regional banking firms.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on capital and I hear everything that you've said this morning, but that target of more than 8%, I just want to make sure I'm clear. Is that relative to a 7% current proposal from Basel of the minimum core Tier 1 ratio? Or is that an expectation of UK rules that will need to be higher than Basel? Or is it just based on today's rules?</p>
          <p>And then just relative to that also do you have any comments on contingent capital, because a couple of your UK peers have been out there talking about it recently and I just would be interested to hear your thoughts on how that market might develop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. The first question on U.S. Retail Banking, we have no plans currently to make any acquisitions in this space. In fact, we have some limitations on our ability to do acquisitions through the EU stop period of 2012. But even, I think, if we had more flexibility, the game plan in the U.S. is to just continue to work to fix the business and strengthen the franchise. We have a new management team in place. They have tried to identify gaps versus peer group, to try and deliver more organic growth and a better efficiency ratio. And better cross sale, better share of customer wallet, all of those things and that program is in flight. And we are optimistic about how it can deliver.</p>
          <p>We also have, I think, a very strong potential for cyclical recovery in that franchise with higher rates and improving real estate market in the U.S. over time that will help restore the ROEs to where we'd like them to be. So I think we will not be a participant at this point in terms of the acquisition game, which is starting to pick up or we're going to stay close to home, and strengthen the business and then never say never that could happen down the road, but certainly not in the near term.</p>
          <p>On the second item, the core Tier 1 is just reflective of that's what it was. We have consciously not moved any of our targets from where we started out, when we set up the plan. And so, our view was, at the time, that we needed economic capital greater than 8% to run the group in steady state. There is certainly, as I answered to an earlier question, there is lots of room for discussion around what that optimal capital target should be. The Basel discussion at 7% and the U.S. Bank saying, yes, 7% sounds good to us. I don't think will carry the day, at the end of the day. I think here there is talk about this SIFI buffer and I think the UK and the Europeans &#x2013; some of the Europeans, not all, and where the Swiss have ended up, would say that a large complex financial institution should have more capital ultimately than 7%. I wouldn't be surprised if the number turns out to be in an 8%, 9% zone ultimately, but we will just have to wait and see how that plays out. So, intentionally we haven't really refreshed that target; that is a bit stale, but that's the derivation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The third thing, on contingent capital, I will ask John to offer his thoughts. But on a broad brush, we are watching the market and it is very interesting to see what Credit Suisse did and how things will develop. At this point, we don't have any need to go out and do something. We have a contingent capital arrangement as part of APS that allows us a subscription of &#xA3;8 billion, the government to subscribe to &#xA3;8 billion of B shares if needed. And that runs for five years through the end of 2014. So, I think when we look at things, we can lag a little bit and see how the market develops and see how pricing usually over time, would tighten, as the market gets deeper and more liquid. And we may be looking at that down the road, but I don't think it's something that we would consider in 2011 given that we have the arrangement with the government in place. John, do you want to...?</p>

          <p>We think the Credit Suisse deal was excellent for them and it has obviously been helpful to set up some structural parameters and as and when the market develops, we will be very keen to follow development and make sure we don't miss any tricks. But right now there is no requirement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Tobias Grun (43:11) from Western Asset Management. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. A question for you Bruce. You've touched already on GBM, but I wanted to come back to that and get a sense of where you see the greatest sort of medium-term cyclical or secular shifts? Clearly, the jump in risk weighted assets is one thing, but we've also got the ICB reporting later this year, I believe it's in September. How committed are you going to be to GBM? Where's the breaking point in terms of what conditions might be sought? And finally, a question on staffing there, within GBM. What kind of constraints do you face in retaining and hiring the best people? Again, that's been mentioned often in the context of your group, perhaps you can shed some light on that as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Look, I think GBM works well inside the group. It's a key element of a universal thing. They have products and services that we offer to the UK corporate customers. We do a lot of cross-sell with the GTS business. We have some arrangements with the larger commercial customers in citizens as well. And so, our view is that to be an effective universal bank and have an ability to service large global oriented customers, you have to offer the types of products and services that we do.</p>
          <p>I certainly anticipate the headwinds and so the RWA and lots of moves around, as you say, reporting, the centralization of clearing arrangements and the like, is all going to put some stress on the business. But what you tend to see over time is that usually these things, in the medium term, adjust themselves out and take care of themselves. And so, either pricing adjusts or the marginal competitors leave the business and the bigger players can continue to thrive. And it sometimes takes some time to sort out, but I have no doubt that there is some very smart people in our investment bank and every other investment bank that we compete against certainly working through these frameworks and these regulations. And it's not something that investment banking hasn't had to face in the past; they have always seemed to be able to adapt to change. And it may be a heavier amount of change and seemingly more daunting than some of the things in the past. But, I still think it's a viable business and we will figure out how to make this continue to be a viable business. And we're committed to it, bottom line.</p>
          <p>I do think it will be helpful when we get to the point where the government starts to sell down its stake and we return to private hands in terms of the staff dimension that you mentioned. Clearly, working here over the past couple of years, as Stephen said this morning on the call, its people feel a bit beleaguered in a group that's recovering. And often times can be a pi&#xF1;ata in the local press for issues of the day. But, I think each quarter that goes by that we demonstrate that we are making progress on the recovery plan and people can start to see light at the end of the tunnel, that feeling starts to diminish. And so, I do think we still have challenges in recruiting and attracting the very best people, but we have a lot of good people that we start with and our businesses continue to hold their market share, and there are some great <mark type="ph" /> little monster (47:30) businesses that we have that form the core of the business. And we haven't seen much erosion across the board. So, I think we are getting better. We are executing what we said we would. The people that really care about this place are still passionate about recovery. And so, we will continue to deal with things the way we have.</p>

          <p>Hello, afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions really. One is a follow-up on the back of some of the comments you made earlier and as well as Richard Thomas's question on commercial real estate. Can I just understand that your base case for sort of unwinding this portfolio is through a refinance by other banks of these CRE projects? And if that's the case, if you can give us a little more color around sort of who is coming in to take these loans off of you and sort of what kind of activities you're seeing, and if you can give us some color on the nationality of the banks that are coming in to take this off of you? And what your other &#x2013; I'm assuming fire sales would be the other way to get out of some of these exposures. But, what sort of haircuts we could expect to see, if that were the case? And then, secondly on the deposit growth side, if you can flesh that out a bit more to tell us sort of where you're seeing the deposit growth, what kind of products have been offered, what kind of pricing, and how you expect to see that develop going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the commercial real estate, the reduction, if you looked at this morning's slide, we went from about &#xA3;63 billion to &#xA3;43 billion over the span of two years. There is an element of that that is impairment, so it is not all kind of disposals or run-off. There are banks, and I don't want to really specify nationality, but there are banks and investors who would certainly step into some of the, I would say Class A type facilities that are not impaired and that maybe have multi-lenders involved. I think where it gets a little more challenging is back when you get into more bespoke tertiary type properties, where we are the only lender. And in some cases, we end up &#x2013; we can restructure the loan and roll the loan, and in other cases there are other parties, either indigenous UK banks or foreign banks who could step up to the plate on some of those projects. It's a combination.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed &#x2013; and again, this is slide 30 in this morning's deck, but we have proviso for rollovers as one of the contra to the run down. And so, we do expect that some loans will not be easily re-financeable and we can work those loans out. In some cases, we take a haircut, in some cases the borrower puts up more equity. But, we have a proviso for rollovers to be in the &#xA3;20 billion to &#xA3;30 billion range, which coincidentally is about the stub that we get to at 2013. We are targeting to get down to about &#xA3;30 billion. And it's safe to say that an element of that, a reasonable element of that, could be the real estate loan. So, what we are trying to do overall is broadly balance hitting the target with preserving shareholder capital, and incurring the least amount of friction that we can. And usually, in commercial real estate, time is your friend and the cycle sometimes takes a while to play out, but that's fundamentally the strategy there. On the second question, why don't I flip that to John and John can talk a little bit about deposit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We went from &#xA3;414 billion to &#xA3;429 billion, the total group. The three main growth areas were UK Retail, UK Corporate and GTS. In Retail, there is a variety of products. You had a lot of good successful term bonds <mark type="ph" /> on our eyes this (52:03) season and we continue to kind of do probably about there and also work closely trying to achieve more &#x2013; get more customers in their checking account area.</p>
          <p>In UK Corporate, there was a major focus on getting closer to our clients, working very hard on relationships and bringing more of those deposits in. If you read some of the bank &#x2013; I mean, macro stuff, you will see the corporate sector in the UK has increased its cash holdings quite strongly. So, we have increased our market share there and a lot of that is down to the focus on the franchise. And in GTS, again, there is quite a big push on some of the ocean going liner customers we have as well as some of the operational accounts and trade finance we want to offer customers. And those are kind of the three areas of growth. So that has been a resilient performance going forward and obviously we've been competitive on pricing as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect this trend to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We expect to continue to focus on the customer side of the balance sheet and to look to continue to work in other areas such as Wealth. I mean Ulster Bank has continued to do very creditably, holding its own in its deposits &#x2013; customer deposits of &#xA3;23 billion. So, yes, we &#x2013; there will be continued focus on the deposit side of the balance sheet as part of the risk reduction strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, tied to acceleration of economic activity, that would help, because then we would start to see more demand for loans and some deposit growth. But, in a more kind of moderate environment that we are in, there is clearly a lot of competition for those deposits. But, I think one of the aspects to RBS is, given the readiness of wholesale funding and the cost of wholesale funding, the deposit gathering programs and capabilities were somewhat stunted. And so, I think with these programs we've been able to punch above our weight a little bit, if you will, in terms of capitalizing on the relationships we have just by doing a better job of blocking and tackling that other institutions certainly focused on more than the old RBS did.</p>

But, perhaps operator, if there is people on the line, they could call Emete Hassan or our IR Department and we could take those questions. But, anyway, my thanks to all of you for dialing in today. Look at our materials, they are quite extensive, both the company announcement and all the slides that we put out. We feel good about, again, where we are and the progress we've made. We certainly still have a big mountain to climb, but we are up for the challenge. And if you have further questions, please feel free to contact the team here. Thanks again.</p>
