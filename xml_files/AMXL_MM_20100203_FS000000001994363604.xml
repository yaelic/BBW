          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil Fourth Quarter '09 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given to you at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Vera Rosi. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Vera Rosi, and on behalf of Morgan Stanley, we are pleased to be hosting AMX's fourth quarter conference call. Speaking today will be Daniel Hajj, CEO of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil; Carlos Garc&#xED;a Moreno, CFO; and Daniela Lecuona, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>I will turn the call over Daniel Hajj. Thank you. Daniel?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Vera. Good morning, everyone. As always, Carlos is going to make a small summary of the fourth quarter results and he also is going to give a brief explanation of the proposed transaction that we're doing. So please, Carlos.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, Vera. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for hosting the call, Vera. Most of the Latin American economies, particularly in South America, recovering from the world economic crisis that shook the world. And helped also by transitional elements, subscriber growth picked up speed in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We added 6.6 million clients to end the year with 201 million subscribers, finally surpassing the 200 million subscriber mark, having obtained 18.2 million new clients, more than what we had estimated at the beginning of the year. Half of the net adds came from Brazil and the U.S., which accounted for 2.1 and 1.2 million subs, respectively. They were followed by Mexico that gained 807,000 subs, even after a clean up of one million subs that were not consuming, probably as a consequence of the economic downturn in the country.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. and Chile, we obtained twice as many clients in 2009 as in 2008. All of our operations based in low to mid estimates over the year . Brazil had 5.7 million subs, Mexico, 2.8, Argentina, 1.6, and Baltic and Peru 1.1 million, with the Dominican Republic just shy of one million. In realistic terms, the U.S. was the best performing in terms of subscriber growth, with subscriber base increasing 29%, followed by the Caribbean with 26, and Chile with 20%. Brazil is increased by 15% and Mexico is by 5%.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter service revenues expanded 13.4% from a year before, with data revenue soaring and voice revenues chairman practically across the board. The median rate of growth of data revenues in local currency terms was 54%, that of voice revenues, 4%. In Mexican peso terms, consolidated data revenues rose 48.7% and voice revenues 9.3% in annual terms.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the full year totaled 359 billion pesos, with service revenues rising 17% year-on-year, borne by data services that increased to 38.8%. EBITDA grew more rapidly than service revenues in the fourth quarter to which 40.8 billion pesos with the EBITDA margin climbing 1.1 percentage point year-on-year. EBITDA for the year was 159 billion pesos, at which was 14.3% of total revenues.</p>
          <p>Depreciation charges were raised by 4.4 billion pesos. We proceeded to depreciate more rapidly our GSM networks in some countries, which allowed us to reduce our '10 tax provision.</p>
          <p>Our net income came in at 13 billion pesos in the quarter and 70.5 billion pesos in the year. The latter figure represented an 18.5% increase over the previous year. Capital expenditures totaled 45 billion pesos, which is very much in line with what we had estimated, which is approximately $3.3 billion. And we amortized 38 billion pesos of debt and distributed 50 billion pesos to our shareholders via share buybacks and dividends, which attests to the strength of our cash flow.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was slightly more than 0.5 times. We have virtually exhausted our Cofin, the accounting reserve that shows the profits on which taxes have been paid, which marks the limit of what we can distribute without incurring additional taxes.</p>
          <p>Now, if I may, I will come up with a brief summery of the rationale for the transaction and some details on the proposed transaction. On January 13, Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil announced that its Board of Directors had authorized it to submit A) an offer for 100% of the equity of Carso Global Telecom, a holding company that own 59.4% of Telmex and 60.7% of Telmex Internacional, in exchange for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's shares at a ratio of 2.0474 to one.</p>
          <p>And B), another for buying Telint shares not owned by Carso Global Telecom to be purchased for 11.66 pesos per share or to be exchanged for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil shares at a ratio of 0.373 to one at the option of the shareholders. The offers have been accepted by Carso Global and Telint's Board of Directors.</p>
          <p>In the telecommunications sector, technology has evolved in such a way as to create a greater integration between the fixed and wireless networks. This technological convergence is allowing companies to provide integrated services to their clients in a way that is attractive to them, both in terms of the commercial offerings it makes possible and in terms of the convenience it entails regarding billing and customer service, among others.</p>
          <p>The evolution of new technologies in both the wireless and wireline world will lead to faster speeds of data transmission in the next several years. This faster speed, coupled with new, more affordable, and those more prevalent devices and new genres of applications will lead to a significant expansion in the demand for the data services. It will be particularly relevant for our region of operation.</p>
          <p>Broadband penetration is still low in Latin America; only 6% on average in the top seven countries by population, having been held back by cost of personal computers, which have been relatively expensive for this region of the world. As more affordable devices are introduced, the barrier of entry several people have faced when looking what's the fastest in data services to browse the Internet, among other things, will come down, opening the way for people to use such services.</p>
          <p>We believe the number of broadband accesses in the region, fixed and wireless will increase significantly in the years ahead and there will be demand for various types of data services, including video. Pooling our resources with those of Telmex and Telmex Internacional will allow us to obtain important economies of scale that none of us individually would be able to achieve.</p>
          <p>These economies of scale will be reflected on our CapEx. There will be a greater bang for the buck, so to speak, on our commercial distribution and on the operation of the networks. But they will also be evident in the stronger position we will have for the procurement of equipment and content, and in better customer service.</p>
          <p>All said, the move towards putting together our wireless and wireline networks will allow us to provide integrated services and will ultimately help us in winning the preference of new clients and in maintaining the one of those already with us. The integration of our Companies will make us more competitive for the benefit of our clients, our employees, and our shareholders. We do not have any estimates we can share with you at this point on the synergies that will be derived from this integration.</p>
          <p>We believe they will be quite significant, both in the short-term and in the medium and long-term. Partly they will take the form of savings with extend overlap in term because of that same area , partly in the form of our getting more done with the same resources, distribution, investment into networks. It is a strategic move that will bring about important benefits to the combined entities.</p>
          <p>Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil investor has been putting in place 3G networks in all of our operations. They have been up and running for not much more than a year. And from what we've seen thus far is that the manageable data services took off much faster than anyone had anticipated, not the market, not us. And this was the case even in the midst of a major economic downturn.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we moved towards providing quadruple-play in our operations in Central America and the Caribbean, where we already have fixed line assets. These experiences and the outlook for data services, given better economic conditions and ongoing development in the industry, which I already mentioned the production of new web portable devices and workings. Let us look quickly in the reintegration of the mobile and fixed networks. If our offer goes through as expected, we will be in a position to offer integrated services in substantially all of our operations as required, and we'll be much better prepared to manage the rising tide of data services.</p>
          <p>In the particular case of Mexico, we will have to await clarification on the part of the regulators before we can operate services jointly. As mentioned earlier, Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil will be tendering for only stock of Telmex International and intends to be listed eventually. In the case of Telmex, we are not tendering for the rest of the stock. It is to remain with an important base of minority shareholders. Notwithstanding this, we expect we can mutually derive significant benefits from working together in a more coordinated fashion.</p>
          <p>This transaction needs to be authorized by the competition and telecom regulators in all eight countries concerned: Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, and Peru. We expect we will be able to walk in with the tender offer and close the transaction in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Thank you. This will be the summary. Vera, and maybe we can pass the floor on to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. I have two questions and then I will open for Q&amp;A. So my first question is about your uses of cash. So given the low level of leverage of AMX, even after the transaction is done, does AMX intend to increase the buybacks and dividends this year, relatively to previous years? And one question about the transaction. Is there a minimum tender condition, or you accept any or all shares tendered in the case of TII? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. We're preparing the tender offer. At this moment, we think that there is not going to be any minimum condition for the tender. I think we're going to buy all the shares that they want to sell. So there is no minimum condition. I think if we get 95% of the shares, then we can get the majority &#x2013; or the 100% of the shares. We can list the Company. But if not, we're going to buy all the shares.</p>
          <p>And the uses of cash, well, we need to wait a little bit to see which is the amount of money that we're going to pay for Telmex Internacional. We don't know exactly at this moment which percentage of &#x2013; is going to be on shares and which one is going to be on cash. So we're waiting until that, and then when we finalize that, then we can decide more or less what we're going to do.</p>
          <p>But as Carlos said a few minutes ago, this last year in 2009, we have around five &#x2013; more than $4 billion in dividends, extra dividends and buybacks. And I think we're going to &#x2013; it's around 50 billion pesos what we do last year. I don't think there's going to be big changes, depending on what's going to be the amount of cash that we pay for Telmex Internacional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And Sincha, I think we are ready to open for Q&amp;A now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And we do ask that you limit yourself to two questions.</p>
          <p>And our first question will come from the line of Ric Prentiss from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. My question is in Mexico. The one million subscriber clean up, was that all done within the quarter? And if so, obviously a very impressive gross number. Can you update us as far as what is happening in the Mexican economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, we cleaned up one million subscribers in the quarter. I think these million subscribers, they are not consuming. I think all of them were prepaid subscribers, and I think mainly they stop the consumption because of the economic situation that we have last year. Still is difficult to say what is going to happen on economy of Mexico. I'm sure it's going to grow, I don't know how &#x2013; how much it's going to grow, depends a lot of what's going to happen on the U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>But even with a difficult situation last year, people use data. We grow our postpaid. So, I think this strategy that we're taking in Mexico, and in all Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil is working as &#x2013; is working very well. And we have good growth on data, but we are in Mexico, especially, we had good growth also on voice. So I'd say we are doing okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last year at this time, you gave your initial 2010 outlook for subscribers; how is your visibility into Latin America? And can you give us a thought about what you think 2010 is going to look like from a net add or other guidance standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it will be around 13 million subscribers that were budget &#x2013; that we have. And that's our target for 2010 on Latin America. Depends a lot in U.S.; we are doing very well. So we can increase a little bit depending on the U.S. platform, but I think our target is 13 million subscribers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from the line of James Rivett from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Two questions, if I can. The first is on the recent Cofetel ruling about your dominance in Mexican mobile. How does this change the way that you're thinking, what should we expect to change, and what do you guys expect the change as result of this?</p>
          <p>And secondly, very strong growth within the U.S. business. I just wonder &#x2013; I just wanted a conformation about whether you guys would be interested in acquiring a network infrastructure that's available for sale within the U.S. market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, James, it was not Cofetel. The one that gave the resolution was Cofeco. And it has to go to Cofetel to put some conditions. The conditions are in quality, in information, and in pricing, okay, or pricing, or quality, or information. So I think in information, we're giving all the information. On quality, we're very sure that we give very good quality to all our customers; that's why we have the preference. And in terms of pricing, that's not me, what I'm saying; also is the <mark type="inaudible" /> is saying that he is looking that the market is doing very good on pricing.</p>
          <p>So I don't know exactly what those Cofetel should do. If they lower the price, then we're going to be bigger. If they tell us not to lower the price, then there's not going to be competition. So I don't know exactly what could be on pricing. So I don't think there is going to be something important for Telcel with this resolution, but in the other hand, this resolution is appealable, and we're going to see what &#x2013; we're studying what we're going to do with the resolution. So I don't see at the short term major changes with this resolution.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Campbell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Daniel and Carlos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One second Andrew, I think I missed one more question about TracFone. Is that we are at this moment, I think that we have very good growth in the market and we are not looking to buy any infrastructure in U.S. So I think we're doing excellent, and we're going to follow what we're doing today. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your line is open, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just going back to the merger, or the proposed transaction again, it would seem that one of the biggest synergy opportunities is in Brazil. And I was wondering if you could give us some color on what kinds of synergies are available in Brazil, and in particular, do you plan on merging together completely Claro and Embratel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&gt;: Well, it's a very good question. I'm sorry not to answer you exactly what we're going to do, because we are still studying. There's some legal things that we need to study in Brazil. How &#x2013; of course we want to integrate the Companies, but we're studying how we are going to integrate the Companies. There are some fiscal and regulatory issues that we need to look before taking a decision.</p>
          <p>But I'm sure that in terms of taxes, in terms of networks, in terms of commercial integrated services, we are going to have a lot of synergies in Brazil. So I don't have any doubt that &#x2013; the two Companies together, Embratel and Claro, are going to be more stronger in the market and they are going to have better network staff to what we have as standalone Companies today. So we are in the middle of checking how we're going to do the integration, and how is the best way to do the integration in Brazil, and not only in Brazil. We are going to do it also in Colombia, in Argentina, in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and all the countries where Telmex Internacional is operating.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morin from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Daniel and Carlos. I was hoping to look at growth rates and compare and contrast what's happening in Brazil versus Mexico. Specifically, it's interesting that you now &#x2013; you grew faster in Mexico than in Brazil this quarter. Your postpaid net adds were very strong in Mexico, but a little bit sluggish in Brazil. And ARPU ticked up in Mexico, and it ticked down in Brazil. So I was hoping you could help us parse out what is happening in both markets, specifically in Brazil. Are we seeing the consequences of a SIM only strategy, and perhaps intensifying competition? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have the same strategy in all Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil in all the countries. In some countries are working better than in other ones, but I'm sure that in Brazil are totally different conditions in Brazil. Still, we have a very good growth in prepaid. Competition, SIM cards only are things that are happening there. But we are focusing on data. We are focusing on postpaid. We need to make some changes in the distribution channels. And we are working on doing more things in Brazil to sell more data services, to sell more postpaid customers, and to increase more our revenue and data.</p>
          <p>I think one of the good things is that with the &#x2013; also in the networks, the networks are going to help us a lot to sell more data. If you compare Brazil Claro to Mexico, of course, we are doing much better in Mexico. But I think if you compare, in Brazil, Claro against the other ones, I think we are not doing so bad. We need to make some adjustments. We need to do a lot more things, but I think were in the right direction in Brazil, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then specifically in Mexico, the ARPU pickup that you've seen, is that a function of you growing postpaid faster than the prepaid base, or if we were to break out ARPU between prepaid and postpaid, would we be seeing the ARPU going up for both segments independently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think ARPU is growing in both segments independently. Even, I think in prepaid is growing a little bit more than in postpaid, because we have a lot of competition on postpaid, so prices are growing fast down, but data is helping us to increase a little bit what we're losing on price and everything else.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Thank you very much for the call. Two quick questions related to Telecom. The first one is, Telecom has all this in the money forwards on Telmex and TII shares, how do you look at these forwards, how do you value them, 9% of Telmex, 9% of TII, and how much &#x2013; and what will happen upon the transaction with the TII forwards? Will they be converted into forward <mark type="inaudible" />? That will be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, Carlos was saying how you've defeated Cofin and Daniel was talking about distributions into next year. If I'm not mistaken, Telecom has about 80 or 90 billion pesos of Cofin which you would inherit. Would you try and take advantage of this and could we see upside to distributions once the transaction closes from having such a high Cofin balance all of sudden?</p>

          <p>Hi, Tom&#xE1;s. On the stock owned by Carso Global, my understanding is that it's all financing, there's really no upside by way of auctions or anything. I think on any additional shares to what they have already reported us, the only shareholdings be 59.4 of Telmex and 50.7 of Telint that we have mentioned. So to refer my understanding, that is the only net position in stock that they have. It happens to be the case that they have financed the acquisition of those shares in way that volume may involve some kind of forward &#x2013; maybe have been structured a forward, but net-net, there is no additional shares that they could be entitled to other than the ones that we have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>As regards to Cofin, well, yet we have to go into all the details of what Carso Global has. My understanding is that, yes, they do have some Cofin but it is important to understand that you may only be able to &#x2013; you may only utilize it depending on the way how the Company's integrated. And we are not sure that we have the flexibility of integrating it for use within the actual B Corp of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, which is where we would need to have the Cofin. So one thing is that the subsidiaries below have the Cofin and quite only one that the holding company at the top actually have it and may be able to use it. But these are things we will be able to have more clarity on as &#x2013; over the next several weeks. We probably will be able to give you a better perspective later on.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but there is a filing at the SEC by Telmex, and a filing by TII, saying that in addition to the shares held directly by Telecom, they own forwards and something like 1.6 billion shares, or something. It's about 9% of Telmex and 9% of TII. This has been filed with expiry dates and specific counterparties.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've already told you what I have heard &#x2013; what I have been told is that they don't have any additional shares, and that what they have &#x2013; whatever filings you may be referring to has to do with the way the financing has been structured, the financings which &#x2013; that was put in place for them to acquire the shares. And I have not said that they may not have any kind of forwards. They probably have some kind of forwards. But I know, what I have been told is that they have no additional rights or namely other shares to what they have already announced to their own shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two quick questions for you. First of all, with respect to TracFone in the U.S., really breakeven from an operating cash flow or an EBITDA standpoint in the quarter. Just was wondering what you see that as meaning for your pricing strategy there going forward, whether you view it more as a market share opportunity rather than a near-term cash flow generation opportunity?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just was wondering if I could get your thoughts on the wireless auction rules in Mexico and whether or not you plan on contesting them legally in court now that they have been formally published? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On TracFone, the strategy that we have been following in the U.S. was around subscribers, but we also want to grow on a profitable way and in &#x2013; and that's the way that we're going to still do it this year and next year.</p>
          <p>So I think our product is working, and the new product Straight Talk is working very good, and we're going to grow as much as possible, but on a profitable way. When I mean profitable way, does not mean that our EBITDA is going to be reduced because of the big growth that we could do. What I'm talking is that these subscribers that we're acquiring in the future will be profitable, and if we have that, then we're going to grow as much as possible, and as we want &#x2013; as we can.</p>
          <p>In the wireless auction in Mexico, the rules are already in the market. So they are letting us participate to buy in some regions 20 megahertz, in other 30 megahertz, and we are working to define which frequencies, and where we need to buy spectrum. So my answer is, yes, we are interested in participating in these auctions. We are not 100% happy with the rules that they gave, but in some cases we're going to participate with 20 megahertz, in other regions with 30 megahertz, and I think that that's okay with us, no?</p>

We're working to put more capacity. I think this transaction that we're doing is going to help us to be more robust on all our networks, and I think we are well advanced against our competitors.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Yes, question on data, I guess in two parts. Firstly, if you could give us a way of thinking about the growth in data demand, in terms of its percentage revenue contribution to the group today, and how this might grow, given that it's surprised thus far?</p>
          <p>And secondly, what does this is mean for the network in terms of traffic growth? How are you positioned to cope with what you admitted is a surprising level of demand growth, and given that a lot of the growth is now in terms of video, as you say. Do you think that's going to prompt further investment in spectrum? I mean, maybe outside Mexico, but also things like base-stations and backhaul? Any sort of color on those would be fantastic. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, we are not disclosing that. I told you the percentage of data, but we're growing good. We are being investing a lot in the backbone, in the backhaul. I think if you see Latin America, still data revenues are low, still penetration in ADSL is not so high, in television it's not so. In the future, we have a lot growth in these three products, and it's again why we've decided to do this transaction, because we're going to offer integrated products, and we're going to have a lot of synergies in the network.</p>
          <p>In my view, we have been investing a lot in the data networks, as in the 3G network, data networks, and we're going to still invest a lot. But I don't think that we're going be investing more than what we have being investing in the past. The CapEx for Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil this year is going to be around &#x2013; between three billion and $3.5 billion. Let's say Telmex Internacional is going to be this year around 1.2 or $1.3 billion. So in Latin America, if you see that, I don't think we're going to increase the CapEx, but we're going to get lot more capacity with this amount of money that we're investing.</p>
          <p>So that's the rationale of this transaction. So, it's &#x2013; I think data, you're going to still see good growth in data. Still a small amount of postpaid subscribers has a data plan, a small amount of prepaid subscribers are using data, still ADSL we're going to grow, still television. So there is a big &#x2013; a new products and a big market that we can attack in the future now.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I had question about the shareholder agreement mentioned in the 13D by Telmex Internacional on January 27. It's talking about a proposed agreement between AT&amp;T and Carso Global that would in effect allow Carso Global to, if I'm reading it correctly, basically double the amount of L-shares they have in Telmex Internacional through the conversion of their A and AA shares. Now if that's the case, then Carso Global would end up owning, I believe, 67% of Telmex International, not the 60% as it does currently.</p>
          <p>Is there any sort of precedence &#x2013; would this kind of shareholder agreement go into effect relatively soon? Do you know anything about it? And could it possibly affect the amount of shares you would have to swap, or the amount of cash that you would have to pay out to get the remaining control of Telmex Internacional?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't read the file that Telmex do. I think that's more of a question for Telmex Internacional, not for us, but what Carlos said is that we are buying Carso Global Telecom that had the percentage that we already do, I think it's 60.7% of Telmex Internacional and 59 something of &#x2013; 59.4 of Telmex. So I think that's what we are buying, and other things with Telmex International, I don't know it. We can review it and check it with you. But that's specifically what we are, that's the proposed transaction that we are doing, no?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. First is when do you expect to close this transaction? So how long will it take you to get all the commission that you need? And second is you mentioned that Cofeco's ruling now goes to Cofetel, and they can decide what to do. Do you think there is a possibility of them implementing what is called asymmetric interconnection rates in Mexico, because that was mentioned as one of the possibilities by one of the commissions of Cofetel recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rizwan, only to finalize the other question is, we intend to pay with the shares that we have in the treasury of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, and I think most of the shares that we have in the treasury of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil are L-shares. So that's the way we are going to pay to Carso Global Telecom and to the Telink shares with our shares that we held in the treasury, okay?</p>
          <p>In &#x2013; and your question was on about the asymmetric rate. Well, the resolution of Cofeco was in the final price, not in the intermediate price, as the interconnections. There is another resolution in process that they are checking about, and we don't know what's going to be the decision on Cofeco. But this one could not be on the interconnection rate. It's only on the final price. And as I told you, I don't think there's going to be major changes as the <mark type="inaudible" /> Cofetel is going to say. But we're going to see &#x2013; but before that, we are going to see if we're going to appeal this decision. So we're in the middle of defining what we're going to do with that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I will &#x2013; I'd say that the total shares outstanding in <mark type="inaudible" /> is a little bit less than 40% of Telmex Internacional shares, so that would have a market value about 3.5 billion, roughly. I think that we can deal with it and have our cash, we have some committed lines of credit, and very likely to the extent that we have to use this money, we'll probably be taking out some of the bonding with the transactions on the &#x2013; longer-term transaction in the markets. There is no limit in terms of how much we can pay in cash for that 40%. So at the limit, all of that will be paid in cash.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Couple of questions, first basically on Mexico, but firstly, after the Cofeco decision, do you see a risk that in Mexico there will be a restriction on the pricing differential between on-net pricing and off-net pricing? I think I'm right in saying that's already happened in Colombia. Is that, I guess, a reasonable outcome from this process?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on Mexico, just looking at the acceleration of revenue growth, I mean, I wondered if you talk qualitatively about what's driven that? Is it faster data growth this quarter than last quarter? Is it slower voice pricing declines, or is it a pickup in corporate usage? If you could just give some color around that, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The second question, can you repeat it, because I don't get it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm just trying to understand, there has been acceleration in revenue growth in Mexico. And I'm trying looking at whether, how much of that's come from a faster data growth rate this quarter? How much of this is due to slower voice pricing declines? Or whether there's just been a pickup in corporate usage as the economy has recovered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're growing in not only in Mexico, we're growing in all the countries, the revenue. And it's not only on data, it has &#x2013; it's also from voice. It's also on the prepaid, each and every thing. In Mexico, the mobile growth is 15.8%, from 172 to 199, so I think we have a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>As to &#x2013; we're getting very good customers. You could see that the customers that we're getting in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, not only in Mexico, are good customers and we have been taking care of that, know that all the money that we spend in acquisition costs would be for good subscribers.</p>
          <p>In the on-net restrictions, well, what happens in Colombia, I think Colombia is really reviewing that because what happens is if they are going to &#x2013; if they are going to &#x2013; if there was a resolution set that I need to reduce my off-net rate, then again, it's going to be better, the off-net is going to be better for Mexico and then I'm going to grow more so.</p>
          <p>I don't know exactly what was the idea of this resolution, because if you make &#x2013; if you tell Telcel to reduce prices, than you're going to be bigger. If you stop prices, then there's not going to be no competition. So it's a very difficult to understand what &#x2013; why was this decision. The only thing that I told you is that Cofeco said that we are not making &#x2013; that they said that they are not recommending to Cofetel to do any &#x2013; yes, any measures on terms of pricing. So, and what Cofetel is saying that we're not making any bad practice, okay. They are saying that we are big but that we are not making a bad practice in the market. So I don't really understand why they do this decision.</p>
          <p>Really, what is happening in Mexico is that people, because we have good coverage, good quality, good pricing, good network, good data, good handsets, good &#x2013; it's very important, we have a very good data network. The quality of the data that we're giving is very good. We have the preference of the customer, and I think it's really why we are growing.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions actually. First, just want to clarify, Daniel mentioned that it hasn't been determined or decided yet whether AMX will just issue L-shares or A and AA to exchange with Carso and Telmex Internacional. Did you mean that for both Companies, that you could be just L-shares, or you mean just the tender offer for Telmex Internacional? That's question one. And question two, it might be a bit early for the detail, but so far what's &#x2013; it seems that you've been saying that there shouldn't be tax synergies in this transaction.</p>
          <p>But for example, as you plan the integration of Embratel and Claro in Brazil, goodwill is tax deductible, so I would expect that to generate significant tax synergies. Plus, as you consolidate all the subsidiaries into a single one, there is &#x2013; you will be canceling out costs and revenues, so that could generate tax synergies as well. I'm not sure if you could share with us any thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What you are saying is totally correct. We don't have the number still today. But we're going to have tax synergies and we are going to have other synergies, and we're planning to do that. What we're really working, and we're going to know in the next weeks is how we're going to integrate the Companies. Because it's very important the way to integrate the Companies so we have very good savings on taxes and everything else.</p>
          <p>In the &#x2013; the first question is, we intend &#x2013; we're preparing the offer, but we intend to pay with the shares that we have in the treasury, that we held on our treasury. So almost, a lot of those shares &#x2013; almost 99.9% of the shares that we have are L-shares, so that's why we think that we're going to pay with the L-shares. That's the reason, because we intend to pay with the shares that we have, so that's what we're planning to do. We are not finalizing the offer, but we think we're going to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think all the details should be contained in the filing that we will be making of the offering in the next several weeks.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. I have two questions, please. The first one is if I look across your businesses in Latin America, it looks as though rates at which voice pricing is coming down has improved, and I was wondering, has this been a conscious business decision to now be less competitive on voice yourself? Or are you seeing less competitive intensity that's causing you to drive pricing down? It would be interesting to understand whether this is now a kind of start of a trend where voice pricing might be able to stabilize.</p>
          <p>And the second question I had was just regarding the Telecom tax and VAT increase in Mexico. I'm wondering if you could share with us how you have changed your pricing to adjust for that, and during month of January, what changes you've seen in consumer behavior in terms of how people are dealing with the new tax? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. The first question is I don't think &#x2013; well, in all Latin America are different rates and different competitors. I think we have being very aggressive in terms of pricing. One example, let's say Mexico, Mexico in terms of the OCDE, we're one of the lowest in terms of price. It's $0.05 of a dollar, so we have very good price in prepaid and in postpaid. We are going to still reduce the price.</p>
          <p>We really don't know, but it's going to depend on the competitor. And in all the rest of the countries, it's going to depend also on the competition. But if we need to reduce prices to be more competitive, we are going to do it, and if we need to invest, we're investing to do that. So, still we have a lot of capacity in all our GSM networks. So if we need to reduce more the price and have more minutes in the network, we don't have any problem on doing that.</p>
          <p>And the second question on taxes, can you repeat it, please?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is taxes in Mexico &#x2013; I haven't been any &#x2013; it's very early to see how the taxes are going to impact the products. But maybe in the second quarter -- we need three months to review what's happening as to with the customers. It's not only the &#x2013; these taxes, what is happening is that we have other taxes, and these are going to take money from the people, and we don't know how those &#x2013; the people are &#x2013; is going to behave in our sector. So we need a little bit of time to see what's happening.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you increased your retail pricing, though, to match the price increase &#x2013; sorry, the tax increase?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We increased &#x2013; in some cases, we increase exactly the amount of the tax that they put us, yes.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Arena Watchsmith from Seaboro Price. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick questions. One is on your tax rate going forward, with this change in Mexico and now the merger with TII and Telmex. What should we expect in terms of the effective tax rate going forward, the net income tax rate?</p>
          <p>And then I wanted to ask about Brazil, we saw a clear improvement in the margin, but what should we expect for this year? And also, what do you think could happen if there is some contradiction in Brazil to your margin, even if you don't actively participate, what you think would happen if there were one less player in Brazil? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Arena, on the tax rate, the effective tax rate should increase at some point, to the extent that the marginal tax rate in Mexico is going up from 28 to 30%. But then you really have to look at what would the combined operation will look like, because of what Daniel mentioned a little while ago.</p>
          <p>There will be some important tax changes within the transaction. And so we would need to come up with those numbers to see what will be the net effect between this year and the next following several years. There are some tax losses to income operations that will be utilized, and that's really having an impact on our effective tax rate.</p>
          <p>And as regards Brazil, well, this whole issue of the market consolidating and losing one player, you know have been there at least for the last five years, as far as I can remember and &#x2013; but what we have said is that we expect something like this happens. It's not something that is driven by the market, but is driven by the quite similar situation for some shareholders are. It is very &#x2013; the reduction of a player, that will have an impact on margins, so things come clearer.</p>
          <p>I would take this product as referring the capacity that if the steady state EBITDA margins are sealed into categories that going to -- with one less player, should probably put us in the low 40s situation. In my view, that's I think what we could have in terms of impact on margins. But again, you know this is something that we have been talking for the last five years at least, and we hadn't really changed anything. It's not something that will be driven by the market, and we are really not counting on that.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Thanks very much indeed for the call. And just a couple of questions, the three to 3.5 billion CapEx budget, does that include any allowances for the spectrum in Mexico? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, you mentioned that you changed the bad debt policy in Brazil. If you adjusted for that policy, what would be the EBITDA if you adjusted, if you did it based on the like-for-like basis for fourth quarter '08?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just looking at your gross fixed assets in the third quarter, year-to-date, you added about 60 billion to your gross fixed assets in the fourth quarter. And then we would expect to put it more like 70 billion, and this compared to stated CapEx of 45 billion, so what's the discrepancy between the CapEx you disclosed and the increase in gross fixed assets? Is the CapEx you disclosed cash CapEx or accruals?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answer to the first question, no. Answer to the second question, what was the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's &#x2013; we basically moved to increase provisions from tax clauses. I think that we have a fair provision to-date, but I cannot give you an amount of how much it affects EBITDA. But I think it's &#x2013; suffice it to say that we have been provisioning of revenues, a higher number than what we actually needed. And that's because we wanted to be more conservative. We knew that we were going to be facing tough times ahead, and this year seemed to be a little bit uncertain, and we wanted to play it safe.</p>
          <p>And the rest, your third question, maybe you can follow-up later with Daniela. I don't know exactly what is...</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just on the spectrum and what <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is -- CapEx, what we show as CapEx is the accrued CapEx, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the spectrum, what is going to be a ballpark budget that you had set aside for the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. We are now transfer, we don't know. I think on the spectrum, there are some &#x2013; there are some rights that you have to pay per year. And there is going to be a price that you pay upfront. So, I don't know exactly how much it's going to be, the price that you pay upfront. And depending on how much or what &#x2013; how many megahertz you win, that's going to be the rights that you have to pay to the government each year. I think for the first two years, there is not going to be rights, and then the next year there's going to be the rights. Now that's more or less what the rule said.</p>
