          <p>Please stand by. We are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. Your lines will be muted throughout the duration of the conference. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation that's available on our website. We'll take questions after we walk through the presentation and remember, the disclaimer in the back of the presentation.</p>
          <p>So if you turn to page 1, for the quarter, we generated net income of $3.7 billion, $0.90 per share on revenues of $22.2 billion. Return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 11%. For the full year, we generated record net income of $19 billion. That's up 9% over last year, $4.48 per share which was also a record per share on revenues of a little under $100 billion. Return on tangible common equity for the year was approximately 15%.</p>
          <p>There's a few significant items in the quarter. We highlight them up front. I'm going to discuss each of them in the businesses. So as you see we ended the quarter on a tier 1 common basis of $123 billion, strong Basel 1 Basel III ratios of 10% and 7.9% respectively, and for the full year, we increased our Basel III ratio by approximately 90 basis points and that's after the re-purchase of $9 billion of our stock this year.</p>
          <p>As we noted last quarter, we continue to see year-on-year loan growth across many of the businesses. Total loan balances across the company were up $31 billion year-on-year, and if you exclude the impact of the $30 billion in runoff in our home lending portfolio, predominantly WaMu related, the year-on-year growth $60 billion would be a run rate of 9% year-over-year, and just to highlight some of the specific small business loans were up 52%. Market loans up 17%. Trade finance loans, up 73%. We also saw a card outstanding growth this quarter and solid mortgage originations. Deposit growth also continued in the quarter. Liability balances ended the year at $1.1 trillion. That's up $200 billion or 21% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>I've covered much of the data on page 2 and 3. So if you turn right into the investment bank on page 4, you see circled net income of $720 million. That's on revenue of $4.4 billion. We highlighted on page 1 the first significant item impacted the IB results this quarter. That's $570 million DVA loss on a pre-tax basis and that reduced our reported EPS for the quarter by $0.09 a share and that's largely the result of the firm's tightening credit spreads this quarter.</p>
          <p>You know, we've consistently said we don't consider these gains or losses to be part of the underlying operating performance of the business, but when it's material to the results, we're go going to identify that number as a significant item. If you exclude DVA, revenue for the IB in the quarter was $4.9 billion. That's up 10% quarter-on-quarter. It's still down 21% year-on-year. Net income ex-DVA was $1.1 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you go into the particulars, IB fees of $1.1 billion this quarter are down almost 40% year-on-year, up modestly quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by the low industry-wide volumes that we talked about last quarter. We did maintain our number one ranking for global IB fees this year, and we also generated record loan syndication fees this year which is, again, part of that loan story we talked about. You can find the league table results in the back in the appendix on page 20.</p>
          <p>Fixed income markets, revenues of $2.6 billion, ex-DVA, that's down 9% year-on-year, 6% quarter-on-quarter and we continue to see solid client revenue across most of our products in fixed income.</p>
          <p>Equity markets revenue was $0.8 billion. That's ex-DVA down 26% year-on-year, 23% quarter-on-quarter. That's primarily been driven by lower market volumes and I would add we had some consistent results again this quarter in our prime services businesses so the volume impact was largely in our cash and our derivatives business. We recognized negative revenues of $31 million, I'm sorry in the credit portfolio. Largely driven by the DVA losses and that's offset by the NII on fees and retained loans, and then we had a small net CVA gain this quarter.</p>
          <p>Credit costs in the quarter are $272 million. That largely reflected some name specific charge-offs, and then on the expense side, you see $3 billion in expenses, down a little under 30% year-on-year. That's driven by lower comp and lower non-comp expenses. The comp-to-revenue ratio for the year we reported was 34%. If you exclude DVA, the revenue was 36%, and that's largely at the lower end of our prior guidance of 35% to 40% for the year.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm going to actually skip page 5 as well and drill down to specifics of CBB on page 6. You see circled net income of $800 million. That's down 16% year-on-year on revenues of $4.3 billion. Revenues are down $365 million quarter-on-quarter. That largely reflects the impact of Durbin this quarter. Year-on-year, revenues are down 2% and that was an increase in deposit-related fees that partially offset the impact of Durbin this quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to see very positive growth in a number of the fundamental measures we keep track of for the business year-on-year. Total deposits were up $25 billion, 260 new branch builds during the course of 2011. 246 CPC, Chase Private Client branches, opened this year and we added 3,800 new sales staff, bankers, salesmen, mortgage brokers during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Expenses up 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by that investment spend I just talked about. Also, I want to remind you the impact of both the rate environment and the regulatory environment on 2012 earnings, we expect spread compression likely to have a negative impact on earnings next year of about $400 million, plus or minus, as deposit margins are going to continue to decline in 2012. And on the Durbin amendment, we've said it will reduce earnings by $600 million plus or minus on an annualized basis in the course of 2012.</p>
          <p>If you skip &#x2013; move to page 7, mortgage production and servicing, loss for the business of $260 million this quarter and that compares to net income of $330 million in the prior year. Production-related revenues, that's at the top of the page, and if you exclude repurchases, was $1.1 billion. That's down 20% year-on-year; originations of $39 billion are down 24% year-on-year, but up actually slightly quarter-on-quarter, and we experienced some lower margin in that business. I'd also add activity this quarter was largely driven by refinancing.</p>
          <p>Repurchase losses in the quarter, you see were $390 million. That's slightly higher in the quarter based on acceleration of the timing of certain claims with the agencies. We do continue to expect for next year $350 million plus or minus per quarter in repurchase losses, and that's largely in line with our prior guidance, and I'll remind everyone our total repurchase reserves remained at $3.6 billion; $3.2 billion in this division.</p>
          <p>Servicing-related revenue in the middle of the page of $1.1 billion is down 9% year-on-year and that's largely a decline in our service portfolio. And that was partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of the MSR asset. Servicing expense, you see in the middle, $925 million in the quarter. It remains very elevated as a function of default costs, which represent about 75% of that total number, and we would expect that number to remain high certainly through the first half of 2012. We did record an MSR risk management loss of a little under $400 million this quarter &#x2013; $377 million. The results really are a combination of reduction of the MSR asset of $830 million. That's based on valuation adjustments and rate. And that was offset by a $460 million gain from hedging the asset. And for those interested in the MSR, I'd point you to a detail in the financial supplement in the footnotes.</p>
          <p>Page 8, real estate portfolios; a modest net loss in the quarter. That compared to a net loss of a little over $800 million in the prior year. Revenues, same story as we've been talking about; down 20% year-on-year; consistent with the reduction in the NII from the portfolio runoff. And, as we said was $700 million a year and remember, balances were down $30 billion year-on-year. We'd expect to see balances continue to decline somewhere in the 10% to 15% range again in 2012, and that would have the result of reducing NII next year by $500 million plus or minus, but remember, that reduction will also free up capital at the company level.</p>
          <p>Expenses, up 5% year-on-year and that continues to be consistent with the overall increase in servicing costs that I talked about in mortgage servicing.</p>
          <p>I want to cover credit on page 9. So if you turn to 9, you see circled net charge-offs of $877 million. That's, again, a marginal improvement versus the prior quarter. We experienced improvement this quarter in our early stage delinquencies. You can see those charts on page 19 in the appendix, and we saw that improvement both in our NCI and our PCI portfolios, and again, we've experienced the consistent improving level of net charge-offs for several quarters in the NCI portfolio.</p>
          <p>So the results of those factors is a net release of $230 million in our home lending portfolio and there are two components to that reserve change. First, in NCI, we took a $1 billion reduction in reserves, primarily due to the improvement in our outlook for losses, particularly in home equity and subprime, and reminder now, current reserve levels for the portfolio are at $8.7 billion. The PCI portfolio, we actually added $770 million to reserves and that, remember, is a lifetime loss estimate and while we've seen improvement in the delinquencies in the portfolio, they weren't as significant as we expected in our lifetime loss estimates, primarily driven by default frequencies relative to modeled expectations, and so we, therefore, increased reserves.</p>
          <p>Reserves in the portfolio now are $5.7 billion, but if you step back from all of this given the improvement in credit performance, you'll see over in the right we're revising our quarterly loss guidance to $900 million, plus or minus. That's down from the $1.2 billion we had in the prior quarter and that's for 2012.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 10, Card Services and Auto, circle consolidated net income for the business of $1.1 billion, that's on revenues of $4.8 billion. You know, we continue to see the trend that we talked about all year. Credit costs down again this quarter. You see the details on the Chase portfolio at the bottom of the page. 3.93% net charge-off rate, that's again, below our through the cycle target, 30 plus day delinquencies declined to 2.54%. That's 112 basis points below the prior year.</p>
          <p>And just a quick note here; we're going to report Chase and WaMu portfolios as a single portfolio in 2012 and for the combined portfolio which end ended 2011 at a net charge-off rate at 4.33%, we'd expect Q1 rate to be 4.50% plus or minus. It tends to be slightly elevated versus the year-end, just literally as a function of seasonality, but the absolute numbers should be consistent.</p>
          <p>As we highlighted on page 1, we did release $500 million in loan loss reserves this quarter in our card business and if you add that to the home lending actions, the combined release across consumer was $730 million and that had a positive impact on EPS of $0.11 a share.</p>
          <p>Back to card, though, total reserves in card will end the year at $7 billion. That's 5.3% of our outstandings, and the final note I'd say on card is on a sales volume basis, it continued to the be very solid results for the Chase portfolio, up 9% year-on-year, 14% if you exclude the impact of the Kohl's portfolio sale that we had and part of those increases are really being driven by our new product Sapphire Freedom, Inc. where sales growth is actually higher than the average.</p>
          <p>The result of all of that is we continue to think we picked up close to 180 basis points of market share in the Visa and the MasterCard systems.</p>
          <p>Page 11, the Commercial Bank, you see circled net income of $640 million. That's on record revenues of $1.7 billion. Full-year revenues of $6.4 billion, $2.4 billion in net income are both record performance for the business, and the revenue growth and the earnings continue to be driven by that same story of loan growth and liability balances. Six consecutive quarter of loan growth balances. You see EOP balances of $112 billion circled. That's up 13%. The market balances continued strong growth are up 17% year-on-year. That's the seventh consecutive quarter of growth and we also had record liability balances just slightly under $200 billion, up 35% or $52 billion year-on-year. So our customers are very well capitalized today, and then the overhead ratio continues to be very strong, credit story continues to be strong. The result is really excellent performance in our commercial bank this year.</p>
          <p>Treasury and Security Services on page 12. Revenues are up 6% year-on-year. In part, we had stronger growth in our TS business. You do see circled net income down 18% quarter-on-quarter of 250 million, really driven by two factors. We had some expense increases this quarter driven by exiting some unprofitable business we had, and also credit costs increased this quarter and that's related to some of those name specific charge-offs that I talked about in the Investment Bank. We have a share of credit expenses between those two businesses.</p>
          <p>We did, though, continue to see some real favorable trends in the quarter for the business. Liability balances up 42%, over $100 billion. I talked about trade loan up front and then international revenue growth, which is a big strategic push for us, grew 16% year-on-year and for the year, international represented 55% of the total revenue for this business. That's up from 49% last year so very good performance there.</p>
          <p>Asset Management on page 13, they had a weaker quarter and that was largely driven by market conditions. Revenues at $2.3 billion are down 13% year-on-year. Relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but the fourth quarter tends to be higher than normal and we had lower performance fees this quarter. So for the year, however, we did generate $9.5 billion of revenue and that was a record revenue number for this business, and it does reflect the positive long-term flows that we've seen throughout the year and a little better markets on average than 2010. It was our 11th consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows. We had $53 billion for the year. And we also did experience some significant inflows in our liquidity products this quarter.</p>
          <p>Expenses, while down year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter for this quarter were up 15% for the full year. We added a thousand people to this business, 700 of which are front office personnel bankers, salespeople, brokers and all that, you know, we expect that to improve future performance. Clearly it had a depressing impact on margins this quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 14, Private Equity and Corporate. Private Equity experienced a loss of $90 million. That's primarily due to market valuations and a lack of monetization opportunities in the quarter. Corporate, you see net income of a little over $300 million. That includes $528 million of an increase in litigation reserve. That was one of our significant items that reduced EPS $0.08 a share this quarter. The increase in reserves was predominantly for mortgage-related matters and then you see to the right, we do expect corporate, excluding private equity and significant items, to be a $200 million plus or minus net income number each quarter in 2012 and that's really a result of positioning the portfolio as well as some of the RWA implications of Basel III and what we can hold in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>I believe I've covered all the items on pages 15 and 16. So with that, operator, if you wouldn't mind, why don't you open it up for questions?</p>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about managing expenses in a tough environment. If the revenue environment remains tough, do you have plans to push expenses down company-wide in 2012 and maybe also just in the investment bank? Do you see the comp ratio moving lower amid all the regulatory changes and industry pullback, or do you expect 35% to 40% again in 2012? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you take a shot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the expense front, I think we are constantly working to try and manage the expenses. As you saw, expenses, John, we're down in the quarter versus year-over-year, and we're going to continue to manage it, and that's what we're expecting of all of our businesses. On the comp to revenue side on the Investment Bank, we think we paid appropriately given the performance of the Investment Bank, and I think we're going to expect it to return at appropriate levels based on that payout, but we're going to constantly be aware of what's going on in the market. We'll see where the markets end for 2011 for everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We basically expect our overhead, i.e., non-IB comp, to be about flat next year. Remember, that's after a lot of invest investments, too. I think we have pretty good expense control. The only thing I want to say about IB comp, I think you will see it stay around those numbers. There's an awful lot of pressure, we're getting an awful lot of pressure for our bankers and traders to increase our payout ratio to about what newspapers and media have, which is a little bit higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the thing you expect to be flat next year, Jamie, is your kind of core overhead, SG&amp;A type ex-litigation reserves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so if you look at the overhead which is almost $50 billion a year, and that's ex-IB comp and things that we have for litigation or something like that, to be essentially flat. But the way you think about that is we're making huge investments and if we have opportunities to market or do other stuff, we change that all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the net interest margin, Doug, it was up a bit this quarter. It looks like maybe some of the trading funding cost was lower. Can you talk about what drove that and what kind of outlook do you have for the NIM in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In NIM, John, it was really for the quarter, it was really a mix issue in part. We had lower cash. We had some redeployment in Treasury, and then we also had some lower rates on the deposit businesses so that's what we saw.</p>
          <p>I'd say for the outlook for the first quarter, we expect to see some downward pressure on NIM in the first quarter and that will be, you know, as we continue this mix in our portfolio on the loan side, greater growth on the wholesale side and some runoff in the consumer side, we'll also see a little lower-yielding loans that we add on, and the other piece I'd say is we got a lower yield in investment securities, I think, expected in this rate environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up; what kind of regulatory event is necessary for you to be able to redeem the $10 billion in TruPS [Trust Preferred Securities] that you talked about and when do you anticipate that might happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talked about that and I think clarification on the Basel III rules, we would expect will be the regulatory event and we're hopeful that that will happen sometime in the first quarter, but that's really up to the regulators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Glenn, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. The other day, Jamie, you mentioned housing at or near bottom. It's a little involved question, but curious to see, A) what you're seeing to give you that feeling? And then B) what needs to happen? In other words, I get that affordability metrics are okay, but there's a lot of inventory out there, underwriting standards are too tight. There's a lack of agency securitization market; just curious if you can expand on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the first part. I think what we need to see is employment. That's what we need to see because employment, in our opinion will drive household formation. If you look at the other factors, we destroyed more homes than we've built in the last several years. We added 10 million Americans. We're going to add 3 million Americans every year for the next ten years, that's 30 million Americans who need 13 million dwellings or something like that. Household formation has been half what it normally is and most economists say that going to come back with job creation and the so-called shadow inventory is coming down, not going up.</p>
          <p>So for all the chatter about it, it is very high. Rental in half the markets in America, it's now cheaper to rent than to buy &#x2013; it's cheaper to buy than to rent. Housing is all-time affordability and my guess is that mortgage underwriting will loosen, not tighten. If you put all those things together, you're going to have a turn at one point. I don't know if it's three months, six months, nine months, but it's getting closer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the past when we were going the other way, you were kind enough to give us some sensitivities around what happens if housing goes down x%. I'm not if you have gotten that optimistic to calculate it, but how sensitive is the whole balance sheet and earnings sheet to that improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was much more sensitive to it going down because we have to take capital losses than going up where we don't get appreciation. To me, if you have housing get better, our charge-offs will start to rapidly go down as you see real improvement in the mortgage portfolio and then we won't need all the reserves. So you get both of those things. We also will have, hopefully, active mortgage markets and healthy economy, and that would be great.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hear you. Another question is on capital markets related, as we all sit here and struggle between determining the cyclical versus secular pressure, how do you go about sizing the IB and most specifically, between the capital charges and potential Volcker changes, how do you think about the inventory businesses which you are so good in and big in as we sit here and wait for the rules?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to put Volcker aside, okay, because that really hasn't been written yet. There are a lot of things coming out about it. You can come up with a scenario which is not good. I should remind everybody on the phone that the United States has the widest, deepest and most transparent capital markets in the world and you should repeat that over and over, particularly when you go to Washington. The widest, deepest and the most liquid; i.e., for buyers and sellers, very narrow spreads. That's a very good thing, okay?</p>
          <p>The beneficiaries of very narrow spreads are the investors of the world. So if you lose liquidity, you lose market makers, it's going to cost retirees, pensioners, firemen, retired military more money to invest their money. So we need those things. I think we've got to be very careful we don't destroy that as we try to limit &#x2013; a fair limit they want to put on proprietary trading. So at the end of the day, I think we'll deal with that later.</p>
          <p>But I think it's secular <mark type="ph" /> is pretty much one of the ones that's (26:37) not permanent. I think that trading &#x2013; think about trading this way. We have 16,000 clients around the world. The amount of money that they are going to need to invest in the next ten years is going to double. Well, I think you have underlying growth. The same kind of underlying growth you had in the 2000s, the '90s, the '80s, the '70s, the '60s and of course, spreads will change and products will change and competition will change, and that's pretty good.</p>
          <p>So we're going to be in the business. We make markets actively for people. We are very good at it, and those institutions, 16,000, which include pension plans and governments and corporations, those are required services. You need to have people making markets so that people can move securities. So you're starting to see a lot of people understanding that. The volumes itself in the marketplace obviously go up or down pretty dramatically, not just by quarter, but sometimes by day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last one. I just saw a quick quote earlier that you felt the pressures are increasing in Europe. I think there's a lot of people that feel like some of the liquidity metrics that have been put in place are a good thing. If you could just comment on that, that would be super.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know what liquidity metrics you are talking about. I think what I've said is that I think what the ECB did was a very, very powerful thing, which is extending the collateral and three-year funding. So powerful, in fact, I think you can probably make the statement it eliminates bank liquidity or funding problems for at least next year. That's a pretty powerful statement. That was the biggest, single risk of an uncontrollable surprise right there. So if that's taken off the table, that's a good thing.</p>
          <p>Now the banks still have to increase capital so, therefore, they're still reducing RWA, i.e., by not rolling things over. You can see them selling aircraft loans, trade finance; they're not participating much in revolvers. There are certain conduits they are not doing anymore. You see them, but that's now just to create capital, not because they have a funding crisis.</p>
          <p>And so look, I think Europe is trying mightily to solve its problems. I still think the likely outcome is they will muddle through, but the longer you wait, the higher you run the risk of something disorderly that you can't really control. So I think the ECB took off the worst outcome, i.e., a bank failure.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd say and it's quite obvious. I just got back from Berlin yesterday, that regulatory policy is completely contradictory to government objectives. They should start talking to each other a little bit.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, a couple questions. One, on the IB, can we just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about bidding for some of assets that might be coming out of Europe? I guess I'm trying to understand where you &#x2013; where you're most interested in adding to your footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so this is &#x2013; first of all, most of the assets we have are just &#x2013; I'm going to call ordinary course of business to maintain our trading books and credit for clients. So are we going to be aggressively bidding for assets from over overseas? No, we've done some. You see that the portfolio is up $10 million. Some of that came out of Europe. But again, going back to contradictory policy, most of us want to get our capital up and therefore, we're not going to do it. That's the outcome of all these rules, you know, that's life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But since last quarter you talked on the conference call about the fact that the capital rules weren't really that clear. They obviously became a little bit clearer between now and then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're clearer bad. I will give you a very specific example. One security we looked that if you look at &#x2013; we believe would have had a 10% cash return and really required some economic capital. Basel III statutory requirement was 1,200% capital, that's an 8% pre-tax return. 5.5% after tax. We're not going to do it, that's all. Not a big deal for us. It's not great for the recovery of the global market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, that's not just one security. That filters through what people are doing everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the flip side, interest in low RWA assets, relatively high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, we're doing RWA, you know in the budgets at a very detailed level and LCR and all of that that. So yeah, we're going to manage &#x2013; we're going to manage at a &#x2013; really micro-manage RWA. So yeah, there are assets we're going to put on that we think are very good RWA returns and we'll probably be much more sensitive to that for now than we would be in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we talk a little bit about head count? Because you're one of the few companies where head count is growing. Revenue environment is still on the tougher side given the rate environment. Can you give us a sense as to how much longer or what your expectations are for head count, and in addition to that, just where your reinvestment spending is and do you have to pull back at all at this stage, yes, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not pulling back. The overhead number, I think we already mentioned that $50 billion is, I believe, going to be pretty consistent so far for next year and the head count needs to put in three things. We're always gaining efficiencies, which you don't see in Tech, Ops, overhead, a whole bunch of stuff, and we've added and we break it out, we've got to do it by business, but branches, so we've added 3,000 salespeople in branches in consumer, some of that is in the new branches. Some of that is in existing branches. We're adding private bankers. We're adding branches overseas. We've opened 20 branches overseas mostly for TS&amp;S, so all those things add people, and the biggest add, which we will not be adding any more, is to handle default. I have got the total number, but we've added 15,000 people in the last two years, maybe more just to handle default mortgage in mortgage. That number has probably peaked and I think you will see it coming down in the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about people dealing with OREO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not OREO. Well, also OREO, but yes, it's 15,000 to 20,000 just to deal with default servicing, OREO, foreclosed assets and all that kind of stuff. So those number will I think it's now running--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's the $925 million in servicing expense in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which two-thirds is default now. That default number is going to come down over the next couple of years and the head count related to that, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So that's tied to transaction volume in housing and how you get down &#x2013; bringing down your OREO in delinquency. My last question just has to do with the outlook for home prices and transactions. I know the question was already asked, but I wanted to ask in conjunction to, you know, the PCI impairment that you took and the reduction in the portfolio there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's keep it simple. We're still assuming another point or two percent drop across the board in home prices. We do it by region and stuff like that. If they dropped another...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if they dropped &#x2013; remember we said last quarter 10%, 8% more and you get $1.5 billion increment incremental impact in PCI reserves.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and so &#x2013; but you've made a change in your PCI reserves this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My guess &#x2013; I go other the other way. We had almost $9 billion in reserves for mortgages. We've got $3 billion of reserves for repurchase. Charge-offs are coming down. It's more likely than not we are going to have excess reserves and this will be reversing. At one point, to me, it will be when the economy gets stronger.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got a couple questions. If we could go back to the LTRO, a couple of questions. First is does this in any way change your willingness to engage in interbank transactions, i.e., compared to where we were a month ago, are you more willing to engage in transactions with European banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I talked about contradictory regulatory policy. When I was in Berlin, they were complaining that no bank banks were lending to other banks. Well, of course not. The banks are penalized for lending to banks. The G-SIFI charge specifically penalizes lending to banks and the FDIC charges 10 basis points on interbank lending. There will be no interbank lending ever again. Now, maybe that's a wise policy in the future. That's perfectly reasonable. It's not reasonable now, but that's what we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second thing linked to this, do you think this will change the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One point. We do finance banks. We do have some credit out to banks and we do some secured funding, so we do deal with banks. It's very different than interbank placing where they get unsecured short-term funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second thing is do you think this will meaningfully change the speed of delevering of assets coming out of Europe as a result of European banks having such a significant amount of three-year funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it reduces the pressure on them, but they have this 9% capital target they have to do by June. So I think &#x2013; and you've got to ask them. I think that's what's pushing them to shed risk-weighted assets to get to that 9%. Most of them are not going to issue equity, nor would I if I were them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we have not seen a huge &#x2013; I mean, some people are expecting this wall of sales, this wave of sales. We have not seen that. We've seen a more orderly &#x2013; particularly in trade finance, aircraft, some CMBS and some RBS, some conduit related business, but it's not a wave, it's just a kind of orderly movement of assets from one &#x2013; some banks to others.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Back in early December, you talked about the possibility of getting Basel III compliant early, i.e., at the end of 2012, which was a change to what you said before.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I said originally &#x2013; I know we flip-flopped this a little. Originally we said there's no reason to get there early and then at your conference, I said maybe by 9% by the end of 2012, but we're going to drive it up. We've just finished CCAR [Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review], the Fed is giving out more guidance that they would like to see people &#x2013; the way I am going to word it is make real progress on getting to the 9% &#x2013; well for us, getting to the 9.5% by 2018. We're going to do that. It may be not be quite 9%, but we do like our stock and we don't mind buying back stock. I think you're going to have people getting there quicker rather than slower.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>People want to get out of the yoke of this thing at one point. We've got to get this behind us. The good news about the CCAR, in my opinion is, it should, I hope, definitively get rid of this capital issue once and for all. If banks can demonstrate that at 13% unemployment, a market down 50%, home prices down 20%, a catastrophe in the U.S. market sales and trading, a catastrophe in European credit and sales and trading and with all that, you're still way above Basel 1.5, it makes two points. We have got plenty of capital and we don't need more. I think that point will be quite openly blatant when people release the results of the CCAR.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good morning. You talked, you know, we've talked a little bit about some of the potential impact or the strong loan growth impact that you've gotten from some of the Euro deleveraging, but I guess I was just looking at the very strong commercial loan growth, wholesale loan growth and trying to get some idea of how much of that was coming excluding any Euro impact. Just from core customers, either using more on working capital lines or investing in capital expenditures, and what's your outlook for that continuing?</p>

So we know and we've added &#x2013; I think it's 2 billion of total loans came out of those areas so we know some of our growth is the new areas that obviously have some market share issues, but I think when other banks report, you are going to see good loan growth numbers in commercial bank in the U.S. Again, look at our numbers, small business, up 52%. Trade finance, up 73%. Investment banking, they're all &#x2013; we're starting to see pretty good growth.</p>

          <p>Other than sort of the recovery of the business cycle in general, do you put any of that into sort of this idea that, you know, you hear &#x2013; you read some of these stories about the reindustrialization of the United States and more manufacturing facilities going in the United States than before and more decisions being made that maybe we shouldn't put that plant in China or Mexico, but we can eliminate the shipping costs back, and we'll put it in the United States.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, I'd like to follow up on the last question. When you look at wholesale loan growth, it was up 37% annualized in the fourth quarter. So it just seems as though there must be some sort of reintermediation by your bank from the capital markets back to the traditional banking? I mean, how can 37% annualized loan growth be sustainable? So my question is...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not. It's not. A big chunk of that, if you take the investment bank loans, which I think that went from $60 billion to $70 billion, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That bounces all over the place. That includes bridge loans and it does include like $5 billion or $6 billion of conduits we put in there. We don't expect to see that kind of loan growth every quarter in that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still 20% annualized loan growth. I'm trying to understand the flight to quality benefit. Are people moving business out of the capital markets back to the banks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>No, they're not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But we had syndicated &#x2013; and we had record syndicated loan fees so there is a lot of that activity going on, but you also saw a lot of activity in the capital markets. So people are, I figure, doing both and we did see some real fundamental growth in the investment bank in terms of the year-over-year stuff, but quarter-over-quarter, I wouldn't draw a conclusion from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wholesale line, you're looking at consolidated wholesale, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And CB, and I think actually AM is also included in that number. I mean, we did see growth across every single one of those businesses quarter-on-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Still, the more general question, the impact from capital markets to traditional banking, look at noninterest bearing deposits, they were up $40 billion in three months. That's a 50% annualized growth rate. It seems like something's happening in terms of people moving at least their money to you if not wholesale loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Wholesale loans, no, other than we've mentioned 5, and maybe it was a little bit more, billion relating to European loans that we bought or conduits. I don't expect that to continue. It might. That's not a flight to quality. That's just other people are trying to get rid of their assets.</p>
          <p>There's no question in the liability side particularly in large corporates or TSS, you're right, it was up 100...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$100 billion year-over-year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More than 100 year-over-year. My guess is a lot of that was flight to quality. It's very hard for us to distinguish because some of it is just big money sitting there. Companies are flush with cash and their cash balances are growing. Some of them are new accounts. We estimate a chunk of that might be that. We don't make a lot of money on that. So the part or whatever you call the flight to quality or something like that, we're making very little on it. We almost do that more to accommodate the client.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last unrelated question. It seems like RFS keeps having negative operating leverage. I know you're investing a lot, and I'm sure we'll hear about this at investor day. It seems like an awful big branch build strategy that's not paying off yet and it's during a period of &#x2013; when deposits aren't worth as much in low rate environment. Does that really make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got three completely different things. Obviously our operating leverage has gotten worse because of regulation, Durbin, etcetera; that's a fact. That's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, we opened branches and I'd say we're modifying that because a lot of these change does affect branch profitability, but to the extent that we can open a branch and get a very good return, we're going to continue to do it. Remember, a lot of this is California, Florida, where there's a huge benefit to clustering, i.e., increasing market share inside local markets. So we are going to modify the size of the branch, location, products and services and &#x2013; but we're going to continue to open branch loans. Every time you open a branch, you get a very good return, and the third one was...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the low rate environment and the deposits aren't worth as much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very important thing. We have decided and you may decide differently and think we're wrong, but we have decided that the value of the deposits is more and we're not going to treat it like they're very low for the sake of our business. That value of the deposit will come back and we will regret having not continued to grow our business as normal. And the profits will go up because eventually margins will go back to more normal types of things over time. That's a decision we made open to comment or criticism, but as of now, unless someone can prove otherwise, that's what we're going to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. When you look at 2011 and obviously first half trading results significantly stronger than the second half. I guess typically we have seen a seasonal uptick, particularly in the first quarter of the year, over the last several years. I realize we're very early into the quarter. I guess given all the macro factors out there, is there anything that leads you to believe that seasonality won't reoccur, or how are you thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, honestly, your guess is as good as ours. Look, we've had a pretty good start so far, but it's only so many trading days and you know, look, we could be surprised on the upside, downside, who knows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the release, you point to fourth quarter ROE that was modestly disappointing. When you think about that, is that, do you think, driven by the macro factors, or there's specific areas that you think underperformed given the macro environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was 11% return on tangible common equity, and we would like to be closer to 15%, so that's all we meant. A big part of difference is there's still a huge drag from mortgage. I mean, you're talking about several billion dollars a year just in mortgage alone. That drag is going down but it's still a negative and eventually that will disappear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Lastly on the third quarter call, you talked a lot about this capital confusion and I guess earlier this week, you talked about you wanted to buy back equal to or more stock in 2012 versus the $9 billion you did in 2011, and then raise the dividend. I guess, you know, first &#x2013; two parts. One, do you feel like you have more clarity on that front? Secondly, it seems like your comments were more leaning towards buybacks than dividends than maybe they've been previously, so maybe comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dividends is a small decision from capital standpoint. Whether you raise it a little bit here or there is not material. We started the dividend again, and we would like to increase it a little bit every year.</p>
          <p>That's a board decision and the stock is very cheap and particularly below tangible book value and I would like to buy a lot back, which of course, we can't do. By the time we're allowed to buy a lot of stock back, I'm sure it's going to be a much higher price and then we may change our decision about that. You can get a little frustration in my &#x2013; about how we've had to do our capital buyback.</p>
          <p>We're getting more clarity from the Fed. The Fed has asked for these stress tests. All the banks have put in their CCAR, and we are going to tell you what that is when we get it back. I'm not going to change the statement I made at the Goldman conference which was, we hope to be able to do a little more than we did in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Got it, okay. I wanted to ask a little bit about liquidity coverage and you know, the ratios. The Fed has indicated that the U.S. banks are going to have to undergo a liquidity stress test on a regular basis. You've mentioned that your concern...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just so you know, most banks I know have always put themselves through a liquidity stress test. That you should do. This is normal course of thing. It's just they're going to get more involved in how it's designed and stuff like that. We believe that we should be able to handle a lot of stress and liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. It's just that you've mentioned when looking at the Basel liquidity rules that have been proposed that it bothers you that they don't credit some of the advantages that U.S. banks have like the guarantees on agency securities and the access to the Fed window, and I was just wondering if you believe that you have been heard on those things, that the Fed will take those things appropriately into account?</p>

          <p>The LCR, and you guys have all seen this, has a huge amount of detail behind it, and we're in favor of good detail and they got a lot of comments.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the fact that you mentioned you deployed liquidity during the quarter and that was one of the things that helped with the net interest margin. That's not that you're feeling more comfortable with this or what the Fed is saying? It's just...?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got it. From what you know of the Fed liquidity rules if they were, in fact, if they were implementing their stress tests right now, do you think you would be compliant with what they're looking for?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know yet. Guy, I don't think it's going to be material to us any which way. If we have to make some adjustments, we'll make some adjustments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Final question that I have is on the non-credit impaired portfolio and the reserve release there. The mortgage delinquency trends that we can see did continue to improve, but it seems the improvement is at a moderating pace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color on what drove the decision to release and I guess sort of a longer term question would be how to think about &#x2013; sorry, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very simple, okay. You see the numbers. They moderated and maybe there will be a little improvement going forward and what made us change our minds is the accountant said we had to. I would have left reserves up if it was solely up to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So in other words, if we were transitioning already into an expected loss versus, say, sort of a current loss reserve model, you might not have done it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, that's another question. I like having &#x2013; eventually we have a $9 billion reserve we won't need. Until we get through all this uncertainty, I would rather have them up. Basically, the numbers have gotten too good over time to leave up that amount of reserves under current accounting. There is going to be a change in accounting, but that's not &#x2013; we'll worry about that when we get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, if you just do the math and you say 877, you multiply it by 4, so call it 3.6. We still, after that, have $8.7 billion worth of reserves up for that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things in the stress test, not just for us but for a lot of banks is, the portfolios are smaller, we have got a lot more reserves up and a lot of the bad stuff is run through so loss rates won't go up as much &#x2013; I'm talking about in a real stress test and you won't need to add as much to reserves from where you were a couple years ago.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

We did tell you we're going to have portfolio run-off in home lending and that's going to impact NII on an absolute dollar basis by about $500 million, and the mix will change but if trends continue where they are, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Separate topic, mortgage put-back continues to grab some headlines here. Can you just clarify and remind us what portions the FDIC is covering related to WaMu? I think there was some debate whether the private label is covered and the GSE is covered. You can clarify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things. The GSE put-back number, that's the $350 million that we had, those numbers are basically timing differences like $3 billion in reserves. We don't expect a real change in that and some of that, there were pieces of that that were settled relating to WaMu, and I forgot which one, whether it's Fannie or Freddie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That number, Matt, that's a fixed dollar amount, and we're working through that and would expect to be through that in 2012, and so and then on the private label side, there's not confusion on our part. We do not believe we have repurchase liability for the private label claims from WaMu.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jamie, I just wanted to follow up on a comment I thought you made in terms of capital in terms of perhaps not aggressively trying to move toward the 9% Basel III number by the end of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I'm wondering if what you said before focused on maybe not trying to aggressively reset 9% Basel III tier 1 common number by the end of this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I don't want to give you quite a number yet. It may not be 9% but it will be 8.5% or something like that. We are going to make a lot of progress toward getting to the 9.5%, and my guess is we'll be at the 9%. We could get to the 9.5% right away. It wouldn't be that hard to do if we just wanted to do it and I don't think it would be good policy to help with an economic recovery but my guess is we'll be at 9.5% by the end of 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. Just following up on your comment on the no material change in your European exposures, I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on some of the commentary that the regulators have made about potentially seeking greater clarity across the U.S. banks in terms of their disclosure and whether or not that might change some of the disclosure that comes out of the regulators as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we already disclose a lot of what they &#x2013; what the SEC said people are going to disclose, right, and there's very little to add. For us, it's not a lot different than we show. I think other people didn't show that kind of detail. You will get more detail.</p>

          <p>That would be helpful, and then just one final question on the investment bank. It looked like Asian revenues were down about 47% quarter-over-quarter, even though loans were up about 14%. Dough, was there anything going on there? Was there anything particularly especially this quarter or last quarter that drove that decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there really wasn't. The capital markets are a big part. Equity in particular of our Asian business and those were very challenging in the quarter. You know, if you look at ex-DVA which actually had an impact there, it was a little &#x2013; smaller decline and year-over-year revenues internationally for the bank were up a couple billion dollars and a much larger percentage, almost 24% of the total revenue up from about 21%.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Can you give us some color on your branch expansion strategy? I know you outlined it last February. You will probably update it for us on this February but then you changed in the third quarter. Where does it stand now in terms of branches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's exactly what I said in the third quarter. There's a page that you can go get from that presentation I made at Goldman. There is about 175 branches and we're looking at things like size and technology and locations, but we're still going to be opening branches, particularly in California and Florida we need more share. There's nothing mystical about it. We have to adjust it. Some of the regulatory changes made certain branches less profitable, et cetera, that's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a possibility &#x2013; since your deposit market share doesn't exceed 10% of the total U.S. deposits, which would prevent somebody from buying another bank, but the too big to fail doctrine seems to be weighing on your bank and a few others. Do you think you could, if M&amp;A comes back, could you guys buy depositories in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have to get rid of the too big to fail thing. I think companies have to be allowed to fail and therefore, we need to help show people the resolution is real. And so you are going to see us be making a little bit of an effort on that by how can you dismantle a big bank in a way that doesn't damage the taxpayer or the economy in any material way, and we're still under the 10% cap.</p>
          <p>I think there would probably be a political fire storm if we tried to buy someone in the United States. If we thought it was really, really good for shareholders, we would want to do it and we would be willing to have a little mud on our face, but we need regulatory approval. So if we can't get regulatory approval, then we're not going to try.</p>
          <p>Counter to all this chatter about too big to fail, the United States is the least consolidated banking market in the world and there's still too many banks and unfortunately, some &#x2013; all of these regulatory things are tougher on smaller banks than bigger banks. So you are going to see a lot of them wanting to sell or merge.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Finally, on your outlook for Durbin, the $600 million, the impact, is that the incremental impact from the fourth quarter or is that the total impact that's already reflected in the run rate in the fourth quarter?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. I want to circle back on Guy's question earlier on asset quality. I just want to understand how we should think about kind of remaining credit leverage, you know, as things seem to be turning, credit card has been a big driver in terms of the reserve release nearer term, but that seems like it's going to start moving higher in terms of losses. How do we think about the degree of reserve release that might be able to come out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in credit card we're near the end of reserve release if that's what you're referring to.</p>
          <p>Credit is very good and hopefully it will stay good. It may get a little better, but I think we're near the end. In terms of mortgage, I think we already mentioned of the $9 billion, one day you won't need all that, but we need more &#x2013; far more improvement in charge-offs, delinquencies and all that, before that reserve will come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jamie, I'd add on the repurchase reserve front, I have got $3.6 billion there, that's another number that over time should come down materially.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thank you. Then on commercial wholesale, should we expect incremental build for the growth that you're seeing, or how should I think about that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're close to steady state now in most of those areas &#x2013; strong reserves but steady state. If we grow, you are going to have a little build. All things being equal, which they're not, but yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a ticky-tack question, in the investment banking detail, you had mentioned that part of the credit portfolio results of the loss of <mark type="ph" /> 31 (1:03:59) this quarter related to DVA losses, but they were offset by NII and some fees but also CVA. How much was the CVA this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net CVA was very small. So in a steady state, that line called credit portfolio would be a couple hundred million dollar positive. Of course, if you look at it, it bounces all over the place because of CVA and DVA effects.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning. Maybe a follow-up on the market share story out of Europe as the banks &#x2013; you've mentioned quite a bit about lending and trade finance. Have you seen anything yet as we hear about some of the European banks pulling out of, whether it's trading or investment banking? Have you seen any impact or benefit there in market share or what do you expect in 2012, any pickups?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I have seen &#x2013; not really, okay? There are more announcements than actions and today, I guess, it was RBS who said M&amp;A and equity is going to stay in fixed income. So we haven't really seen it. If I would ask the traders, they may have seen a little bit. But eventually, there will be some people exiting some of those things and you know those who remain will probably pick up a little share because of it.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks. Jamie, you talked about the regulatory response being different once you get to 9.5%. Could you talk a little bit about how would you see that relationship, you know, kind of once you got to the level that you thought that you should be at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess my point is I think a lot of people want to get past all this and go back to &#x2013; look, we should always have stress tests and liquidity and stuff like that but when the rules are known, we shouldn't be guessing about what we want to retain in capital and how fast you want to get there and what the requirements are and what the phase-in is, so all that uncertainty should be eliminated.

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the mortgage front, given we've had yet another one of these ideas that the settlement with the AGs is imminent, could you talk a little bit about how you see things kind of developing then and could that be a trigger for some of that reserve release that you're talking about or what would it take, do you think, other than this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unrelated, okay. It is still imminent. It would be nice to get it done but there are still open issues and we've been working mightily to try to get it done, because I think it would be better. I think it would be good for the mortgage markets to move on. I think that anything that can get resolved is better for the mortgage markets, but it has nothing to do with reserves and &#x2013; though it will affect numbers. We will have to account for whatever the agreement is and we've already done some of that, so there will be some adjustment because of it, but it won't really affect reserves that much.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Given your relative optimism on housing, are there things that could be done to help the down payment piece? That seems to be the last piece that's really hard to kind of bring to the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, if it were up to me, I think that someone in authority should convene all the people involved in the mortgage businesses and &#x2013; because this could be fixed. It's three years after the crisis. There is virtually no RMBS. We don't know the skin in the rule games. Foreclosures are being held up everywhere which is damaging the economy. You can blame the banks, but it's damaging the economy. These things can be fixed. You have much more &#x2013; mortgage markets and underwriting is still tight. I think underwriting will probably loosen over time. It's tight for a whole bunch of different reasons and obviously GSE policy is critical as is HARP 2 and all these things, but there is no one really in charge of all this; it's just kind of sitting there.</p>

          <p>Hi. In looking at what's going on in Europe, it's really hard to understand how these European banks will ever meet the Basel III requirements in the short run. So I'm wondering if there's a real possibility that this is going to be pushed out in the United States also a year or two years and whether definitions are going to be changed to make it a lot easier to deal with these rules? In other words, I simply cannot conceive of how this thing can go into effect in Europe and I'm wondering how it can go into effect in the United States if it doesn't go into effect in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add to your confusion here a second. We're running Basel 1, Basel II, Basel 2.5, and Basel III. Remember, the European banks are already on, in effect, Basel 2.5. They just to go from 2.5 to 3 where the American banks have to go from 1 to 3, so when they've got to get to 9%, it's not tier 1 common, it's tier 1 core, which is slightly different. By June of 2012, that's an accelerated getting it ready. They've already got most of Basel III in that. Maybe I'm a little wrong on that. I think most of Basel III is already incorporated in Basel 2.5.</p>
          <p>It's put a lot of pressure on these banks in Europe who &#x2013; look, they in the past have over-leveraged, they have too much unsecured funding, but they've operated under that scheme for a long time, sanctioned by the states and you know this is why I say it's completely pro-cyclical what is being caused in Europe right now and so will it change? I don't know. Will that change what American regulators want to do? I don't think so.</p>

          <p>The risk weighted asset definitions seem to be a lot different in Europe than they are. Companies like Credit Suisse have a 20% risk weighted asset to total asset ratio. In addition to which, in looking at liquidity is Nestl&#xE9; really a worse credit than Greece? Doesn't all that stuff have to be resolved before they go forward with any implementation of Basel III?</p>

          <p>Yeah, but I've got to leave that to them. We've got to run our business here. I do think it causes a lot of confusion. If you speak to banks in Europe, they are &#x2013; they may think a lot will get done now. They know it's pro-cyclical and they think some of the stuff is silly, but I'd let them tell you what they need to do about it.</p>

          <p>I can just mention about Europe, by the way, like I said, I was in Berlin yesterday, and it's quite clear when you speak to like the ECB and they did the three-year funding, they're why banks aren't making loans and buying sovereign debt. It's a huge arbitrage. You can earn 4%, 5%, 6% and finance it at 1%. If you ask the banks, they're saying I can't buy sovereign debt because I'm already being criticized heavily by other regulators, you know, about my sovereign debt and my exposure and I've got to get all those numbers down. So over there, it's quite clear that regulatory policy, government policy, central bank policy, it's not coordinated. It's making the situation worse not better.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A little bit about regulatory inconsistency. Jamie, would you just speak to the Fed's sort of white paper on the mortgage market that came out a couple weeks ago and then Governor Rankin came out and blasted the mortgage servicers and said that principal write-downs remain on the table, et cetera, et cetera; what's going on with the Fed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look. I don't know; everyone wants to get the mortgage market healthier, and I think the Fed in that white paper also showed that costs are higher than they should be. The mortgage costs, if you reduce the mortgage costs, the spreads over 10 years and stuff like that could be &#x2013; I forgot the number, 30 or 40 basis points cheaper. I agree with them.</p>
          <p>That's not going to happen if you can't foreclose on homes. It's not going to happen if you don't have RMBS. So it's more of a &#x2013; you need a holistic approach to get it all done. I think the Fed is right that there should be a holistic approach. We put in the press release that we've offered 1.2 million mortgage modifications, okay, and that we've actually completed 400,000, and that we're making 765,000 mortgages a year. With all due respect, we're making mortgages all day long. We're selling them to the GSEs. We want to be in the business.</p>
          <p>On the servicing side, mistakes were made. They're being fixed. We're paying for them and we should. We should pay for the mistakes we made, but let's keep the mortgage market active. I mean, you did you see Ally said they're not going to do mortgages in Massachusetts anymore because of certain litigation there and stuff like that. That's not a good thing.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I also don't agree that somehow principal forgiveness would be the end all to be all, okay. There are 75 million homes; 25 million don't have mortgages. Of the 45 million or so with mortgages, 4 million of those mortgages are having problems and we're working through those. Those who can't afford to stay in their home, the loans in effect would be written off and forgiven, okay. And millions of mods are being offered. All the banks do it as aggressively as they can and all the banks have geared up trying to handle just the raw amount of defaults and stuff like that. We support HARP 1; we support HARP 2; we supported HAMP and we're doing our own mortgage modification on top of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Chris Wheeler wfrom Mediobanca here. A question on risk weighted assets under Basel III if I might. I think if I remember rightly, you were talking about uplift of about $180 billion from Basel 1 to Basel III. Of that $180 billion, I wonder if you can give me some flavor as to &#x2013; that's from mitigation, sorry. How much of that mitigation has already been achieved because obviously we can't see that given you are still reporting on Basel 1?</p>
          <p>Perhaps a flavor for what the nominal asset value is behind that? And then also perhaps what timetable you've set yourselves in terms of running that off as you move towards obviously getting there sooner rather than later. And then finally perhaps, how much of that is going to be active and how much of that is going to be passive mitigation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the numbers today are about $300 billion in uplift and what we've said is we're going to bring that number down it's really going to be two things. One is we just have natural portfolio run-off across the businesses and that's going to reduce RWA.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second is there is just model implementation and that's again, just literally inputting the data that's required in order to have a somewhat different treatment than the standard.

It is loans or high RWA assets that we're not going to regenerate again that are going to run off the books. There's nothing we need to do. That includes high RWA loans. It includes all these mortgage loans that are running off.</p>
          <p>Then there are models which we're just building which are normal modeling and stuff like that we're allowed to put into Basel III which will do another whole chunk of reduction of RWA. Do you have the chart right there?</p>

          <p>I don't know the exact. We can get back to you on the exact nominal dollar amount, but a lot of it is in the mortgage portfolio so it's pretty close to that number.</p>
