          <p>Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q1 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our host speaker, Mr. Peter Voser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much, operator and welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell first quarter '09 results presentation. So good afternoon, everybody. I will update you on the results and then take your questions. So first, let's move to the disclaimer and the cautionary statement. Just take a moment to read it.</p>
          <p>Now firstly, on the macro environment, macro conditions deteriorated further in the first quarter of '09 following a downturn across Q4 and all the track has continued to be under pressure so far in the second quarter. This is a very difficult environment for the oil industry, and we need to be clear about that.</p>
          <p>Oil prices fell from $97 a year ago, to $44 per barrel in Q1 2009. This is a decline of $53 and it is very significant change. Natural gas and LNG prices also fell with the usual two to three month LNG time lags to oil prices. So we saw weaker demand for natural gas, oil products and petrochemicals as the global economy deteriorated.</p>
          <p>The pricing environment deteriorated steadily across the quarter. Refining margins for example were supported early in the quarter by industry downtime and winter demand, but declined significantly in all the regions later in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I am pleased with Shell's operating performance in this very difficult industry landscape but operating conditions overall remain tough so far in the second quarter, when the industry typically loses the demand support from northern hemisphere winter. Alongside a tough downstream environment, I would highlight that industrial gas demand is under particular pressure and it impacts Shell as a major gas producer.</p>
          <p>So that's the picture. Strategy has not changed. We have 1 million barrels per day of upstream under construction and 300,000 barrels per day of downstream capacity under construction. This will deliver growth early in the next decade to 2012 and the strategy is on track. Now let me turn to Q1 '09 performance in more detail.</p>
          <p>So excluding identified items, CCS earnings were 3 billion and earnings per share decreased by 62% compared to Q1 '08. The quarter was characterized by lower earnings in upstream, mainly as a result of the sharp decline in energy prices. Downstream earnings were also lower than a year ago levels, but remained resilient despite weaker industry conditions due to Shell's strong portfolio and operating performance.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow was some 7.6 billion, less than half of Q1 '08 levels. We have announced a Q1 '09 dividend increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, versus Q1 '08, which is the level we preannounced last quarter. So let me talk a little bit about the business performance in more detail.</p>
          <p>Firstly on upstream, upstream earnings decreased by 71% to 1.8 billion in Q1 '09. The falling oil and gas prices was the main factor behind the decline in earnings. We are making progress in reducing supplier costs. However, upstream maintenance costs increased versus a year ago level and New Year depreciation also increased with the impact of new fees and amortization from '08 <mark type="inaudible" /> acquisition costs. Exploration costs were also higher predominantly due to the impact of new acreage purchases last year, which are amortized over a number of years.</p>
          <p>Turning to upstream volumes, Nigeria production fell some 90,000 barrels per day, versus the same quarter last year due to security issues there. The main item was downtime at the Soku gas processing plant which came offline at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>This is supposed to make repairs to the pipelines that have been damaged by significant illegal bunkering of condensate. To leave these illegal taps in the pipelines would be a significant safety and environmental hazard, and we have taken action there.</p>
          <p>So Soku was offline for all of the first quarter with an impact of more than 60,000 BOE's per day, versus Q1 '08. And there were additional security challenges in the quarter. However, underlying production was at similar levels to Q1 '08, excluding items like Nigeria security, divestments, PSC effects and about 60,000 barrels per day of OPEC quota impact.</p>
          <p>I think this is a reasonable performance in the context of the generally weak demand environment. The driver behind these underlying performance was new production. First quarter oil and gas production was boosted by some 200,000 barrels per day versus a year ago levels from new field start-ups, mainly in Australia and Malaysia and ramp up of other fields around the world. So this is all part of our strategy to rejuvenate the upstream portfolio.</p>
          <p>LNG sales volumes decreased by 13% and volumes were supported by new production at the North West Shelf Train 5 and from Sakhalin late in the quarter. However, feed gas supplies for Nigeria LNG were impacted by downtime at Soku, as just explained, reducing LNG volumes by about 150,000 tons per month. Excluding this impact, LNG volumes were broadly similar to a year ago levels with an upwards trend in capacity as new trains in Australia and Russia ramp up. Again, the underlying performance is strong.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to downstream. Downstream earnings declined by 16%, to 1.2 billion, versus year ago levels. This decline was due to lower refining earnings partially offset by an increase in marketing including trading. Refining margins were higher in the Far East and the U.S. West Coast but lower in Shell's main refining centers in Europe at the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>Shell's refinery intake fell by 7% as a result of soft demand, and refining was at the breakeven levels compared to a profit of some 100 million a year ago. Marketing earnings increased versus a year ago levels with support from trading and business-to-business activities, offsetting weaker results in other areas.</p>
          <p>We managed to keep marketing margins relatively stable, versus year ago levels, although volumes were lower. Chemicals had a weak quarter, with lower demand and pressure on margins. Both refining and chemicals availability in Q2 '09 are expected to be around 93%. So those are the results.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to cash flow and balance sheet. Looking at the cash position over the last 12 months, upstream and downstream segments have both generated cash flows in excess of capital spending levels. At the group level, the cash inflow is well-balanced against outflow for organic capital spending and payouts to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We have been in an up cycle in the last few years and in that environment cash flow from operations has been large enough to cover organic capital spending and dividends, and we have used the balance sheet for acquisitions such as Duvernay and the Shell Canada minorities.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have kept a competitive balance sheet structure, and gearing is now sitting at around 7%, which is low in our industry. So now we are in a down cycle, and as we have said previously, we are using the balance sheet to finance the capital spending program in the down cycle, so that level as previously said will increase in '09.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to pensions. The sharp decline in world markets at the end of '08 has left pension deficits for many companies and Shell is not immune from that. Accounting for this can create known cash movements in the P&amp;L, in addition to the normal cost of pensions, for example, a return on plan assets that's higher than expected, can result in profit and loss gains on a lower return, as was the case in '08, can result in P&amp;L charges.</p>
          <p>So the total estimated post tax charge for our deficit in defined benefit pensions in '09 will be $1.3 billion. This includes the 0.2 billion inflation adjustment in the U.S., identified separately in the first quarter results. So the balance of about $1.1 billion post tax is spread evenly across the quarters and impacted the first quarter results. These charges are allocated to each of the business segments.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow impact, we normally do make cash contributions to pension funds and in 2008, the figure was $1.6 billion. For '09, we expect to make total cash contributions of around $5 billion. This increased level of contribution is driven by regulatory and other legal requirements.</p>
          <p>We expect the cash contribution of about 3.5 billion from the &#x2013; in the second quarter to cash flow. Balance sheet gearing was around 7% at the end of the first quarter, and guidance for gearing long-term average, 20 to 30% is unchanged. So let me summarize the results and then I will take your questions.</p>
          <p>So we had a tough industry landscape in the first quarter. Energy prices and demand remain under pressure and Nigeria security is clearly a challenge. Having said that, we have delivered in the first quarter on the pace by operating performance. At Shell, we are taking a prudent approach to the economic downturn and we maintained our investment in new upstream and downstream capacity and our cost discipline and focus.</p>
          <p>We have one million barrels per day of upstream under construction and 300,000 barrels per day of downstream capacity under construction. This will deliver growth early in the next decade to 2012, and we have a further set of opportunities that can support growth to 2020. We have the financial flexibility to manage the down cycle and I think Shell is well positioned for an economic recovery.</p>
          <p>Now, this is my last presentation to you as the CFO. And I step down from this role tomorrow, ahead of becoming Chief Executive in July. Simon Henry, who some of you may know, will be taking over as CFO from me. Simon has been working as the CFO in Exploration and Production area for the last few years, and Simon will take you through the results for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, that's the future. Let's go back to today and let me take your questions. Please limit yourself to one or two questions each so everyone has the opportunity to ask a question. So with that, over to the operator.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Your first question comes from Michele della Vigna, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. It's Michel here. I just had one question. You refer to the good level of trading profit in the quarter, I was wondering if you could actually quantify versus Q4 or versus what you consider to be a normal quarter in terms of trading profitability and where we stood in Q1. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the question. On trading, as you all know, we do our trading actually and structured alongside or around our physical assets which we have, either on the upstream side, but predominantly around refineries and our supply and distribution envelopes and maximizing our storage capacity which we have across the world. So quite significantly, these volumes end up in some shape or form in our refinery stream or in our marketing stream. So from that point of view, I think it's embedded in all the results of our oil products, chemicals and the other side also the GP business.</p>
          <p>Now, Q1 has clearly a contango market, which we have actually taken advantage of. And we have used some working capital actually to drive trading during the Q1, and to a certain extent also into Q2. Given the fact that this is all embedded in our normal earnings, I'm not going to strip it out. I go as far as Q1 was certainly higher than Q4, but it will endorse a higher action than Q1 last year. So we had a certain benefit of it, but I consider it as part of our value chain, where we make money with our physical assets across the trading and the marketing angle of our business. So I will not split out the absolute amounts, because we have never done that, and we are not going to do it.</p>
          <p>We had in the previous quarters &#x2013; we talked about some EITF adjustments or trading market-to-market adjustments. I can report to you that these were not significant in the first quarter this year, and also not significant in the last year's quarter. Last year, it was a slight help. This time it was a slight minus effect in it. But all in all, we were happy with the B2B results and trading during Q1.</p>
          <p>Thanks for the question, the next one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Theepan Jothilingam. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter. Two questions actually. Firstly, I think you talked about a fall in industrial gas demand. I was just wondering whether you could sort of quantify what Shell is seeing or saw in Q1, and envisages to see through the course of the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I wanted to get an idea in terms of depreciation. I understand depreciation is going up at Shell, but I wanted to get a feel for how depreciation moved up in Q1, relative to Q4 and particularly in the upstream? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the questions. I take a little bit more time too on the gas side, so bear with me on this one. The Shell Oil gas production is about 50:50 in Q1 '09, which is no doubt of line with peers.</p>
          <p>On the gas prices, they do vary by regions, but we are most exposed in places where gas prices are linked to oil and oil products, for example in Asia-Pacific, LNG, Continental Europe. So we're less exposed to spot gas than our peers. Let me just remind you that the LNG is mostly sold on long-term take or pay. So we typically have 90% kind of long-term contract, but they can vary in that, by let's say, less than 10%. So you have a minimum and the maximum offtake.</p>
          <p>So what we have seen so far is that the lower offtake for LNG has started in Q1 and we expect that to continue actually throughout 2009, which could reduce headline volumes in Shell and also in the market. Also the underlying LNG capacity trend is up, because we have, for example, in Shell the ramp ups of North West Shelf T-5 and Sakhalin. So LNG customers take less cash. And there is a knock on effect on upstream gas production, especially in Asia Pacific, and this will reduce headline volumes.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe, where we have large gas positions in the North Sea and the Netherlands. We're seeing the impact of lower industrial gas demand. We expect this again to continue in '09. Q1 European gas volumes were fairly robust, with colder than normal temperatures drove heating demand. This was especially in January and December, while uncertainty in Russian supply also strained the supply and demand balance. So however, end users demand in certain markets was severely affected by the recession, Spain and Italy, for example. We expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>I think in the North America, the gas we sold on spot were very weak contract and, again, we are seeing the impact of weaker demands which is really a price effect rather than a volume effect. Overall, the year-on-year impact of weaker industrial gas demand could be around 50,000 BOEs per day, although this is hard to predict, at this stage.</p>
          <p>I think the second question was on the upstream units DD&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's what we see it, it's trading up, you have seen '07 it's 10.7, and in '08, it's $11. This is mainly because of our new capital heavy assets which we have. I can also give you the U.S., because that may come up later in the question as well. There we have quite clearly an impact by our lease amortization. There the trend is as follows. It was in Q1, it was $0.65 per BOE and it is 1.06 per BOE in Q1 '09. I think that's it. Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Pete <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just one question and it's on the downstream the product sales volumes, which you're showing is down about 9%. So just comment on that one, because down not only year -- strong on year-on-year, but also against the first -- the fourth quarter. Could you give a flavor as to whether that's representative of that level of underlying pullback in the market or whether there were some Shell specific issues there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think if you go to the numbers, you would get a 12% decrease, but this is trading on marketing volumes. If you go straight to the marketing face volumes, you will get 6% lower, and if you actually clean up for divestments, and this is mainly related to our French business, which we did -- divested last year, you will get a decrease of 3% in our marketing sales volumes.</p>
          <p>So that's the way we look at it when we just kind of global situation. Now, the main declines and I would say that's continuing to show up, were in the U.S. and in Europe. And volumes were actually down in all the businesses across the marketing businesses, and I think this, again, it will continue into let's say the near future, certainly, that we have got demand pressure still. Thank you. Next question.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Peter. I had a question on CapEx. I was wondering if you were maintaining the guidance for 32 billion. The Q1 run rate appears to be a bit below that. Would you expect to spend less in the end because perhaps costs will turn out to be lower or because some of the partners may have funding constraints Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Irene. No, we do not change our guidance at this stage. We stay at 31, 32, yes, indeed the run rate was a little bit lower, but that's always the Q1 is lower. We see obviously that we are getting -- we're having success on the cost side, I'm sure we'll come back to that theme a little bit later. But I think we actually built in some FX and some deflation rates. And we will, for the time being go ahead with our activities for '09. I think we will then have to charge out 2010, looks our costs have changed and how many activities which we want to do. But for the time being, we maintain the 31, $32 billion of net spending. And as you know, we have not assumed any divestment. So this is -- then also the CapEx spending at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Quick question on gearing actually. I mean I see gearing has fallen to 6.6 from 7.5% at the end of the year, but I've also noticed that this quarter you have admitted, your note which calculates gearing, including your off balance sheet commitments like leases and underfunded retirement benefits.</p>
          <p>And you have said in the past that this definition, which includes these obligations is much closer to values by the rating agencies. Can you maybe tell us why you have taken it out this quarter, and maybe help us with some of the numbers we need to do that calculation or even better, tell us how you see -- how gearing is on this basis, relative to the 23% at year end? And then if you can indulge me, maybe tell me, what do you think will be the gearing level on this basis that the rating agencies will start considering your current rating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think -- thanks, Mark. It's obvious the second question, that is a rating agency question, so I can't answer that one. Let me be clear on the gearing numbers. We actually introduced all of this back in the March presentation, in the strategy presentation, where I gave you both numbers. And we have clearly reported since then on the gearing ratio, like our competitors do. So let me just take you through some numbers here.</p>
          <p>We had as you said 6.6 at the end of March, actually the way we calculate, the one at the end of 2008 it was 5.9%, so we had a slight increase. If you include all the off balance sheet stuff, we had 23.1, as reported at the end of 2008, and that's 23.7 now. It's more or less the same increase. Now, we have clearly adopted here to the way the equity investors look at the gearing like our major peers do, present their numbers, but I'm not holding back to give you the other numbers. There is one thing which you need to take into account.</p>
          <p>There are for example, the under-funded retirement benefit obligations or the pension deficits which amounted to 8.3 billion at the end of the year, we only update that once a year. So whenever we calculate these things we use the end December '08 number and that's why we are not publishing it every quarter again, because obviously that number would change as well. But rough estimates are here and that will be the 23.7%.</p>
          <p>Now, I have said we will be in the low 20s on the normal, the gearing as we have published it now for this year if macro conditions as we had them in Q4 in 2008 will actually go through 2009 and you can more or less expect then the, including off balance sheet side to be in the very low 30s. So you have more or less a difference of some 7, 8%, between the two ratios by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>I hope this answers the question.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Just a quick question on gas demand. I am not sure it's possible to answer it but I was curious as to whether you felt that some of the destruction of demand in both the fourth and first quarter was caused by buyers going to the bottom end of their take or pay volumes in order or assuming that gas prices would be significantly lower in the second and the third quarter in Europe because of oil price linkage?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions can you just elaborate rather further on the comments you made on the business-to-business performance because if you look at your chemicals business, the comments you made on natural gas and industrial demand and the refining businesses it would suggest that, you are being impacted by a global recession, a manufacturing recession and it seems to me, it's a business-to-business one, which you make high margins would be impacted by that.</p>
          <p>So I'm a bit puzzled how 1Q business-to-business could be so strong if you could explain to me that. Second is just on the U.S. upstream, take your points about depreciation charges et cetera, and obviously it's moved into loss. Can you just elaborate further on whether that's a structural issue now or whether there is sort of remedial action you can do to bring down the breakeven in your U.S. operations in the upstream?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jon. Let's start on the B2B, indeed, in chemicals we saw a demand slowdown of 20-21%, and you have heard reduction in volumes on the marketing side were less affected and actually in B2B even less affected.</p>
          <p>So let me remind you, what's in the B2B, that's on a dollar marine business -- our fuels business, commercial fuels business, our LPG business, our aviation business, our bitumen business.</p>
          <p>So we maintained very well our margins there. So we didn't go actually for the big volume market share increase there. That helps us, obviously, financially from a marking point of view, more and more what we are seeing in those businesses is actually the differentiation strategy, which we have where we use the products and bring in our technologies, for example, on the bitumen side, but also on the marine side and the brands has helped us quite significantly in the first quarter but also in 2008. You remember the marketing business started to be rather strong already in 2008, and this is quite clearly a continuation of it, so the volume effect was not as big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But if you look at the data on the airlines and marine transport, et cetera, I'm just puzzled that you can maintain strong margins in such a weak industrial &#x2013; in such weak industrial conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can see that. Let's take aviation. I think I reported out last year, actually that in various quarters we had actually shrinkage on the volume side in aviation, because we saw this coming and we have actually kind of like purified our volume quite a bit already in order to actually take advantage where we can and we entered into contracts which do actually meet our expectations.</p>
          <p>So we were not chasing that and we have now taken quite clearly some benefits. Now, I think to be fair, there is also certain amount early in the quarter, which I would call is a parachute effect, which still actually affected the first quarter, which helped a little bit early on, in the quarter, but otherwise, it's across all the businesses. It's just better performance than we had a year ago in that sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the U.S. EP, I think I would describe it in such a way that the U.S. EP business is fundamentally in growth mode and you should not compare the earnings there with other competitors who are more mature and harvesting game in the U.S. So you know that we have built up the exploration position significantly in the last few years in the U.S., <mark type="inaudible" /> of Mexico, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And that quite clearly has built -- has resulted in a build-up of non-cash charges, but this acreage now is being amortized. Typically these are 10 to 15 year leases and we amortize it in such a way. So what this does is &#x2013; it obviously like for the total group it impacts your earnings and hence your <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So we have got kind of -- I look at this like my higher proportion of capital under construction, or capital for future projects in the U.S. Now if I look at the earnings, we went from 1.5 billion last year to, let's say more or less break even. Out of that, 1.2 billion is pure price effect, because we are in a high, high price environment where you get the up side.</p>
          <p>If I look at the cash, we made $1 billion of cash, in the EP U.S. and that's how I look at the business, which is in growth mode. Can they actually generate cash and can they therefore pay their CapEx, et cetera? And then quite from that point of view, that works very well. Now, like in all areas in Shell, there we are scrutinizing them on the OpEx side, and we are working on our suppliers and we have programs, top quartile programs obviously in -- on the work and we are clearly going after our costs.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we do short-term, medium-term measures there but fundamentally we are not going to change the strategy going forward. On a cash basis, this is an acceptable outcome, which we have there, and I'm okay with the development.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter, good afternoon. A couple of things, if I could. Could you clarify the time lag implicit in your LNG price contracts? I believe we discussed this previously and my recollect -- my strong recollection is that we talked about six to nine months, yet I think I heard you say two to three months in your prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you update us a bit on the gas supply situation for Train Six in Nigeria? I notice, I believe, some progress with respect to Gabar and Ubi moving ahead? Third and finally, could you comment on whether the Port Arthur upgrading and expansion project has been slowed down? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Mark for the questions. I can't recall the six to eight months or six to nine months. What we typically see in our contracts, I said two to three months there are some where you have maybe four months, but that's a typical kind time lag you have on the LNG side. On the Nigerian, one of the Train Six in Gabbar and Ubi et cetera I think I'm not going to repeat all what I said on Soku, et cetera which is impacting it quite clearly.</p>
          <p>We have said that Train Six will ramp-up over time. This time, it's not just '09 this time it goes into '10. As we are kind of building and constructing new projects and you mentioned the right one there, which is Gabar and Ubi which is an important one. It's also one that we have signed some funding agreements with Nigeria, with NMPC in order make sure that this project actually goes through.</p>
          <p>So as expected, Train Six is underutilized and that will actually be with us for quite a while. So I think you need to think about '10 and '11, before these things come on stream. On Port Arthur, I think I have got two comments. One is I think we are roughly on as predicted for the 2012 startup, as we said in March. We have -- I wouldn't say we have slowed it down or whatever, but we are retendering some contracts that indeed is correct. And that's what you have heard in order to actually bring some of the costs down and take advantage of what's happening in the markets. But I will not call it slowdown in that sense, compared to what we said in March.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon gentlemen. My name is Kim Fustier, JPMorgan. First thing when I tried to back out your implied upstream cost per barrel, they appear to be roughly flat year-on-year, maybe slightly up. I know you haven't given quantified guidance on cost cutting targets. But do you expect unit costs to decline later this year. And perhaps could you talk a bit more about the steps you are taking to reduce costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your statement on the volume is correct. It excludes -- then quite clearly we had a good production quarter, is what I explained and I would confirm is slightly up in that sense. I think on the cost side, let me just tell you a little bit more what we are doing. So we are looking at our cost base and we think with all what we have started we should be actually improving our cost position over time with some billion dollars. Now, how do we get there?</p>
          <p>The first one is quite clearly, we are looking at those projects, which we think are not competitive from new projects from a kind of a cost CapEx point of view and we are postponing and delaying them so that we can actually tend to them later on. We have our top quartile program across all the businesses and across all the functions of the program which already works now for two years where we are optimizing our structures and bringing our assets and organizational -- and organizations off the top quartile and hence take cost out.</p>
          <p>The third one is we are working with our suppliers. And this is now based on the experience and facts from the first quarter, where we have actually started to renegotiate or negotiate contracts. And just remember that normally these contracts do run for two to three years. So we are talking mainly about projects, which are contracts which still have the '05 and '06 prices in it. And against that in quite a number of key areas, we have achieved reductions of 15 to 20%. So for example, in well services and if rigs between 10 and 30% against integrated service contracts between 10 and 15%.</p>
          <p>And we will continue to do that. Now, these savings will not come in one quarter. They will come over time. They will be built into our operating expenditures and future CapEx spending. And hence, we are very pleased or I am very pleased with the progress there. So all of this should actually allow us to be absolutely clear to save or optimize our costs going forward and that should allow us to actually save several billions of dollars.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Neil McMahon [Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co.]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had two questions. And the first is on Oil Sands. It's the second consecutive quarter of negative earnings in the Oil Sands division. Any update on the breakeven costs or is there anything special within these numbers, both in the fourth quarter or the first quarter that may mislead you when you are trying to calculate that? It looks like it's in the high 40s, when you look at this data.</p>
          <p>And secondly, looking at the Nigerian LNG situation, which have you gone over already, I appreciate, but is there a risk that during the summer you don't see any material increase on LNG leaving Nigeria, going both to Europe, the U.S. and Mexico? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me start on Oil Sands. I think so far we have given you the '08 numbers and they have been cash cost wise, the whole year was on average 38, of which roughly $6 were energy costs. And the Q4, for example, we have given us a $55 break even costs. Now, what we have in those cash costs is also some development costs for -- for future de-bottlenecking or other project.</p>
          <p>Now we normally update it only once a year, because you have so many issues going back and forwards and we are running cost programs. So I think I prefer to do that later. But we are working like in all the other areas on the costs can be as very general admin costs but it also can be costs during the operations which we're really trying to optimize there.</p>
          <p>I think I would just like to add, we take a very long-term view on these things and to have a short-term volatility on the price, even if it lasts for a few quarters, or years, will not actually change our strategy in that sense.</p>
          <p>So from that point of view, no update, but quite clearly, I would not have seen Q1 to be very different to what I told you in 2008. These are all U.S. dollars and they are using last year's exchange rates. It's quite clearly the exchange rate moved differently earlier in the first quarter, between the Canadian and the U.S. dollar, but I do normally not take that into account. I look at kind of constant exchange rates because FX gains may go and come. Okay? And just repeat to me quickly, your second question because I didn't capture everything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's really just looking at the LNG outlook from Nigeria over the summer months, obviously with destinations going to Europe, U.S. and Mexico. I just -- to get a good sense what incremental volumes relative to the very low volumes so far this year, because of the disruptions are we likely to see over the summer, or is this really it's going to ramp back up properly at the end of Q3 into Q4? I'm just trying to quantify the LNG output from the plants this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. That's a difficult one to answer. This really hands together with the start-up of Soku as well and I would rather defer because of security reasons not to talk too much about when that could happen, et cetera. The situation is just too delicate for that. But we are, I think I go as far as we are working on the start-up and I will report back in the thick or actually Simon, I need to change now. Simon will report back on this in the second when we talk about the second quarter, but for security reasons, I really have to restrict the information. Thanks for the question, and the next, please.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just two quick follow-up financial questions. I mean, your peers are now sort of disclosing cost-cutting targets to give us a feel for how they are benefiting from the changing cost environment. I mean are there any figures outside of the division lending numbers that you can perhaps give us to track how you are doing in terms of your cost performance going forward?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, a quick question on the pension contribution, where would that appear in the cash flow statement, as a separate line or included in other lines, so to speak? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Yes, to your first question, I prefer to deliver -- I have gone as far as we as the current management team wants to go of giving you several billions which we are aiming at. And we will report on a kind of constant basis on how we are achieving this.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to understand that there are clear targets in place and we are aiming at going -- or we are actually going at it in a very fast way. These cost savings will come over time, and we'll see when these contracts actually really start to come in and we will update you on this one. But we are talking about big numbers here.</p>
          <p>So that's on the first question. On the second one, this will be a part of the cash flow from operations and it will be in the line "others", but we will quite clearly help you to understand that and we'll quote the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Just as a quick follow-up. On the P&amp;L, if you look to the selling, distribution and admin expenses line sort of year-on-year, does that give us a reasonable guide as to how you are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, this is -- you have to be careful there, because Q1 holds there quite a bit of FX effects and as I said before, the business will not get relief from these effects, foreign exchange effects and some other effects. So I think it's a little bit early to expect that this all hits in the first quarter. It takes a little bit longer. So I think I will not take that as a kind of a guideline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Lucy Haskins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask what level of deflation and ForEx you'd already included in terms of your CapEx guidance for this year of 31 to 32 billion? And could I also ask whether your sensitivities to margin movements have changed relative to your previous guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't changed our guidance. It is in, but Lucy, I'm not going to tell you what it is exactly because I know where we then go in terms of the discussion so we will have to explain each time how this works. I think we are not known for being too aggressive on these things.</p>
          <p>So let us work the year and it's also various FX rate change -- the FX rate actually which influenced it. So it's the Canadian dollar, it's the U.S. dollar, it's the Euro and it's also some other currency. So I think I will report back on a constant basis on how we are doing. So let us operate it on our own.</p>
          <p>And maybe the other one is on the oil price sensitivity, that may be helpful for you as well. We have a range of roughly 180 to 220 million annually per dollar on the oil price sensitivities. Obviously, this is not a straight line relationship due to tax drops, and different absolute prices. For Q1 '08 to Q1 '09, we were at the upper end of that range. And note that the U.S. barrel have above average sensitivities to the oil price changes, at least that gives you also some feeling on how we look at this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Good afternoon gents. Two questions. First on the exploration, and you explained that the exploration charge is connected with amortization in your fields. What is your sort of target in view of the need to increase exploration efforts for this year or next year, also with respect to lower drilling costs and lower service costs? The second question is the Oil Sands CapEx is still pretty high, I suppose this is Phase II of the current project. How are we going forward with this? Is this almost finished, at least this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Bert for the question. I start with the second one. We have said that the start-up is in '010 for the Oil Sands. So we are not yet there, but it's north of 50% complete, as far as I remember. So there is still one year of CapEx to come. I think you will get some FX movement on that one most probably.</p>
          <p>But otherwise, costs are pretty much kind of -- have been tended or fixed. So I would say that is most probably going through without too much of savings for '09 and then '10. So that's -- longer term as we have said, we are looking carefully at the next phases. After today, we will consider a debottlenecking of the two mines which we will have after this expansion as the most logical next step.</p>
          <p>It's less capital intensive, it's more in kind of quantity and duration and one can do more with that before taking on the next expansion. But a lot will depend on the cooling down of the price, the cost pricing environment within the Alberta region or within the Fort McMurray oil sand region. So we will see that later on.</p>
          <p>On the first one, exploration, we have got a program, which is roughly $3 billion for 2009. This is a slight increase versus the 2008. I think that's the best way I can describe on how we are moving our organic growth strategy forward. We still see exploration. That's the best and cheapest way to find barrels and develop these barrels.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Just a minor point. In the Q4 results, you were confident enough to preannounce the Q1 dividend. And I was just wondering, if there's any reason why you are not preannouncing the Q2 dividend. I think I probably already know the answer but --?</p>
