      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, again. Joining me on the call today with Sherry are Jeff Naylor and Ernie Herrman. So let's begin by saying it is great to report strong results in such a difficult economy. We delivered EPS growth of 27% in the second quarter. I want to point out that this is on top of three consecutive years of very strong performance. Further, our first half EPS has grown at a compound annual rate of 20% over the past four years, which speaks to our ability to drive the same profit growth.</p>
          <p>Our strategies for 2009 are clearly working. Despite the environment, we are seeing comp sales not only remain positive but accelerate, which is very unusual for us during a recession. In addition, our customer traffic counts have reached extraordinary heights. Value is winning in this environment and we believe that it's here to stay. We think that the economic recovery is likely to be slow, that customers will remain under pressure to reduce household debt, and that a value-oriented customer mindsets will prevail for a long time.</p>
          <p>With our value proposition consisting of a combination of fashion, brand, quality, and price, we are in excellent position to retain new customers that we are attracting today for the future. Further, we are employing the flexibility of our business model to take advantage of the opportunities that this environment is presenting. Big picture, we believe that we are extremely well-positioned for today and for the future. I believe we have tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us, which I will talk about later in this call.</p>
          <p>Before that I'll turn the call over to Jeff to recap our second quarter and first half financial results. Then, I will review the highlights of our second quarter performance, our vision for growth and our outlook for the full year. Now, here's Jeff to recap the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everybody. So to recap second quarter results, our net sales were $4.7 billion, up 4% over the last year. Consolidated comp store sales were up 4%. It was well above our plan and it was on top of three years of very, very strong comparisons.</p>
          <p>As we note in the release today, the diluted earnings per share was $0.61, that's up 27% over the $0.48 we earned last year. This growth was achieved despite a net $0.03 per share negative impact from foreign currency translation and from marking our inventory related currency hedges to market. The mark-to-market adjustments was $0.02 unfavorable to what we anticipated when we set our guidance in early July.</p>
          <p>In terms of the quality of earnings growth, pre-tax income was up 23% despite higher interest expense and despite $18 million of foreign exchange impact. The tax rate was essentially flat to last year, so that did not contribute to year-over-year growth. Our share count was down 3%, a very small piece of our overall 27% EPS growth and in line with our strategy to buy back shares. There were no other significant items impacting comparability. So all-in-all we had a very high quality earnings growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of consolidated pre-tax profit margin, that was 8.7%, up 130 basis points over last year. Comparisons to prior we're adversely impacted 10 basis points by the mark-to-market adjustment and another 10 basis points by higher interest expense. The gross profit margin was up by a very strong 130 basis points over LY [last year], driven primarily by merchandise margins. SG&amp;A expense was 10 basis points lower than last year as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>As to inventories at the end of the second quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses were down 4%. At Marmaxx, our total inventory commitment, including the warehouses, stores, and merchandise on order was also down versus last year on a per store basis. We ended the second quarter with very clean inventories and are very happy with our inventory liquidity as we enter the back half.</p>
          <p>Now to briefly recap results for the first half, EPS for the six months were $1.09, so $1.09, up 18% over last year's $0.92 on a reported basis. Last year's EPS benefited $0.02 per share from FIN 48 tax adjustments. Excluding this benefit, EPS was up 21% over the adjusted $0.90 per share.</p>
          <p>As outlined in today's press release, foreign exchange rates adversely impacted EPS for the first half of this year by $0.07, compared to a $0.01 adverse impact in the first half of last year, so EPS increase would have been significantly higher were it not for these impacts. Cost sales increased 3% in the first half over a 3% increase last year.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call back to Carol and I will return later to recap our guidance at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. The important points that I'd like to make on this call are as follows. First the strength and consistency of our results should be noted, both in terms of year-over-year and division-to-division performance, as well as across economic cycles. Second, we have great opportunities in the back half of this year, given our strong trends and easier comp comparisons. Third, our growth vehicles both domestically and abroad are doing extremely well and hold tremendous potential for our company.</p>
          <p>Fourth, our customer traffic count reached extraordinary high levels in the second quarter and the rate of increase accelerated from the first quarter. We continue to attract new customers with our value propositions and are building our customer base for the future. And lastly, I say it all the time, we must continue to be totally focused on execution.</p>
          <p>So, let me highlight some of the second quarter results. Beginning in the U.S., Marmaxx's second profit margin of 11.4% was the best second quarter performance ever in Marmaxx's history. Segment profit was up 20% driven by a 4% comp, very strong merchandise margins, and effective expense control.</p>
          <p>HomeGoods delivered a 9% comp, with double-digit increases in customer traffic. This division's profit margins improved dramatically to 5.9%, its best second quarter performance ever and we believe its profit margin will hit all-time highs for the full year. I believe that HomeGoods still has tremendous untapped opportunities for the future.</p>
          <p>At A.J., they had another profitable quarter with the strength of 5% comps on top of 6% increases in the past two years. A.J. Wright's store contribution model is now at a level we have been targeting, which gives us the confidence to continue to roll out new stores.</p>
          <p>In Canada, while Winners and HomeSense segment profit was lower than last year, it was entirely due to the negative impact of currency. Profit was well above our plan as the business did a great job of mitigating the currency impact through better buying and excellent expense control. Our Canadian divisions remained our highest ROIC business.</p>
          <p>TJX Europe continues to significantly outperform our expectations. After investing in our new European businesses, segment profit grew approximately 80% and segment profitability improved by a very strong 230 basis points over last year. And T.K Maxx at 6% comp on top of comps that have ranged from 5% to 10% over the last three preceding years. With strong comp sales growth, as well as leveraging its cost base across the broader European business, we now believe that T.K. Maxx in the U.K. will exceed our previously stated segment profit target of 8% this year.</p>
          <p>Now I want to move to our vision for growth, which is rooted in how we conduct ourselves as a company. On our year-end call, we reiterated our vision and strategies to grow TJX as a global off-price value retailer. We told you that we were planting the seeds for the future. We're encouraged by early reads, and would grow when and where we are convinced it would produce solid returns to our shareholders. All of that still holds true today, except that we have seen even better results than we had expected and are taking advantage of the opportunities that this environment is presenting, which together gives us more confidence than ever that we can double the size of this company over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Our growth vehicles are all performing well domestically and abroad. In the U.S., we now feel that A.J. Wright has a solid foundation. As I mentioned, its store contribution margins have gotten to where we needed to see them to give us the confidence to grow this business. In addition, the new market of Atlanta is outperforming our expectation. While we will not grow too quickly, we could step out of it next year. As we pointed out before, we have a very strong management team in place for the future.</p>
          <p>Also in the U.S., our test of our Mega Shoe Shop by Marshalls, although still early, are performing very well and we believe may hold a good deal of growth potential in the future.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our T.K. Maxx stores in Germany continue to deliver powerful performance, exceeding our plans and we are on track to open our first stores in Poland this fall. Putting all of this together with the results we are seeing and the real estate deals we are getting, very exciting. While we're definitely seizing the day I want to say it again, we will only grow when and where we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (12:02) that justify growth.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about how we are capitalizing on the opportunities in this environment. First, we continue to attract new customers and are building our customer base for the future. Customer traffic continues to be up significantly and our average basket remains sound, which means that even a slight increase in consumer spending in our basket would be very meaningful to our business. This would probably be a good place to say that we are thrilled with the results of our dual branding strategy of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. We're very pleased with the new campaign of HomeGoods.</p>
          <p>Additionally we're very focused on making a shopping experience for our new customers a great one and have staffed our stores appropriately. In addition to building our customer base, we're taking advantage of this environment to build our vendor base. I can assure you that we are highly confident in the future of our supply chain. In terms of sourcing, we have significantly expanded the breadth of our vendor base, any one vendor is even less meaningful to us today than a few years ago. We continue to build our buying group and now have more coverage of the worldwide marketplace than even before with over 600 people in our merchant organization.</p>
          <p>Now to the real estate environment which is presenting opportunities in the near-term as well as for our long term growth. Some very attractive locations are opening up to us the first time. We now expect to net approximately 90 new stores this year up slightly from what we said on the last call due to some opportunistic deals. Keep in mind that while we are capitalizing upon opportunities we're still opening fewer stores than last year, so we will &#x2013; we are being very careful. And next year we anticipate opening more stores than this year, with our growth opportunity and the advantages of the global real estate environment.</p>
          <p>I want to reiterate that the strategies for growth that we shared with you a year ago are all working today. What has changed this year is that our results are better than we expected and the environment is offering us excellent opportunities. We are more committed than ever to our vision for growth. I can assure you that we will remain prudent, methodical in our approach. It's part of who we are, however, the advantages we have in the current environment bring even greater clarity to our vision to grow TJX well beyond the $20 billion company, we are today.</p>
          <p>Now let me move to our financial strengths. Returning excess cash to shareholders remains a priority that we are balancing with preserving our financial flexibility in this economy. Our strong operations generate substantial amounts of cash, which allows us to reinvest in our businesses and be conservative with CapEx, while we are simultaneously returning value to our shareholders through our share buyback and dividend programs.</p>
          <p>In terms of share repurchases, we bought back approximately $194 million of TJX stock during the second quarter, retiring $6.4 million shares. It continues to be our plan to buyback a total of approximately $625 million of TJX stock in 2009. This consists of $250 million we originally planned and the additional approximately $375 million to buy back the shares that converted in the first quarter. However, we may adjust this up or down depending on the economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to our outlook for the full year. We are now planning EPS to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.38, compared with $2.08 per share last year on a recorded basis. Last year's results included a $0.09 per share benefit from the 53rd week, as well as certain other items impacting comparability, which are detailed in a table in today's press release. Excluding these items, our full year EPS outlook of $2.26 to $2.38 represents an 18% to 24% increase over last year's adjusted $1.92.</p>
          <p>I should also point out that this guidance includes an estimate of $0.03 per share negative impact from foreign currency for the full year. Our outlook assumes a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 4% in both the third and the fourth quarter. Although we are up against easier compares in the back-half, we believe it makes sense to continue to plan our business conservatively. This strategy allowed us to generate significant leverage on incremental sales in first half, so it's working and we will continue with this approach to the business. However, I'm pleased with our current momentum entering the back-to-school period. Jeff will provide more details in a moment.</p>
          <p>So in closing, let me say that we believe we have more opportunities in front of us than ever before. We are seizing the day to take full advantage of the terrific opportunities this environment presents. Our strategies to remain flexible and conservative are working and we are going to stick with them. We know that we must execute sharply and we will. Our approach has always been and will continue to be that when things are going well, we get more demanding of the entire organization, not less. Complacency is not in our DNA.</p>
          <p>While we significantly surpassed our expectations for the first half and reached many all-time highs, I want everyone to hear me say that we are far from maximizing our growth opportunities. We hear the discussion out there about whether our growth is sustainable, so I want to be crystal clear on this point, despite all that we have achieved, we strongly believe that there is even greater growth ahead of us. As we enter the back half, we have great opportunities in our existing businesses and several new growth initiatives that we will be testing, as we are constantly planting new seeds for future growth.</p>
          <p>Further, a very important piece of our growth story that I want to make sure is understood is the scope of our value proposition. We span the customer income demographic from the low-end through the middle and to the high-end. We believe that our customer appeal is broader than any other apparel or home retailer out there. Just think about how much more growth we can achieve on a global level with this broad customer appeal. I have great confidence that we will emerge from the recession in a stronger position and grow beyond the $20 billion business we are today with stable, consistent, and strong growth.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the call back to Jeff to go through further details on the second quarter on our guidance, and then we will open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Obviously we now believe we have enough visibility into the balance of the year to provide guidance for the full year. What we will give you today is detailed guidance for the third quarter. We're also providing you with our outlook for comparable store sales growth and EPS for the fourth quarter and the full year but, and I want to emphasize this, we are not providing detailed guidance or models for these periods at this time. So we will give you very detailed guidance for the third quarter. We'll give you ranges of comp and EPS for the fourth quarter and the full year but no detailed models or guidance for the fourth quarter or full year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the details on third quarter guidance. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.68 over the $0.58 per share we reported last year. There are several items impacting comparability here. Last year, the mark-to-market adjustment for our inventory related hedges benefited EPS by $0.05 per share, while this year it's estimated to only have a $0.02 per share benefit, which is essentially the reversal of the Q2 quarter end mark-to-market adjustment that we booked in Q2. Additionally, we expect Q3 this year to be unfavorably impacted by $0.01 per share due to impact of foreign exchange translation.</p>
          <p>And finally, last year's Q3 earnings per share benefited from the adjustment to our computer intrusion reserve of about $0.01. So, when you adjust for these factors, the third quarter guidance represents a 17% to 29% increase over prior year. We're assuming a third quarter top line of $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion, with comp sales planned up 2% to 4% on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx Group. As the monthly comp both on a consolidated basis, and at the Marmaxx Group, we expect comp sales in the range of 2% to 4% in August, 1% to 3% in September and 2% to 4% in October.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 8.7% to 9.4% range, which on a reported basis are down 10 to up 60 basis points over the prior year. However, these year-over-year comparisons are significantly impacted by mark-to-market adjustments, which negatively impact our year-over-year pre-tax margins comparison by 40 basis points. Last year also benefited by 10 basis points from the favorable intrusion reserve adjustment that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>So adjusting for these items, the pre-tax margin would actually be up 40 to 110 basis points. I should also note that higher interest expense year-over-year, in part due to prefunding year-end debt maturities adversely impacts pre-tax margin comparisons by approximately 10 to 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>Same with the third quarter, we're anticipating gross profit margin in Q3 to be 25.9% to 26.4%, compared with 25.7% last year. Again, gross profit margin comparisons are adversely impacted by 40 basis points due to the mark-to-market adjustments I just described, so the underlying year-over-year increase is greater than the guidance would indicate. We expect the SG&amp;A in the third quarter as a percentage of sales to be about 16.7% to 16.9%, compared to 17.0% last year.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're assuming &#x2013; anticipating a tax rate of 38.1%, net interest expense in the $12 million to $14 million range, and a weighted average share count of approximately $430 million. For the full year, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.38, compared with $2.08 per share last year on a reported basis. Excluding certain items impacting the comparability of results year-over-year, which Carol described earlier and which are outlined in today's press release, this guidance represents an 18% to 24% increase over last year's adjusted $1.92.</p>
          <p>The full year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.61, compared with $0.58 last year. Like third quarter, there are several factors impacting the comparability of results, the major one being the additional week last year. These are also detailed in today's press release.</p>
          <p>We'll now open it up for questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person and I'll just say with our last call running long, not everyone has time to ask a question, so we are going to enforce our one question limit on this call and would appreciate your cooperation. Thank you and we'll now open it up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I was hoping you could help us understand the magnitude of the items impacting the gross margin in the second quarter, the 130 basis points improvement between, for example, merchandise margin, occupancy, et cetera. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, In terms of the gross margin, Kimberly, that was primarily driven by merchandise margin. We had a little bit of buying and occupancy leverage that's primarily merchandise margin related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one other point I'd make out is mark-to-market adjustments had a 10 basis point adverse impact on the gross profit margin, so that 130 basis points improvement would have been 140 basis points worth after that mark-to-market hit.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Congrats as well. I guess our question is on the Marmaxx segment margins. Looks like you got a lot more leverage in Q1 on a one comp than you did I guess in the second quarter on a four comp, so we're just trying to understand what's the difference between the two quarters in the leverage perspective and how should we think about the leverage point going into the back half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Brian, first of all we are leveraging SG&amp;A very well. There's probably 20 to 30 basis points predominantly due to our incentive program, which does go very deep in the organization. As you know, we have thousands of exempt associates, including our store managers, so with this very strong performance, it's significantly higher than planned. We have a bit in the 401-K and probably for the back half, a slight uptick in marketing. Jeff, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think just when you look, the difference on Marmaxx is really being driven by SG&amp;A, which as Carol mentioned is impacting the entire quarter. So if you look at SG&amp;A, Brian, you see we reported 10 basis points of leverage today. If you actually calculate it, by the way, it's closer to 20 basis points, just some rounding going on. The underlying leverage is actually significantly higher than that 20 basis points. As Carol mentioned, we've got an incentive plan, incentive programs that are tied to financial performance that go very deep into our organization, we have store managers and thousands of exempt associates participating and these associates are going to receive payouts that are well above plan. I mean, the strength of performance with EPS up 21% year-to-date in a very difficult economy, with the majority of retailers struggling. This is leading to higher expenses &#x2013; higher incentive expenses associated with these broad-based incentive plans.</p>
          <p>So as Carol mentioned, the expense is meaningful. It's worth about 20 to 30 basis points. In terms of a G&amp;A hit in the second quarter, it's impacting the majority of our operating divisions because they're all performing terrifically, and we are going to see this impact carryover into the back half as well. That said if you look at Q3, we are calling for SG&amp;A leverage of 10 to 30 basis points, despite this impact. It really tells you we're getting the cost savings that we planned. Probably a bit more than you asked for there, Brian, but sort of naturally led into a conversation about SG&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, you mentioned you've broadened the vendor base. Now, just to get at what's really a may knock on the story, I guess, do we see at this point in time some of the bigger brands less availability and that's why you're broadening out things? And is that a break from historical practice when we are coming out of recessions than we might have thought the supply chain tightened up? Could you just add some color around that for us? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say to you the answer to that in terms of the big brands is absolutely not. We put a strategy in place many years ago when we looked at the whole extension of being a global company and purposely put a lot of dollars and to sourcing and expanding to be very, very unique. I think today we probably have the most exciting stores that I've ever seen and the breadth of the assortment which is what we strive for, a little of everything versus being narrow and deep in any one place makes it probably one of the most exciting mixes and I think that's what's driving the customer back into our store and I think that's what's driving our traffic. So that will continue. So there's no change in our philosophy. We're just broadening which I think is very exciting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You come up &#x2013; but I'm interested in your guidance and then you come up against much easier backup comps and I know you talked a little bit about this and I'm wondering why your guidance is using the midpoint of your comp guidance assumes pretty decent deceleration in the two-year average comp so you did a 4% comp in the third quarter, a 3% last year, it's like a 3.5% two-year average and if you look at your &#x2013; you saw your third and fourth quarter even at the fourth quarter you're calling for it to take the midpoint of that two to four you're calling for deceleration to like 4% on a two-year basis. I'm just wondering what are the things that are contributing to that type of conservative guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Todd, with the way we looked at it is we really took the first half and basically said fairly equal on the second half. Yes, planning conservatively and I think part of it is we obviously with the volatility of the economic environment, we never know. Having said that, my intention is obviously to beat it and we are conservative in our plans and I think wisely so at this point.</p>

          <p>I think you called that out in your comments. It's really benefited us year-to-date and that we set our inventory and our cost plans around comps that are reasonable but conservative and that's the way we're going to continue to plan the business.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations as well. Carol, can you talk a little bit about the success and the learnings of your advertising strategy, what's been different there both in terms of spend or shifting dollars, international TV? What kind of results are you getting and what are your plans there going forward strategically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well I won't give you all our secrets, that's for sure. I can tell you that I think it's out there that we've done this dual advertising in terms of Marmaxx, which we think we're just at the beginning of this venture and we're pretty excited about what we're seeing. It's really allowed us to hit probably between 30% and 40% of the markets that did &#x2013; never have seen us really on TV, let alone on a consistent basis.</p>
          <p>So our plans are to be fairly aggressive in the back half and to continue this and we have a few new goodies and surprises for the future. And we're testing some other possibilities that will be very intriguing corporately going forward. So that's really all the comments I can make. I can tell you our spend will be less, but our penetration will be greater.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this strategy a little bit different in the sense that you had been advertising more on the basis of price and now it's more brands? Can you comment on that, more of a brand strategy?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks. If we forget about anything that happened last year for a second, I'm just wondering why fourth quarter wouldn't be a larger EPS quarter than 3Q, just trying to understand the guidance a little bit. And then you layered on to that easier sales comparisons and more help from FX, I'm just trying to figure out how you come up with that fourth quarter guidance. Maybe, part of that is if you could share your currency assumptions, Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I mean, I think when we forecast currency, Paul, we forecast it at the current rate. And right now, we would anticipate about $0.02 pickup, and we have that baked into the numbers.</p>
          <p>You know, if you back out currency, if you back out mark-to-market, the 53rd week, some of the one-time items that we've had, that we detailed in the press release, you'd see the midpoint of EPS range is up 10%. I think if you look at it without the translation benefit, because frankly there's no guarantee what currency rates are going to do, it would be up 14%. That's on a two to four comp. And I think the biggest factor impacting fourth quarter is given that we're trying to project out, a decent amount of time in an economy that's relatively uncertain, we took the half year of being relatively prudent in the way that we set the guidance.</p>
          <p>So to build on the question Todd asked earlier, year-to-date we have a three comp on top of a three last year. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is two to four on top of a minus two, so clearly there is a deceleration baked in there. If that doesn't happen, then there's upside. But, we just felt it made sense to plan our cost structure and our inventory prudently around that level of comp growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pre-tax margin, if you do the reverse math, we're about flat to up 70 basis points. The mark-to-market in a 53rd week impacts in the fourth quarter basically cancel each other out. So on a two to four, flat to 70 basis points, we have that bonus impact that we talked about earlier, which dampens those year-over-year pre-tax margin increases. So but, I think we are clearly being prudent, given the length of time between now and the fourth quarter and I think what remains is a reasonable amount of economic uncertainty.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys have clearly seen a nice turn in your home business and I'm wondering, Carol, if you could possibly talk a little bit about some of the categories where you're seeing most upside. And in terms of some of the categories where you're still seeing weakness, and also if you can just talk about you did allude to the fact that your basket was solid, was it up in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. First of all in terms of the basket, our basket is slightly down. Our traffic is way up, very, very strong and our average ticket is down mid single-digits. So that's what's really driving it, is truly the traffic. In terms of the home businesses, Jeff, it is really strong across the board.</p>
          <p>What I'm very happy about and gives me a tremendous positive feeling going forward is that not only are the fashion pieces working but the basic pieces are working, so when our sheets and towel business and our soft home and our basics are strong, that's a tremendous sign. So I think our values are extraordinary, I think the execution is absolutely terrific and we are testing a lot of new ideas and new categories, so I just think it's going to get more exciting. So I think we are in a great place in terms of all of our home businesses across the board.</p>

          <p>Just wanted to see if you might give us an update on some of the in-store merchandising initiatives and where you stand with the rollout and of let's say, the runway at Maxx or the Cube at Marshalls, those kinds of things and if those had any material impact in the quarter and what the outlook is going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ernie, do you want to talk to the runway in Cube?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Patrick, and I think it came up at a call earlier. On the runway we've added another few stores, because our results there continue to be strong. We like what we see. I think it does speak a little bit to the whole conversation of getting new customers in the door, a different customer that speaks to what Carol said earlier about a broader range of customers. So again, we're pretty content with the runway and have added a few stores recently, actually in this quarter here that we are just finishing.</p>
          <p>The junior Cube initiative continues to expand. We are at a little over 400 stores at this point and again the results we are very happy with. So and what we're trying to do there is obviously capitalize on a different customer than we have in the past, the younger customer, again going back to the comment about trading broader demographics-wise here, I think we're trading to not only a different demographic but a different age group, so that I think is planting a strong seed for the future and those are two good initiatives actually to talk about because they are an investment for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's interesting Patrick is that typically your mean age sort of starts to age and ours isn't. We've actually gone slightly down a few years, which means that when we talk about the increase in traffic, it absolutely means that we are capturing both a younger customer and keeping our customers, so that's a pretty exciting statistic.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does that shape some of the broad comments that you made earlier about pleased with back-to-school, early back-to-school, that kind of thing? Is it just being better positioned from a merchandising standpoint with juniors and some other categories?</p>

We took some &#x2013; we made a decision to take some early markdowns and clean out all summer, very early, so we did take a bigger hit in July than we had in plan.

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well, clearly we have $1.4 billion on our balance sheet. We also have almost $150 million in cash that we can't classify as such because it's invested in marketable securities that are a little bit over 90 days, so we're sitting here with about $1.5 billion. Our intent right now is to retire the debt, so that $1.5 billion, $400 million of it is for debt retirement. We've actually paid down the Canadian debt, which was approximately $200 million. The rate of interest that we're paying on that was very comparable to the rate of interest we're earning on the money, so it just made sense to pay it down. And then we have the bonds to repay in December, so that $1.5 billion, really $400 million of that is earmarked for debt repayment, so that would leave us with $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Clearly, Richard, it's not our goal to run with that level of cash. If you look historically, we've typically run $400 million to $500 million of cash on our balance sheet. However, I would say in this environment, we're going to want to maintain some excess liquidity as it's probably not a bad thing and continue to be conservative.</p>
          <p>And so our plans are currently to execute the buyback plan as we've laid it out, the $625 million, although there is a chance that at certain stock prices, that we might go in a little bit heavier on the buy back and we reserve the right to do that and we clearly have the financial flexibility to do that. But, ultimately that cash will be distributed to shareholders. That's been our practice &#x2013; our longstanding practice now for the last &#x2013; hope as for as far back as I can go. So we'll continue &#x2013; so we're going to continue that practice, but I think for the short-term, don't be surprised to see us run a little bit heavier levels of cash, given the environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're pretty happy with the level of debt we have now. We've &#x2013; essentially this year all of our transactions have replaced existing debt, so we really have an impact to our leverage ratio. I think over time as EBITDA grows, we have the ability to take on more leverage, and we'll consider that, but as of right now, there are no plans to do so.</p>

          <p>One question that's a big question, there. Do you want me to go ahead and take it, Carol?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, fine. So in the case of Marmaxx, Marmaxx's profit margin was up 130 basis points on a four comp in the second quarter. Right now, we have it up 100 to up 140 basis points on a two to four comp in the third quarter. In the case of &#x2013; I'll do the American, the U.S. divisions, and then do international. In the case of HomeGoods, in the first &#x2013; or in the second quarter, excuse me, we saw a 230 basis point &#x2013; excuse me, 530 basis point improvement on a nine comp. Our guidance for the third quarter is a 220 to 330 basis point increase on a four to six comp, so again those line up.</p>
          <p>With A.J. Wright, we saw a 130 basis point improvement on a five comp. As we look at the third quarter, we actually on a three to five comp would project it up 160 to 250, so it's higher than we saw in the second quarter, primarily because of the markdown issue that Carol mentioned that dampened the overall profit growth at A.J. Wright slightly.</p>
          <p>In terms of our international businesses, unfortunately, you get a lot of noise in here because of mark-to-market. In the case of Winners, Winners was down 150 basis points in the second quarter but only down 30 if you back out the impact of the mark-to-market, which was &#x2013; it's very important. I mean, they did a fabulous job of mitigating the impact of foreign currency on their cost of goods and a great job of managing expenses, so for them to be only down 30 basis points in the second quarter excluding the mark-to-market is a big deal.</p>
          <p>We look for a similar level of decline in the third quarter. We right now have them down 20 to down 40, again excluding mark-to-market. And in the case of T.K. Maxx, T.K. Maxx profit margin for &#x2013; or TJX Europe, we have &#x2013; they were up 230 basis points in the second quarter. There was really no impact from mark-to-market on them and that was on a five &#x2013; excuse me, on a six comp and then in the third quarter, we have them up 20 to up 120, again excluding mark-to-market on a 3% to 5% comp, so that's how it breaks out by business, Dana.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Stacy Pak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, congrats again. So I guess a question just on the whole cost reduction effort, are you still sort of thinking 150 is the right number for 2009? Can you talk a little bit about what inning you are in, what cost reductions we might be able to see for 2010 and sort of the potential improvement to gross margin and SG&amp;A from those efforts, multi-year kind of level? And maybe in that, throw in your thoughts on operating margin goals by division now, especially given some of the changes we saw this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Stacy, is that one question? All right. Just I'll turn it over to Jeff in a minute. In terms of the cost reduction, we had a goal of 150. We're definitely going to reach that goal. We're looking obviously at next year on what that number can look like. We're working on that today and we will update you obviously on that call in the beginning of the year and give you a full picture of that. And then in terms of multi-year, Jeff, do you want to just.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, yeah, the one other thing I'd call out on the $150 million is at the beginning of the year, we said SG&amp;A would be essentially flat on a constant currency basis and actually down in an actual dollar basis. So and we're on track for that. I think we have to call it is that our significantly above planned performance, it results in additional SG&amp;A dollars for the first &#x2013; with sales significantly over plan, there's variable costs like store payroll, the credit card interchange costs, et cetera, which have to increase the support sales. Also, we're planning to open 24 more stores in our original plan, so we got a 25 stores for the plan, and Carol talked earlier about some of the performance related incentive costs that are higher due to our strong performance. So, when we actually normalized it &#x2013; and we have a little bit of additional marketing that we're spending behind the strength and the business in the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>So, if you normalize for that, we're seeing $150 million and we're seeing flat SG&amp;A year-over-year. It's just that we've &#x2013; since we put the plan together, we've actually added G&amp;A, so that's important to call out.</p>
          <p>The other call out on this year, as we look at second and third quarter, and I'm not commenting on fourth quarter at this point, but second and third quarter, excluding the impact from the incentive comp, we're seeing very, very significant SG&amp;A leverage and that's being driven by this. As we look forward, I don't think we're prepared to put a model for next year at this point. And as I think as we look at our potential margins, the operating margin goals for each business, they're essentially in line with where we've been. We think HomeGoods is clearly a lot closer than they were. They had a peak margin two years ago, lost a lot last year, they've gained it all back and then some this year.</p>
          <p>T.K., we think can exceed their profit margin. Carol talked about that in the script, but beyond that, and Marmaxx is clearly pushing the high end, but I think beyond that, we haven't revised any of those goals and really wouldn't comment on that until get into putting a plan on the street for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the cost side, do you think that &#x2013; I mean, what inning are you in? If you don't want to comment, I understand you don't want to give numbers for 2010, that's fine, but can you just give us a sense of sort of what inning you're in and what sort of opportunities you may be looking at for 2010, anything qualitative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stacy, as far as I'm concerned, every single year we're going to go after cost reductions. I don't think we're in &#x2013; we're going to finish this year, certainly reaching our goals and hopefully surpassing it and then we are going to set the next goal for next year. So that to me is an ongoing process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Thank you. Just to piggyback on the last couple of questions &#x2013; Jeff, can you give the EBIT, segment EBIT sort of goals for this year that are embedded within your full year assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, no I can't &#x2013; I'd be happy to do that for third quarter but I think as it relates to fourth and full quarter, we &#x2013; as we said earlier, we weren't going to put detailed models on the street at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then if I can ask a different question, you've talked a lot about inventory availability not being a problem. Can you just comment a little bit on whether you're seeing better pricing now in terms of contributing to merchandise margin and whether you believe that's sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we're seeing both, David, but again, I'm going to go back to how we set up our sourcing and supply chain. Every single year we've increased our buying of off-price, and we will continue that goal. So we see this continuing, the availability be it of that brands or any country. I don't see that changing.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Just a follow-up on HomeGoods &#x2013; how much of your improvement, which was pretty spectacular for the quarter, was due to operational improvements and inventory management, which we've been talking about for a long time, and how much was just better traffic and merchandising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really all three. Our inventory levels are significantly down, which allows us to really flow in a lot of fresh, fantastic merchandise and I think our execution is really where it should be this year and I do think we skipped a few piece last year and I think we are at a place today where the guys understand it, they know that going forward, they know what they need to do and I think that some of it is up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great quarter. I have two tiny questions, you talked briefly about your basket being down and average ticket being down. I was curious if you could give us color, if that was mix of product versus mark-downs, and did HomeGoods, I'm sorry, A.J. have an impact on that for the overall? And were there any segments that you saw rebound nicely and improved nicely in the second quarter that you're able to now flex up going into the back half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, In terms of our basket being down, we set mid single-digits. A.J.'s really has no effect on that, Marni, it's really across the board and the qualitative piece is the qualitative piece. I mean I just think we'll continue to give great value to the consumer and that's what our goal is. In terms of seeing a segment going forward, again we have big initiatives for the back half. I really don't want to talk to those and I think you will see them when you go into our stores in the back half, so I would suggest shop in our stores.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just trying to reconcile your comment that HomeGoods likely to have its best margin in its history. Can you talk about what makes that business stand out from other homes related retailers, other than the obvious, because that's a great result?</p>
          <p>And then also, I think that implies a real reversal in margin trends at Marmaxx in Q4, is that right? And if so, what should keep Marmaxx from having much better margins in Q4 on a year-on-year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the HomeGoods question and the margin question, we &#x2013; Jeff already did talk a bit about Marmaxx and exactly what is creating that, so if he'd want to reiterate that, he can. In terms of HomeGoods, again, I'm just going to come back to &#x2013; it's about execution and I think these guys are executing and I think the model is a terrific model. It worked and it works when you execute well and that's what they're doing. So, I think again, I'll reiterate that I think they understand. I think we made some missteps a year ago and I think we're back on track and ready to accelerate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the only color I would give you around &#x2013; or around the fourth quarter is &#x2013; I'm not going to comment on Marmaxx specifically, but again, if you look at our Q4 overall pre-tax margin, we're seeing flat to up 70 basis points. We're clearly running stronger than that year-to-date and stronger guidance than the third quarter. And it really just comes down to a level of caution about the fourth quarter, just given how far we are out from holiday and the level of visibility we have.</p>
          <p>So, I would tell you, as we said earlier, that the assumptions we're making in our Q4 guidance lean towards the conservative side, but again, we think that's prudent in terms of how we position ourselves from a cost and an inventory perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Maybe I'm missing the share count, can you comment on year-end share count?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're just going to execute the buyback program that we have and we've got about $400 million to go, we're going to spend throughout the back half. I think you can make an assumption on share pricing to get to the share count.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning and congratulations. You had mentioned additional store openings next year relative to what we're going to see this year, could you just detail us on where the biggest growth is coming from and maybe domestically, geographic penetration, where we should expect to see those store openings? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michelle, you really are going to see it across the board and we are taking an opportunistic approach, and the reason why we ended up with 26 more stores in the original plan this year was because of the opportunity. So just like everything else, we have cash. We have tremendous flexibility. So we will take advantage of every terrific real estate opportunity for next year and that's the way we're looking at it, so it's really not by any particular region. It's really by return on invested capital.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Just regarding the merchandise margin, can you just give us a little bit of color of the IMU versus the markdown? And then on IMU, I guess you made a comment that you have a plentiful inventory to buy out there. Has the costing side of it changed at all over the last few quarters on a sequential basis?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's pretty balanced between merchandise margin &#x2013; the merchandise margin growth is pretty balanced between markup and markdown. And we're also getting some benefit from freight fuel. Freight as result to some as part of our cost reduction program, so we're seeing some of that flow through that but it's primarily going to be markdowns and markup on a pretty balanced between the two, Randy.</p>
