          <p>Welcome everybody in Frankfurt in our new inter-remestic headquarter to our Analyst Meeting on the occasion the Fourth Quarter Results, which we released this morning.</p>
          <p>With me is the top management of the house. We have Joe Ackermann, we have to your left Tony Di Iorio, Chief Financial Officer and we have to your right Hugo Bnziger, our Chief Risk Officer.</p>
          <p>We would like to proceed as following. Two presentations, Joe first and then Tony, on the results and on our strategic positioning. And then, we enter as usual into discussion with you all here in Frankfurt. We appreciate you came, joining us for this meeting. And after that we prepare to take questions from all the participants of the international conference call which is linked with this event. Also we are stream &#x2013; streaming, we are broadcasting this event through our website.</p>
          <p>With that one more remark, Joe, before I ask you to take the panel and speak from over there, is in interest of time, I want to save you the trouble that I read out all our legal disclaimers, which normally would have to. So for good order, I assume you have all read it, understood it, and we can take them to the minutes, so to speak.</p>
          <p>With that Joe, I would like to ask you to give your presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First, let me say a few words about the bank in 2007 and then of course say a few words about 2008.</p>
          <p>I think that you probably know, in the meantime, revenues have been up 8% to &#x20AC;30.7 billion, profit is up bottom line by 7% is 2.5 and pre-tax 8.7. I would like to make one comment as I read a little bit your interim comments in the meantime.</p>
          <p>We had one provision. Third party conduit, nothing to do with the traditional business one-off is not a worsening or weakening of your credit environment, not at all. So it has nothing to do with that. It is really a one-off.</p>
          <p>Still a little bit challenging to see whether it will be finally covered by the agreements we had. Let's see, but it is one-off event which we had to take because we couldn't fully document the way the agreement was looked out and that is a &#x2013; is now they tested in our case and I'm very happy about that.</p>
          <p>Then of course we had some tax events, Tony will talk about that briefly, which were in addition to the normal tax rate and we had a write down on impairment on intangibles and as I mentioned in two small businesses, but we took it now and so that had somewhat negative impact on our results. The operating strengths actually has been quite good.</p>
          <p>What is really important, is the CIB businesses, now admittingly of course more coming from the first half and from the second, but for the full year we are only down 15% in CIB and about 22% in CB&amp;S. So actually a relatively small and &#x2013; I mean, compared to the record level of 2006, if you compare with 2005. Things look of course even better. But I think its important to say that we have the tested mark down to 2.2 billion and we still are only 15% below the record level of 2006, I think that is something, which, by the way, is also a good argument for our vision statement later on.</p>
          <p>PCAM steady growth, of course, we have integration cost on the retail side. And we had this impairment in asset management, otherwise a strong good business in line with what we are expecting and I may come back to that quickly and we talked about '08.</p>
          <p>Clearly, one of the out performances in the industry is our CB&amp;S revenues. And we delivered on our pre-tax target, which 26% reported 29. But you know, we've this target definition, which is more narrow and more the underlying side of our business, 26% and the same EPS 13 reported and 10.79 underlying our target definition.  That's why, we are proposing to the AGM to increase dividend to 450, a bit in line with our commitment, remember that, to increase our payout ratio over time.</p>
          <p>The next one, the management agenda is unchanged, we stick to that. We are continuing our discipline.  Having said that, I was asked several times on the first conference, have you taken lessons? Have you learned your lessons? Yes, of course, I mean, if I'm asked about the fraud event in Deutsche Bank, I'm not na&#xEF;ve and say this will never happen.  We are confident that it doesn't happen. But immediately, we asked our auditors internal and external to look into that.  I think that would be bad management not to do that. But this is not in any way a bad feeling, but I wouldn't like to say we're complacent, everything is perfect and then in three years from now, we do have a similar case. So we're looking that and starting that very carefully.</p>
          <p>But as I said, we are confident. The same is true for our risk management. There are lessons to be learned. I think we did a better job then most of our peers, but are we perfect? No. I think we will look more into stress testing of our hedging strategies. We look more into notional amounts, our trading capital equivalent, we will give more to price signals to our traders, so they are not benefiting from a double A1 bank. They get the price signals, which they should get when they take high risk, and things like that. So there are things to be learned, improved and we are doing that very methodically.</p>
          <p>We will continue to invest in organic growth in bolt on acquisitions. I think what is really a success story is our value creation in Asia. Especially in China, if you think you now have a 30% stake in the largest &#x2013; third largest asset manager with quite a substantial invest in assets and we bought that in a very early stage, increased it now. And nowadays, I think we have quite some value created in it, so we've got it very reasonable. Same of course is true for our last year, where we have a nice stake and a good corporation agreement and more to come along these lines.</p>
          <p>We will further grow our stable businesses, PCAM and GTB; and of course in investment banking, we are now benefiting &#x2013; I don't want to offend anyone at this table, but some are more effective than others, and I think those who are less effective have good reason to push and to gain market share and that's exactly what we are doing.</p>
          <p>So, next page, cost/income ratio is stable. The compensation ratio was 43%, so below last year. And what is also very important, we are not mortgaging the future &#x2013; or we are mortgaging the future less than in previous years. So, what we have here now restricted equity units is below what we had last year.  If you believe some rumors, some banks are mortgaging more.</p>
          <p>The other thing is this famous liability side. We have not made anything &#x2013; actually, for the full year, I think we have 19 million. Others have billions or more like billion. We are not doing that. First of all, we don't need; and secondly, I think it's wrong, because you are mortgaging the future and it's also not very logical. There's no economic value in it and your spreads widen because you have weaker credit. So in the theory, you can buy back your debt cheaper and that's what makes you more profitable. That's not the way we are doing it. So we have not mortgaged the future on that side, which is a very important argument, and we have not mortgaged the future in terms of compensation more than when we normally had for retention purposes, another good argument.</p>
          <p>Problem loan ratio is down. Tier 1 ratio flat, 8.6, and at year-end still unrealized gains on our industrial holdings, but these are industrial holdings we have not taken into account yet other stakes, as I said, in Chinese banks, so this is the target industrial holdings.</p>
          <p>Next one, we will have a positive impact from Basel II, so we are starting now at 9.4% since 1st of January.  We have similar targets so that I don't have to go through that, as you see on the right hand side. The next &#x2013; because I think we are showing more resilience and probably more stable, we are clearly funding cost advantages, which I tried to put. Although I have to say that CBS spreads are not fully reflecting the cost of funding. Actually, we always had good funding and even in times where other banks had difficulties in getting term money, we've got quite attractive term money because we were one of the banks big investors trusted. What we cannot offer is capital injections. Many would like to do a similar deal with us, we just don't need them.</p>
          <p>Next one, we have organic growth. We have continued to grow our risk weighted assets, but as you see, return on risk weighted assets has been relatively stable, a little bit lower than in 2006. I should also mention that when we talk about return on equity, that we have a completely different capital base. We have about 4 billion more than we had in previous years. So we are not buying back shares or reducing capital in order to maximize return on equity. We are growing and we have added 4 billion in capital, and you will see that later on in more detail.</p>
          <p>The next one, that's more of a reminder, we continue to grow our business in all areas. But we are not a friend of market cap maximization. I don't think that's a good strategy. We &#x2013; important for us is not &#x2013; neither the total assets, nor a number of branches, nor market cap.  Important for us is the strategic positioning in our core businesses. And secondly, the return we achieve on our capital. That's all which counts. And it will be easy to buy a retail bank somewhere and to add another 20 or 30 billion, but I don't think that's strategically intelligent nor is it in interest of shareholder. So this dream of growth I do not share, or we do not share.</p>
          <p>Then stable businesses.  Over 3 billion now in GTB we are roughly 950, which is close to the billion target. On the retail, it is 1149, if you add the integration costs and the noris [norisbank] adjustment cost, it will be over 12, so 13 is not such a stretch. And in asset and wealth management they have a very, very good asset inflow and are making good progress, but we have taken this impairment charge in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next page, you'll see the money &#x2013; net new money inflows, 59 billion, 40 billion in asset and wealth management, 19 billion in PBC which I think is very strong development.</p>
          <p>Next one in CB&amp;S, to fuel investment banking, we have net revenues which are flat to last year on record level. So I think that's another very important message.</p>
          <p>And I would like to say a few words why we did somewhat better. First of all, I'm strong believer in management stability, I'm not a friend of if someone makes a mistake, he has to go and then you hire a new one at a higher price and he makes the same mistake two years later.</p>
          <p>If you want to have experienced people, you have to tolerate that they can make mistakes in challenging terms, not twice but once; and so for us never a question of getting rid of people, who have done a fantastic job for very long. If someone underperforms then of course he will be replaced, if someone does something legally incorrect he has to go, but not in a market which is so challenging if he had some bad luck; so, very important that we have the same team in place as at the press conference for many, many years.</p>
          <p>Secondly, a very tight risk and capital management; I think one of the reasons we were successful that in July when the first signal started we said, out, exit, whereas some others hoped for better times. And I feel here that if you are jeopardizing our bonus pool by doing this or you know when traders, investors come back from their vacation, they start buying again.  We did not share that view; based on a more macro economic analysis, we felt that the subprime will not recover and that it will get worse and so we got out of related products and I think that's the major difference between those who did better than the others. And we are well diversified, very strong position on emerging economies which helped us tremendously, and as I said always access to funding sources at attractive rates compared to some of our peers.</p>
          <p>Going forward you know that, that mega trends, in my view, are unchanged. Those who say, that originated as a thing of the past. They really don't know what they're talking about, if we change that model we'd have a recession on a global scale because we couldn't fund emerging economies anymore, we couldn't fund large cap companies anymore, it's just na&#xEF;ve to assume that. Will it change a little bit? Yes, certain things will be different, maybe more transparencies, but overall our position is that EBIT will continue and we are one of the best positioned in that.</p>
          <p>Globalization will continue, we have added over 9,000 people last year, 40% of that in Asia. We have now 6,000 people in India alone. And global asset growth, strong outsourcing in the insurance business, insurance industry, through asset management, we're benefiting from that. And alternative investment is becoming more important, real estate, we believe, is one of the premier players in that market.</p>
          <p>Now for the mission, first of all, I mean, we have hundreds of skeptics around us, too, and if I may say something on my birthday, I wouldn't dare to say that. Some of you I think are also now in environment where it is very messy. I mean if I had all these positions and billions of write-downs, I would probably be shocked too. So trying to differentiate between those who have such better positions than others, and I think that's an important first message.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if we now give internally and I'm not saying we should naively be optimistic, that's not my point, but if you say everything will be bad and just lean back and wait, that is not what we should to do as managers. You have to take the risk and you have to say, we are going to achieve that and to make it credible as long as it is realistic. If it's not realistic, you'll be foolish, but I am very convinced that assuming that the real economy is not collapsing and when I say not collapsing, substantial slowdown in U.S., but no recession; relatively strong economy in Europe, Germany about 1.5%, not collapsing either but slowing down. And in the emerging economies still strong growth. If this is right, I don't think that the credit environment will change dramatically.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are assuming that there is not big a monoline tsunami hitting us and with dramatic dislocations of the market. So, I mean if this happens or other things then of course I &#x2013; we'll come back and say, this is not based on our assumptions, but assuming that we have these positions which we have that markets will be more challenging in certain parts on the other hand flow business is very strong and January in sales trading was a good month because of that.</p>
          <p>Now clearly, we've one big issue, that's the leveraged loan. If markets do not recover, prices have to be adjusted. If we can't place them we have to take them on our balance sheet, but the NIM is very important. So, maybe in the first few months, you will see it will be more on the negative side; then in the next nine months you will see them on the positive side.</p>
          <p>So overall, we think from today's perspective that NIM is exceeding any markdowns and I think that is what I have in mind when we talk about 2008. I am not talking about February or March or April 2008. We are talking about the full year. And we have taken management actions. We are not expanding. We are not building up the way we would have liked to without the financial crises, so we are waiting and then we will see. So, costs are under control.</p>
          <p>And overall, looking into our positions, we are confident that some businesses will outperform our ambitions; some will maybe a bit under-perform, but on average the 8.4 is still realistic. And as I said the Executive Committee is committed to that and we do everything to achieve that, what I've said this morning. If you are a Formula One driver and you start your race with saying I will be last any how, you better don't go there.</p>
          <p>So if we said we are not going to make it then it will be a little bit weak. All we are saying &#x2013; we take the courage as we did with the retail bank with the 25%. Many of you still have some of its report. It said how ridiculous and how naive and you will never achieve that. We achieved it. Even in the most turbulent year, we had 26% and retail was 1.150, so much higher than the 1 billion.</p>
          <p>And I am very confident that we do the same and you have the management commitment and strength to do whatever is necessary to achieve that, but are we profitable? I cannot say how this year develops, I think people are a bit too negative now</p>
          <p>Based on now we have now a book value per share of about 77, 78. If someone is saying the target price is 68, he is saying it should be value it at price-to-book of 0.9, everybody's guess, I would challenge that. I am just saying here you have different and I think its very important that you have a few people in the industry who have the courage to say things will turn out differently. Otherwise we can just start crying here and see the whole banking world collapses and this is not the case. Capital markets are strong. Liquidity is strong. There are lot of strategic buyers around and a tremendous strength in the emerging economies. So that is in a nutshell what I wanted to say but I am happy to be challenged by all of you. Thank you</p>

          <p>Thanks, Joe. We hand over to Anthony</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll go through this briefly without trying to repeat much of what Joe said but the first chart with pre-tax profits for the year 8.7; for the quarter 1.4, which is comparable to the third quarter. We'll talk about this more later but the difference between the two quarters, the third quarter had substantial write-downs, but it also benefited from substantial Corporate Investment gains.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we had some Corporate Investment gains, but they were much more modest and as a result the quality earnings. Joe talked about the mark-to-market of the debt. We'll talk about that in more detail.</p>
          <p>Next page, net income of a billion and we've shaded the fourth quarter last year and the third quarter this year to give you a sense of the special tax effects that were in each quarter. In the third quarter, this year we earned 1.6 billion and as we discussed when we presented those earnings, there were some substantial tax credits. One had to do with the revision of the German taxes, the impact that had on our deferred tax liabilities and others had to do with the settlement of some tax audits and similar and that was 600 million.</p>
          <p>So in the third quarter we would have earned 1 billion, and we earned 1 billion after-tax this quarter. If you look at the fourth quarter last year we had about a 400 million credit, which was from the German tax law that changed the application of the dividend credits that were grandfathered.</p>
          <p>So, as far as net income is concerned, it is about the same as the third quarter. The third quarter had substantial tax free gains in it as well I should mention and slightly below the fourth quarter last year, which was a record fourth quarter, very strong fourth quarter. So given the turbulent times we are in, given the difficulties that we have had to face it was a fairly steady tax rate for the quarter, was just under 33% and that fits within our guidance rate of 33 to 35 and we'll continue with that guidance.</p>
          <p>Net revenues were up 2% against a very strong fourth quarter for the year, up 8%, which is remarkable when you consider the effects particularly of the summer months. I should add that we had no significant net write-downs in the quarter in our CDO or RMBS exposures. I'll touch later on the leverage finance book, there's a chart in the handouts that will show you what happened there and Corporate Investments contributed 165 to the quarter, which was the same about as contribution in the fourth quarter of last year. Go to the next page we look at expenses.</p>
          <p>Our total expenses for the quarter were up from the third quarter but up slightly from the fourth quarter last year and I'd just like to comment on two elements. When we presented the third quarter numbers, many of you were skeptical as to whether we had taken down our bonus accrual too much.</p>
          <p>If you remember, we came in at a comp ratio which was in the low 30s and at the time we said two things. We first told you how we do our bonus accrual, which is a year-to-date and then a true up over what had been accrued in the prior periods and because of the very strong first half, we released accruals in the third quarter that were made in the second and the first, in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>We indicated at that time that our targeted comp ratio for the year was going to be consistent with we were in the first half. And we are happy to report, you will see on the next page, that it is.</p>
          <p>As far as the non-comp let me go back one page there, let's touch on that, as far as the non-comp, we came in at 2.1 comparable basis and again we spilt this to show a 200 million charge which I will explain. The 200 million consists of two elements, the 74 million which we took in the Asset Management, which was a write-off of the Scudder intangibles, and I will touch on that shortly in a little more detail. And then, because of the anomalies of insurance accounting, following the acquisition of Abbey, which was in the third quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter of this year, we have to gross up investment gains on the insurance assets against the liabilities for two policyholders and the latter comes through as an expense. And so, although we take out a spread from those two, unfortunately we cannot report them on a net basis.</p>
          <p>The net is still positive and we believe that the business on preliminary indications will produce the P&amp;L forecast each year that was anticipated when it was approved &#x2013; before it was approved when it was reviewed. So, those two elements we are going to begin showing or the second one in the Abbey, we're going to begin showing that separately just so that you can focus on where the expenses were.</p>
          <p>When we presented the third quarter numbers, we also told you that in those numbers were some credits. There was an &#x2013; recoveries on insurance claims that we had previously expensed and paid from the insurers because that does take some time to run through the claims process. In addition to that, we had a 138 million of VAT recoveries, which also have to be shown as an expense offset rather than revenue. And what we said is if you adjusted out for those two elements, then our run-rate in the third quarter of non-comp would have been about 2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>If you look at this year &#x2013; this quarter, there is an insurance recovery and there is a settlement. The insurance recovery is about the same as it was in the prior period, so that had a neutral effect. And the settlement on a claim we had was substantially lower than the 138 million. So, if you factor all of that in and the reason we put the headline here that G&amp;A expenses are consistent with the effective run-rate of the second and third quarter, is that we avoided what happened here in prior years with the fourth quarter book.</p>
          <p>We had fourth quarter expenses because at year-end there are special expenses that you can't charge off earlier in the year having to do with mailings, having to do with a number of other things, and &#x2013; but we were about at the same run rate adjusted for those non-recurring items.</p>
          <p>Now, if you go to the next page you'll see the ratios, the 76% cost/income ratio is impacted, that number would have been probably rounded to 75, without the Abbey adjustment and there were some other &#x2013; there were some expenses in the quarter. I want to focus for a second on the comp ratio which is 44% for the quarter and 43% for the year. It came in where we said it would and as Joe said, we reduced in absolute terms the number of equity grants that we had as part of that process. The number is down from last year. On a relative basis, we followed about the same split as a percentage between cash and stock. So, we didn't change that. So, we have not mortgaged the future, what you will see is in the first quarter, a first quarter phenomenon which we explained last year because of the accelerated investing for people eligible for early retirement. So you'll see a pick up. But what we are doing is accelerating closer to the year in which the grant is made; the expense which we think is a good thing because it gives you a better sense of what's happening against costs.</p>
          <p>The next slide has to do with the stable businesses. Joe discussed this; I just want to highlight one thing, in the fourth quarter, the 643 million is net of the 74 million. If we adjust for that, then the fourth quarter of the stable businesses is comparable to the first quarter of 2006, which was the best quarter. So, we're producing there and doing well.</p>
          <p>Moving into the segment CB&amp;S &#x2013; is down 57% from the fourth quarter last year, but it's a very different quarter, up substantially from the third quarter because as I said earlier, we avoided the write-downs; we were able to, because of risk management practices and the early liquidation, we were able to avoid costs and we did have recovery.</p>
          <p>If we looked at the businesses, the product lines where we had the 1.6 billion of trading losses in the third quarter and looked at the contribution of those businesses in the fourth, the number is positive. So, we had a shift from a 1.6 billion loss to a positive. And so, that shows the recovery of those businesses. Did we have write-downs in the CDO book? Did we have write-downs in other  assets? Yes. Did we have hedges that offset them and was there a prudent risk management? Did our net exposures remain where we wanted them to? The answer to that is yes as well, and these results demonstrate real strength in the flow products. We'll go into them in debt and equities in a second and we had a record quarter on Advisory.</p>
          <p>I just want to go back to something Joe said with regard to the mark-to-market of own debt. During the quarter, we booked a loss of 3 million. So in marking our debt to market, we took a loss of 3 million. We had 22 million in the third quarter and that brings us 19 million for the year.</p>
          <p>As Joe said, it's very difficult to understand how you can ever economically realize this benefit. So what does this mean for you and for our investors? It means we're not mortgaging the future. Either we're sitting &#x2013; have to be sitting on substantial excess liquidity to be able go out into the markets and buy your publicly traded debt, which very few banks are currently.</p>
          <p>If you had to refinance that debt, you would have to refinance it at higher interest rates, and so you're going unwind the benefit through higher interest costs in the future. If it is a privately placed debt, the holder of that debt is not going to except a redemption, unless you've got a call feature of some type, and most of these structured notes that we apply to is not going to accept a discount on the face value. He is going to wait for maturity. So what you have to do for those, is accrete this benefit back through P&amp;L as an expense to raise a liability to maturity date as to what it is.</p>
          <p>So we're not criticizing anybody for doing anything. But we only want to point out the significance &#x2013; because I think that was lost on a lot of analysts &#x2013; the significance of what those gains mean. And we're assuming everybody accounted for them properly. Although the past week has just published a proposed change in rules that says that the debt has to be marked to the spread that represents the driver of that liability cost in the market.</p>
          <p>So if it's privately placed notes, such as the ones we are valuing and the spread is widened two points or whatever, that's what you have to use, not the CDS, not the publicly traded debt spread. But &#x2013; and that's the change they've proposed. Significance here is what does it mean for you and our shareholders, and we think it's not mortgaging the future.</p>
          <p>If you look at debt, Sales &amp; Trading, a sharp recovery from the third quarter, although down from the prior year quarter. The flow businesses effects in traditional fixed income, which we call rates, benefited from the quarter. Strong performance, a scalable platform and their great economies, the depth of our platform, the geographic reach are all beneficial with rates. As you can see, it's a flow business is in the structured products. On credit, we had no net write-downs in sub-prime and CDO and we continue reducing the size of the trade book.</p>
          <p>As far as equities is concerned, the same story. A growth though from the third quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter of last year. And the fourth quarter of last year had much larger designated prop trading profits than the fourth quarter this year. So both in terms of relative terms as well as absolute terms, the prop trading is down. Equity derivatives had strong performance, particularly in the retail products.</p>
          <p>Our prime services business is growing well. We've just announced the acquisition of a hedge fund administration company in the United States and we think that that will complement that business. It's in GTB not in the CB&amp;S, but nevertheless, it's another foray into a very important product area for us. Cash equities was up, and as the arrow shows, designated prop was down significantly.</p>
          <p>Origination and Advisory, a record quarter for us on Advisory. You'll see the numbers in detail in the product breakdown. But we had 314 million of Advisory revenues in the quarter. Equity origination is also &#x2013; was down but performed well. And on the leverage finance pipeline, we'll continue that on the next page. So you'll see what we did <mark type="inaudible" /> if you could.</p>
          <p>Okay. This is an update of the chart that we showed at the end of the third quarter. And so what happened to our positions during the quarter. They dropped from 41.4 to 36.2. And you can see, where that 5 billion plus came from. Some of it was helped by FX but the significant is the sales of 5 billion. The 5 billion, if you go down to the development of the write-downs was sold for 80 million higher than the carrying value at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So we sold them for a profit but that also indicated something about, for those positions at least, how close our marks were to market and demand. We took another 124 million of charges during the quarter. We reported in the press release that the net write-down was less than 50 and that's the 44 you can see on the chart. That's the combination of the 124 and the 80.</p>
          <p>Our funded loans, at the end of the quarter were at 15 billion and the unfunded was at 20. And you can see the run-off of the commitment period down below, whether all those close or not is subject to conjecture and our guys are working very closely and very carefully to see where that goes.</p>
          <p>The other importance is as far as how this is classified and how it's treated through P&amp;L. We did not move any loans into the banking book, except those that at the time of the commitment, the intent was to hold.</p>
          <p>So as we explained last period, every time a commitment is proposed, it has to be designated as to how much of that is the final hold. And that's an important thing that Hugo looks at, as far as risk management. So we didn't move anything. So that says that the book is still susceptible to market fluctuations and you can see we get almost 35 billion. How did we value these? The same way we valued them in prior periods, the same way we value trading positions.</p>
          <p>The business &#x2013; the CRM in this case, credit risk management go through the first review of the marks. They do it with market conditions as of December 31st, which is what is required. We then &#x2013; our guys, finance guys go in to do the typical independent price review that they do on trading positions.  And then on top of that our external auditors did a review of both, the pricing methods, the approach, as well as the values.</p>
          <p>So that's where that is. GTB, if we can turn, had a record year. The quarter was up from the fourth quarter last year, best fourth quarter ever. We had very strong performance from trade finance as well as our cash management business. We announced, as I mentioned earlier during the quarter, the acquisition of a hedge fund administrator on the West Coast in America. And also in the year, we purchased the domestic custody business in Turkey of Garanti Bank. So those have not had any impact or significant impact yet on the results, but we expect that over the years, those will help us build the business further and particularly outside of Germany in emerging markets, which is where there is a big push on in this business.</p>
          <p>Asset and Wealth Management, the fourth quarter was affected on a comparative basis by some specific items. The first, in the fourth quarter last year, we had significant gains from the sale of assets that were booked and we disclosed this. We didn't have those this quarter, and we indicated that these are lumpy. They don't come on a regular basis but they come when the sales or the performance fees are generated. In addition to that we took the 74 million charge. When we acquired Scudder, the purchase price was allocated to tangible assets, intangible assets and goodwill. Among the intangible assets was the value of investment management contracts. Two of the businesses that had intangibles on their investment; management contracts, the review we did this year indicated that the intangible value was impaired. One of them we wrote-off 100% because the numbers, the valuation allowed us to do that. And the second one, there is still a small piece left. And we'll have to see how the business develops. It's maybe 20% of this total that we have here, so there maybe another, in the future; hopefully, there won't be, and we'll see how businesses develop.</p>
          <p>On PBC, we're up 13%. Again, it's the best fourth quarter we've had. The revenue &#x2013; we had lower revenues from brokerage. There was a slowdown of activity. The fourth quarter is normally a slow quarter. And this is an individual business and we've had a slowdown in brokerage revenues from the third quarter. We had substantial net new moneys. We incurred cost for the relaunch of norisbank. We picked up about 2 billion of new deposits our deposits have gone from 1 billion to 3 billion in norisbank through that relaunch, and we'll continue that. And what they are going to focus on this year is growth, after substantial integration cost, we should see most of that go away, probably half way through the first quarter and that was significant. And we should see the fruits of the marketing and relaunch campaign both on loans as well as on deposits.</p>
          <p>Turning to next page, as far as net new money; 59 billion for the year, 13 billion for the fourth quarter. It's important to look at the breakdown as well. PWM, which suffered from the costs of substantial build up in 2006, which we have described to you. We hired more than 400 people in that business, most of them or many of them in frontline or directly supporting the frontline. And we saw the benefits of that hiring both in the U.S., our former Alex. Brown, this is still not totally profitable, it's approaching break-even, but has improved substantially. But we've seen significant growth in Asia and good money flows from Asia as well.</p>
          <p>Asset Management was the same phenomenon and if you look there, the amount of assets that we had coming in on institutional, retail as well as alternatives was very strong, and this should help in the future. One of the effects that we suffered from, in the fourth quarter was FX with the weakening dollar and the large presence in the United States, we had a negative impact. So if the dollar recovers some, you should see some reversal of that. The number for the FX is included in the &#x2013; not in the net new money, but in the total asset cost.</p>
          <p>As far as risk and capital, we've mentioned and Joe commented on this that we had a significant write-off. The majority of the growth from the fourth quarter last year is due to this one provision we took on a counter-party relationship. And absent that, what we've seen is that risk costs are rising consistent with the size of the book. We haven't seen any trend that would indicate the rate of cost, is up.</p>
          <p>If you got to the next page, you'll see that in a part demonstrated here, the bulk of that increase in problem loans comes from this one credit. And it will &#x2013; other than that, it has remained fairly flat. Joe commented on this before. Our shareholders' equity is up, book value at 77.5% and Tier 1 at 28, the ratio also stayed at 8.6 and this is on a Basel I basis. We showed the chart earlier on Basel II basis, we would have been at 9.4.</p>
          <p>And that's the end of my prepared remarks and we'd be happy to take questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Wolfgang. My name is Dieter Hein from FaiResearch. Firstly; congratulations to your very respectable figures and results in the fourth quarter under the current market circumstances. I have two questions, if I may. Firstly, regarding your vision for the current year: Dr. Ackermann, you took the risk to give us 12 months ago a breakdown for the sub-segments or for the segments and for CBS, your expectation for 2008 contribute to the pre-tax profit of 5.3 billion. Could you update us on this &#x2013; if I understood you right during your presentation its still your target, but maybe this,is not correct? And secondly, I heard from the press conference that you confirm that you are interested on buying Postbank, if that is right? So my question &#x2013; I have two questions there, does Postbank branch network really fit to your branch concept, I mean, that Postbank shares its network with the mail with Deutsche Post? And secondly does such an acquisition mean that Postbank has as well target to reach 25% midterm under Deutsche Bank Group? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, the first question, a good observation. Without committing &#x2013; not indicating any sub-segments. It is clear that even we see the challenges in some parts of our business and others we think will do better. So the combination, the breakdown will be different but overall we shall stick to the 8.4 billion that is supported by what the businesses have developed as their plans. But I am not going to give you a number on the details, but I am not saying it's exactly the same numbers per segment as we indicated two years ago, that is true.</p>
          <p>Secondly, well I think implicitly I gave you a little bit hint when I said where we are in GTB in retail already and still having some additional costs &#x2013; integration costs, or impairment costs seen which hopefully will not be repeated so and in that sense, I think it shows you a little bit where we see more &#x2013; somewhat more fantasy than in others.</p>
          <p>Postbank, well I mean we analyzed that two years ago.  At that time, we were willing to enter constructive dialog, unfortunately as you remember we had this IPO mandate in parallel and it was a little bit on too short notice. It was leaked to the media and then the whole thing had to stop. So we know pretty well what the value of Postbank would be. Since then a lot has being done on both sides, in Deutsche Bank as well as in Postbank. I did not say that we would jump on it without having deliberations and proper analysis. No one has asked us, but I'm just saying in principle, we would be willing to consider that if it makes sense at the end for the shareholders. I mean, it depends on the price; it depends on some other requirements. I remember that a few years ago people asked for thing we were not willing &#x2013; we would not have been willing to give in, and maybe that would be the same. I'm not saying under any circumstances we would take it. I'd say we would clearly be interested in being invited to any bidding process.</p>
          <p>What we are going to do then is an open question, but we have not been asked. So it's somewhat hypothetical question. But it's clear that now for the second or third time, its rumored that something will happen with Postbank. I can clearly say we have not been contacted by anyone and have not been active ourselves.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Next question, please. <mark type="Inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" />. Three questions please. Sorry to come back to that leverage loan commitment issue that we already discussed in the third quarter, but could you just explain again the 35 billion that are in the trading book.  What the risk rating of that is? what the underlying capital required for that amount is and at what stage you would have a different risk rating on that exposure and to obviously different capital requirement? That's question one.  And question two relates to your exposure in the U.S. Maybe you could give us the absolute size of direct loan exposure in U.S., and in addition, either direct or indirect monoline exposure and in that context maybe also your expected loss estimate for 2008? And the final question is on funding. You have a strong increase in your deposit volume, I think 5 billion in the fourth quarter, and you're heavily advertising in the press for getting retail deposits in. How do you think about optimizing your funding mix at the moment also in terms of maybe issuing <mark type="inaudible" />, getting even more deposits in to sort of like optimize your structure there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask Hugo to answer the second &#x2013; question number two and three, and Tony number one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as our leverage finance book, and I think we explained this last time, once the loan is funded if it stays in the loan book, which the 35 is, for the first 180 days it gets trading book treatment. The trading book treatment does not have a bar directly, it does not have an RWA, it's based on a trading risk. Once the 180 days expires then whether we keep it in the trading book for financial reporting purposes or not, for regulatory capital purposes, it moves into the banking book and then it gets this typical loan treatment. I don't know what the mix is or when those come in, but if you look at the what we had funded at the end of the third quarter, you can probably figure out what's going to go into the banking book, if it's still there, by the end of &#x2013; by the 180 days. So that's where we are, I don't have the number as to how much that would be but basically that's the principle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was asked this morning whether we are similarly well positioned with monoliners as we were with the sub-prime assets and my answer was very short. And it was yes, we are. And the reason why I'm saying that is we are not using monoliners for risk management primarily. So we use monoliners because our investors ask us for wrapping assets in monoliners or in monoline insurance and that's for a very simple reason. When you look in the investment principles that the &#x2013; or guidelines that ERISA pension funds have to follow in the United States they have to follow rating pocket and the biggest pockets are Triple A rated assets, so they are always looking for Triple A rated assets and the monoliners are the guys who produce that.</p>
          <p>Now when you look then further down for the debt begs the questions of when we use them, so how much do we hold on inventory. And we hold on inventory as we hold all other assets on inventory, to manufacture products. So we do not have an inventory to take positions, that's very important. And that's the prime reason why actually we went so well through the whole crisis. So many other banks had carry positions, but when you think about what we as a bank do with illiquid products like loans, mortgages, student loans, things that we can wrap in a CDO or leveraged buyout commitments, we wrap them, structure them and sell them off. So, on the balance is on our balance sheet is only what we need to manufacture these financial products. So, therefore it's a function of the business that they're doing and therefore the turnover is relatively high and the total balance is relatively low.</p>
          <p>Now of course, we have some monoline exposure. If you have some monoline exposure you have to ask yourself, what is the quality of the underlying assets that you have, and the quality of the underlying assets is what we look at is &#x2013; when we bring these loans on our balance sheet. So, for in order to get in our inventory they have to qualify and to have to pass an entry test, that's like putting any loan on our balance sheet. So, we are very happy with the asset quality, the underlying asset quality, so even if we would lose the protection of the monoliners, which we don't have for ourselves but for our customers, we would be happy with the quality of the underlying assets.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, but of course, we monitor that situation very closely, some of the monoliners we are concerned more than others. The ones we are really concerned may have a little while ago, overlaid it with credit default swaps so in case something happens that we have protection. And we think so, if there were a meltdown of the whole monoline sector that we would be by and large okay.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, optimizing our funding mix. You have seen us extending our maturity profile very actively the moment the liquidity squeeze started in the market. But what we did, very, very quickly is we issued more U.S. dollar long-term securities, and we got criticized here in the local press for doing that because people believed the U.S. dollar is not our home market. As a matter of fact, it is. The U.S. dollar is a very important currency for us, because most of the currencies in the world are pegged against the U.S. dollar, so it is one of our natural currencies. So, we extended that very quickly and we almost doubled our funding program.</p>
          <p>Our funding program per year is usually 23 billion long-term funding. We raised 41 billion. We also increased our deposit program, and there is &#x2013; we increased our long-term stable deposits from GTB and from our retail bank by a significant amount and are now much better-off than we were before.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, what you mentioned, the prompt brief issue, we started that very carefully, but don't forget that until this year, the German Banking Act did not allow a normal commercial bank to issue prompt brief and therefore we have to restructure our mortgages. So, our mortgages are not split in prompt brief eligible and others, so there's an amalgamated mortgage that we have to split them. It takes us some while, but with a 50 billion mortgage book that we have that's something that we're definitely going to do and that will further increase our funding. So, I think in funding terms we are very well positioned and we get the funds at actually quite attractive rates given that on the other side we can charge a high premium.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>J&#xFC;rgen, did we answer everything? Okay, may I suggest, we limit it to one or two questions everybody &#x2013; so that we can get more questions. Next one, Stefan?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Stefan Stalmann, Dresdner Kleinwort. First I want to say happy birthday &#x2013; I have two questions, I'm sorry for not looking at to you; I have to keep the mic real close. But strategically, I was wondering what's next after FAS Phase III, which officially I guess ends in 2008, and that's probably time to think about the next step strategically, which I'm sure you've done but could you share a bit what your thinking is on that?</p>
          <p>And the second question is more in terms of risk management on the LBO commitment. I was actually quite surprised that you did not disclose &#x2013; reduce the LBO pipeline more than you did. The Americans have actually reduced it, it looks like, much more aggressively and from what we hear now, the market seems to be very closed and its very difficult to make further reductions, you're essentially sitting on a pretty big LBO book, which is probably fairly clustered in its composition and you have risks that you never wanted to have in these kind of amounts. How do you manage the risk and the credit risk of that over a, let's say, 12 months period or 18 months on that book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, maybe Hugo, the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very happy with the credit quality of our LBO books. One of the principles we always follow, and was something that was quite criticized by the markets, it was that banks originate then walk away from the deal have no stake in the whole thing and therefore they don't care what they originate, they just sell it off. We never did that. We always keep 10% in everything we do. We did the CDO, there we keep less there, we keep about 5. We did have the CLOs when we issue collateralized loan obligations for our own churn and mid-cap loan book. We always keep something because the clients like it, that's for them a guarantee that we have good quality.</p>
          <p>Now that has an immediate effect. So if you keep some of the stuff on the books, even its 10%, you apply this very high underwriting standards and when you look at the way we lost league table status in the second half &#x2013; in the first half of 2007 and you find out that we lost lead table status in leverage finance and in commercial mortgages and that's because we sticked to our underwriting standards. So we feel actually quite, quite good about the loan quality and the book that we have really performs, so the underlying performance of our credit is better than what we actually expected in our plans. Having said that, the reason why we can't use serveries is because a lot of our commitments becomes due only in the first quarter of this year and the second quarter. So we had funded about 13 billion of these 36 that Tony mentioned and more. We couldn't do these, our commitments are outstanding. Then I think you shouldn't forget what Joe Ackermann said this morning, which is still true. So a third of the deals will be re-negotiated, a third may probably be cancelled and the third may be done.</p>
          <p>And we are in the middle of it, I think one thing that has really changed is that the financial sponsors start to understand that just stuffing the banks with deals and doing things regardless of market condition is not the recipe going forward because no bank does a deal any longer. And in order to open the market, they need much more or they need to provide much more cooperation in order to get things done. We had now two deals suspended, one was here today in the newspaper, he got immediately sued. But we have documentation that can support that and I'm sure we will win that that lawsuit. And another one was cancelled by a regulator, you go onto the Allianz data you're going to see more of that thing going to happen. And I think we will be &#x2013; we have no credit risk that we're worried about, hence the name that we will be able to take in case we have to keep this position will be a name without any credit losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's also &#x2013; I'll give you a hint for the 2008 &#x2013; depending on what happens with cancellations we get money back. So it's a bit difficult to say where we end up with it but &#x2013; it's not my saying but we're not certain. Well known private equity person says it's one third, one third, one third and some of the deals, the weaker deals have actually have been cancelled and we're not part of it. I think we are at least in our understanding involved in the better quality deals, which is positive from a credit point of view because I always said that one is the market risk and the pipeline risk that is &#x2013; you know, you can handle that &#x2013; if on top of that, you have down the road market risk then it hits you twice, and in our case we are pretty confident that our deals are good deals from a quality perspective.</p>
          <p>Now first of all I think that can go on for quite some time. We feel absolutely no necessity to make transforming transaction and my philosophy now at length to add, just market cap, in terms of a patchwork bank, is first of all not very intelligent, doesn't create a lot of value and thirdly it's the best invitation to be broken up. So I am against this, if it does make strategic sense just to make acquisitions is wrong and the question is do we have a strategic position in our core businesses where we are number one or at least top three or top five and investment banking we clearly are and as the management and as in wealth management we clearly are and on the replace side in those markets that we are operating, we've a strong position now would we add resources or our platform in some of these markets if we could, yes. And in Poland we have done it organically from 40 we are now at 120 branches and offices, sales offices in India and we started with eight and now 10, next move is 13 and we would like to grow faster.</p>
          <p>But even alone into '07 we have increased our client number from 160,000 to 500,000 and we got licenses for other openings now, banking facilities, which we probably will do, in China the same going to be incorporation and I think that are ways to go. I am not &#x2013; I am not a strong believer in &#x2013; certainly not in wholesale mergers, I think overlaps are too big and execution risks are too high. So in that sense we are not interested in &#x2013; some people ask this morning to buy the equity derivatives, this is certainly not our intention or to merge with Merrill Lynch or whatever, Morgan Stanley, I don't think makes a lot of sense for us. So the only thing we would be interested is to add another retail bank if some our price rise interesting that's why Deutsche bank could be an option for us, but we just continue to be disciplined.</p>
          <p>To grow organically, we have so much more potential in many markets right now and to strengthen our peak ambitions and our stable businesses and we are making tremendous focus. I mean TPB I know is not such a sexy business for many but, you know, we made about 200 million, we said we're going to push that up to a billion and we are 50 million short of that already a year before we sell it and this is a fantastic business. And it's such a stable business. And now having, which I still read &#x2013; we are more dependent on investment banking. Investment banking last year had about 4.2 billion and the stable businesses had over 3 billion. So I think it's a quite a good balance. And the stable businesses are growing steadily and very nicely. To get 59 billion in new assets, is a good base for further revenues. So, I see absolutely no necessity to do something dramatic. I am pretty sure that one day some banks are more under pressure and then we may see what we are going to do, but we have no, absolutely no need for a transforming deal. Even in terms of market cap, if you exclude the Chinese banks and the Russian banks, I think, we are now top 15 or top 17.</p>
          <p>So many famous names are now behind us, who were quite substantially ahead of us only a few weeks or months ago. Maybe it's not bad just to stay the course and to deliver what you are promising and one day you get rewarded for that, that is much more our outstanding. Stuart?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got a couple of question, please. Firstly, on the balance sheet, you're now at 2 trillion euros should we expect further growth in that, this year, and in your strategic discussions do you even focus on equity to asset ratios? Is that something you care about at all? That's the first question. And the second question is I take your point about differentiation and people should differentiate more, but certainly personally it would help me differentiate more if you actually gave us some numbers on your exposures. U.S. banks and day banks have been giving figures for monoline exposures, CMBS portfolios, subprime, Alt-A &#x2013; I think it would be very helpful even if it's all zeros it will be nice to know its all zeros, but we can see the growths and net exposures and that would help us to feel more comfortable differentiating. At least me anyway, could we have those figures please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do focus on offshore but a strict balance sheet to equity ratio. Particularly given accounting differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS is difficult and I know there are been some studies that have looked at it. IFRS, as you remember, does not afford net down possibilities. What we look at is risk. We look at funding, when we look at the balance sheet, and so RWA Tier 1 ratios, to us are a lot more important because, than strict balance sheet asset ratios. I know some of you have a different view to that, but, and we'd be happy to discuss it with you and understand your views better. But to us what's critical is how much risk you are carrying for your capital. How are you funding your balance sheet? And what kind of returns you are making on assets? So we do look at returns on RWA. We had a chart from those presentations that showed you a trend just to how that was going. As far as growth is concerned, we're looking to grow the business organically, that's going to be in more RWAs, with RWAs you are going to see balance sheet growth. How much that is? I couldn't forecast for you. We do forecast where we're going be in terms of RWA to Tier 1 ratios and our target is to maintain that ratio where we have been targeting which is remained at that stable mid-range between 8 and 9 for sometime now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second, I mean, still struggling. If you could send us list of what you really want to know, I've no problem to give you details. I thought we have done much more than most of our peers in terms of transparency. We are low, we cannot change that and very often we have short positions, that is something we don't like to do disclose so much because it's not really in our interest. But if you &#x2013; I would be interested if you could just &#x2013; one page of what you want to add to exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can add something &#x2013; well we don't want to get in this in at the end position where we have to justify our trading decisions we make. And my mono-line exposure is hedged and over hedged and if I just give you one set of numbers, you will be to the wrong conclusion. I give you the second number and the third number and at the end you actually doing my job. And I think it's &#x2013; at one point transparency has to end &#x2013; you have now seen that our disclosure actually is met by the real numbers and Tony goes through a very strict IPV process, which was an independent process verification and therefore was been confirmed. And I think we are very confident that there will not be surprise and we wouldn't say that if we're not in a good position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. For instance &#x2013; some of our US peers.  How could you publish your results two weeks before us or three weeks. We could not &#x2013; it took us more than three weeks, where we had an in depth individual price verification, with a lot of input from all over. And the answer I got was we started in mid-December. Well we started mid-December, unfortunately yearend is different story. So, we have done that very, very carefully. And you're running into huge legal issues as well. We are sales people on one side we are proprietary traders on the other side. And yes, of course, there's not always an aligned view. Some are selling products because their conventions have good products, and others are hedging this product because they have a different view. Now you can make a case of it and say you had a different view, actually internally than you had externally, no, that's not true. These are different people and we have clear asset management that's absolutely separate from our privatized management from the top trading. And I think if we start mixing the things by giving old information, we are really jeopardizing our business model, I mean not only ours but in fact the investment bank's business model and I don't think we should do that. But if there is something which would then include, if you knew it, would make you think differently about our valuation we are happy to provide that. We have absolutely nothing to hide, absolutely nothing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have two questions here on your vision in 2008. Anyway, if you stick to this 8.4 billion, it means in investment banking you are expecting more than last year. So, I cannot imagine that the stable business will have a very significant jump in 2008. You have mentioned some cost issues. But in a way, at the bottom line it means that you're expecting more profit contribution from the investment banking side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had a 2.2 billion write down in the third quarter. If we didn't have that we would be at a different level. Now the question is, I cannot convince &#x2013; not convince &#x2013; I cannot stand here and say, this is exactly going to happen. That's not my point. My point is &#x2013; and this is the guidance we are giving. We are doing &#x2013; we have not forgot this wish. We are doing everything to achieve that. We have the full commitment of the businesses behind us. And let's see whether we achieve it or not.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; let's not forget, in August some of you criticized us for not being more courageous in raising the target. And we said, no we stick to it. We were 3.9 billion, I think, after the first six months, and I always said this is exceptionally strong. I don't think that will be annualized 7.8. Then, you said we should at least take 7, I said no, we will not change it. Then, we are now at a little bit below what we said in your calculation and still ahead of what we achieved this year. But this year we had some extraordinary &#x2013; so I mean do we have a close to 200 million provision against one counterparty out of...</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>No. One provision, out of 200 that are the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you know that was a special case which I don't want to get into because its &#x2013; there is a political dimension in it and secondly we had the &#x2013; these markdowns &#x2013; substantial markdowns of over 2.2 billion. Is that going to be repeated? Now, if you think, yes, then of course the ratio will be a challenge. If it is not repeated you will see that we don't need miracles to achieve it. I can't say more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we are not run &#x2013; we are not foolishly courageous, we are trying to be realistic, at the same time we are also a little bit saying, why not take the lead and have the spirit in the bank to achieve it? And we are right now working on cost programs, on delaying expansion programs and things like that. So we take it very seriously. And I think, you know the 12% return on equity and we said 25%, I still remember how many said how stupid and na&#xEF;ve, they will never achieve it.  We are now three years in a row above that. The same in terms of our businesses.</p>
          <p>So, either you trust that we are capable of changing things and I said it many times linear extrapolation is easy. But let's not forget, there is always either a management response or a central banks approach response or a government response. If you just let the U.S. economy go, it's a different thing than having Fed cutting rates, having a stimulus package in place, and things like that.  So that is exactly the same in a bank or in any company.  You try to challenge things and you try to change things. And the question is do we think we have the platform to achieve what we are setting up? The answer is yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning everybody. I'm sorry &#x2013; I just wanted to return to the question about balance sheet exposures and write-downs. Do I understand that your gross monoline exposure has been fully hedged with credit default swaps and presumably, you're happy with the counterparty risk on the other end of that credit default swap. Would you be able to give us your remaining Alt-A and CMBS exposure on balance sheet, or are those now net short positions? And just related to this as well, I think it was reported on Reuters that you have taken maybe a 1.35 billion Euro gross charge on the structured credits so far this quarter. Is that the correct number and of course, net you told us that there is no net charge in the P&amp;L. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't know that I can confirm or deny the gross charge. But in answer to your question this morning, we don't &#x2013; the question this morning was how much were your hedge gains?  And I'd say the same with charges. We manage risks by looking at exposure, we put hedges on for the exposure to look it a gross charge on a cash position or a long position and not look at what the hedge effect is, we wouldn't have had the cash position, we wouldn't have the long position where we were, and I think the P&amp;L shows the net effects of it.  And so I don't know what confirming it or denying it is going to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I just then can confirm what I said before that we are very happy with the underlying credit quality of the assets we have wrapped through monoliners. We did that not for ourself to the largest extent, we did that for our client business.  For the counterparties that we have credit concerns, and you know yourself which counterparties these are, we have overlaid that with credit default swaps so that nothing happened.  If the whole sector were melting down it would be a manageable figure for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  And are able to tell us anything about your Alt-A and your CMBS exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the, I think we answered that question already in the third quarter.  So the pipeline that we have for CMBS is something that's a moving target and we feel very comfortable with that. I think we never disclosed that.  And the Alt-A exposure is again on a net basis down to a manageable figure.  So otherwise you would have seen us taking charges in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  It's David Williams from Fox-Pitt Kelton here.  I've got a question on your capital position.  You show in your slide presentation your Basel II going to 9.4 from 8.6. That suggests against your Tier 1 capital you're looking to have effectively 2.4 billion Euros of capital effectively freed up by Basel II from Basel I.  Two questions related to that; one is do you propose continuing the share buyback program, you do show that as a possibility on the slide in rewarding the shareholders. So I wonder if you can tell me whether you will be undertaking share buyback in 2008.  And the second question is, do you have any exposure to structured investment vehicles, or as I believe they're actually termed in your report and accounts, variable interest entities and whether you expect some of the entities which you've put into the marketplace to be coming back on to balance sheet and absorbing that spare capital.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hugo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our capital structure benefits from Basel II for by and large two big effects. The first one is an effect that most people underestimate or forgot about that's our international loan book is more or less hedged with credit default swap. And on the Basel II, you get some benefits, so whilst many other institutions with big international loan books see the capital increasing on the Basel II, ours stays flat for the international loan book.  It's very important because it's one of the drivers.</p>
          <p>The second thing is as every bank that has a big mortgage book, and don't forget that our mortgage book is above 60 billion, you get substantial benefits, and the benefits that we realize on the Basel II come from that mortgage book.  So that puts us in a better position and gives us then higher Tier 1 ratio.  And that is even before all the models have been approved, so the regulators, for them it's a real work burden and it takes some time to go through the whole process, and the total result will be even better than 9.4.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we do not intend to lock out the shareholders from participating in our results. The first step that was made by increasing the dividend.  We will definitely maintain the share buyback program and we will carefully weight that again and again in our regular Board meetings how much it shall go and how far can we invest it into growth or is it better to buy it back. So you have seen how we dealt with that question throughout the year 2007, and we should mention that we bought shares for 1.2 billion back.  So we do it as we see the business developing.  Your second question, do we have an exposure to, I can't remember what you said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Two questions.  Firstly, again on the Basel II, perhaps you could just clarify whether you're intending to cancel the shares that you've bought back this year, and also going forward whether you're intending to use your buyback as a means of returning capital to shareholders or whether it's just a mechanism to manage your share awards?  And then secondly, coming back to CMBS, you are prominent player, yet don't seem to have been affected in the slightest by the massive blowout of spreads last year.  I was just wondering if you can give us a bit more color on whether that's because you have a very small warehousing, whether it's because you've got 100% hedging on that or whether it's because you don't believe that as the spreads we see in the market indices are indicative of the quality of the loans that you're warehousing.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's relatively simple.  The portfolio of the warehouse that we have is in the overall size, not that big, even though we are big players though what we do very careful, we have a good turnaround and the key number that I study and always monitor is that our turnaround is around 90 days. So we keep nothing longer than three months. Having said that, that's under current circumstances not possible but it tells you the velocity that we can use the balance sheet four times a year.  Now having said that, because we are by and large, with the exception of our props trading where we deliberately take risks, we are a risk neutral bank and we hedge our inventories. Now we don't need to hedge our inventories one-to-one because the dynamics of the indexes and the cash underlines are different.  But so far the hedges have produced more than enough money to write down our positions as it was needed. That was true in the fourth quarter and that has been true in the first month of January too. So I look at that relatively positively.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capital, that's a technical question, what we intend to do.  So we always, when I said we let the shareholders participate in our results, so we look what is the best way, shall we cancel shares or shall we, you know, what is the purpose of canceling share when you have to re-issue it because you have a long-term incentive programs for your staff, so that really doesn't make sense.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good afternoon.  Just a few questions actually, firstly starting with commercial real estate particularly in the U.S., do you see any risk in the sector, perhaps lending to developers etcetera.  A few banks have already started taking provisions in this area.  Secondly, in terms of your Risk Weighted Assets in the Corporate and Investment Bank, I think we saw 7% sequential growth, whereas your value at risk did not go up massively, so what were the drivers behind that?  Thirdly, when do you book your fees in the leverage finance business, is it on commitment or is it on funding?  And finally, have you or do you intend to provide any disclosure on the Level 3 assets?  What percentage that is and how that moves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tony, Level 3 and I think the fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The accounting from fees on leveraged finance is we only book them at the funding time, because what we do is we fund the net, in fact with a transfer fees the net amounts.  So those are not booked at commitment, but at funding. As far as Level 3, we will be disclosing, we're still finalizing the numbers, where we are is the assets will probably end up being in the high double-digits, liabilities in the low double-digits.  It's something, again, you've got to look at very carefully because it's a mix of cash at the notional amount, a derivative at the mark-to-market amount.  What is observable and what isn't is also an open question.  The growth from the end of 2006 was principally in two areas, in the leverage finance loans we've booked and you can see on the page we've included how much those were, whether we carry them on trading or in the banking book.  We had 15 billion at the end of year.  So that gives you some indication of the next Level 3.  And the second is other cash loans in the CMBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, your question brings us back to developer loans.  We have, it's basically a business we are not doing. We have one big transaction that was in the newspaper, which we are in the middle of restructuring and there will be no loss there.  We have a very good solution and we are very confident that this can be done and the portfolio is not affected by that risk.  When we talk about Risk Weighted Asset growth in the investment bank, you shouldn't forget that our business strategy is to win more clients, to do more derivative business, so one thing that has increased when you look at the breakdown, our exposures to counterparties that the economies, the global transaction bank has increased, so that contributes.</p>
          <p>Another thing is, if you add more derivative clients then the replacement value of your derivatives goes up by the number.  And thirdly, these markets are very volatile.  We have seen a significant increase of the total mark-to-market, the net mark-to-market on our books and on the balance sheets just because of this. So it's part of our growth strategy. In addition, if you want to hedge the trading activities, you need to close your positions.  So we have a lot of government securities which we need to hold in order to eliminate the market risk that we have.  So that is shown on the balance sheet as tradable assets, but it brings or reduces your market risk down to the levels that we find acceptable. So if you take all that together, we think the growth in Risk Weighted Assets and the growth on balance sheet is something that fits nicely in our strategy and helps us to achieve our strategic goals.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Sorry I couldn't be there in person today. Could I just follow-up on Stuart's question on some of the disclosure, particularly around commercial real estate. I understand you just said that on the Maclo loan you are not expecting any loss, but could you at least confirm the size of the exposure because it sounds like it's a reasonably large concentration and the press are talking about 5.2 billion, Fortress on their loan has publicly spoken about them taking that down significantly. I'd just be interested to understand at least where the particular loan stands today.  And on CMBS, I think we understand you have roughly about 8 billion of notional outstanding whether you could at least give us some sort of sense of order of magnitude, even if it is today sort of hedged.  Also could you at least give any color, even if it's qualitative, on any potential exposure to adverse movements in the securitization of credit cards or auto loans or other consumer credit categories?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well again, it is one of our principles that we don't break down the loan book in its constituencies. We've never done that and I think that there is no reason to do it. The exposure is not that big; you cannot take one exposure and then extrapolate and say that's the whole portfolio. With respect of hedges, the hedges are large enough to produce the revenue that we need to write down the loans as we go and that should tally, and that depends on circumstances or sometimes in more volatile markets we need a little bit more hedges than in less volatile market.  So, that's the nature of the business.  So, these are decisions that we take in a very dynamic way, and we adjust the size of our hedges, but they are adequate for what it is. Adequate doesn't mean one-to-one, so there's no one in the world who hedges one-to-one.  So, that's not necessary.  I think that's all that we can say.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you.  With that I would like to end the participants from the telephone conference.  We have time for one concluding question here from the floor, if there is anybody with the one golden question at the end. If this is not the case, we really would like to thank you on behalf of the management of Deutsche Bank and the whole firm for your interest, in particular those who came here to Frankfurt to join us, and we look forward to continue the dialogue in the next days with all of you.  Thanks. Good-bye.</p>
