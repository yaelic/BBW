          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. My name is Stacy, and I will be your conference moderator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded today, February 2, 2012.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Susan Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stacy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Gilead's fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the quarter and full year 2011. This press release is available on our website, as are the slides that provide much more detail around the topics covered on today's call.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by our President and Chief Operating Officer John Milligan, who will review the key milestones and strategic initiatives from 2011, followed by our CFO, Robin Washington, who will provide additional details on our financial results and our 2012 guidance. Kevin Young, EVP of Commercial Operations, will discuss our commercial performance, and then Norbert Bischofberger, EVP of R&amp;D, will provide an R&amp;D update and key milestones. John Martin, Chairman and CEO, will close out the prepared remarks by outlining our strategic initiatives for the year ahead.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans. The statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. A description of these risks can be found on our latest out SEC disclosure document and recent press releases. In addition, please note we undertake no duty to update or revise them.</p>
          <p>We will also use non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release, as well as on our corporate website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John Milligan.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Susan. Thank you all for joining us today. Our teams' hard work over the last several years resulted in many significant financial, commercial, and R&amp;D milestones in 2011. We saw record revenues for Atripla, Truvada, AmBisome, Ranexa, Letairis, and Cayston. We also achieved record market share for our combined HIV portfolio, as well as our cardiopulmonary products. Robin and Kevin will review these outstanding financial and commercial results with you, and then Norbert will describe some of our many R&amp;D accomplishments.</p>
          <p>Single-tablet regimens are becoming the standard of care for HIV treatment. And, as you know, it is Gilead's ongoing strategy to provide HIV patients with additional options for simplified regimens. During the fourth quarter, the European Commission granted approval of the Truvada/rilpivirine single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. This product, marketed in the EU as Eviplera and as Complera in the U.S., constitutes our second single-tablet regimen and began launching in 2011 in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Austria.</p>
          <p>Regulatory submissions for approval were made in the U.S. and EU during 2011 for Quad, which, if approved, would be Gilead's third single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV infection. The NDA was filed less than six weeks after data lock. These accelerated timelines for collecting and analyzing the data and filing in both the U.S. and EU were made possible by the dedication and skill of our R&amp;D teams.</p>
          <p>Just two weeks ago, FDA approved lower-strength tablets and an oral powder formulation of Viread for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients from ages 2 to 12. We are pleased to provide this important therapeutic option for younger HIV patients and are working to make the pediatric formulations of Viread available in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
          <p>For a number of years, we've been collaborating with various organizations to explore the use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. Several studies have shown that the use of Truvada in uninfected at-risk adults can reduce HIV transmission. Based on these observations, a supplemental NDA was submitted to FDA in December for the approval of Truvada for prevention of HIV infection among uninfected high-risk adults. To get expert advice on this application, FDA has determined that an advisory committee meeting for the Antiviral division will be held in the May timeframe.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that there's room for significant innovation in the area of HIV, and during the year announced a new collaboration with Tibotec to develop the first single-tablet regimen containing a protease inhibitor. Tibotec's PI, darunavir, has now been successfully combined into a single pill with emtricitabine and our investigational agents cobicistat and GS-7340. And we anticipate clinical studies to begin later this year. In addition, a Phase 2 study was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2011 for a single-tablet regimen containing emtricitabine, elvitegravir, cobicistat, and GS-7340.</p>
          <p>Last year we entered into a licensing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, which allowed us to combine BI's patented statin compounds on non-catalytic site inhibitors for HIV with our internal research program. Integrase inhibitors working by this mechanism are not expected to be cross-resistant to elvitegravir, and we look forward to sharing with you future data on this exciting new class of HIV inhibitors.</p>
          <p>On the liver disease front, five-year data from the ongoing open-label phase of our two Phase 3 clinical studies of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B were presented at the key U.S. Liver meeting AASLD. These data show that five years of Viread treatment did not just halt further progression of fibrosis, but actually resulted in improvement of liver fibrosis in 51% of patients and regression of cirrhosis in 74%.</p>
          <p>We continue to be enthusiastic about the prospects to help people with chronic HBV by developing finite-duration treatments. With this goal in mind, an exclusive worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement with GlobeImmune was announced in October. This research is aimed at developing a therapeutic vaccine that will enhance S antigen conversions, providing a functional cure for HBV-infected individuals.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our philosophy to develop best-in-class drugs, we acquired Pharmasset in order to bring PSI-7977 to our portfolio. We anticipate that we'll be able to conduct and complete the clinical studies to allow the first approval of 7977 in combination with ribavirin by FDA during the first half of 2014. We also plan to initiate the development of alternative 7977-containing regimens, including single-tablet regimens, with other candidates in our portfolio. This strategy has the potential to benefit a large number of patients and provides the opportunity for significant revenue growth and diversification in 2014 and beyond. Gilead's liver disease team enrolled more than 1,400 HCV-infected patients in various clinical studies during 2011, demonstrating their capacity to work towards these accelerated timelines.</p>
          <p>In summary, 2011 was a very productive year for Gilead, and I'm very proud of the individual and collective efforts of all our employees.</p>
          <p>I will now to the call over to Robin to discuss in more detail our financial results. Robin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As John mentioned, we made exciting advances in our products and pipeline programs, and our continued commercial execution delivered solid financial performance in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, product sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 11% year over year. We completed the year with total product sales at the upper end of our guidance at $8.1 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year. At $8.1 billion, we now have a worldwide business that is six times the size we were in 2004, when we first launched Truvada in the United States. North America product sales for 2011 were close to $5 billion in total, and Europe approached the notable milestone of $3 billion. Gilead generated product revenues above $200 million in seven countries and today has commercial operational capabilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia with a growing presence in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore.</p>
          <p>Our fiscal year 2011 non-GAAP product gross margin decreased slightly to 74.8% from 75.8% in fiscal year 2010, primarily due to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of Atripla that is paid to our partner. This adjustment occurred late in Q4. Compared to Q4 of the prior year, the selling price adjustment had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our product gross margin.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses for 2011 were $1.1 billion, approximately $19 million above the upper end of our guidance. This was primarily due to the milestone payment associated with our accelerated registrational filings for Quad in the U.S. and Europe. In addition to the investments we made in our internal programs over the course of the year, we augmented these efforts through strategic investments in acquisitions, in licensing opportunities and collaborations, which in totality resulted in additional R&amp;D expenses for the fourth quarter and full year of approximately $60 million and $100 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses were $1.1 billion, in line with our guidance. When compared to the prior year, non-GAAP SG&amp;A increased, primarily due to expenses associated with the ongoing growth of our business, the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax expense, and bad debt provisions due to slower collections in certain Southern European countries.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flows, for the full year 2011, we generated $3.6 billion of operating cash flow, of which approximately $1 billion was generated in the fourth quarter. Our track record of generating strong operational cash flows enabled us to raise a total of $5.9 billion in debt to partially fund our acquisition of Pharmasset while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.</p>
          <p>The last financial highlight that I would like to share is our full-year 2012 guidance, which is detailed on Slide 23 in the earnings call deck, available on our corporate website. Please note that this guidance is inclusive of the Pharmasset acquisition, which closed in January. For the full year 2012, we are projecting product sales of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion, reflecting a 6% to 9% increase over 2011 product sales. This range includes the U.S. launch of Quad in the second half of 2012, the growth of Complera and Eviplera in the U.S. and Europe respectively, the continued gains from our non-HIV products, tempered by the ongoing economic uncertainties in Europe and the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, we estimate that a 10% fluctuation in rates for our hedged currencies could have a $150 million to $200 million impact on our product sales.</p>
          <p>Please note that the non-GAAP product gross margin and operating expense guidance provided to you include the impact of acquisitions, restructuring, and stock-based compensation related expenses where applicable.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the full year 2012 is expected to be in the range of 73% to 75%. We expect non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.4 billion. This range includes the full-year operating expense impact of all our recent acquisitions, including Calistoga, Arresto, Oceanside, and most recently Pharmasset.</p>
          <p>We expect non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the anticipated impact of Quad launch and a higher U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2012 is expected to be the range of 26% to 28%, due primarily to the expiration of the federal R&amp;D tax credit and the increase in the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax, which is nondeductible.</p>
          <p>As detailed on Slide 24, we are anticipating the full-year 2012 diluted EPS impact of acquisition, restructuring, and stock-based compensation related expenses to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.34 per share. And finally, we anticipate the net interest impact associated with the Pharmasset transaction to be approximately $230 million for 2012, which is detailed on Slide 25.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to share more with you regarding our 2011 commercial performance and our outlook for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. I am very proud of the many accomplishments achieved by our commercial organization in 2011, and our results in Q4 bode well for a successful 2012.</p>
          <p>Especially encouraging were the U.S. Truvada and Atripla Q4 year-on-year growth rates of 9% and 11% respectively. These results reflect the final release of 2011 ADAP federal funds and the resultant 50% reduction in patient wait lists from their peak. HIV product revenues were unaffected by large wholesale inventory levels, and non-retail purchasing was healthy yet in line with patient demand.</p>
          <p>The key patient drivers of HIV growth also looked very encouraging for Q3 2011, our latest data point. In the U.S., the moving annual total number of antiretroviral-treated patients remains strong at 9%, and the median CD4 count at treatment initiation hit an all-time high of 347. We have also been pleased with the uptake of Complera since its U.S. approval and launch in August of last year. Our goal of bringing the combination products of Truvada and rilpilvirine to market was to provide additional options to physicians and expand the total number of HIV patients receiving a single-tablet regimen. With this in mind, I'm delighted to say that since the launch of Complera, we have seen a 37% growth in the number of prescriptions for patients starting on a single-tablet regimen. We hope to reproduce this performance in Europe as we roll out Eviplera during 2012. To date, we have begun supplying Eviplera in the UK, Austria, and Germany.</p>
          <p>Over and above our exceptional performance in HIV in 2011, I'm pleased to say that we have a growing business outside our core antiviral franchise. 13% of net product revenues, or over $1 billion, came from AmBisome, Ranexa, Letairis, and Cayston in 2011. Importantly, Letairis and Ranexa had year-on-year growth rates of 22% and 33% respectively.</p>
          <p>As I think about 2012, the underlying drivers of HIV commercial growth continue to look robust. The scientific arguments in HIV to diagnose more patients and treat them earlier have never been stronger. Moreover, the reasons to be using single-tablet regimens are compelling, both medically and practically. During 2012, we will continue to roll out Complera around the world. And, subject to FDA approval, we'll bring our third single-tablet regimen to individuals in the U.S. living with HIV. We feel confident that the Quad will become an important treatment option for HIV patients initiating therapy and will ultimately be positioned as a preferred therapy in U.S. and international treatment guidelines.</p>
          <p>Like the rest of the pharmaceutical industry, we will undoubtedly continue to see some headwinds in European markets. Nevertheless, the specialist nature of Gilead products and the strength of the pharmacoeconomic arguments to treat HIV place us in a strong position for future growth. We will look for opportunities to open up new operating affiliates, as we have done successfully in recent years in Austria, Switzerland, and Poland, where we see sustainable and profitable businesses and healthcare systems that support breakthrough medicines.</p>
          <p>Finally, like the rest of my colleagues, I strongly believe that the acquisition of Pharmasset is a transformational milestone for Gilead. The worldwide potential for all-oral antiviral pan-genotypic HCV cure is sizable, with over 12 million infected individuals in commercial markets alone. We are already in high gear preparing global launch plans that will bring GS-7977 expeditiously to patients around the world. Our established relationships with the hepatologist and the gastroenterologist via Viread HBV, our knowledge of liver disease payers and policymakers, and the exciting potential of leveraging our HIV resources to expand HCV provider capacity is a galvanizing prospect, and I'm confident the Gilead commercial organization will rise to the occasion.</p>
          <p>I will now hand the call over to Norbert Bischofberger. Norbert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kevin.</p>
          <p>For HIV, in the fall of last year, we provided positive top line results for the two pivotal Phase 3 studies comparing Quad with two current standard-of-care regimens, Atripla in Study 102 and atazanavir boosted by ritonavir with Truvada in Study 103. In both cases, at 48 weeks, Quad proved to be noninferior to the standard-of-care regimens. The 90% response rate observed on the Quad arm in Study 103 is the highest response rate seen in any large blinded randomized study of HIV patients. The 48-week results for both pivotal studies were accepted for presentation at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, or CROI, taking place in Seattle March 5 through 8. Study 102 will be the subject of an oral presentation, and Study 103 of a poster. Across all our HIV programs, there will be at least 45 presentations at CROI highlighting the important role of Gilead products in the treatment of HIV infection.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., the NDA application for Quad has been accepted by FDA for standard review, with a PDUFA date of August 27. In addition, FDA indicated that a panel would be convened in the May timeframe to provide expert advice on the application. In Europe, we anticipate that EMA will complete their review by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>To further define the profile of the Quad, we have initiated three 48-week Phase 3b studies to evaluate switching of biologically suppressed patients from Atripla to Quad in one study, from Truvada plus a protease inhibitor to Quad in the other, and from raltegravir plus Truvada to Quad in the third study. We expect data from all three studies to be available by late 2013.</p>
          <p>The Quad filing will be followed by regulatory filings this year for this single agents of elvitegravir and cobicistat. The filing of &#x2013; for elvitegravir will be supported by Study 145, comparing elvitegravir to raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients. 96-week data indicating non-inferiority of the two arms were released in 2011. The cobicistat filing will be supported by Study 114, the Phase 3 study comparing cobicistat to ritonavir, both in combination with atazanavir and Truvada. We released top line results from this study, which also met its 48-week primary objective of noninferiority.</p>
          <p>Last week we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating GS-7340 for the treatment of HIV infection in treatment-naive adults. This 150-patient Phase 2 study will evaluate GS-7340 as part of a once-daily co-formulated single-tablet regimen that will also contain cobicistat, elvitegravir, and emtricitabine and will be compared to our Quad single-tablet regimen.</p>
          <p>Moving to cardiovascular, Ranexa appears unique among anti-angina agents, because in addition to reducing ischemia and angina, there's evidence that it also lowers HbA1c, the biomarker for Type II diabetes. 30% to 40% of coronary artery disease patients also have Type II diabetes. Hence, these patients could potentially derive a dual benefit from Ranexa. In order to further define this potential benefit, we've initiated a Phase 3 program that includes three studies involving approximately 400 patients each to determine the effect of Ranexa alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic therapies in lowering HbA1c and plasma glucose after 24 weeks of treatment. Confirmation of the anti-diabetic effect of ranolazine in these studies could lead to a new indication of ranolazine for the treatment of Type II diabetes.</p>
          <p>Another opportunity for Ranexa is its use in conjunction with percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI to prevent subsequent major adverse outcomes. A subgroup analysis of MERLIN, the 7,000-patient study of Ranexa in acute coronary syndrome, indicated that Ranexa treatment resulted in a reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with a history of angina undergoing PCI. A Phase 3 study has started to further define the potential benefit of Ranexa post-PCI. In this trial, 2,600 patients with a history of angina undergoing PCI with incomplete revascularization will be randomized to Ranexa or placebo with the endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events.</p>
          <p>On the Oncology front, in further strengthening of R&amp;D management, Roy Baynes has joined the Gilead team as Senior Vice President, Oncology Therapeutics. Roy joins us from Amgen, where he served as Vice President, Global Development, and Therapeutic Area Head for Hematology Oncology. Throughout his tenure there over the last decade, he <mark type="ph" /> helped (25:21) the Clinical Development and Medical Affairs teams responsible for the approval and launch of numerous hematology and oncology products. Gilead has acquired promising oncology assets over the last couple of years, and Roy's leadership will be important in bringing these novel candidates to market.</p>
          <p>GS-1101 will enter Phase 3 development this quarter, with studies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, patients are being enrolled in three Phase 2 studies of the monoclonal antibody GS-6624. These Phase 2 studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of two different doses of GS-6624 in myelofibrosis, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. The pancreatic and colorectal cancer studies are both randomized, blinded studies comparing 6624 versus placebo when added to the standard of care in second-line metastatic disease. In addition, 6624 is also being evaluated in a Phase 1b study in IPF and in a Phase 2 study for liver fibrosis in HCV-infected patients.</p>
          <p>And finally, turning to liver disease. John, Robin, and Kevin have all mentioned the important acquisition of Pharmasset. We are proceeding with the Pharmasset Phase 3 development plan for GS-7977 in Genotype 2 and 3 patients. This program consists of two studies, one in treatment-naive patients with peg interferon ribavirin as the control arm, the second in interferon-intolerant/ineligible patients with placebo as the control arm. I'm pleased to report that the treatment-naive study was initiated in mid-December, and since then we have screened 145 patients. This trial is the rate-limiting study for filing because of the 24-week duration standard-of-care arm. Due to the great interest and fast enrollment, we anticipate that these two Phase 3 studies will reach target enrollment in the United States before we will be able to activate sites in other geographies.</p>
          <p>As you know, results from the ELECTRON study were presented by Pharmasset at AASLD last October, where GS-7977 and ribavirin for 12 weeks resulted in 10 out of 10 cures in Genotype 2/3 patients. We're awaiting data from multiple studies in Genotype 1 patients, specifically from the ELECTRON study, which involved Genotype 1, both treatment-naive and nonresponders, as well as from the QUANTUM study, which involved Genotype 1 treatment-naive patients.</p>
          <p>We received news this week that our late-breaker abstract has been accepted to CROI for two cohorts of Genotype 1 HCV-infected patients from the ELECTRON study, nonresponders and treatment-naive patients. In both cohorts of that study, all patients treated with GS-7977 and ribavirin achieved undetectable viral load at four weeks on treatment, also known as rapid virological response or RVR. By the time we present those results, we will have four weeks sustained virological response data or SVR-4 from the nonresponder patients. Many of you know this, but it's important to reiterate that RVR reflects virological response on treatment. However, the important measure of response and the accepted Phase 3 endpoint is SVR-12, which is sustained virological response 12 weeks after end of treatment. SVR-4 data are a reasonable proxy for SVR-12, as most patients that rebound after treatment discontinuation do so in the first four weeks.</p>
          <p>We also anticipate that we will have a significant presence at the European liver conference taking place in Barcelona in April, with over 17 submitted abstracts from our HCV efforts alone. As Gilead has pioneered in HIV, we expect to bring forward next-generation, single-tablet regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C also. To that end, drug interactions will be carried out with 7977 and GS-5885 and other internal candidates, which will be followed by Phase 2 clinical studies.</p>
          <p>In closing, the investments we're making today, both in our broad and promising &#x2013; in our broad and promising internal R&amp;D efforts we have embarked upon, will continue to drive the success of our business in the future.</p>
          <p>I will now turn over the call to John Martin. John?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Norbert. As you have heard, we met a number of important milestones in 2011 that were achieved as a result of all the hard work of Gilead employees over the last several years. This momentum is continuing into 2012. For HIV, we will continue to benefit from the evolution of the U.S., European, and international guidelines that support earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as the growing appreciation for the benefits provided by single-tablet regimens.</p>
          <p>In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested HIV testing as part of routine medical care in order to decrease the incidence of new infections. This benefit has now been quantified in study HPTN 052, demonstrating that HIV treatment results in 96% reduction of HIV transmissions in sero-discordant couples. The publication of this work in The New England Journal of Medicine was recognized in December as the Breakthrough of the Year by Science Magazine. The high efficacy demonstrated in HPTN 052 has ended the debate on the value of treatment as a prevention.</p>
          <p>In summary, we look forward to adding to the strength of our HIV business with our growing pipeline in cardiopulmonary, oncology, and liver disease. As we enter our 25th year, I believe that the health of our company has never been stronger, with prospects for exceptional growth for many years to come.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Financial one and then a clinical one. So for your 2012 guidance, can you let us know if you assume top line or margin impact from the Quad launch and then your currency assumptions in 2012 guidance. And then for Norbert, just a question here on strategy in Genotype 1 &#x2013; and congrats on the data that you told us today. But what changes would you guys make in Genotype 1 to the original Pharmasset strategy, registration strategy? Would you increase the number of patients? Would you increase or change the comparator group? Just to help us out with that. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Geoff. So it's Robin. I'll answer the financial part of your questions. Yes, we did include the Quad launch, as well as the continued tick up of Complera from a product gross margin in our overall guidance. And from an operating margin standpoint, some of that is tempered by the R&amp;D investments that we're making associated with Pharmasset and the rest of our therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>You also asked about currency. As I mentioned in the guidance section, the FX assumption is included in that plus or minus 10%. We believe that our current revenue base is about $150 million to $200 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Geoff, on the clinical side, of course, we've been thinking about a whole different number of scenarios, and many of these depend on what the emerging data look like. And that will all become much clearer in the next month or two or three.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is we still have to have conversations with regulatory authorities. But something I can tell you we've been thinking about is to further accelerate the program. It's entirely conceivable that you would &#x2013; actually the studies that will get to approval would be two or three placebo-controlled studies. So you take the placebo-controlled study in Genotype 2/3 that Pharmasset has announced already at AASLD, and you add to that one or two placebo-controlled studies in Genotype 1 with 7977 and ribavirin, that would probably be an attractive thing for us to do. But again, of course, it depends on the data in the Genotype 1 patients and secondly whether regulatory authorities would agree to that. And both of those things are being discussed internally, and we have meetings scheduled with regulatory authorities to discuss this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I'm going to ask one really boring gross margin question and then one on the HIV franchise. On the gross margins, if my math is right, it looks like you guys are actually guiding to &#x2013; I think your non-GAAP gross margin in 2011 was about 74.5%. Your guidance is 73% to 75% for 2012, but Complera is obviously a higher-margin product, and Atripla is a higher-margin product. So can you help me understand why there wouldn't be more gross margin expansion? And then Merck today on their call said that Isentress has 14% patient share, but when asked about the impact of the Quad, they seemed to minimize it because they said that the booster would keep people away from the Quad. Do you think you can take the 14% patient share away from Merck as low-hanging fruit in the refractory setting? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Mark, I'll take the first part. So the margin, to your point, is higher for Complera, but Complera and the launch of the Quad &#x2013; which wouldn't happen 'til the second half of 2012 &#x2013; are still relatively small relative to Atripla. So while we see some overall uptick because the variation in the mix of the single-tablet regimen doesn't start to make a huge difference until the out-years as the Quad upticks and Complera upticks, and you'll see more of that in 2013 and 2014.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Mark, it's Kevin on HIV. We think we've got a very attractive potential for Quad. The results that were referred to by Norbert, I can tell you the awareness of Quad is incredibly high, particularly in the U.S., where we did the majority of our 102 and 103 studies. And I just think there is such a high and growing demand now for single-tablet regimens. On Slide 36, we begged a snapshot of Synovate Q4; the Ipsop (sic) [Ipsos] (38:01) healthcare database is actually Synovate. They were bought out. And so we begged to have a very early look, particularly for Complera. What you can see already, just in the first quarter, our Gilead single-tablet regimen share has gone up to almost 60% in the naive patients, and I think that shows you the preference for single tablets. So I think having our Quad on the market will only help that.</p>
          <p>I do want to point out that of course our label will be in the naive-treatment setting, as opposed to treatment-experienced patients, for the Quad. But nevertheless, I think the Quad is, in my mind, going to do very, very well in HIV.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Norbert, I just wanted to follow up on the comments you made with regards to the ELECTRON data at CROI. Is that 10-patient data sufficient to discuss the Phase 3 design with regulators? Or do you need additional data beyond that? I assume you do. And just as a corollary on the R&amp;D budget, just want to get a better sense for this. You have lots of, I assume, increased HCV expenses. Are you assuming any discontinuation from other kind of pipeline studies? Or is that something that could impact R&amp;D numbers later after you do a portfolio review? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rachel, so I'll answer the first question. So the data we will have by CROI or will be presenting at CROI is enough to schedule the meeting with the FDA. So that's the data that will get us in then to get the meeting date. And when the meeting is actually scheduled, which is typically three, four weeks later, then we'll have more data, and that will absolutely suffice to discuss the strategy that we're going to pursue in Phase 3 in Genotype 1 patients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Rachel, it's Robin. Relative to our R&amp;D guidance, this is a year of investment for us. To your point, there are incremental investments in liver disease. There will be some rationalization of the portfolio. But again, given the transaction closed less than a month ago, we're still going through that process. That's basically taken our liver disease program and their program, and we'll do some rationalization, but that won't have an impact until the latter half of the year. There's also the ongoing investment in oncology and inflammation, and you have to keep in mind that our study progressions, we have a lot more Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials versus prior years, so not only in 2012 but also in 2013, you'll see R&amp;D expenses a bit higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rachel, maybe to follow up on that, we started a large number of Phase 2 studies last year that looked at relevant questions then. They are not as relevant anymore now. So we will, of course, discontinue those studies, but it takes a while to close them out. So as Robin said, the real benefit of closing them out will not be seen in the first half of this year, more be &#x2013; later.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question. Also a follow-up on hepatitis C. Nice to hear that you're going to have the SVR-4 data from ELECTRON at CROI. Should we presume that we're going to see SVR-12 data at another medical meeting later this year, perhaps at EASL? And similarly, are we going to see QUANTUM data presented at EASL, or is that simply a top line press release? Secondly, just on the financial guidance here, you referred to economic uncertainties in Europe as one of the factors you considered in product sales guidance here. So can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of budgetary constraints to access, pricing, receivables, so that we can sort of reflect that in our models as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matt, I'll answer your first question. It is our intent that as these data mature, that we will make them public and communicate them, because we have to do that. We also owe it to the investigators and the patients that they know and it helps enrollment in our clinical studies. But we have not made a decision yet what exactly we're going to present at what meeting. It depends on really how the data evolve and what are we going to have at what point in time when the abstract deadline is due. So we'll decide that on more short notice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Matt, just for further clarity on Europe, right? We mentioned just the ongoing uncertainties. There is an assumption of about a 2% to 3% impact from overall price reductions, which is mostly just part of the ongoing process that happens over there, and there was a small amount of incremental austerity measures in the latter half of 2011, where we'll see the full-year impact.</p>
          <p>Relative to collections, we continue to build up our reserves. That wouldn't impact revenue, but we baked an increase in bad debt associated with Southern Europe into our SG&amp;A guidance as well. But primarily it's going to continue to deteriorate. A lot could happen, as well as could happen relative to the valuation of the euro. So we've factored that in also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Great. Thanks so much. So, Norbert, just for you &#x2013; two questions. One, I mean, the data is looking like it's going to be very good from ELECTRON, both in nulls and in experienced. So what are your, I'm sorry &#x2013; naives. Does that mean that you would consider doing one &#x2013; you said maybe one to two studies. Are we talking about maybe a combination, naives and nulls? Or would you actually potentially split it up to a naive and a null study separately? And then if you don't mind just secondly, just on Genotype 2/3, I mean, congrats. I mean, it looks like the U.S. sites are going to enroll the patients. Would you consider doing a study for the rest of the world then for Genotype 2/3 as well? Or is that going to be sufficient for global registration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Yaron. So three comments, three answers to your questions. So first of all, and I would like to remind you again &#x2013; I know you know this, but the RVR data is necessary but not sufficient. I'm going to remind you in the ELECTRON Genotype 2/3, they had 100% RVR rates with 7977 by itself, but only 60% SVR rates. So we really have to wait for the SVR data; that's the meaningful thing.</p>
          <p>Then the other thing, we're just thinking about &#x2013; I mean, this is all a dialogue internally. We could do a study in naive patients in Phase 3 in Genotype 1 and another study in previous treatment failures or rebounders or nonresponders; that will be treatment naive and treatment experienced.</p>
          <p>And then the other question you asked &#x2013; yes, absolutely, we are acutely aware of the fact that we have to do studies in other geographies. It's just the fact that these studies are going to enroll very, very quickly, and they will be enrolled way before we have the first site up and running. But what we are thinking about is doing &#x2013; for instance, there's a lot of special population studies that we want to do in parallel. And those are for instance transplant, HIV co-infection, cirrhotics, boceprevir/telaprevir failures. Those are just four examples, and those we would look to focus more on outside the United States to give people, particularly in Europe, experience with the drug and some comfort to use it so that they're comfortable once it gets approved.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But it's not needed for registration. So we can absolutely register the drug in the U.S. and probably also in Europe. We still have to have that conversation with European regulatory agencies with the U.S. studies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two quick questions. One is do you have any end-of-treatment data or SVR-12 individual data for patients that we may expect at CROI? Are we going to see it all together? And the second question is just what you do with the rest of your HCV portfolio if 7977's data really does live up to this potential at maturity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Sapna. So the end-of-treatment data we have now, and they were included at the abstract, so these are the RVR data. But we don't have any SVR data yet, and those will be presented at CROI, and it will be SVR-4s. That's all we're going to have. But as I said in my script, SVR-4s are a reasonable proxy for SVR-12, because they have been at least qualitatively very predictive.</p>
          <p>And secondly, what are we going to do with the rest of our HCV portfolio? Well, 7977 and ribavirin is not going to be our last drug that we're going to get approved in hepatitis C, but we're really aiming for a pangenotypic single tablet oral once-daily regimen. And that, I think, is much closer than we thought a year ago. And we have all the compounds internally in place so we can pursue that. The first one will obviously be 5885 or 7977. That will probably be Genotype 1 specific. But we have other things coming behind it that have pangenotypic potential.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Another question on 7977 along those same lines, kind of a commercial question. What's your sense to the SVR rate relative to the current standard of care that you think would support a go-forward path for 7977 plus riba in the broadest Genotype 1 population? And if you did opt to conduct a pivotal study with 7977 plus 5885 in this broader population, what would be some of the rate-limiting steps to getting to the point of running a pivotal study? And how far behind would that be versus the Genotype 2/3 program? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, I would like to &#x2013; if Kevin wants to join in, please do. So, Brian, you said what kind of SVR rates do we need to consider a broad Genotype 1 development programs. I want to remind you, there are a lot of people that are interferon-ineligible/intolerant, and so even with a not-optimal SVR rate, this would absolutely be a very successful product, because &#x2013; let's just pick something &#x2013; 30% SVRs. If there is no downside, you try it for three months and afterwards you may have a 30% chance of being cured. That's a huge step forward from where we are today, so that's how we're thinking about it. And the other question you had &#x2013; can't remember now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, what's the rate-limiting step? So we are currently pursuing a drug interaction study, 7977/5885. That would then be followed by a fairly small Phase 2 study to simply show that you can use together &#x2013; the two together that you get reasonable SVR rates, and that would then lead to a Phase 3 study. And it's probably about six months to eight months behind the 7977 by itself.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess some expense questions. You talked about SG&amp;A being up in 2012. Maybe you can give us a little sense of what's behind that? Is HCV the key driver? Maybe what programs or in education might you be adding ahead of going into hep C? And then second, maybe a little bit more color on the R&amp;D spend. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Robyn. It's Robin. On the SG&amp;A side, there is a small uptake, and I'll let Kevin go in a little bit more detail as we prepare for the Quad launch. But the biggest impact on SG&amp;A is the excise tax. So in 2012, we guided to about $50 million, and that's pretty much where it came in. But going forward in &#x2013; I'm sorry, for 2011. But in 2012, we expect it to be in a range of $80 million to $100 million, and that's really driven by about three factors. One is just our overall growth &#x2013; our overall revenue growth in the government sector. Also the denominator in the calculation is getting smaller as a result of a decline in the overall pool of pharmaceutical sales using the calculation as more products go generic. And then the overall fee is increasing, so Gilead's getting a bigger component of that tax. It's a fairly significant increase. So that's one of the primary drivers.</p>
          <p>But I'll turn it over to Kevin to talk about the Quad investment that we're making.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robin, it really isn't HCV. HCV is mostly, in 2012, around market assessment and building our launch plans. We are increasing our investments in HIV for the U.S. for the Quad. Again, that will be very efficient. We do have a plan, I think, for a high-impact launch, and we're certainly not going to leave anything on the table when it comes to the launch of the Quad. I should also add that we're very carefully establishing our Asian organization. We hope by the middle of 2012 that we'll have the pricing approval for Viread for HBV in Korea, and Korea is a very substantial market for hepatitis B, and Tekavir is actually the biggest product of any pharmaceutical in the Korean market, and we'd like to be successful there. So we're being selective and we're being very focused, but we think they're good investments to make around the world.</p>

          <p>And Robyn, relative to the color around R&amp;D expense. As I mentioned earlier, Pharmasset is a component of it. We've pretty much taken their budget. The investment in oncology and in inflammation is also increasing. And as also mentioned, it's really a function of more Phase 2 and 3, as we continue to progress our overall pipeline, that's driving the increased R&amp;D spend.</p>

I was hoping you could maybe take a shot, Norbert, at the &#x2013; on the hepatitis C side. I think you've given us some framework for the Genotype 2/3. Can you just comment further on Genotype 1 beyond the ribavirin combo and also the 5855 (sic) [5885] (54:36)?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ian, certainly. I'm actually just looking at Slide 7. I don't think I've ever -- so you want more color on which one?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, so Genotype 2/3, Ian, as we said, it's kind of on its merry way. So the first study is enrolling. And as I said, I think, in my conference call, the study was started on December 19, and really not much happened in December because of the holidays. But nevertheless we've screened, as of this morning, 145 patients. That's pretty remarkable. And that's the less-attractive study of the two. We're actually intentionally waiting with the second study so the first gets a little bit underway. So the study will enroll very quickly. It's a six-month total study duration, three-month treatment, three-month follow-up. We will be able to assemble and analyze the data fairly quickly and then submit it to the FDA, and then you can kind of do the math. It's going to be a very accelerated timeframe.</p>
          <p>In Genotype 1, if the data look good, we will initiate that at the same time the second Genotype 2/3 study gets up and rolling. And Genotype 1 will be even faster, because there are more patients around. So I think it's just going to be a very rapid development.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are doing a drug interaction. We'll do a Phase 2, a small Phase 2 study, similar to what, 12-week, 7977, 5885 plus/minus ribavirin, something of that sort. And once we have SVR-4 data, I will feel comfortable making a decision to go to Phase 3 with SVR-12 data emerging during that process. So we're thinking it would be maybe six to eight months behind the 797 (sic) [7977] (56:53) ribavirin program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. A couple quick questions. One, Norbert, you mentioned the 7977 monotherapy arm and the fact that there was four patients who relapsed in that arm at four weeks. Could you tell us, now that you've got 12-week follow-up, how that looked? And then just, Robin, could you give us a sense of where we should be thinking about share count going by the end of the year, given all the capital use that you'll have during the year? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, so the ELECTRON, the arm with 7977 by itself still looks the same. This is not data we have disclosed, but that's one reason why we feel SVR-4 is a pretty good proxy for SVR-12.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And, Geoff, relative to your share count, as we talked about with the acquisition, we did moderate and pretty much suspend our share repurchases after October of 2011. We will do moderate share repurchases in the near term to offset option dilution primarily, but our real focus of cash in the near term is going to be on debt repayment, which we expect to be back at our target debt-to-EBITDA by mid-2013. So to your question on share count, I mean, we don't expect it necessarily to go down significantly. But we're just going to try to manage the current balance as much as we can.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had a question on 7977 in HBV. So I guess especially now that you've seen 100% RVR rates in Genotype 1, we've seen some of what Pharmasset's valuation assumptions were in their regulatory filings, what perspective can you share with us, or what details are you willing to disclose, on the ways in which your own valuation assumptions were similar or different from Pharmasset's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess there's a combined question in there, Thomas. It's John Milligan. So a couple things. Changing a valuation at this point in time wouldn't be prudent because of course we don't know what the SVR rates are for Genotype 1 or null responders. And also I think the only thing I can say with regard to our valuation process is that was very different than the Pharmasset valuation in terms of how they saw the patient flows and the time of the patients. So we think it'll be a longer timeframe to capture patients than Pharmasset had suggested in their disclosure. Also I would say that we think there's a lot of patients that can be captured both in the United States, Europe, and other territories, which could provide for very long and sustained revenue and cash flow stream for Gilead. But we haven't put out anything more than that, so that's as much as I can say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. You've talked a lot about different combination and a lot of different studies on Slide 47 and 48. I guess I was wondering, when you think about long term, maybe even for 7977's launch, have you thought about studies with shorter duration regimens or ribavirin-sparing regimens? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, Michael, absolutely. We have not only thought about it, but some of these cohorts are already ongoing to look at even shorter duration than 12 weeks to see what the response rates are there and to also look at other combinations. I want to remind you, we have two important studies ongoing. One with BMS in combination with their NS5A inhibitor with or without ribavirin, and one with Tibotec with TMC435. Both of those look at combinations of 7977 with other agents and would provide important information about how to use the drug optimally.</p>
          <p>And by the way, both of those studies &#x2013; the BMS study <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:14) also explores ribavirin sparing, because the arms are 7977 plus the BMS NS5A plus or minus ribavirin, so it has both two drugs and three drugs in the regimen.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A question for Kevin. Kevin, could you give us any color on the proportion of treatment-naive patients versus treated patients for Complera and how that's changed over these very early phases of launch? And a second part to that question, you cited that the protease inhibitor &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; the PI study is due, the 420-patient study is due to report out in Q2. How quickly can you get that into the label?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ravi. Thanks for a little bit of love for commercial here. I knew I could count on you. Yeah, certainly can give you a little bit, and obviously it's only four months of data. So it's really very, very early for Complera. If you break down where the patients are coming from for Complera, about 30% are naive and about 70% are switch. And of the switch, about a third were switches from a Atripla and two-thirds were switches from other regimens. And I think you can see that sort of borne out a little bit in the slide I referred to earlier, which is that very nice early snapshot of Q4, because you can see that actually Truvada has dropped down a little where you see Complera coming in. But obviously when you total both Atripla and Complera, you get up to that 59%. So a little bit of the trade-off has obviously been Truvada plus something else, but we're okay with that because we want to have patients onto the single-tablet regimens.</p>
          <p>In terms of the inclusion of the data, Norbert, how long would it be typically for us to look for some sort of label change if we submitted data?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If the study is fully enrolled, I don't have the last patient, last visit here, but normally what we would &#x2013; internally, we look at three to six months to collect, analyze, write up the data, submit them, and this will probably be a six-month review efficacy supplement. So you're looking at maybe a year after completion of the 48-week endpoint.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Norbert, back to you. I was just wondering if you could put a finer point on a couple things you said. So first, on the FISSION trial, it sounds like in a month you've enrolled maybe a little bit less than a third of that study. If I assume that that enrollment's going to actually increase with time, that means that trial could actually be enrolled by the end of this quarter. It's a 36-week study, so is it reasonable to expect data from that possibly year-end this year or very early in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so if your calculation is correct, then yes, it's reasonable to expect that. The other &#x2013; I just want point out two things. Actually, we haven't enrolled 145; we've screened 145. There will be a certain screen failure rate, although we don't expect that to be high. The other thing is also there aren't a lot of the sites up and running yet. We were thinking about having a large number of sites. With only 19 sites open in this short period of time, we have 145 screened. So enrollment will be very quick. I do not really want to predict how quick, but soon &#x2013; six months afterwards &#x2013; nine months afterwards, is the end of the study. Remember, the control arm is peg riba 24 weeks. So it's a nine-month observation period, and after that, yeah, you could submit certainly an abstract to a meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second, on your comments on starting the Genotype 1 trial and the answer to two separate questions. At one point you said even like a 30% SVR would be perhaps meaningful for patients, and then in answer to another question you said if the data looked good, we're going to start that Genotype 1 study at the about the same time as POSITRON. Can we take from that basically if there's any SVRs that come out of ELECTRON and QUANTUM in Genotype 1 patients, the Genotype 1 study is going to start? It sounds like the bar to starting that Genotype 1 trial is actually quite low. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at one point, of course, if you get to very low numbers, you kind of &#x2013; then we wouldn't be doing it because we don't need to go there. We have 5885 and 7977 that's about six months afterwards, and that &#x2013; if 7977 and ribavirin is not enough in Genotype 1 by itself, then adding 5885 will certainly greatly increase those response rates. And we then just have to gauge what is the loss in time and the risk and the expenses associated with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us some idea of what the bar is? Is it 30%, 50%, 80%? Like, what would be the go/no go point in your mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. You know, we really don't see it that way that we say below 30% we don't do it, above 30% we do, or 50% we do. We have to really look at the totality of the data. Another thing, of course, is also you have to look at resistance. Those that don't respond, rebounders or nonresponders, if there are any &#x2013; well, there aren't any right now, but if there were, did those people develop resistance? And if the answer is no, then you could say there is really no downside to treating somebody. The only downside practically is cost. It's safe, well-tolerated, it's only for three months, it's oral, it's convenient, and why if you have a 30% response rate, it seems to me, why wouldn't a patient accept that as a reasonable alternative to what's currently available?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the data and a good quarter. Just real quick, a couple questions. The first one, on Slide 45 on the ELECTRON cohorts, you have all of the cohorts listed as having an n of 10, but on the last Pharmasset slide set and Dr. Gane's ELECTRON presentation, there were 25 patients supposed to be enrolled in the treatment-naive cohort and the 2/3 experienced cohort. Has this protocol changed?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually, Brian, that &#x2013; I'm just seeing the slide right now. That is not correct. There are two &#x2013; those two cohorts have 25 patients target enrollment. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then the second question is, just moving on to the Quad, I wonder if you guys have any thoughts on the ad comm? I mean, it just seems that the FDA has less frequently used advisory committees where there wasn't really controversy around whether or not to approve. I just wonder, has the FDA communicated any rationale for why they're going to have an ad comm for the Quad specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely, Brian. We actually had a conversation with them when they informed us of their intent to do an ad comm. We said, why do we need one? And they referred us to a guidance document that's available on the FDA website, and it clearly says, if the advisory committee meetings can be convened or should be convened if it's a first-in-class molecule. And the FDA felt fairly strongly that cobicistat in particular was something that's first in class, one of its kind, and that's why they wanted to do it. But they also communicated to us that there's no safety or efficacy concern with the Quad that would make them feel like they need an advisory committee. So it's more of a policy thing that has to do with first-in-class, one-of-its-kind molecules, and cobicistat is the one that's in the Quad.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, guys. A couple of maintenance questions. Just on the R&amp;D spend, it seems like we get a spike every fourth quarter, at least for the last couple of years. Can you remind us why that is? And should we expect the same distribution in 2012? And then just on the Quad, as it's part of your guidance, are you assuming a similar launch trajectory as what we've seen for Complera? And would something better than that be upside to guidance? Or &#x2013; I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about Quad out of the gate compared to what we've seen from Complera? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim. It's Kevin. I'll take the second part first in terms of the kind of possible uptake of Quad. Just to step back, if you think about Complera, Complera was never going to be Atripla. There just were no existing patients. There was no conversion market like we had with Atripla. Atripla had 80,000 patients on the components when we came out the gates, and obviously, that gave it an incredible ramp up. We never had that, never said we would have that with Complera. So in some ways, Complera is almost like a third agent launch, and that's why on Slide 35, I referred to our volume being above Prezista as a sort of a third agent comparator, which we're pretty pleased with.</p>
          <p>I think at this stage, I would probably peg the launch of the Quad somewhere between an Atripla and a Complera. As I said earlier, there's a high expectation for Quad, very high knowledge of it, and a very strong investigator base. So we believe that there is a high expectation. And I think we believe that we would get a preferred listing, a preferred ranking for Quad based on 102 and 103 data. We never expected to be a preferred regimen in treatment guidelines with Complera, but we are hopeful that that would happen fairly quickly with Quad, and obviously that's a big market driver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jim, to the first part of your question, the spikes that you referred to are really just driven by milestone payments, or in the case of 2011, was primarily related to some of the M&amp;A and the collaboration activity that we did in Q4. It was the tune of $60 million, is what I called out in our script. And that included the Boehringer Ingelheim agreement as well as GlobeImmune, and then the other piece related to the timing of the Quad filing. So again, that's what the driver was. Those aren't always predictable when you think about 2012, and the way we plan it is it's pretty much straight line. But those milestones can occur from time to time.</p>

          <p>Yeah, so, Mark, to be clear, the abstract was submitted with all available RVR data, which comes from both cohorts, the treatment-naive and nonresponders from ELECTRON. But at the time of the CROI presentation, we will only have the SVR-4 data on the nonresponders. That's a total of 10. There won't be any other SVR data. We just &#x2013; those patients just aren't as far along at that point in time. So that's what we're going to have.</p>
