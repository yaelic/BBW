        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. Following my remarks, Larry Stone will review our operational performance, and then Bob Hull will review our financial results.</p>
          <p>As expected, home improvement spending remained weak in the quarter. But even in this weak environment, we were disappointed with the magnitude of erosion in our comp sales performance from the first quarter. We expected challenging economic conditions, but wavering levels of consumer confidence, unseasonable weather in many areas, and tougher than anticipated comparisons to last year's stimulus related spending led to lower sales than we expected. We continued to see relative strength in outdoor products in the quarter, but that was more than offset by pronounced weakness in larger ticket discretionary projects.</p>
          <p>The decline in average ticket was the largest driver of our negative comp and was down 8.6% in the quarter. Our comp for tickets greater than $500 was negative 16%. For $500-plus tickets, in Q2 we were lapping the toughest comparison to last year's stimulus aided comp sales. However, in recent weeks some categories have experienced an increase in detail fees, the small fee we charge to take in-home measurements that is the first step in the installation process, which should lead to improved trends in many of our installed sales categories.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, consumer research suggests that in this uncertain economic environment, consumers are only taking on home improvement projects that they feel are absolutely necessary and are postponing discretionary projects until clarity about the future returns. In fact, 40% of consumers say they have a major home improvement project they're postponing because they're waiting for their confidence about the future to improve.</p>
          <p>On the flip side, we saw better performance from the transaction side of comp, with only a 0.9% decline in customer count. Our comp for tickets less than $50 was slightly positive in the quarter. I feel the relative stability of traffic indicates our stores were ready for the late spring season, successfully transitioned into summer categories, and provided great service to customers. Evidence of this is found in our continued market share gains. In the second quarter, we added 70 basis points of total store unit market share according to third-party estimates. I'd like to thank our more than 228,000 employees whose customer focus and hard work made those gains possible.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, I think our store employees and merchants did a great job getting ready for spring and preparing for the continued outperformance of our outdoor categories. We had positive comps in our nursery category and above average comps in lawn and landscape and outdoor power equipment. Being ready to serve customers with the right product and great service helped drive outdoor product related comps nearly 500 basis points higher than indoor products.</p>
          <p>Also, I mentioned last quarter a growing trend of a return to DIY. We continued to see evidence of that trend in the second quarter with strong performance in key DIY categories like paint, hardware, and rough plumbing; and also in products like mower repair parts, grill repair parts, and gardening supplies. As the return to DIY leads to more frequent trips to our stores, we have an opportunity to capture additional traffic item sales like HVAC filters and bird seed as well as items like trash bags and cleaning chemicals. We saw positive mid-single digit comps in cleaning chemicals and bird seed and above average comps in HVAC filters in the quarter, which I believe is evidence of the foot traffic generated by the shift to DIY.</p>
          <p>Despite the weak demand environment, our entire organization worked to maintain gross margin by moving products more efficiently, minimizing the impact of markdowns, and reducing shrink. Combined with a favorable product mix and a rational competitive environment, these efforts led to a 50 basis point increase in gross margin, better than our expectations when we began the quarter.</p>
          <p>Expenses were also managed well, especially payroll, during what has now been 12 consecutive quarters of negative comps. While payroll did deleverage, I believe we maintained an appropriate balance between cost control and service in our stores.</p>
          <p>Our efforts to maintain gross margin and control expenses allowed us to deliver earnings per share of $0.51, in line with our guidance despite the weaker than expected sales results, and also after taking into account a $48 million pre-tax charge primarily related to our new store pipeline evaluation.</p>
          <p>In the end, I don't think our comp erosion from first quarter represented a significant shift in the consumer. Home improvement consumers have been and remain reluctant to spend on much beyond the necessities. Our research suggests that the number of projects the average home improvement consumer plans to take on in the coming year has dropped only slightly from a few years ago, but the expected spend on those projects has declined substantially.</p>
          <p>But in addition to an obviously cautious home improvement consumer, with hindsight I think the erosion in comp performance from first to second quarters had a lot to do with cycling last year's stimulus checks and relatively little positive offset to date from this year's stimulus package. That is supported by the fact that we saw progressively improving comp sales through the month of July and continued better performance into the first two weeks of the third quarter as the comparisons to last year's stimulus ease.</p>
          <p>Significant headwinds remain, including the pressures of the economic backdrop and cycling last year's hurricane spending along the Gulf Coast. But there are also encouraging signs that a bottoming process is underway. We're maintaining what we feel is an appropriately cautious sales outlook and are building our plans accordingly. But as the second quarter results show, we feel we have the flexibility to appropriately adjust to either a weaker or stronger than expected sales environment while continuing to deliver great service to customers and reasonable profit for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for your interest, and now I'll turn it over to Larry Stone to provide more details on the quarter. Larry?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Robert, and good morning. Today I will share some details of the quarter and what we're doing to manage the business in this challenging sales environment. The current economic conditions continue to weigh on consumers and pressure our sales. Reflective of these pressures is our negative 9.5% comp for the quarter, driven by consumers' hesitancy to take on big ticket discretionary projects, which led to an 8.6% decrease in comp average ticket.</p>
          <p>Comp traffic continues to show signs of stabilization as our comp customer count was down only slightly for the quarter. The sequential improvement in first quarter this year did not continue into the second quarter. Last quarter, 19 of our 23 US regions achieved better comps sequentially. This quarter only six regions had sequentially better comps with some of the biggest quarter-to-quarter declines in our core markets where we have the highest concentration of stores, including the Southeast and the Ohio Valley.</p>
          <p>Although second quarter comps were weak, three of our four Western regions and three regions in the Northeast improved sequentially. Macro pressures remain broad based, leading to 12 of our 23 regions experiencing double digit negative comps for the quarter. In our Western division, comps improved quarter to quarter, but they are still double digit negative. While positive housing turnover is an encouraging sign, home prices are still declining and consumer confidence remains weak. We're watching foreclosure data in key housing markets and we're working to build relationships with commercial business customers to capitalize on opportunities as these markets move towards home price stabilization.</p>
          <p>Additionally, parts of the Southeast division had double digit negative comps, driven to some degree by the stimulus spending on home improvement last year when these markets had more stable housing pricing, also where our sales in parts of the Northeast were impacted by the unseasonably cool wet weather.</p>
          <p>On the product side, as we examined our sales, it was clear that small projects, maintenance and repair products, and outdoor products experienced the best performance. Only two of our 20 product categories, nursery and paint, achieved positive comps for the quarter. Sales in these categories, the two most popular DIY projects, were driven by consumers' willingness to complete small projects and enhance the appearance of their home and outdoor space. Home and landscape products including mulches, soil, seed, and patio block continued to perform better than the company average as consumers continue to do outdoor projects to improve the appearance of their homes.</p>
          <p>As more consumers tackle basic repair and maintenance projects, we experienced relatively solid demand in faucet repair and repair parts for outdoor power equipment. In fact for the quarter, we had double digit positive comps in OPE repair parts. Also, we continued to see positive comps in tillers as consumers continue to plant gardens in many of our markets.</p>
          <p>Selling to the DIY customer has always been a priority of Lowe's. And with the resurgence of DIY, many customers may be tackling their first home improvement project in a while, and many are looking to Lowe's not only for home improvement products, but for how-to information to successfully complete their projects.</p>
          <p>And similar research tells us that interior painting is one of the top home improvement projects that will be planned and completed within the next 12 months. Painting is one of the easier DIY projects; but like most projects, having the right tools plus the confidence you're doing it right will go a long way in customer satisfaction. That is why we are focused on spending more time with these customers providing them with project information and tips that make their project easier to do.</p>
          <p>With this resurgence in mind, we've tweaked our staffing model to ensure departments that feature more project basics like paint, rough plumbing, rough electrical, and hardware remain appropriately staffed. This is just another example of how we continue to maximize every sales opportunity.</p>
          <p>Consumers continue to postpone discretionary projects, which are a primary driver for special order sales. Soft project sales led to a negative 23% comp for the quarter with the most pronounced weakness in special order cabinets and countertops, fashion plumbing, and flooring. Special order flooring was negatively impacted from cycling an aggressive promotion last year for installed carpet as well as a consumer shift to our improved and extended offering of stock carpet that delivered double digit positive comps in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The resurgence of DIY coupled with fewer discretionary projects led to a negative 22% comp in installed sales. During the quarter, we saw soft demand for installed millwork, flooring, and cabinets and countertops.</p>
          <p>Sales to commercial business customers fell slightly below the company average for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to work on building relationships with CBC customers to provide them with products and services needed to maintain and restore foreclosed homes.</p>
          <p>Despite the external pressures playing on our sales, we continue to grow our market share. According to third-party estimates, we gained unit market share in 13 of 20 product categories in the second calendar quarter versus the same time period a year ago. And we gained 70 basis points of total store share in the quarter, a good indication that our value message is still connecting with customers.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the quarter expanded 50 basis points, aided by lower fuel cost combined with our efficient distribution infrastructure. Improved inventory shrink and favorable mix shifts also contributed to the margin improvement in the second quarter. Our merchants and operators continue to work together to find the right products to take care of the customers during this tough economic time.</p>
          <p>We planned conservatively for our seasonal categories, and overall we are in good shape as we head into the third quarter. The exception to this would be air conditioners as the cool weather in the Northeast did impact our sales. However, the hotter weather we've experienced in August has led to stronger sales this month and currently our inventory is up only $16 million compared to last year. We do have markdowns in place and we should move through the majority of this overage in the next month.</p>
          <p>As a result of our sales performance for the quarter, payroll deleveraged 59 basis points. Despite the external pressures that weigh on our business, we remain committed to appropriately staffing our stores with knowledgeable employees, ensuring we provide the service customers have come to expect from Lowe's. Our customer service scores improved in the second quarter of this year compared to last year. I'm very proud of our teams as they continue to deliver on our service commitment, and this commitment has helped us increase our market share.</p>
          <p>Throughout my career with Lowe's, improving customer service and managing inventory have always been priorities. Flexible fulfillment is one initiative we're working on to enable us to better meet customers' needs by leveraging our existing network's inventory. Once these systems are in place, they will allow the sale of a product at any Lowe's location including the Internet to be fulfilled and delivered to the customers' homes from the most efficient node in our network.</p>
          <p>I know that those of you who have followed us for a while know flexible fulfillment has been something that we have discussed before. But with enhanced focus and resources, we're making progress and expect to implement the deliverables in 2010. Flexible fulfillment is another example of how we plan to continue to balance investing in our business to drive efficiencies in the future.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, we're disappointed with this quarter's sales results, but we will continue to capitalize on the opportunities to profitably capture market share. As we look to the balance of the year, our outlook remains cautious as we anticipate continuing macro headwinds. Evidenced by this quarter's results, we're committed to diligently managing expenses while continuing to deliver on our customer service commitment.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob Hull to review our second quarter financial results. Bob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Larry, and good morning everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $13.8 billion, which represents a 4.6% decrease from last year's second quarter. In Q2, total customer count increased 4%, but average ticket decreased 8.2% to $61.43. For the first half of 2009, total sales decreased 3.2% to $25.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Comp sales were negative 9.5% for the quarter. Looking at the monthly trends, comps were negative 7.9% in May, negative 9.9% in June, and negative 10.6% in July. For the quarter, comp transactions decreased 0.9% and comp average ticket decreased 8.6%. We are encouraged by the improvement in comp traffic relative to Q1's 2.6% decline.</p>
          <p>With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the second quarter include building materials, rough plumbing, hardware, paint, nursery, outdoor power equipment, and lawn and landscape products. In addition, seasonal living and appliances performed at approximately the overall corporate average.</p>
          <p>For the first half of 2009, comp sales were negative 8.2%.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.8% to sales, an increase of 50 basis points from last year's second quarter. The increase in gross margin was driven by a number of factors. First, the margin mix of products sold had a 19 basis point positive impact on gross margin. Distribution favorably impacted gross margin by 13 basis points, largely driven by lower fuel costs. Lastly, lower inventory shrink as a percentage of sales had a positive impact of 10 basis points. Year to date, gross margin of 35.1% represented an increase 62 basis points over fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A for Q2 was 22.5% to sales, which deleveraged 167 basis points driven by store payroll, credit, fixed expenses, and bonus. For the quarter, store payroll deleveraged 59 basis points. Proprietary credit deleveraged 27 basis points due to higher losses than last year. In addition, rent, property taxes, utilities, and other fixed expenses deleveraged approximately 20 basis points due to the comp sales decline.</p>
          <p>Bonus expense deleveraged 19 basis points in the quarter. This is primarily related to our stores as they attained higher performance levels this year versus missing many of our performance targets in the first half of 2008, largely driven by our better than planned first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Given this challenging economic environment, we have reevaluated our future store expansion plans. For 2010, new store openings will be likely in the range of 35 to 45 stores. We will provide a more detailed update on our future store expansion plan at our analyst conference next month. As a result of the lower store opening plans, we have decided to walk away from a number of future store projects. We recorded expense of $48 million primarily to write off previously capitalized costs and reduce the value of these discontinued projects, which is included in SG&amp;A for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Year to date, SG&amp;A was 23.6% of sales and deleveraged 191 basis points to the first half of 2008. Store opening cost of $14 million leveraged four basis points to last year as a percentage of sales. In the second quarter, we opened 18 stores with no relocations. This compares to 23 new stores in Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Depreciation at 2.9% of sales totaled $408 million and deleveraged 32 basis points compared to last year's second quarter, primarily due to the negative comp sales and the addition of 111 stores over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and taxes or operating margin decreased 145 basis points to 9.3% of sales. Year-to-date operating margin of 8.3% represents a decrease of 156 basis points from the first half of 2008. Interest expense at $76 million deleveraged eight basis points as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, total expenses were 26.1% of sales and deleveraged 203 basis points.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 8.8% of sales.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.6% versus 37.4% for Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $0.51 for the quarter were at the low end of our guidance of $0.51 to $0.55, but decreased 19% versus last year's $0.63.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, during the first quarter we adopted the FASB Staff Position or FSP related to EITF 03-6-1. The FSP, which deals with share based payments, requires both a change in our method of calculating EPS and retroactive adoption. The amount of securities involved is insignificant; but as a result of rounding, our second quarter 2008 earnings per share is now $0.63 versus the $0.64 reported last year. Earnings per share for fiscal 2008 are unchanged at $1.49. For the first six months of fiscal 2009, earnings per share of $0.84 were down 19% to 2008.</p>
          <p>Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets; cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion. Our second quarter inventory balance increased 250 million or 3.1% versus Q2 last year. The increase was due to a 6.8% square footage growth and higher distribution inventory as a result of opening our 14th regional distribution center. These were offset somewhat by a 5.2% reduction in comp store inventory.</p>
          <p>Inventory turnover calculated by taking a trailing four quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last five quarters was 3.72, a decrease of 29 basis points from Q2 2008.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter, we owned 88% of our stores versus 87% at the end of second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Return on assets determined using a trailing four quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters decreased 267 basis points to 5.7%.</p>
          <p>Next, I'd like to highlight a few items from the liability section of the balance sheet. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 26.5% compared to 30.1% for Q2 last year. At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 1.52 times. Return on invested capital measured using a trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the last five quarters decreased 367 basis points for the quarter to 8.8%.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the statement of cash flows, year-to-date cash flow from operations was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 152 million or 4% over the first half of 2008. The decrease is attributable to lower net earnings offset somewhat by working capital improvements. Cash used in property acquired was $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2009 compared to 1.6 billion for the same timeframe last year. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.6 billion represents a 17% increase over the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>There were no shares repurchased in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. We expect a third quarter sales decrease of two to 5%, which incorporates the opening of approximately 11 new stores: two in August, three in September, and six stores in October. Comp store sales are estimated to decline six to 10% to last year.</p>
          <p>EBIT or operating margin for the third quarter is expected to decline by approximately 170 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>The anticipated sales and operating margin declines are expected to generate diluted earnings per share of $0.21 to $0.25, which represents a decrease of 24 to 36% compared to last year's $0.33.</p>
          <p>For 2009, we expect to open 62 to 66 stores, resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 4%. We're estimating a comp sales decrease of seven to 9% and a total sales decrease of approximately 3%.</p>
          <p>For the fiscal year, we're anticipating an operating margin decrease of approximately 130 basis points.</p>
          <p>We're forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.5% for 2009.</p>
          <p>As a result, we expect diluted earnings per share of $1.13 to $1.21 for the year.</p>
          <p>For the year, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $3.6 billion. We forecast total capital expenditures of approximately 2.4 billion, with roughly 300 million funded via operating leases, leaving cash CapEx of approximately $2.1 billion for 2009. As a result, we are forecasting free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>Our outlook does not contemplate any share repurchases for the third quarter or fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>Celeste, we are now ready for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us maybe a little bit more color on the impact of special order sales and installed sales on the overall comp number, and when do you think that might turn around? What are you looking for on that going forward into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, I'll start off. This is Larry Stone, and then let Robert and Bob join in. Certainly installed as Robert mentioned in his comment, in a few categories we noticed our detail fees have increased. And installed sales starting off from the third quarter have improved in a couple of categories, but that's still the big bogie that we think consumers are just not willing to go out and spend on categories like kitchen cabinets and countertops and even on our installed carpet program.</p>
          <p>Our stock program that I mentioned in my comments has been extremely strong with double digit positive comps in the second quarter. So once again we think once the housing bottoms out and people get more confidence that the economy is starting to turn, I think there is a big backlog on these projects, but right now we're just seeing people spend on the smaller projects. But certainly we've got the processes in place. We continue to have our sales specialists focused on the projects that do come on board, and I just think it's going to take a while before that business comes back, probably sometime in 2010 would be a good estimate in my opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, this is Robert. The impact of installed and special order had negatively impacted comps about 200 basis points in the quarter or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and what's the indicator you're looking forward now that you think will indicate that this has turned? Is it housing values? I mean we're seeing a better velocity at least relatively in some of the housing indicators. So it value or is it just all of the above?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, I mean obviously there are a lot of inputs into the consumer's decision making process, but I think a key item is seeing a bottoming in housing prices. If you think about the numbers of homeowners that are out there, for them to move on those discretionary side larger projects, I think they want to know how bad are things going to get, how low is the value my home going to go before they get off the fence and start spending on those major projects. So yes, the velocity of housing, the turnover number has bottomed. There are still a lot of pressures out there in the economy. Obviously we know where unemployment is at.</p>

          <p>And just finally, is there any impact of the stimulus into your forward thinking right now? I know last year you had 100 to 150 basis points of stimulus affecting last year's second quarter, and the stimulus now is going to affect the second half of this year and maybe into 2010. Is any of that projected into your outlook?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions if I could, first off and I guess more or less a point of clarification. Robert, you talked about sales in July improving a bit and then that improvement continuing into August, but I think the quarterly numbers &#x2013; the monthly numbers that Bob gave suggest that sales continued to decelerate through the quarter. So maybe I just want to make sure I have those numbers correct, and also maybe is it a function of the comparisons with last year, but if you could further expand upon that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is true that as you look at the quarters that through the quarter sales decelerated. But within the month of July as you look at the trends and particularly the traffic side of the comp, we saw improvements in that during the month of July. Then those improvements have continued into our first two weeks of August. So in a tough environment like this, we think traffic is key. We're continuing to have traffic coming into the store.</p>
          <p>And a follow-up to the response to Budd's question, once we see the consumers' mindset change towards where is the value of their home going and they start those discretionary projects, hopefully having that traffic in the store today will be a good leading indicator of the opportunity in the future. But we've got to get to that point, and obviously we've still got some challenges and headwinds from the economic standpoint and from a housing pricing standpoint before we get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful, and the second I have with respect to the lower number of new store openings for 2010, as you look upon the stores that you will no longer be opening that you had planned to, was it a really broad based decision or is it more were you targeting certain areas of the country where you decided to pull back in store openings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we did, Brian, was really it's part of the ongoing evaluation process we've been going through really for the past couple of years in a challenging environment. And as we look out and say okay, when is the recovery going to take place, obviously things have been deeper and longer than most people anticipated when we first got into the process. We went in and we're constantly reevaluating what we think these store opening volumes are going to be.</p>
          <p>So it may be based on a store that's falling below our hurdle rate. In other cases, it may the new store had an acceptable hurdle rate, but it would be cannibalized, have too much of a cannibalization impact on existing stores now that we've gone through three years of negative comps. So we view it as part of the overall evaluation process to look at those that were in the pipeline. And it's looking all across the country, and in some cases it's on the facts and circumstance based for each individual site that we made the decision on.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Larry, you had stated that I think sales to commercial business customers fell slightly more than the company, and you're working to build relationships with those customers. Can you elaborate in terms of what you're doing specifically, and is there anything differently than what you've done in the past, especially it relates to the foreclosure market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Deb, certainly we're trying to work with various organizations in each market, realtors, banks, and so forth because a lot of those homes have been foreclosed on. We repeatedly said if the bank owns the home, then there is certainly a good opportunity to work with the folks they've worked with in terms of culling that commercial business.</p>
          <p>So it varies by market; in some markets the real estate agents that we're working with and trying to get the job and so forth. In some cases we've actually used our installed sales team to do the projects that say in a small market where a realtor might be working with the bank to get a house ready to sell and so forth, so it varies all across the US. And certainly the amount of spend on foreclosed homes varies quite a bit. If it's just a home that a customer basically left a home pretty much intact, it spends much less versus a home where a lot of fixtures and so forth were taken out. And it's pretty hard to quantify that across the US because it varies quite a bit by market. It's just a continual effort to drive more sales, to have that relationship with those CBC customers, and also with the lending institutions and the realtors throughout the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then, Robert, you referred to one of the issues declining comps this quarter being the stimulus from last year. What is it that you saw in this quarter that makes you feel differently this year versus last year in terms of the benefit and how much do you now think the benefit was to last year second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we previously said we thought the benefit last year was 100 to 150 basis points. In hindsight, it was probably at least 200 basis points of benefit, so maybe approaching 100 basis points more than what we previously thought. And I think last year obviously if you think about it, there was a discrete amount of money put in individuals' hands from a rebate check, and the money that they received then was prior to the collapse that we saw in the financial markets and the significant &#x2013; unemployment was on the rise, a significant increase in unemployment that we saw in the second half of last year.</p>
          <p>So in many parts of the country when that money was put into the consumers' hands, it seems like a propensity to spend it, and I think obviously part of it wound up in our channel, whereas this year there hasn't been that discrete amount of money that has been put in someone's hands in a large dollar sum like that. And obviously the consumer is in a much different mindset today given the state of the overall economy.</p>
          <p>So I think those things combined, it's just &#x2013; probably our trend line last year was decelerating more than what we anticipated and the stimulus filled that gap and it was a bigger impact than what we &#x2013; the actual impact was bigger than what we estimated when we looked at the numbers last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last question for Bob, I know you said you would provide additional details at the upcoming Analyst Meeting with regards to square footage growth changes. But will there be a greater focus going forward on the smaller stores and are you finding that the returns there may be greater than you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deb, we're still looking at a barbell strategy. We think there's still great opportunity in many of the metro markets. A lot of the metro markets we still feel like we're under stored, and it's a great opportunity. In a lot of those markets, land was very tough to come by previously. In these current economic times, we're finding more opportunities than we have in the past to put a Lowe's store in some of those metro markets. We'll continue with our infill strategies in the other top-100 markets. As Robert said, we do look at it on a market-by-market basis. We do evaluate the home market and the related cannibalization impact. So depending on household growth in those markets will dictate our comfort level to put a store there.</p>
          <p>And lastly, the 94Ks continue to perform well. And as we talked about, we've got several stores opening lower than 94K or square footage less than 94K that we're continuing to evaluate. So we think there's opportunity in all markets but we're proceeding a little bit more cautiously going forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks a lot for taking my question. Given the weakness that you're seeing in bigger ticket items and the research that you cited that showed consumers are probably going to spend less on home improvement projects, how long do you think it's going to take for positive comps to return given the changing dynamics between ticket and traffic?  Another way to say it is can you see positive comp first that traffic will return without that big ticket spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, this is Robert. I assume you're talking about overall comps being positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean certainly I think in an environment like this, I think traffic is what's king, so that's what we're after is maintain the traffic. As the environment improves, as the consumer's outlook improves, housing price bottom, I think that will help from the ticket standpoint. And certainly we're doing everything we can to try and get those add-on sales when we drive the traffic through the store. Housing prices aren't looking to bottom until maybe the first half of next year. So hopefully by the first half of next year unless we have another setback in the overall economy, hopefully we can start moving at least to flat comps maybe in the first half of next year, then certainly hopefully positive comps as we move through the year next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a quick follow-up on the reduction in store openings, is this a change in the way that you see the longer term market opportunity, or is it more so that some of these sites that currently do not have needed hurdle rates will when the environment changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, I think it's just an extension of the store opening process because in many of these cases, you're opening a store that when we had planned that store two or three years ago, the surrounding stores were doing a greater volume. Now those surrounding stores after three years in many cases have negative comps. The volume has dropped to the point where you don't want to cannibalize and it's going to take a few years for those store volumes to recover to the point that you'll be ready to cannibalize that site.</p>
          <p>So it's really just going through looking at it on a market-by-market basis and deciding is it best just to walk away now and come back to this market at some point in time in the future. So really we still think there is still great long-term opportunity out there, but the overall number of stores that we're talking about opening, the timeline on that gets extended.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one quick last one, your guidance for the rest of the year would suggest that the margin performance is going to deteriorate somewhat from what you saw in the first half of the year. Is there anything that's happening, particularly on the gross margin side, even though comparisons are becoming much easier that would suggest that that performance will be somewhat restrained?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually gross margin for the second half as a percent of sales increase relative to last year, it is actually certainly higher. I think we had 62 basis points improvement in the first half. Our outlook is 70 basis points for the year, which suggests a little bit higher performance in the back half. Obviously that skews a little bit lower than that in Q3, a little bit higher than that in Q4 relative to the easier margin comparisons we have relative to Q4 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks; two questions, one on the credit and then on DIY. If you think about how credit drives the larger tickets, what did credit drop as a percentage of sales in the quarter? And could you just give us an update on what percentage of your sales are on those larger tickets like you did in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you that credit as a total percentage of the mix was roughly 20% in the second quarter. That's down from about 21.5 from Q2 last year. Actually bank card mix dropped by a similar amount with the cash and debit card increasing in mix. I don't have the specific big-ticket amount in front of me. Certainly the credit does play an impact in the big tickets and has an impact in the overall big-ticket performance. We're certainly seeing a different dynamic in the credit markets this year relative to last year, which is having an impact on the extension of credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, this is Robert. When you talk about big tickets, just keep in mind that that's not always done on a credit card. It can be there are big tickets, and when we speak about it, it's in all forms. So not specifically to the credit card, but when I talked about sales greater than $500, the comp being down about 16%, those tickets above $500 is somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% of our total sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then secondly, Larry, you got into the DIY and how it has always been an important focus for growing. Beyond adding staffing into the categories where that's important, are there other initiatives you have or things that you can do to try and get people to put more in the basket if they're doing a project, in-store kiosks or other things that we should look for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Greg, I think the thing that we've really tried to emphasize in the last three years, we spent a lot more time working on our new lower price strategy, special values which will come in maybe for a weekend with special values and so forth to really hit it pretty hard and drive that traffic into the store. Clinics certainly have come back in some of our markets. The Kid's Clinic has proven to be very, very successful for us not only because the parents come into the stores to shop, but it really drives hopefully a lot of DIY-ers in the future for our company. Lowes.com has many, many how-to videos and information now where customers go online and look at various ways to do projects.</p>
          <p>So as I said in my comments, DIY has always been very important to us as a company, and we continue to exploit that business as we move forward. Inside the store, we've got a tremendous focus on selling related items. We've always had that but now even a more renewed focus. Our cart starter areas, our side stacks, everything that we're trying to do inside the store is to really enhance that ticket and drive as much ticket as we possibly can on the smaller purchases. So it's all throughout the store, challenging merchants with better packaging, better signage, better how-to, I mean the whole gamut of things that you would do in a basic retail operation but just with a tremendous amount of focus from all parts of the organization.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. You talked about some details on different line items but the share gains that you mentioned, can you talk about those categories where you're gaining share and losing share and how you feel about those? And relatedly, are there any new market entrants or exits into the categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, Dave, yes, we can go through that. As we talk about share gains, when we talk about unit volume share, we said we were up 70 basis points in total in the quarter, and this is from a third-party estimate. And keep in mind that this only relates to DIY spend. This isn't anything to do with commercial spend. But we saw &#x2013; in hardware we saw an improvement, lawn and landscape, rough electrical. We saw a slight improvement in appliances in the quarter, the seasonal area of the store. So lot of those DIY type projects that we talked about where a customer can come, get everything they need for that project, get the how-to advice if they are someone that hasn't done DIY in a while or moving back into that category, our nursery category, some of those. So we saw across the board some nice improvements in our share volume from a unit basis in lot of those key categories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is there anything you guys are picking up in terms of either mass discount players trying to play in a category or the opposite, closing the stores from stuff that you guys can pick up on, pulling some of the houses, whatever, just your view on competitive entries and exits in the different categories would be helpful.</p>

          <p>David, this is Greg Bridgeford. One area that we've seen lot of closures and probably I think the predominant sector that has been hurt by the nature of the current downturn is lumber building material dealers of all sorts. And I think you see that reflected in the strength that we've exhibited in building materials and rough plumbing and hardware in some of the core categories. So it's a lot of angular information, but that seems to be the one category or sector within our industry that seems most impacted by the nature of the current downturn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, Scot Ciccarelli. You guys in the past have provided some guidelines regarding how the outdoor mix change is quarter by quarter relative to the indoor mix. I was wondering if there's similar color you might be able to provide just in terms of big ticket purchases versus small ticket purchases and how that flexes during the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally speaking, the big ticket categories seem to peak in the third quarter if you think about a lot of folks trying to get their homes ready for the holiday season and a lot of big projects take place in the third quarter. So we're about to bump up against the cyclical peak if you will in big tickets as it relates to percentage across the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scot, no real big differences. I mean certainly as we talk about the pressure in the Western division and so forth and the Northeast, your big ticket sales as we've stated previously many years ago, some of our best home decor stores were on the West Coast and certainly large kitchen cabinet sales and so forth. So you did have a higher percent of their sales being done in larger tickets. And so people are spending a lot more on housing projects say in the West versus the Midwest. But recently, it has been pretty well balanced across the US. We still have strong pockets of stores that did not have the big upswing in housing prices, so those stores are still pretty much strong versus how they were three or four years ago.</p>

In certain categories and air conditioners is one that I highlighted in my comments, certainly the Northeast is a very strong air conditioner market for the Company -- a lot of window units are still used in apartments and so forth. And we had a very weak season in the Northeast in terms of air conditioner sales. And some of the outdoor categories also suffered as a result of the cool, wet weather.</p>
          <p>At this day and time, big tickets, OPE and so forth are slow. That's why I made the comment about outdoor power equipment repair parts; people are really coming back and getting the mowers out of the basement so to speak and fixing them up and using them for one more season. So there again, we think as we said earlier, a lot of pent up demand could happen in the next year or so as things continue to improve. But the wet weather and the cool spring hit us in a lot of different categories, but really air conditioners was probably one of the biggest ones this year that we got hit with in terms of sales slowdown.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And following up on that, what kind of margin exposure or what kind of margin pressure have you factored into your third quarter numbers based on air conditioner mark-downs? Is it material relative to the overall number?</p>

          <p>It's really immaterial. As I've said in my comments, we got about 16 million more in inventory than we had last year. And based on the first couple of weeks of August, we've been going through that inventory at a pretty good clip. So we really feel like in the next three to four weeks, we should be back in line with what we had last year. And quite frankly, when you get into this late in the season, there is no reason to really try to give it away because people are just not going to buy it if it's not hot. So we think we have a great opportunity based on the weather forecasts that we're looking at in the next couple, three weeks to blow through a lot of the inventory without discounting it substantially.</p>

          <p>Got it, and then finally following up on Greg's question on credit, a question for Bob. You spoke about the mix that you're experiencing in the different I guess credit methods of payment. What are you seeing from your partner in terms of how they're treating your customers, new applications, turndowns et cetera? What do the metrics look like and how are they evolving from earlier in the year?</p>

          <p>The approval levels have dropped slightly from this time last year. As you would imagine, everybody is tightening their lending standards, and our partner is no different. The drop is not as dramatic as we once thought. I think roughly 85% of our consumers are homeowners. They've got very good credit scores. The commercial customers, this is their livelihood, so they're paying their bills in order to procure more product. So we're not seeing much degradation. In fact towards the tail end of 2008, our partner took certain risk actions and now they're reversing some of those risk actions. So we've got a good balanced approach to try to grow sales profitably with our credit partner.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about, just to follow up on that, if you think about what you're seeing sequentially, is this as big a drop as you've seen on year on year or had you already turned the corner in that regard in terms of approvals?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The approvals have &#x2013; they dropped. Probably the biggest drop was Q4 last year, Q1 this year. So we're seeing some stabilization there as it relates to approvals orders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a question on the second half, seasonal and outdoor certainly a favorable contributor in the first half and the second quarter. As that becomes a smaller piece of the business in the second half, what are the thoughts in terms of driving traffic? Is there any thought of increased promotion or anything different to try to drive traffic other than this focus on core DIY categories you've talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, it's Larry Stone. Certainly as we get into the third quarter and we start to switch out to more the seasonal fall products, we get into seasonal heat. And certainly as we get into the latter part of the third quarter into our trim-a-tree and get ready for Christmas, we don't see anything right now that makes us think we need to do anything drastic to change people coming into our stores. We think we've got great values every day, and certainly the special values and the new lower price and all the things we're doing from market standpoint, we feel real comfortable that we can continue to drive traffic without having to do anything that would be beyond the norm of what we've done in the first half of the year.</p>
