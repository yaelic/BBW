          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is the EADS Q1 earnings 2010 conference call. Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also webcast with a special banner for Q1 earnings 2010. Playback of this call will be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicating phone replay service. The supporting information package was emailed to you this early morning with slides, which we will now walk through, and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now, to Hans Peter Ring.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nathalie. Good morning and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to our Q1 conference call. This was certainly one of the quieter closings we had in the last times. So to a great extent, our results in the first quarter are a reflection of the trends we had outlined when we discussed our outlook for 2010 not long ago.</p>
          <p>The market outlook of commercial aircraft remains on an upward trend, particularly in Asia, Latin America and Middle East. Emerging markets account for more than half of our backlog. As you know, there are seasonal effects to our financial year. So performance indicators in the early part of the year tends to be lagging behind, particularly in the defense and institutional businesses; so too with the trend in 2010. Nonetheless, we find that revenues from all parts of our portfolio are largely in line with momentum expected to pick up as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>Airbus legacy programs continue to deliver very good profitability. Once residual program challenges have disappeared, profitability in the long term will match our common expectations especially if the dollar keeps strengthening. The rest of the business will pick up as usual during the year.</p>
          <p>We are determined to ensure liquidity through cash conservation. This is essential, especially as we seek further opportunities outside the eurozone and better position ourselves as a global manufacturer.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the business and financial highlights of the first quarter on page four, but before that please take a close look at our Safe Harbor statement on page two.</p>
          <p>We have seen signs of improvement in the commercial aircraft environment in both passenger aircraft and freighters. Delivery and backlog levels confirms this trend. 122 commercial aircrafts were delivered to Airbus customers in the first quarter, higher than the 2009 level. Eurocopter delivered 86 helicopters.</p>
          <p>The A400M program is progressing well as the second aircraft has now joined the flight test campaign. Following the principle agreement achieved in March, we are still working towards the contract amendment with our customer nations.</p>
          <p>As announced last month, EADS North America intends to bid for the U.S. Tanker, and is currently working on building a team of industrial partners to support the bid. And I think we are going to have a strong team together very soon.</p>
          <p>Revenues and EBIT are in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>A brief comment on our cash position before I focus on the financials in more detail on page six. Our strong net cash position of &#x20AC;8.8 billion continues to provide a solid foundation. It reflects, as expected, the unfavorable cutoff impact of customer advances paid in 2009.</p>
          <p>Customer financing needs for the first quarter reached around &#x20AC;150 million. We remain prudent on the customer financing outlook for '10 at this stage.</p>
          <p>Reported net income for the quarter was &#x20AC;103 million.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before, keep in mind through the release, the seasonality of our defense and institutional businesses, whose top, bottom line and cash performance tends to be back loaded.</p>
          <p>Up to page six and the financial highlights. Revenues grew by 6% versus the same period last year. The growth comes from a combination of higher volumes and a favorable mix on commercial aircraft deliveries at Airbus, as well as increases in Eurocopter, other businesses and Astrium. Negative pressure from foreign exchange as well as lower A400M revenues weighed on the quarter's revenue evolution versus last year.</p>
          <p>The EBIT before one-off stands at around &#x20AC;150 million for EADS and around 80 million for Airbus. We've benefited from good performance in Airbus, legacy programs and space and defense activities. However, the A380 continues to weigh significantly on underlying performance.</p>
          <p>HQ and eliminations is lower versus a year ago, reflecting a change to the allocation of real estate costs and a lower contribution from Dassault. Compared to 2009, EBIT before one-off was weighed down by the deterioration of hedge rates.</p>
          <p>Order intake for the quarter was significantly above the 2009 level, primarily due to a higher level of commercial aircraft orders for the A330 and A350 XWB at Airbus.</p>
          <p>Our order book stands at a robust &#x20AC;416 billion, reflecting increases at Airbus, Astrium and Eurocopter. The Airbus backlog benefited from a positive revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;22 billion due to a U.S. dollar closing spot rate that has significantly strengthened since year-end.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, we can look at the underlying performance. The EBIT before one-off margin is at 1.7% at Group level. At Airbus, good underlying performance of single-aisle and long-range aircraft is weighed down by the A380 by roughly the same amount as last year.</p>
          <p>There has been no change to the compounded rate used to revalue our loss-making contract provisions for this quarter. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar may lead to a necessity to review the compounded rate for H1 results. This may trigger a revaluation impact, but in lower proportions than the adjustments made prior to the introduction of this compounded rate.</p>
          <p>In the Q1, the dollar mismatch and the balance sheet revaluation had a negative impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>On to slide eight now and the profit and loss highlights, where you can see R&amp;D increased slightly versus last year driven predominantly by an increase at DS. The ramp-up in the A350 XWB activity was offset by a decrease across the other Airbus programs.</p>
          <p>The interest's result reflects the decline in interest rates on the financial markets. A large part of this line is related to interest for refundable launch investments.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the other financial result improved considerably by around &#x20AC;90 million year-on-year. The main change comes from the 2009 negative revaluation of the options, while in the first quarter of 2010 we completed the option restructuring program which will remove some volatility in this line going forward. This line also includes the unwinding of discounted provisions, which is stable with the first quarter last year, and some revaluation of U.S. dollar and British pound assets.</p>
          <p>Now, tax rate for the year 2009 is as expected at 31%.</p>
          <p>On to the hedging portfolio update on slide nine. During the quarter, we took advantage of the recent strengthening of the dollar by increasing the pace of our hedging activities at more attractive rates without collateralization. As much as the dollar strengthening helps mid-term, the mark-to-market value of our hedge book turned negative to &#x20AC;1.6 billion at a closing dollar rate of 1.35, compared to a plus 1.3 billion we had in December 2009. This obviously is weighing on our equity net of taxes.</p>
          <p>While $4.7 billion of hedges matured at a rate of 1.32, $12 billion of forward contracts were added at an average rate of $1.39 per euro. We completed restructuring of the euro call options we added in summer 2008, selling $2 billion of options of which $1.9 billion were restructured into new forward contracts at more favorable rates.</p>
          <p>Our hedge book increased from $60.8 billion at the end of 2009 to $66.2 billion at the end of the March '10. Despite the latest increase of our hedge portfolio, the volatility of the dollar and the resulting change in mark-to-market as well as the risk pricing of financial institutions continue to put pressure on hedging capacity and hedge rates.</p>
          <p>Quarterly rates for 2010 are provided on page 25. As you know, we suffered significantly this year from hedge rate deterioration.</p>
          <p>Up to our cash flow now on slide 10. As expected, we consumed free cash flow this quarter versus 2009. The change in gross cash flow from operations comes from the lower EBIT before one-off. The change in working capital reflects, as anticipated, the unfavorable cutoff impact at the end of '09 of government payments received as well as an increase in inventories, also at a much lower level than in the Q1 2009.</p>
          <p>The inflow of advances linked to Airbus commercial activity is higher than one year ago. The level of customer financing needs for the quarter reached around &#x20AC;150 million. Investing activities consumed &#x20AC;400 million, reflecting an increase in capital expenditure mainly as investment went up on A350. The 2009 figure recorded a cash inflow from the sale of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Now, I will talk you through the performance of the Airbus division in more detail on page 12. Airbus delivered good commercial results in the first quarter. 60 new firm commercial contracts were booked, including an order for 25 A350 XWB to United, which represents a major breakthrough in the U.S. market. More than 80% of aircraft ordered in the first quarter were for long-range aircraft.</p>
          <p>122 aircraft were delivered to the end of March, including three A380s. Of the 122, three single- aisle aircraft were delivered under operating lease, and thus do not count for revenue and margin recognition. No cancellations were registered in the quarter compared to 14 in the same period last year. The commercial backlog stands at 3,426 aircraft at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>No new military aircraft orders were booked in the quarter. Two deliveries were made, one C-295 to Czech Republic, and one P-3 for the Spanish Air Force.</p>
          <p>No revenue milestones were reached on the A400M program between the year-end '09 and the first quarter '10. Consequently, no revenue has been recognized, and the resulting EBIT impact for the quarter is zero. Costs incurred in the period have been recorded under work-in-progress.</p>
          <p>Now, on to the financials in more detail on page 13. Compared to a year ago, Airbus Commercial revenues benefited from higher volumes and the favorable mix effect. Three single-aisle aircrafts were delivered under operating lease, as I said, with no revenue recognition. The deterioration in foreign exchange rates versus the Q1 '09 has resulted in a negative impact of around &#x20AC;400 million on revenues.</p>
          <p>Airbus Commercial EBIT reflects the favorable mix effect on single-aisle and long-range aircraft deliveries, that was mainly weighed down by negative foreign exchange effect of around &#x20AC;300 million. And then, A380 weighs on underlying performance as it was expected.</p>
          <p>Airbus Military results benefited from an increase in tanker activity for both the UAE and the FSTA programs. Revenue performance was, however, lower due to the absence this quarter of revenues booked on the A400M versus 150 million booked in '09 under early stage accounting. EBIT benefited from the absence of the A400M provision update and the negative foreign currency revaluation impact booked in '09.</p>
          <p>Two key milestones have been reached so far this year in the Airbus division. Following a successful 200-hour flight test campaign, the A330-200 freighter was granted EASA Type Certification at the beginning of April. At Airbus Military, the A400M development continues to progress well. Since early April, a second A400M has joined the MSN1 in supporting the flight test campaign, and the third aircraft will follow very soon.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at Eurocopter on slide 14. 2010 has begun with a slight positive trend of bookings and cancellations in Eurocopter versus the first quarter '09, though commercial appetite is still far below '07/'08 levels and the market is still uncertain.</p>
          <p>Net bookings of 84 helicopters were recorded in the first quarter, including 8 LUH. The cancellation trend is slowing, with only 18 cancellations in the quarter compared to 28 a year earlier. Deliveries are slightly below a year ago with 86 deliveries, including 2 Tiger and 4 NH90 and 6 LUH. That compares to 93 in the first quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the year grew 5% due to a favorable saving of customer support activities this quarter and an increase in revenue recognition for the NH90. EBIT declined 32% below the 2009 level, reflecting the positive impact from services, but weighed down by a negative headwind from foreign exchange, increasing product investment and a lower margin on NH90 program.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter achieved a significant milestone on the naval version of the NH90 in the quarter, with the first Step A customer qualifications for France and The Netherlands.</p>
          <p>The Korean Utility Helicopter prototype developed by KAI and Eurocopter, and the German Army CH-53GA upgraded by Eurocopter for personal recovery missions, both successfully performed their maiden flights this quarter on schedule.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter has begun implementation of its SHAPE program aiming at securing the company's competitiveness and maintaining its leadership in the future. The program also includes several saving initiatives.</p>
          <p>On to Astrium on slide 15. During the first quarter, the successful submarine launch of the new M51 missile completed the latest series of development tests, confirming the entry into service of new generation technologies. The increase in development and production activities of the M51 program drove the first quarter's performance. Telecom services also contributed to the growth.</p>
          <p>The strong contribution to revenues and EBIT from defense activities was partially offset by lower volume and margin in navigation satellites and a lower margin in observation satellites.</p>
          <p>Order intake for the quarter of &#x20AC;1.2 billion was supported by successes across the segments. However, order intake was significantly lower than a year ago, which included the Ariane 5 PB batch of 35 launches, which accounted for a value of more than 4 billion, as well as the M51 Tranche 3 production.</p>
          <p>In services, Paradigm signed an extension to the Skynet 5 services contract with the UK MoD. This adds a fourth satellite to the constellation, and will enhance MILSATCOM's service provision capability, providing additional capacity for third parties in a growing international market until 2022.</p>
          <p>ESA awarded Astrium two contracts in the quarter, a contract for the initial development phase to enhance the performance of Ariane 5, as well as for the construction of the Sentinel-2B optical satellite.</p>
          <p>Cooperation between Astrium and Defence and Security is already bringing benefits. The European Defence Agency, EDA, selected the divisions to lead a six-month study to demonstrate the feasibility of UAV integration into civil airspace using satellite communication.</p>
          <p>On to DS now, on the next slide, slide 16. Revenues compared to the first quarter 2010 are roughly stable here, reflecting higher export revenues on missile programs, but lower volumes in military aircraft services activities which should pick up in the year.</p>
          <p>EBIT is also in line with that of the first quarter '09. Higher volume in export missile programs and a better mix from maintenance and training activities offset the significant increase in R&amp;D investment in the quarter. This increased R&amp;D effort is concentrated mainly on UAV and secure communication segments.</p>
          <p>The order book of &#x20AC;18.9 billion provides a solid platform for future growth. DS secured new important contracts in the quarter. MBDA and the UK MoD have agreed a long-term partnering arrangement for the supply and support of complex weapons, which led to an order worth &#x20AC;132 million for the deployment of new military capabilities into Afghanistan.</p>
          <p>In addition, DS signed a number of contracts for its TETRA radio network system, including a contract with the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau in China making the largest digital network for the police in China. In February, the second batch of 35 modified UAV DRAC systems was delivered to the French Army to enhance capabilities in mountainous terrain.</p>
          <p>Now, on to other businesses on slide 17. Here, revenue growth compared to the first quarter 2009 was driven by higher deliveries and asset management activity at ATR. EBIT was stable with Q1 '09; a small increase in ATR and EADS North America was offset by a decrease at Sogerma impacted by the decline in the jet engine MRO business. This is where we have a small subsidiary in Sogerma.</p>
          <p>ATR delivered 13 aircrafts compared to 8 in the first quarter '09. The 2010 delivery outlook remains stable. The market is improving, but the financing environment remains difficult for regional aircraft.</p>
          <p>At EADS North America, the 100th LUH helicopter was delivered in March. All helicopters have been delivered on time and ahead &#x2013; are on schedule. On April 20, EADS North America announced its intention to submit a proposal as prime contractor for the U.S. Air Force Tanker Modernization Program. The DoD has clearly stated that EADS North America is a qualified provider and capable of executing all prime contractor responsibilities, including classified work. The company will continue to add to its industrial team in ways that strengthen the KC-45 offering.</p>
          <p>Not in other businesses, but a significant year-on-year change this quarter, is the deterioration of EBIT in headquarters and elimination. This reduction is due to a change in the allocation of real estate costs and a lower contribution from Dassault.</p>
          <p>Now, I will comment on our guidance on page 19. Here, we confirm the 2010 outlook as we have communicated eight weeks ago. The Group is fundamentally solid to cope with a 2010 economic environment. This improving market trend is confirmed especially on air traffic with volatility remaining. The helicopter market is still uncertain, as I said before. The solidity is based on a resilient actively managed backlog of 3,426 aircraft at Airbus Commercial, 1,301 at Eurocopter, and strong backlog in the space and defense businesses.</p>
          <p>Based on a number of active campaigns, gross orders at Airbus should be at 250 to 300 aircraft in 2010. Airbus expects to deliver up to the same level of aircraft as in 2009. Eurocopter should deliver around 6% less helicopters in '10 compared to '09. Therefore, using &#x20AC;1 equals 1.40 on a dollar as the average spot rate, EADS revenues should be roughly stable in 2010.</p>
          <p>EADS EBIT in 2010 will be around 1 billion. The deterioration of the hedge rates will weigh by about 1 billion compared to 2009. A380, while slightly improving, will continue to weigh substantially on the EBIT before one-off, as in '09.</p>
          <p>Cost savings and some improvements in aircraft pricing should contribute positively, while weaker helicopter deliveries, some increases in research and development and cost inflation will weigh on profitability, as we have said before.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the EBIT performance in EADS will be dependent on the Group's ability to execute on our programs, particularly A400M, A380 and A350, in line with the commitments made to our customers.</p>
          <p>Provided a sustainable year-end cash flow of institutional and government business and subject to Pre-Delivery-Payment advances in the A400M program, the free cash flow before customer financing should be breakeven.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow after customer financing should be negative due to the customer financing cash outflows of around &#x20AC;1 billion. If market conditions continue to improve, less cash flow should be consumed by customer financing.</p>
          <p>Now, I will take your questions, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, madam. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question is from Rupinder Vig, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have just got two questions please. Firstly, just around A350 development. Could you just give us some bit of an update as to where we are now? What the next key milestone will be on this program?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just around customer financing, you talked about 150 million being the outflow in the first quarter, you've stuck to your guidance of a billion. I mean, just how much upside is there in that guidance, given that we would expect financing needs to come down as we go through the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Rupi, and thank you for questions. Upside customer financing, yes, as I indicated, I think this is the only change to what we said in March. We would see some upside here indeed. The level is difficult to say. I would not give you a number today, but so far the financing environment seems to be robust, and it will depend on the question of paydowns. We are not taking exposure which might come up in the next quarters. So this will depend upon that, and so far there is upside without any doubt.</p>
          <p>On 350, I mean we had a comprehensive presentation on our North American Investor Forum, not a lot of things have changed since then. The schedule status remains critical. We have consumed some of the limited buffers we have. The resource ramp-up makes good progress, which obviously will be a precondition to deliver on the development.</p>
          <p>The MG6 review which is freezing all the toolings on the program are, as we speak, about to be finalized this week. So there are a number of reviews currently taking place, and I think the last ones will be in June. So, so far no new status. It is a program which is a significant one with a lot of new technology and with some risk obviously, as we always have said, but compared to what we said recently there is no real change.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on order intake, just to complement that, you've seen an order of 25 aircraft in the quarter with United. We are now at 530 aircraft, which I think is quite a significant base for the program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. My first one goes back to March and your guidance for the full year. And you kind of concluded that you should be seeing a cost of inflation headwind to profit this year of about &#x20AC;400 million. How much of that impacted the numbers in Q1? When can we expect the rest to arrive, if it will arrive, and has anything changed there? So that's my first question.</p>
          <p>And then my second question, just to follow-on on Rupi's comments and the financing environment, are you still seeing the same degree of support from the export credit agencies? Or, are they now coming down in terms of the volume and we're seeing more of the slack taken up by banks or commercial markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To your second question, I think ECA support is ongoing. So we see no big change. Whether we will need ultimately the same level we have seen last year, which was 34% of all the deliveries which were supported by ECA, we will see. And it depends obviously on the commercial financial markets, I would say, and whether they are picking up the exposure.</p>
          <p>But I think wherever necessary, ECAs are, continue to be responsive. What they are increasingly looking at obviously is risk concentration for them on certain customers. So they are not there for unlimited support and this is, I would say, subject obviously to due diligence in each and every case. But so far we see no change, which I think is good news and which should support the delivery situation and the backlog we have this year.</p>
          <p>On cost increases, there was some limited impact in the first quarter, yes, and we can see that. I wouldn't now give you a precise number on that, but we have seen a little bit of cost increase due to inflation in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I mean, what we can say probably, additional to what we said on the call on the full-year results, is that we struggle in terms of inflation mainly on the buy side of our business. So it's on the supplier side. And what we can see there is that there is an indirect impact coming from, for example, materials. But I mean the buy side is, I would say, the bigger problem here than our own value-added, which is very much in line with what we thought. So there is no deterioration on our own activity here. So that's what I would say on that point, Avi.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This first question I have is on the issue of re-engining A320s. And could you comment on what you're looking for right now in terms of the things that you need to have in place before you can make that decision, and what that means in terms of timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is your only question, Doug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a second one too, if you want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So re-engining, we are working on that subject heavily as you know. What I need particularly is the business case. So we are still analyzing the impact, and I would say the profitability we expect from that program. Other than that, a lot of technical evaluations are ongoing. A lot of discussions are ongoing with our engine suppliers. I think this is the most significant discussion we have to have and this is not closed.</p>
          <p>The timeline, I mean, if everything goes well, we might see something <mark type="inaudible" /> but we take the time we need, Doug, so we don't put ourselves under self-imposed pressure here. We need to answer all the questions and evaluate the options we have here, and that might also take longer. But for the time being, I think there is a chance that we see something <mark type="inaudible" />..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as a second question, on Power8, if we go back to the early days when Power8 was being developed, if I recall correctly, this was based on trying to balance against an exchange rate of about $1.30 to $1.35 for the euro. So here we are today. Could you comment on what does it mean today, in terms of Airbus margin, if you see the euro come in below $1.30, and if you make the Power8 objectives? A lot's happened in that timeframe. How do you think about the margin implications of success on Power8 today for Airbus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the last point, I think we will deliver on Power8, and Power8 will offset everything we've said before as much as it can. So cost inflation, and probably higher than at the beginning of Power8 expected A380 costs certainly. You are right, the program at the outset was at 1.35, and we put a little bit more on the program with Power8 Plus when the dollar became weaker, as you remember.</p>
          <p>Now, given that obviously the dollar trend has changed and probably changed, I would guess today, at a more sustainable basis, there is upside on the Airbus margins, without any question, and with that on EADS. And this will particularly start to come through in 2012, '13, '14 progressively as our hedge book obviously goes down. And if you look to the hedge book we have today, rates in that timeframe in the later years of around 1.39, 1.40. Obviously with the current trend, we are hedging at much better rates since a few days or weeks into the years 2013 and '14 and also '12.</p>
          <p>So clearly there will be upside, which is not insignificant. I would not give you now the precise numbers, but certainly in the medium term a couple of percent can be expected, and particularly on the Airbus side and then also on EADS as I said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes, the first one I wanted to ask about the A380 industrialization. I can see some comments on the newswire saying it's making quick progress and you could deliver more than 20 aircraft this year. And so I wanted to know if we could think about the learning curve effect, and when you'll be able to evaluate the impact on EBIT? So that's the first one, if you want to take that first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On A380, indeed industrial process makes progress, you say quick progress. I mean compared to a year ago, that was my comment on the newswires. We obviously have progressed on outstanding work. We have progressed on this Design Query Notes, so design changes. We have progressed also on missing components from suppliers. So there are marked improvements within the year, within one year, and whether this is quick or not is up to your judgment.</p>
          <p>So insofar industrially, the program continues to stabilize. And I would say, today, we feel pretty confident about the progress more than it was in the past because there is indeed visible improvements.</p>
          <p>Now, on deliveries, we have around 20 in the guidance; today we would see at least 20, and so far I wouldn't exclude that it is one more, or I don't know. So we will see. We will work hard with our Airbus teams on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second one on Eurocopter. The statement this morning sort of talks about some challenges. I was trying to sort of get an idea in terms of my EBIT forecast for Eurocopter. Should I think of it as being there is more risk to meeting this year's number? Or, should I think of it more that there is a risk that the weakness really drags on into 2011 and I have to put a weak number in for 2011 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of today, I think for 2010, I mean we have always said that it is going to be weaker than 2009 and that has not changed. I think for this year, we are on track with what we had expected some months ago. Indeed, if the trends would not improve over the next two quarters, we would get an impact on 2011, which probably then would mean we are not back to recovery in 2011 and we will have to see where we are. But indeed, the trend today is not so much, I would say, changing the 2010 outlook, it's more on '11.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hans Peter, it's Harry here, I just had a couple of quick questions. Can you clarify, at Airbus, what the impact of improved pricing and escalation was in the first quarter, the year-on-year the bridge for it, and what you are expecting for the full year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, it says on slide 13 there was a favorable mix effect on the single-aisle and long-range aircraft deliveries. Can you be a little bit more precise? Was this about the volume of A320 compared with A319, A321, and about the volume of A330-300 relative to other A330 models? Could you clarify that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Harry. Pricing, we can confirm that the pricing upside we see for this year, first quarter was rather low. So that's going to be back loaded a little bit into Q3 and 4. So we have low million improvement numbers in the first quarter. So you should expect to see something more significant in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>The mix effect, now you are asking a very detailed question. We would have to dig that out, just one second. The impact, because of the mix between now 2009 and 2010, we would expect &#x2013; and it's coming mainly from A330s &#x2013; we would expect was around 60 million.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Two questions. Your hedge portfolio reached $66.2 billion end of March. Could you tell us the current level of this hedge portfolio mid-May? And are you accelerating these hedges given the dollar movement? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is linked to the cost inflation. Till when are you going to have this cost inflation item in your P&amp;L? In other terms, have you been renegotiating this contract with your suppliers? Do you intend to do so? Do you have any lever on this issue? So could you comment a little bit on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one, I could not, from the top of my head, now tell you where we are with our hedges mid-May. But what I can tell is, indeed, we have accelerated in the last weeks again given that we are obviously much stronger with the dollar than we had factored in, in our outlooks, and I made the comment before. So naturally you should expect that, at these levels, it's pretty attractive for us to hedge.</p>
          <p>We are certainly looking into diversification of instruments currently. So that is something which is not finalized. Whenever we have something to report, obviously we will do that. But dollar certainly is one of the things which we are very much focused on at the moment.</p>
          <p>Cost inflation and until when will we see cost inflation, I mean, as a matter of principle, unfortunately cost inflation is a topic more or less every year. The question is how you deal with it. You just have seen the discussion we had in France with the unions and the struggle to achieve and to reach an agreement, which was done now. But I mean it is something which obviously affects your cost base where you have to find compensatory measures.</p>
          <p>So insofar in principle, this will be there. But in a normal world and as we see it now, this cost inflation should be covered by a corresponding inflation/impact, positive impact, on the pricing side. And that's what we are seeing now.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Sandy Morris, RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Top of the morning, everyone. Two very broad questions. One, is there any particular magic about hedging at 1.39, which is where we did it last year and where we were contend to do it in the first quarter? Is there some competitive position there that makes us happy to do it at 1.39?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, just looking at the Annual Report, I was a little surprised to see that we're still carrying capitalized R&amp;D on the A380. What I'd like to do is to interpret that as a sign we are confident that we can actually turn that program to a positive return with reasonable certainty. Would I be overly optimistic in thinking that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think you are overly optimistic. Indeed, we have some capitalized cost on the A380 according to, I would say, the methodology we have introduced which is based obviously on the accounting rules of IFRS. I could not give you now the stock of capitalized R&amp;D, but in 2009 the number was &#x2013; this is, yes, the 2009 &#x2013; the number was 46 million.</p>
          <p>And the capitalized cost as such in the balance sheet now end of the quarter &#x2013; I have to look at it &#x2013; I mean, for Airbus as a whole we have 670 million roughly. And it will be &#x2013; the majority of this will be A380 obviously. So that's what I can tell you. And then there is the question, obviously, is there an impairment risk? This is your underlying question, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I was trying to be positive really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, and I would share the positive view on that, so clearly &#x2013; I mean this is a very long-term program. And we built the business case, as you probably remember, on 750 aircraft. We have now a bit more than 200 in the backlog. Not all of the contracts &#x2013; or not all, as we have several &#x2013; many contracts not being at a loss. And that means, going forward, this program will make some money, and particularly hopefully if we get new business on board. So that is far too early to, I would say, put a question mark on this topic. At this point, I would share your optimism that this can be recovered.</p>
          <p>Magic on hedging, there is there no magic, Sandy. I am sorry, but I don't have a magic recipe how to deal with the subject. I mean, we simply, as you know, we have the philosophy that we are not absent from hedging nearly at any time. There was only a time when it was very weak: the dollar was at around 1.50, 1.55, where we changed our strategy to options, which by the way was a very wise decision and a very, you could say, profitable decision because the way we restructured them showed that we were rather successful with that. So this is what we are doing, and the more the dollar strengthens, the more ambitious we are getting with our so-called hedging grid where we define the speed of hedging depending on certain rates.</p>
          <p>And that leads us normally to something which smoothens the cycle and where we, on an average hedge rate compared to an average spot rate over the year, normally are a few cents better. So this is the whole magic we use and not more than that.</p>

          <p>And the next question is from Ben Fidler, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. At this time, three questions, if I could. The first one, I wondered if you can just help me to understand the potential impact on your loss making contract provisions, say, if we were to mark those to market at the current spot rate?</p>
          <p>Second question, if you can give me any update on how negotiations are progressing on the A400M with governments over the final settlement, and on your target completion for those?</p>
          <p>And the third question is, just wonder at what stage do you change the assumed FX rate that the commercial side of Airbus starts to use on aircraft bids? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben. Last question will be answered in the context of our next plan. There is at least the usual reasons we are looking at that, and for the time being I would not see yet a reason to change. With the current rate, obviously deals are looking more attractive.</p>
          <p>Potential impact of dollar was your first question on LMC, I think. That is a question which I addressed in, I think, on the hedging slide. We use, since end of last year, what we call a compounded rate, and we try not to change this rate other than once a year, which means with a year-end closing. So normally, you should expect no volatility this year on the LMC. But I have to say we are currently due to the, I would say, steep strengthening of the dollar, we are in a situation that we might get into what we would call, a triggering event for the accounting methodology to review whether the compounded rate would not have to be updated with our half-year figures.</p>
          <p>So you might see an update with the half-year. It needs to be discussed with auditors. I could not give you now numbers, but the big volatilities you have seen in the past certainly would not be seen, in my opinion. And compounded rates means we account for PDPs. And also for the cost side, with the historical rates, we take the hedge rates going forward as far as we are hedged; and for the open exposure, we take the planned rate and that gives you the compound of a dollar rate for evaluating the LMC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that compounded rate at the moment is &#x2013; just so we know where it was in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the compounded rate for 2009 is 1.35; and on the pound, 0.80.</p>

          <p>And A400M, the other question?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On A400M, yes, this one I was missing, update. Yes, after the signature of this principles of agreement, everybody was exhausted obviously. So we restarted now the negotiation for the contract amendment. You have seen some commenting in the press that the question how to deal with a price increase, in the context of the flexibility of 10 aircrafts we have given to the customers or we have agreed with the customers, is discussion between the customer nations currently. That is an ongoing subject.</p>
          <p>Other than that, we are progressing, and we had several meetings with all nations on the, so-called, export levy facility. So that progresses as well. Discussions are not as quick as we would like to see them, obviously. So we are not progressing at the pace we had hoped for in early March, but we are progressing. So there is, I would say, no critical situation up to now in those negotiations. So we need to progress and the target is obviously as quickly as possible. But I don't think it will be in May to close these subjects.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Jason Adams, Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions. The first one &#x2013; we've had questions about Power8 and we've had questions about cost inflation. I guess what I care is the potential for net cost savings. And so I am wondering, Hans Peter, when you look at Power8 and you look at what's happening on the cost inflation side, over the next three years do you think we can see net cost savings at EADS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a difficult question, Jason. I am not sure I have everything here on the top of my head to give you a somewhat precise answer. But this is &#x2013; what you look at obviously, you try to keep costs below inflation and you try to cover inflation on the revenue side. So that's usually what we have to try. But I could not give you now any precise indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question is on our Airbus profitability assumption for 2010. So at the full-year results, you and Louis, we kind of went over the guidance of 1 billion effectively implied Airbus breakeven this year at the EBIT level. But a lot of us care about the EBIT before one-off level, and you did 80 million in Q1. And I'm wondering, are we at a position where in 2010 you could say that Airbus should have a positive EBIT before one-off, and there's still quite a bit of certainty on what the actual EBIT could be and we're shooting for breakeven there? Or, do you think EBIT before one-off &#x2013; are we still targeting a breakeven for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, Jason, we have not changed our view. So we see, as you have implied, the breakeven for this year, and then we'll follow that up in the next conference call in July.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Zafar Khan, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, please. Yes, good morning, it's Zafar Khan. Two questions, please. One on the A380, quite encouraging what you're saying about the improvements there, Hans Peter. Can you give us some idea of when you think that program might be breaking even in terms of the Airbus P&amp;L? Because Tom Enders was quoted as saying that that would be a drag for the Group for a very long time. But your comments are positive. So I'm hoping that you will tell us that that will turn positive soon.</p>
          <p>And the second one was just on the A380 margin. I think in answer to Doug's question, you were saying that if these currency rates are sustained, then hopefully we may see a couple of percent improvement in the long term to Airbus margin. I guess what you mean is that you may upgrade from the 5% guidance you gave on Airbus margin, now to 2014, to perhaps 7, 8%. Is that a correct reading on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not precisely. I mean, we have not confirmed this 5% guidance in our recent discussions. So I would not confirm the 5%, but in principle the logic is right.</p>
          <p>On A380, and breakeven on A380, I mean, provided the progress we see and also the maturity of the aircraft, which still needs to be improved, is progressing, certainly there is some, I would say, hope that towards the end of the planning horizon we are approaching this breakeven. But it is really not to be understood as guidance.</p>
          <p>It's just, I would say, extrapolation probably of current trends. So that does not look so bad, in other words. So we will see the breakeven somewhere on the A380. We will see it particularly, obviously, if the dollar is at rates as we see them today. I mean, that might impact very positively the whole situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the planning horizon, what is this planning horizon you're talking about?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now take our last question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question is from Christophe M&#xE9;nard; Bryan, Garnier. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Question on the working cap. I was wondering, you mentioned higher inventory levels and higher cash outflow to suppliers. What is the cause of higher inventories, would be the first question?</p>
          <p>And the second one is, the cash outflow to suppliers appears to be higher than in the previous year. Is it a seasonal pattern, or do you see a trend for the rest of the year? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the last one. It's a seasonal pattern. I don't see any change to previous years. So quarter one is typically rather weak in terms of cash flow. And the first one was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one was on the higher inventories. Is it related to Airbus? Is it related to other divisions? And is it also a seasonal pattern or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's related to all the divisions more or less, particularly, Astrium and Defence and Airbus. So we see it in the divisions, and it's also kind of a seasonality pattern.</p>
          <p>As we said before, on the Airbus side, we see lower increases than we have seen in the last two years. So that also shows probably some progress, but nothing I would say particular on that.</p>
