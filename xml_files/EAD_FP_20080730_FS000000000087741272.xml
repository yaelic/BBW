          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the EADS Conference Call regarding the H1 2008 earnings release. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Let me now turn the floor over to your hosts Louis Gallois, Hans Peter Ring and Nathalie Errard.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS H1 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Louis Gallois, our CEO and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour and 15 minutes and should conclude at 12.15 PM Continental European Time. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also webcast to access with a special banner for H1 2008 Earnings. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was e-mailed to you this morning with slides, which we will now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now, to Louis Gallois.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Nathalie. Welcome to everybody and thank you for attending our today's call. One of the strategies of EADS here today is to make the continued improvement at our company more open to the investor community.</p>
          <p>With our performance still below our long-term growth, our cash generation is strong and the underlying performance is robust, in spite of the economic obstacles before us. I believe that we are making progress toward a better company. It is important to keep a boarder picture of EADS in mind. Why do I say this?  First, EADS continues to register strong commercial gains despite a weaker macroeconomic trend. Certainly the next month will be decisive to understand how the airlines can adapt to this pressure and adjust the order strategy. We will remain vigilant.</p>
          <p>Our top line continues to grow. We have some cash position and sustained a stronger than ever backlog. Demand is better than anyone had reason to expect, and our product mix clearly meets this demand.</p>
          <p>Second, look to our strong underlying performance. The EBIT before program charges is significantly above target, thanks to cost containment and robust margins on our Airbus legacy programs. It also proves that Eurocopter Defence and Space businesses are all delivering increasingly satisfying profitability.</p>
          <p>Third, we are delivering on Power8 above plan and we intend to go beyond the &#x20AC;2.1 billion already committed. We will talk about Power8 Plus later, given the dollar headwind we recognize the need to do more in addition to the &#x20AC;2.1 billion already committed. I shall give you more information in a few minutes. EADS is improving and will continue to improve its competitiveness through further efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>Fourth, another plus for the long term is that the management of EADS is closer, more integrated and more performance focused than ever. Recent media headlines rising from the insider cases could seem distracting, but if you look closely you see that the job is being done with dedication. I could confirm that personally.</p>
          <p>The mission of EADS leadership is to responsibly manage our business for the long term, use cash conservatively, and press on with the strategy we have described to you in earlier meetings. Dollarization through globalization optimizing or reinforcing our solid position in the difference space, security and services areas, and at the same time resolving the problems we face in our large aircraft programs, such as the A380 ramp up and the A400M development.</p>
          <p>With this point in mind, let's address our financial presentation. As Nathalie said, have a look to Page 2 of the Safe Harbor statement and please remember that all forward-looking statements such as in our guidance are based on assumptions. As conditions made change so may our projections and plans.</p>
          <p>I would now turn toward the main first half of 2008 business achievements, Hans Peter will follow with the Group and division performance, then I will close with a discussion of our guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, on to Page 4. As I said, demand of EADS products remains robust. Traffic is growing although at a slower pace. We recognize that increasing energy costs are having an impact on overall airline profitability and certainly on the appetite for ordering new airplanes. Yet continued strong demand for modern fuel-efficient aircraft in Asia and the Middle East coupled with our limited exposure to the US market have made our aircraft business resilient.</p>
          <p>Airbus booked 525 gross orders in the first half and following the success at Farnborough, we will boost that level to 772 firm orders, exceeding our expectation by far. Of the 247 firm orders in Farnborough we took 98 new orders for the A350. Given strong customer desire for this aircraft, the order tally is now 472 units including Farnborough's orders. And I don't take into account the 30 more orders in the letter of intent signed by Emirates in Hamburg the day before yesterday.</p>
          <p>14 more aircraft were delivered in the first half 2008 than a year ago, and the day before yesterday we achieved another milestone on the A380 program with the first delivery to Emirates. The A400M is progressing slower than expected. In June, the first complete A400M rolled out in Seville. The Flying Test Bed activity will begin in the next weeks, even later than expected. The team is dedicated to achieve the first flight in autumn and has a strong focus on system installation integration.</p>
          <p>As you are already aware, based upon GAO [US Government Accountability Office] review, the US Department of Defense has decided to reopen the bidding process based on the eight points raised. We remain convinced that we have the most suitable aircraft for the US Air Force refueling activity, and are prepared to support Northrop Grumman in rapidly fulfilling the US Air Force requirements.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter's backlog remains at record high, and an additional 475 orders were booked in H1 2008, taking the backlog to more than &#x20AC;14.5 billion. The ongoing ramp-up led to 254 deliveries in the first half including 14 LUH in the States and nine NH90.</p>
          <p>We have achieved several wins in Astrium, the Galileo renegotiation is complete, the structure has been simplified, contract will now be held directly between these and segment prime contractors chosen after competitive dialogue. Since early May, the Giove-B navigation test satellite has been successful transmitting the highly precise Galileo signal. The third Skynet 5 military satellite was launched successfully, completing the constellation. This represents 26th successful launch for Ariane 5.</p>
          <p>In Defence we are gaining momentum, we now have the capabilities to supply large spectrum of UAV systems, for example SIDM which is now operational, and the many UAV systems such as DRAC and Trackers. We won a major contract to equip German military airfields with new control radar systems.</p>
          <p>Our Power8 savings plan is progressing well across the key modules and delivering results. Performance tracking against 2008 targets demonstrate strong progress. I would like to remind you that Power8 over-delivered against 2007 targets. And you see the result in the high level of cash generation and our strong underlying business.</p>
          <p>Our key cash contributors are coming from the maximized cash module, where strong focus on financial working capital improvement is visibly delivering results as well as the cash control in CapEx. The harmonization of supply chain and logistics is also making solid contributions to our cash. For example we continue towards a more global sourcing strategy. We have selected 28 strategic suppliers of engineering services as Tier One suppliers comprising four Indians and 24 European Union-based companies out of the existing pool of approximately 2,000.</p>
          <p>Airbus has also recently signed an agreement with Kuehne + Nagel and as our logistics supplier reducing the number of providers down from 15 to one, and has awarded a contract to DHL to act as our lead transport provider. The key contributors for EBIT savings has reduced overhead cost and Smart Buying models. Airbus has made considerable progress in the reduction in its number of internal workforce, securing approximately 40% of this element of the reduced overhead cost model. Structural plans are in place to ensure the delivery of 2010 targets.</p>
          <p>In Smart Buying we are making considerable progress towards savings, notably in our general procurement activities and in the rationization of our IT and communications systems and processes. Redesign to cost activities are also bringing savings, for example changing materials used on certain parts with limited rectification costs.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, the three modules designed to focus on the aerostructures are taking more time to implement. The side divestment strategy is progressing according to the new schedule. The aerostructures carve-out is progressing in France and Germany and the new aerostructures company will &#x2013; must comply with the full original Power8 target. They will be in place the 1st of January 2009.</p>
          <p>The sale of Laupheim to Diehl/Thales is nearing completion in line with our cost and cash targets with the negotiation with GKN are in the final stages. You know that in addition we are entering into negotiation for the sale of the majority stake in Socata to DAHER.</p>
          <p>Power8 Plus EADS is on the way to launch. An overall saving plan called Power8 Plus with the potential to generate savings of &#x20AC;1 billion across EADS in 2011 for delivery in 2012, in addition to Power8. For Airbus, the program will expand on the progress of current Power8 initiatives beyond the &#x20AC;2.1 billion after 2010. Furthermore it will be much more structural in value. It will focus on the expansion of our global industrial footprint and the internationalization of our cost base that is currently dominated by the euro. This means that it will change the structure of our value chain. Obviously, this will require some time.</p>
          <p>Savings will come from all divisions. In Airbus and Eurocopter our strong commercial success can help stimulate our global progression. We aim to use the increased workload to reap benefits from outsourcing a part of that growth, without harming our industrial European bases. &#x20AC;1 billion of savings beyond Power8 to be obtained within the two-year timeframe is a challenge, but we are determined and focused on achieving this goal. We will present measures to the European Works Councils after summer break and we'll provide you with more details on the program after informing the concerned bodies inside the area.</p>
          <p>Now we'll look at the earnings in more depth. Hans Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis and good morning, everybody from my side as well and a very early good morning to the ones following us from the US. I am now on Slide 8.</p>
          <p>First I would like to remind you that EBITDA is now consolidated at 37.5% and half year 2007 figures has been adjusted accordingly. In H1 2008 revenues grew by 8% across all divisions despite the negative dollar impact of &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Higher deliveries in Airbus and Eurocopter volume ramp-up in Astrium and Defence and the achievement of the A400M milestone which fueled the Defence revenues all provided positive contributions.</p>
          <p>We will expand on the EBIT explanation shortly and I will emphasis the good underlying performance, the non-recurring charges and some temporary excess volume hedging effects. As Louis said, pre-Farnborough order intake remains strong, also below last year where Le Bozay was included in H1.</p>
          <p>The first half 2008 includes strong inflow in orders from Airbus, Eurocopter and the FSTA order intake. Backlog remains at record levels, increasing 4% compared to year-end figures despite a &#x20AC;17 billion revaluation impact at the dollar spot rate at the end of June. The Defence order book grew by 6% to almost &#x20AC;58 billion, driven mainly by the FSTA contract.</p>
          <p>Let's take a closer look now at our EBIT performance on Slide 9. We have taken this slide, it replaces the usual EBIT bridge, which you can now find in the Appendix on Page 24. It is an attempt to develop something like an underlying EBIT knowing that this is difficult because of the dollar reference and reconciliations on the dollar.</p>
          <p>It shows how strong we are in our Airbus legacy programs. This slide demonstrates the underlying EBIT trend in stripping out non-operational and non-recurring items. Firstly, we confirm the A380 delivery assumptions communicated to you in May, 12 in '08, 21 in '09 and the progressive ramp-up thereafter.</p>
          <p>On this basis we have made a financial assessment of the program which has triggered a revision to the loss making contract provision resulting in a charge of &#x20AC;715 million on H1 2008 EBIT. The main part of the provision update has been booked against inventory.</p>
          <p>You are aware that as the dollar deteriorates so do our loss making contract provisions. The deterioration of the dollar between the year-end spot rate, which is 1.47 and that of the end of June, i.e. 1.58 has lead to a revaluation of all loss making contracts amounting to &#x20AC;700 million.</p>
          <p>H1 benefited from temporary excess volume of matured hedges because those hedges were put place before the A380 delivery shift of 2006. Later in the year less hedging volumes will mature compared to the exposure causing a negative phasing impact in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>This half, other one-offs include the dollar mismatch impact coming from the reversal of the pre-delivery payments, the revaluation of trade liabilities and the sell-down and provision release of customers financing at Airbus.</p>
          <p>To conclude, despite a difficult macroeconomic environment the positive trend I've talked about already in Q1 is confirmed, driven by cost savings and positive volume effect.</p>
          <p>Now as we come to Slide 10 we see that EBIT margin reached now 5.9% in the first half of 2008. R&amp;D decreased to &#x20AC;1.1 billion in H1, but it is expected to ramp up through the year to around a number of around &#x20AC;2.8 billion. The interest result mainly echoes higher average rates and net cash balance through H1.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile other financial result deteriorated by about &#x20AC;370 million. This is mainly due to the revaluation of dollar cash assets at the closing spot rate of 158 and due to unwinding of the discount on provisions whose present value grows as we move towards their consumption. In the second quarter it also includes some revaluation of financing liabilities.</p>
          <p>The earnings improvement leads to a tax expense of &#x20AC;232 million compared to &#x20AC;30 million last year due to some impairment of deferred tax assets in the UK. Therefore, our tax rate for the full year should now be above 30%. On the bottom line it leads to a net income of &#x20AC;403 million from H1 2008 compared to &#x20AC;71 million in H1 of last year.</p>
          <p>On Slide 11 we talk about our hedging strategy. In H1 we have taken decisive action with regard to our hedging activities. We continue to use hedging instruments to protect our cash flows, but recognizing that the US dollar is at an all time low instead of only locking in hedges with forward contracts at today's rates we have also invested in a hedging premium to give us more flexibility.</p>
          <p>We added plain vanilla options to our hedging instruments in the first half of the year to capture potential upside from a strengthening US dollar over the coming years. We have purchased around $7 billion in plain vanilla options with a maturity between 2010 and 2012 at a premium of around &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Accounting-wise the premium is recorded as an asset and expense over time. The cash outflow for the premium is in the change in working capital in the cash flow statement. If we exercise the option, the profit is recorded in the EBIT line. In any case the asset will be eliminated via the depreciation mechanism in the other financial result.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to Page 12 where we have the traditional hedging slide. As discussed, the hedging portfolio now includes both the forward contracts and the structured forward and plain vanilla options. Despite the weak dollar we have further increased our hedge book from 51 billion to $59 billion.</p>
          <p>It was done by adding plain vanilla call options to the hedging instrument we use, whereas $9.5 billion of hedges matured, $17.2 billion of new hedges were done in H1 2008 at a weighted average rate of $1.50 per euro. It is worth mentioning that interest spreads between currencies mitigated the impact of the extensively deteriorated dollar spot rate on the dollars forward rates.</p>
          <p>The high order inflow dilutes the hedged Airbus eligible exposure to around 51%. Nevertheless, even if we modify the pace of hedging activities we make sure net exposure of the next two calendar years is nearly hedged.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 13, the cash flow in H1 2008, you can see that this is remaining robust, &#x20AC;2.4 billion gross cash flow from operations is in line with good operational performance. In H1 2008 working capital had a negative &#x20AC;690 million effect on cash flow mainly due to payments to suppliers and payments for the option premiums I mentioned. Increase of pre-delivery payments of &#x20AC;1.8 billion across all divisions compensates the usual growth in inventories.</p>
          <p>Compared with last year, inventory grew much less on the A380 program, meanwhile the inflow of pre-delivery payments on the Airbus orders and Defence &amp; Security programs were more favorable this year. Investing activities consumed only &#x20AC;0.7 billion of cash in H1. Saving effects in Power8 improvements contributed to lower industrial CapEx.</p>
          <p>An additional benefit came from a positive net contribution from sell-down down of customer financing assets compared to a cash-out in the first half of '07. The line others include the payments for acquisitions like Plant CML and the dividend from Dasso.</p>
          <p>We expect CapEx to reach around &#x20AC;2 billion for the full year. Free cash flow before customer financing has improved significantly to &#x20AC;962 million at the end of June 2008 versus minus &#x20AC;29 million last year. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that in subsequent quarters we will be deploying significant cash towards settlements, restructuring expenses and CapEx.</p>
          <p>At the end of June the net cash position reached a healthy &#x20AC;8.1 billion. We will now dig into each division performance, Louis is going to present to you the other slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Hans Peter, thank you. We are at Page 15. Airbus continues to book orders, thanks to a balanced global marketing footprint and a great product mix.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver on our ramp-up plans and with good on-time delivery for A320, A330 families, which drives strong underlying profitability. We remain resilient to low activity in the US since the region accounts for only 11%, as I said, of our backlog.</p>
          <p>We see continuing momentum from the Middle East and Asia. Aircraft results are considerably more active in orders, but as I said, we are vigilant, looking at the impact of all price increase on the will or the capacity of airlines to order airplanes.</p>
          <p>Deliveries remain at record levels. We delivered 245 aircraft in H1 and 44 in June. We have also achieved new milestone in July for the A380 with, as I said, the delivery of the first of the 58 aircraft for Emirates. Revenues are consequently up 5%, driven by growth in delivery and also the A400M Power-on milestone in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Robust growth continues despite headwind from the dollar and the effect of the deterioration in price. As we already mentioned, we are working on compensating this effect with Power8 Plus.</p>
          <p>H1 2008 EBIT is showing a strong underlying pattern, mainly driven by the excellent performance of the deliveries of the A320 and the 230 families. It is weighted down by the A380 revised loss making contract assessment, lower pricing for first half deliveries and the different dollar impacts already mentioned.</p>
          <p>We must bear in mind that future quarters maybe impacted by the increase of R&amp;D and the reversal of the positive temporary excess volume hedging impact of H1. Progress towards a more international footprint continues as the first aircraft parts are shipped to the China final assembly line.</p>
          <p>Agreements have been signed for composite aerospace manufacturing centers with HAIG in China and Mubadala in Abu Dhabi, which will also join Airbus in developing engineering, R&amp;D, and M&amp;O capabilities. We have also reached an agreement with Russia's VSMPO for the long-term supply of titanium across all Airbus model until 2020.</p>
          <p>Now, Hans Peter is going to walk you for the other divisions. Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let's now come to Military Transport Aircraft on Page or Slide 16. In H1 '08 the division's revenues more than doubled to 898 million mainly due to the achievement of the A400M Power-on milestone and an increase in invoicing for the Tanker and Medium and Light activity. EBIT has improved slightly from a &#x20AC;29 million loss in H1 2007 to a loss of &#x20AC;20 million for the first half of this year. The loss is driven by a temporary delay in Medium and Light aircraft deliveries.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong order momentum. The order book stands at more than &#x20AC;23 billion. We've booked 18 MRTTs in the first half with orders from the UK, Saudi Arabia and the US; and two CN-235, one each for customers in US and Botswana.</p>
          <p>As Louis already mentioned, the US DoD has reopened the KC-45 bid process on the points raised by the GAO. Consequently, the assigned green aircraft is being held in Dresden, no modifications specific to the US Tanker have been made.</p>
          <p>On the A400M we already mentioned the successful roll out in Seville in June. MSN1 is currently undergoing functional testing as well as systems installation and integration. Considerable effort is being concentrated on the achievement of a first flight in autumn. The study specimen has been performing structural tests since March. Test cases to achieve first flight clearance are underway. The TP400 engine installed on the Flying Test Bed performed the first ground run successfully in June. The challenging ground test program continues prior to the first flight of the Flying Test Bed in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter continues to gain momentum across its business segments. This is now Page 17. During the first half, Eurocopter's revenues increased by 9% compared to the same period last year, driven by strong volume in both serial [helicopters] and development activities. 254 helicopters were delivered compared to 209 in the first half 2007.</p>
          <p>Strong order flow has boosted backlog to more than &#x20AC;14 billion. EBIT for the first half '08 compared favorably with the first half '07, which included an exceptional charge for the NH90. The improvement was driven by volume increase, which partially offsets the negative impact from foreign exchange and higher R&amp;D. The NH90 program margin has been reduced following last year's adjustment.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter continues to expand in its services business. As we previously stated, Eurocopter derives more than 30% of its revenues from services. A further step to increasing this activity is the acquisition of an MRO company called Motorflug Baden-Baden in Germany, which is currently pending antitrust confirmation, and we have also seen an increase in the retrofit business activity in Germany.</p>
          <p>NH90 ramp-up is progressing. The structure has been optimized and the qualification process has been simplified for both the tactical transport and naval versions. Nine helicopters were delivered to the end of June, including the first to Finland. 20 have now been delivered to date. 12 firm orders were booked in the second quarter for the French DGA.</p>
          <p>Tiger received step two qualification acceptance in May and further qualification continues. More than 10,000 flight hours have been booked across the fleet. Three deliveries were booked in H1. Production ramp-up levels for the UH72A in Columbus were achieved in June as planned. A total of 14 helicopters were delivered in the first half. Eurocopter has now delivered in total 32 UH72A Lakota helicopters to the US Army ahead of schedule with full operational capability.</p>
          <p>Let's now speak about Astrium on the next slide. High levels of innovation, a strong focus on efficiency and solid competitive positioning are evident in the Astrium results. The order book is robust, revenues are up 20% and EBIT has nearly doubled. Astrium generated revenues of &#x20AC;1.7 billion in the first half '08. This strong increase was driven by Paradigm Services and increased Ariane 5 production.</p>
          <p>EBIT almost doubled, driven by a ramp-up in Paradigm Services and operational improvements in Space Transportation that more than compensated for the unfavorable impact of the declining British pound to euro exchange rate on Paradigm.</p>
          <p>Astrium was awarded two Earth Observation contracts by the European Space Agency in the second quarter. Sentinel-2, a contract for an optical satellite worth &#x20AC;195 million and EarthCARE, a contract worth 263 million, which will focus on atmospheric radiation. Added to the Betty Collance in Q1, this demonstrates our strong presence in this activity.</p>
          <p>In addition, the European Space Agency awarded a service agreement worth 275 million to Astrium, representing a transfer of all activities involved in the operation of the European portion of the International Space Station. As Louis, already mentioned, the Galileo structure is now simplified and the Giove-B navigation test satellite is delivering results.</p>
          <p>Skynet reached important milestones in Q2. Operational service acceptance was received in April from the UK MoD with a high level of satisfaction. Paradigm has made advances towards increasing third-party revenues. The first contract has been awarded to the US &#x2013; in the US to provide expand satellite connectivity for the DoD.</p>
          <p>If we turn to Defence &amp; Security on Slide 19, I firstly would like to remind you that MBDA is now consolidated as I have said at the beginning with 37.5% in both half years. Revenues in Defence are up 5% to &#x20AC;2.17 billion driven by growth in Eurofighter and Defence Electronics and the first consolidation in May of Plant CML, the company we acquired in the US. The strong increase in EBIT is driven by considerable operating performance across all businesses and cost reduction initiatives.</p>
          <p>Eurofighter and missile activities in particular improved their profitability providing a sound basis to grow the division, which already benefits from much improved margins. The seasonality pattern of the earnings in Defence usually very much back-loaded should continue in 2008, but keeping in mind that H1 enjoyed more a favorable mix.</p>
          <p>Order intake is above &#x20AC;2.3 billion driven by a high level of orders in Defence Electronics and new export contracts in Secure Networks and MBDA. It is worth mentioning the export weight which amounts to 34% of the total figure and represents around &#x20AC;800 million. Defence continues to deliver UAV success. The French Interim MALE [medium-altitude longendurance] UAV system SIDM successfully completed flight acceptance in June. The first batch of 25 product systems has been delivered to the Ministry of Defense and following these deliveries an order for a second batch of 35 of these mini-UAVs has been placed by the French Defense Procurement Agency.</p>
          <p>EADS is currently the only European company capable of meeting the requirements from strategic to technical, both large and mini-UAV systems. We have submitted two Eurofighter proposals, one to the Indian Ministry of Defense for the replacement of the MiG-21s by 2025 and another one for the Swiss combat aircraft program and we focus on securing the third tranche of Eurofigher for the four launch nations.</p>
          <p>On the Services side, DS was awarded of a five-year contract with a value of &#x20AC;92 million for target demonstration in medium speed range combined with live electronic warfare training for the German Bundeswehr.</p>
          <p>On the Security side an aerodrome surveillance radar contract worth around 200 million to replace air traffic control radars and identification systems for German military air fields was awarded in early July. This confirms a strong market presence in radars for the segment and significant progress in flight safety.</p>
          <p>Finally, a few words on other businesses on Page 20. I would like to remind you that EADS North America is now consolidated in other businesses rather than in Defence &amp; Security, first half of last year has been accordingly adjusted. The different divisions will continue to report their relevant work share of their activities in the US in their results.</p>
          <p>In the first half 2008, EADS North America sales mainly include the revenues linked to being prime contract holder of the LUH program. Revenues and EBIT of other businesses are roughly stable with some negative effect from foreign exchange. Sogerma confirms economic recovery in its seats activity. Two new contracts have been booked for the new business, passenger seat for Thai Airways for the A380 and Etihad for the A330. The division has also been awarded the contract for the A350 XWB pilot seats.</p>
          <p>ATR continues to ramp up deliveries in 2008. 22 aircraft were delivered, an additional seven aircraft are awaiting delivery. Seven orders were booked in H1 and the order book reached 180 aircraft at the end of June. EFW aerostructures business performance is mostly compensating for a temporary slowdown in the phasing of freighter conversions. Future business markets will benefit from the new cooperation with Lufthansa Technik for the conversion and modification of Airbus aircraft in partnerships with Russian Irkut and UAC on the A320, 321 freighter conversion.</p>
          <p>EADS Socata delivered 21 aircraft to the end of June and there's a backlog of 91 aircraft. EADS has opened exclusive negotiations for the acquisition of a majority interest by DAHER in EADS Socata. This aims to generate a major actor in the area of aerostructures and aviation business and generate a One Tier partner for the A350 XWB. On June 30, 2008, the order book of other businesses stood at &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>Louis, it's now up to you to comment on our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Hans Peter. First I remind you that the EADS guidance is based on the closings portrait at year-end 2008 of &#x20AC;1 for $1.45 US. EADS expects Airbus to capture above 850 aircraft orders in 2008. EADS revenues are expected to exceed &#x20AC;40 billion in 2008, consistent with about 470 aircraft deliveries for the full year.</p>
          <p>EADS expects its 2008 EBIT to reach &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Obviously the strong underlying performance generated across all businesses in the first half of 2008 provides some upside potential. Nevertheless, the program development of the A400M requires us to remain cautious. The Group expects that the result of the first flight test and further negotiations with customers and suppliers will provide a sound basis for the finalization of the cost completion exercise on A400M program.</p>
          <p>The weakening of the closings portrait at year-end 2008 could have negative impact on earnings linked to the re-evaluation at the deteriorated US dollar rate of some Airbus balance sheet items including loss making contract provisions. Before the impact of customer financing, EADS expect 2008 free cash flow at above &#x20AC;1 billion, if this current trend is confirmed and keeping in mind it is the most volatile item to predict.</p>
          <p>Now, ladies and gentlemen, Hans Peter and myself will now take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Colin Crook from UBS here. Two questions, one, I'm just trying to understand your underlying EBIT number, I'm trying to reconcile Slide 9 with Slide 24. Slide 24 I think was the previous format in terms of the one-off nature and there seems to be a difference in the PDPs, where PDPs are positive of 200 million in the first quarter. And it seems to be zero on Slide 24 for the first half. So it implies it's negative, and yet you've got a 277 million one-off on Slide 9. The only other thing that you mentioned was release of customer financing provision. Should I assume that that was the scale of the release in the first half, is the first question.</p>

          <p>I think in the slide on Page 24 we are building the bridge between last year's and this year's result.

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question just relates to the A380 loss making contract or loss making charge you put through. It seems to come through much higher than you indicated on the Q1 call. Why don't you give us an explanation of that?  And then you also talk about it part being written off to inventory and part being written off to provision. I wonder if you could give us the breakdown of how that roughly splits?</p>
          <p>And then, should I assume that the write-off on &#x2013; to inventory is essentially the extra cost of building the thing and the provision is essentially for penalties?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, yes. First of all, if you say it's much higher than we have indicated on the conference call, I do not remember we have given any indication on...</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...that because actually, at this point in time we did not really know about the cost situation on the program going forward, because the industrial plan was not yet clear enough. Insofar, I think this is one part of your question or one answer to one part of your question, inventory and provision, that we have split it obviously against &#x2013; most of it is against inventories and I would &#x2013; I mean most of it, by far the most part is in inventories. I would not provide you with a precise figure, but it is mostly in inventories as we said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And that implies that the penalty is relatively small?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank UK. Mr. Fiddler, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Again a couple of questions please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, just coming back to your clean Airbus profit performance in the first half of the year, where based on Slide 9, you're looking at something around the 11% or so margin level. As we look into 2009 and 2010, in the past you've talked about a 5%, even maybe less than 5% margin in the business plan for Airbus. Are you now reappraising that in the light of the underlying margin you achieved in the first half? That would be the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's immediately answer that. I think it is too early to really appreciate what we told you with &#x2013; I think it was with the March conference call. I would think for this, we would need already a new plan, which we only deliver towards the end of this year. There are a lot of moving parts now. We expect the second half and this is what you can take from the guidance, to be weaker in Airbus than it has been in the first half due to a number of impacts which were favorable in the first half and which are going to be less favorable in the second half. So it does not mean that you can extrapolate the good underlying performance of H1 for the full year in Airbus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you. Second question, just coming back to that A380 charge, the  &#x20AC;715 million, presumably most of it is written-off inventory, this is money that you've clearly already spent that's been capitalized that historically should have been expensed really. I mean, what scope is there for further charges necessary on the 380 after this 715, bearing in mind if this is written-off against inventory, it's all historical looking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not what it is. This is what we need to invest on Wave 2 now. So this is &#x2013; these are costs, which we are going to spend over the next years still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably this money, if it's written-off against inventory, the stuff is already in inventory, therefore effectively the cash has already been...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cash-wise, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...from these things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in EBIT terms &#x2013; yes, cash-wise a lot of it should be in inventories already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But with the small amount in provisions, you wouldn't expect to see further charges on 380?  In your mindset this now clears on the basis of your current plan for Wave 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good morning, gentlemen. I have a couple as well please. You've talked about the A380 loss making contract adjustments of 715. Could you give us a little bit more color on the other in Airbus was 700, where those are? And what is the absolute number that we are adjusting?  Clearly it must be a big number for it to have gone up by another 700 on this change in the spot rate. So if you could help us with that that, I'd be grateful. And then I have one other after that please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Zafar, yes, these 700 are &#x2013; I mean the difference coming from the dollar revaluation of the loss making contracts we have. So it means it is the difference between the year-end spot rate, 147 and the 157 point something we have now for the half year closing.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

I mean, 1.8, Louis with respect is just a kind of number which just seems plucked from the air. How can you talk about 1,996 underlying EBIT in H1 and only talk about 600 in H2?</p>

Airbus had 700 million in the first half and we have revalued the provisions as we just discussed with another 700. So the LMC was 700, I mean.</p>
          <p>hen what we see in the second half of the year here is we have dollar excess hedges in the first half, which will reverse in the second. And we have I think given you a number for that, which was 300 million. We anticipate, as I said I think in the speech, we anticipate growing R&amp;D, significantly growing R&amp;D in the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being we anticipate that the volume, because we are now at 245, we say we are at more than 470, so we are with the volumes a little bit ahead of our schedule.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing is concerned, it is I would say nearly evenly split between the two halves of the year, probably a little bit back-loaded but not as significantly as it was last year. And we anticipate also in the second half along with further A380s going into service, some increase on the support cost on that, less sales finance contributions. In the first half you have seen that we again contributed something from that. Some Power8 non-recurring costs and we have seen also a front-loading of customer service contributions in Airbus. So, all of that makes &#x2013; let us be a little bit careful for the second half.</p>
          <p>Now if you ask upside, what is that, where is it coming from? It is coming from the volume, so if everything goes well there is upside on the volume. The question will be are we able to I would say spend the money on R&amp;D?  The first half was rather low in terms of activity. And last but not least, there are some other structural, more structural costs I have mentioned where the question is, is it really that we will spend everything we anticipate currently? So, there are some upside elements and provided everything goes well especially on the volume side, I think we are &#x2013; we see some as we say upside.</p>
          <p>And last but not least as we said already on the first quarter, we obviously have also included some contingency. This is I would say the upside part and then what Louis said in the guidance is we see risk on A400M currently, particularly we are little bit behind the schedule on the Flying Test Bed. It does not mean that this is now a big, big problem; but we have to be vigilant in the second half in terms of following that program. I don't know, Louis, whether you want to mention something to the A400M?</p>

          <p>Morning, everyone. I can still hear Zafar in the background, no, he probably doesn't understand.</p>
          <p>One question, and a very simple one, if we have marked-to-market the provisions in Airbus to 157 but we're working to 145 for the year-end and for the guidance, aren't we missing out the fact that we would get a big write back in terms of this mark-to-market driven by the weaker dollar? I mean I just need to understand what's in and isn't in the guidance. Does that make sense?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes, two questions. First one is just rounding off on the A380 charges and whether that now you think covers everything that you expect to charge going through to full rate ramp-up or whether this is actually just from the unit delivery slippage that you announced earlier in the year. So is the review still going to throw up more charges?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on A400M and first flight, it seems then you're saying first flight should still be before year-end and therefore any charges you need to book, you still expect to book in 2008, not spilling over into next year, is that the right expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps on the A380 charges, we don't anticipate new provision to be taken on the A380 with the vision we have also program today. It's as Hans Peter said, it includes penalties on the airplanes, which are delayed and also cost of rents on the airplanes of Wave 2. On the A400M, the first flight is slightly delayed because we have some issues on the Flying Test Bed, with the interim instrumentation of the engine of the Flying Test Bed. It's longer than expected.</p>
          <p>We have sent a team to Marshall in the UK to help them to instrument the engine. But we're expecting the first flight of the Flying Test Bed mid-July and we are now more on mid-August. It means that we are losing time and it's not easy because the flight &#x2013; the first flight of the Flying Test Bed have to be in non-wet atmosphere, and we are flying in England. It means that we are delaying the first flight of the airplane for &#x2013; slightly delaying the first flight of the airplane. We think we could &#x2013; we will fly in autumn. There is no direct or cost of run linked to that, but you know that when we are delaying a milestone in a program, it could trigger some expenses.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everybody. Vincent Becker, Sal Oppenheim. One very simple question I think, tax rate in the first half comes out at some 36%, must not include your &#x2013; or is this a fair guidance for the full year?  And the second question beyond half year reporting and beyond 2008, could you comment and explain a little bit at Airbus your exposure to the low cost carriers having in mind the production slots, easyJet, Indigo, etc. and delivery plans, has here something changed having in mind the trouble in the industry there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the first one on tax rate, we had some one-offs as I explained before, mainly some impairment of tax assets, which drives it to 36 in the first half. This is not what we expect for the full year because in the second year we don't envisage at least at this point, further allowances of that kind. So it would be somewhere in between, I guess, the 30 and the 36%, roughly halfway, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair enough. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your exposure towards...</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Low cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Towards low cost, exactly. Yes, obviously we have some exposure for &#x2013; towards low cost airlines in 2009 and also in 2010 which is not insignificant. One is the one you mentioned, it is easyJet, but there are other ones as well, be it Air Berlin, be it AirAsia, so it's not only in Europe, it's also outside. So, there are obviously exposures towards those airlines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I may, Hans Peter. Low cost airlines doesn't mean weak airlines. Some of them are strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could say that easyJet is a strong airline. And we have &#x2013; we know that other are weaker than easyJet. Mainly low cost airlines are on A320 program, mainly. And I have to say that we have a buffer with over-booking on A320, which means that we are &#x2013; we will be resilient. And we don't &#x2013; for the time being, we are on our program of increasing, ramping up the production to 40 airplane per month in 2010, '11. We are not changing our strategy on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So no major cancellations or postponements of orders, is that what you're saying as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the beginning of the year, we have received 38 cancellation demands, part of them are linked to A350 conversion from the first version to the second one. We could anticipate more, for example Skybus which is in Chapter 7 and which has orders for the A320 in the States. But for the time being Skybus wants to keep the slots to certainly to try to sell them because the slot has value and you know that we prefer to do that ourselves.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have two questions. First one is a reconciliation of Page 24 and 9 again, but not on the same topic we had already discussed. It's the gap between A380 revised LMC of 600 million on Page 24 and 715 on Page 9? This is my first question. My second question is a 1 billion Power8 Plus saving plan. How would you split this plan between Airbus and the other divisions? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question and I shall leave first one for Hans Peter. We share Power8 Plus in a proportion which is exactly the proportion of the two activities &#x2013; the activities in the revenues of the company. It means that 60 &#x2013; &#x20AC;650 million will come from Airbus and 350 from other activities and headquarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, two questions. First on Power8, you described that you were at &#x20AC;400 million, a quarter million euro run rate now. Could you describe what the run rate, that's 400 million plus what you've captured that eventually you're confident will turn into that, to additional savings? And then how that breaks down over the pieces of Power8, overhead reductions, Smart Buying, lean manufacturing and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That &#x2013; I mean I will not now give you an exact breakdown across all the eight elements of Power8, but the major contributors of the 400 million are coming from the Smart Buying module. It is coming also to a certain extent from return on overhead costs. Louis has said that 40% of the reduction of people is committed, which does not mean everybody has left already, but a big part of that. These are probably the two modules providing most of the savings currently. But also, I mean every module is &#x2013; anyway these two were the two which are contributors to Power8, so they should also deliver the most substantial part. But these are the ones which are on the timeline more advanced than other ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Presumably the 400 million, you've actually captured or gotten commitments for something that's substantially beyond that, is that's correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I thought the 400 million is a run rate that you're already seeing in your current performance, as opposed to captured that you know you've got, but we may not see that recognized and until later in the year or possibly next year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, a second question which is on your production rate, you're still going to 40 a month in 2010, still 11 a month on long range in 2010. Can you describe the path to get there, what you're sort of seeing for '09? And then what could cause you to perhaps pull back on that, if you saw changes in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could say that we are looking very carefully at the evolution of the market and if we had a very steep decrease of orders or a lot of cancellation and so on we could adjust. But for the time being we don't need &#x2013; we don't see reasons to reduce our ambition in ramp up, even in &#x2013; but we are very flexible, we are not &#x2013; it's possible to reduce if we needed. We are very flexible, we are not buying new facilities for that and so on, except the some airline in China, but it's a structural decision not linked to the necessity to increase the production. It's a decision to invest in China. It means that we stick to our ramp up forecast, but we are flexible if the situation were deteriorating rapidly, but for the time being we have no reason to reduce our ramp up ambitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is your lead time for that flexibly Louis, how quickly &#x2013; how far in advance are you pretty much set on your...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's easier to reduce production than to increase it. It depends on the way we manage the supply chain. We have to inform supply chain, it means it takes months, clearly. But it's a bit shorter than to ramp up the production, but it take months. It is clear that we can't do that from one month to another. We have to manage that with supply chain very carefully.</p>

          <p>Yes, okay. So, on the question of what will it be for the full year, we anticipate it to be between 6 and 800 million, Harry, for the full year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Power8 Plus, I appreciate there are still a lot of details to be worked out, a lot of consultations to be made. Can you help us to think about how the &#x20AC;1 billion of extra savings in 2011 or 12 might build up for what &#x2013; could we for example expect a similar rate of ramp-up as we've seen with the baseline Power8?  Or do you think it will be more loaded towards the back end of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could only repeat what I said on the Power8 Plus. It's &#x2013; it will be split in two part for Airbus at least, it will be split in two parts and I can't give you the split, the exact split between cost savings continuing the effort and reinforcing the effort of Power8 with new savings. And we have seen that we have room for that, particularly on Smart Buying and our capacity to outsource production in lower cost countries, and we are working on it. But as I said first, we will take benefit of the increase of the workload to do it without hurting the industrial setup in Europe in a significant way. And second, we have to give the first information &#x2013; detailed information to the working council inside the companies. For that I can't go further.</p>

          <p>We will now take the last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question comes from Mr. David Perry from Goldman Sachs (sic) [Citigroup]. Mr. Perry, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for letting me on. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I've got three questions, apologize for that. Can I take them one-by-one please? First of all, your delivery guidance for this year implies a much weaker H2 than H1 than we've seen in any year I can recall, and that just seems a bit odd given that you're on a ramping up trajectory going into next year. Can you just comment on why H2 will be so low, please, first of all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>H2 is lower than the H1 because in H2 you have August month and you have Christmas period, the two periods where we are delivering less airplanes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have that &#x2013; that happens every year, since I've been a little boy anyway, Christmas. And just a bit surprised by the phasing, I mean, given that you're putting &#x2013; plan to be producing more aircraft, I'd have thought we might see higher rates going into the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been able some years, but we, for the time being we stick to our forecast of around 470 airplanes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question, Power8, if we go back to the original Power8 plan, my notes are, were that you were going to get 400 million of savings in 2008. And from your earlier answer to Harry's question, you're clearly well ahead of that. Does this mean that you are going to beat the original Power8, do you think, of 2.1 billion, or are you just pulling forward some of the savings and we might get a lower increment in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said in my introduction that we could go further than Power8. But for the time being the people are mobilized to reach the target of 2.1. If we have an upside, we will take it with pleasure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean what Louis said, David, is there are two parts in Airbus, one which are new topics, structural topics we are addressing, and one which is kind of an extension of Power8 into the year 2011 and '12. And clearly I think Louis, we can say we are encouraged by the current performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. No, I thought the question was for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm just thinking about the original plan. The original plan you appear to be well ahead of what your target...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2010, as I said we will stick to 2.1 and if we are able to do more, it will be an anticipation on Power8 Plus. But for the time being we stick to 2.1. I don't want to give expectations on better results than 2.1. First, we have to reach 2.1. People are motivated on that target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The last question, it's bit of a conceptual question but I think it's important going back to your Slide 9 on the definition of underlying EBIT which seems to me a bit arbitrary. If we go back to the October 2006 profit warning, you gave a very clear profile on the cost overruns on the A380. And there was going to be a balance of overruns observed in '08 and '09. You didn't give us a number, but a sensible guess would have been about 500 million each year in '08 and '09, you could play with the phasing. So I'm just curious why when you define an underlying EBIT for us on Slide 9, you choose to treat the 715, the new overrun as a one-off but not the original cost overruns, because they are one-off, they are going to end not this year but next year. And it goes back I think to the first very first question on the call about the run rate in underlying EBIT for '08 and what we should be thinking about going into '09 and 2010. Can you just give any color or your thoughts on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure, I kept that conceptional question fully. But I mean the provision we are taking is a one-off, which covers then the additional expense due to the additional delays. On top of that obviously we are suffering still from what we have announced back in 2006, which is also spread over time and which is part of the business performance side. So, it is not reflected in the 700 and something we are showing on that slide. So there are two elements, I mean we show the A380 as being one of the programs of Airbus in terms of if you go to page, I think it is the Page 24 again, where you see the performance part. So this includes everything including the A380.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>One-offs are stripped out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it just goes back, I think it was Ben Fidler's question about migrating from a 9% margin to a 5% margin. I mean pre-the &#x2013; if we strip out the'06 overruns as well, which you're still absorbing, you've got an even higher underlying margin. Just how we would think about the underlying business versus what you're trying to show us there.</p>
