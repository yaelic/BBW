          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the presentation of the 2007 annual results of the BNP Paribas.  Can I just ask you to shut down your cell phone please and if you participate to the Q&amp;A session through &#x2013; speak through the microphones, the hostesses will handle to you as the presentation is webcasted through the internet and the telephone.</p>
          <p>I will now turn over to Mr. Baudouin Prot, Chief Executive Officer of BNP Paribas.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Well, good afternoon and then thank you for joining us on this annual results presentation of BNP Paribas. I think the first important point is that these figures &#x2013; both the estimated results and all disclosed exposures are exactly the same as the one we produced to you on the 3rd January.  I think that there is no surprise and no unexpected is very important in those days in the market and this is what you, I hope, would expect from the BNP Paribas and this is where we are. So, all the figures I will give you today regarding our results, regarding our exposures and growth and the new way, the figures are nothing new so that we can go into details and comments on the BNP Paribas annual results.</p>
          <p>Yes, 2007 was a year of record results for BNP Paribas and as we see here, these are the key and annual figures.  As I said, are exactly the same figures.  Just we rounded them up to the billion Euros when we estimated the result. So, actually the revenues are not 31 billion but 31 &#x2013; &#x20AC;37. million wouldn't make a big difference, they're up 11.1% to last year. Operating expenses up 10%.  I certainly prefer to say from 1% to 2% but it's not a big-big difference.  Gross operating income is 12 billion, 273 million Euros, up 12.8%.  The cost of risk, I will come in certainly the cost of risk stands up &#x20AC;1 billion 725 million, up 127%. The net income group share stands at 7 billion 822 million Euros, up 7%. The return on equity for the full year after tax stands at 19.6% and the dividend, this is nothing new, proposed to the AGM of BNP Paribas &#x20AC;3.35 which is up 8.1% compared to the 3.10% of last year. So, that's record results despite the prices with a dividend up 8%.</p>
          <p>The second slide is also nothing new so I will ready to cross rapidly.  This is to say that in all of our core operating businesses revenues were up last year. The retail is up 4.4%, that very much should be a good number for French Retail, well 4.4.  BNL up 6.5% and international retail and financial services up 7.9%.  AMS well, it would be very strong, 20.9, close to 21% and Corporate and Investment Banking, CIB, up 2.5%.  A record figure of 8 billion, 293 million Euros, the record for 2007 that as you know already from this morning, we will want to set the target for this year to match that record number for CIB revenues but I will get to that in a minute.  So, these are the revenue growths across all the groups.</p>
          <p>Operating efficiency, I think this is the kind of slide that you could expect from BNP Paribas.  We will continue to consider operational efficiency and gross income as a very serious parameter of management in a year of crisis. We couldn't improve it because we went from 60.6 to 60.8, so that is fairly stable. Retail: French retail is down 1%, Italian retail is down 4% and that's the beginning story.  I'm going to go on.</p>
          <p>AMS is up close to 2%.  A very good job, positive effective, full point of positive effect on AMS.  Well, international retail and financial services is flat, 57.2 to 57.3, I mean close to flat and CIB up from 55.4 to 57.8.  Well, still very good. Still, nearly best in class and still certainly below our objective or targets of being below 60% at any time through the cycle. So I think that goes for operating efficiency and control of costs.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk, well, certainly now a very important concern and cost of risk as for the whole year stood at 36 basis points against risk weighted assets. I still consider this figure as quite reasonable.  Last year certainly 19% was even lower. That was a very low level especially due to the &#x20AC;256 million of positive &#x2013; well, positive cost of risk, positive write-backs that we had on the CIB which we see here on this, well &#x2013; cost of risk was a minus 17.  So, against that the 36 basis points is still fairly low.</p>
          <p>French Retail nothing new. 17 basis points over cost of risk against 18 in 2006 and 25 in the 2005.  I believe that the quality of assets of our loan portfolio in France is unmatched; I think it's very strong.  It's very strong, because for years in corporate as much as on retail, we do a lot &#x2013; we keep a lot of attention on what we originate and I think we watch and manage the portfolio very well.  Especially with our new organization with the corporate centers, highly dedicated team and the 26 corporate centers were very satisfied both from a revenue and cost perspective in the organization. BNL, 65 against 67, so nothing new.  Cost of risk is stable.  BancWest, I'll get back to it.</p>
          <p>Exceptional provisions, I think were &#x20AC;231 million. This is worth of 67 basis points on portfolio basis and the specific provisions on a more normal basis, I believe, &#x20AC;106 million these are the 31 basis points.  I'll get back to the cost of risk of BancWest in a minute.</p>
          <p>Cetelem, 214 basis points &#x2013; well, a bit higher than last year, not different from 2004 on Cetelem, two comments: We are doing more business in Cetelem consumer finance in Brazil in the emerging markets where the cost of risk is structurally higher, and second, we have noticed recently an increasing cost of risk in Spain which we are not the only ones to report that. Lending to retail customers in Spain has become more risky. So, we're monitoring it, where we have watched it &#x2013; where we have noticed it.</p>
          <p>CIB, I mean a 2 basis point cost of risk, &#x20AC;28 million for the full year is still very, very benign and with the quality of our portfolio inside the receipt when moving from Basel I to Basel II capital ratio is overall very good.</p>
          <p>Contributions for the full year from the core businesses, French retail up 5%.  BNL, powerful story, up 55% from 491 to &#x20AC;556 million euro.  IRFS, International Retail and Financial Services, you see that BancWest in fact certainly down 10.7% at &#x2013; over &#x20AC;2.2 billion.  AMS, an incredible year, I mean, up 21% very strong.  And CIB, CIB down 8.8% from 3.9 billion into &#x20AC;3.6 billion. As we all know, especially in the second half of 2007 in the last year, the pre-tax income of CIB was the third largest in the world, just coming after Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers and leaving all the others below.  So it was a strong second half and a strong year also, for CIB.</p>
          <p>First quarter, we have seen that net income group share was a billion and we came out with 1006, so not a very big difference.  It is a very, it is a &#x2013; we have shown a good resilience for the crisis. It is a profit of 1 billion, certainly against 1.7 billion last year but as everybody who has been around has seen that the first quarter has been a very, very difficult one for the industry. What I think is important is that in last quarter of last year, every core business came out with a significant profit.  Well certainly, French Retail was untouched, up 6%. BNL was also not impacted, up 36%.  International Retail and Financial Services was very much impacted because of BancWest 231 billion. Well and then portfolio provisions and so we came out to &#x20AC;331 million, down 45%. INS, the rates, the trend of profit gross came to 4.4% that remained positive and certainly CIB mostly due to the revenue to the credit adjustments for Monoline, &#x20AC;453 million. We had the profits down 65% but still a profitable quarter for &#x20AC;343 million of pre-tax income. So certainly, a robust model in face of, well a very significant crisis and lot of turmoil in the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of our five core businesses, I now want to comment on each of them without going into many details. Starting with French Retail, it's really much of the same of 2007 that we've &#x2013; it starts with strong sales and record number of new customers.  We now have 6.2 million customers. We have 200,000, exactly 230,000 net increase of new customers check and deposit account of last year. The volume growth was strong and balanced, 11% growth of the deposit and &#x2013; 11.2 for deposit, 11.6 for loans, so quite balanced.  We didn't have identified, but to get back to basics that a bank after all is a company or is a business in which you collect deposits from customers to make loan to customers, not distribute business. So this is a business we are aiming front.  And revenue is therefore been up from 1%, with 1.1% positive jaws effect, because this is really a very, I mean, this is a very regular kind of figures for BNP Paribas, and by the way this is inline with the guidance we've given for 2007, so nothing very strange there.</p>
          <p>In terms of risk, we already commented the 70 basis point very low, and pre-tax income already commented.  So, very much inline with guideline and target in a more difficult environment.</p>
          <p>While the next few years what can you expect from BNP Paribas in terms of French retail? Much of the same.  We are going to continue to grow the number of customers.  Now there is one thing which is important. By 2010, so in three years, we want 10% of our sales to be made by Internet. Today it's nearly marginal.  We don't want only millions of customers to do their daily operations by Internet, which they like and which we like, because especially it's costly and much more convenient for them, but we also want them to buy through the Internet. We launched a new &#x2013; I believe that we are the more advanced CRM and online shop for savings and yes, saving products and also loans, and we want 10% of all sales by 2010.  It will be very tough decision for BNP Paribas and I think it will be very convenient for our customers.  So that's a big project.  It's not a project because we've launched the new Cetelem, which is the new online shop like I said two or three moments ago.</p>
          <p>Customer satisfaction, gains and market share, well nothing really new there.  Private banking, we are number one private bank in France. It's an incredible business. In my view this is one of the great success of BNP Paribas. It is better than I would have dreamed when we created BNP Paribas seven years ago, so we just want to continue to grow the assets by 10% a year.</p>
          <p>Corporate customers, we want to leverage our corporate centers and become more often the core bank of the fast growing businesses. And we are going to take advantage of the favorable H permit to optimize recoveries, what else would you expect from BNP Paribas. So revenue should be up 4% a year on average with the 1% per year positive jaws effect.</p>
          <p>BNL. BNL in 2007, 70% of our synergies have been achieved within the first year of the three year plan, 2007 to 2009. The integration is well ahead of schedule. We've enhanced commercial efficiency with reenergized image, we are back on TV with the product, the only range of the revolution product, and we have trained the sales force to be more, I would say sales oriented, and we are rolling out new commercial applications. I've already commented the revenue, the right &#x2013; operating expense, that's important, operating expense down 0.6% therefore we have 6 full points of positive jaw effects, because revenues up 5.5 and costs down 0.5, well, not 0.5%, but 0.6%.  And pre-tax income already commented.  So successful integration, and it has become a major engine for the group profit growth.</p>
          <p>What's next for BNL?  Well, we are going to achieve this year all of the synergies planned and that were early forecasted to come out in 2008 and 2009, a year ahead of the plan. We're going to continue to leverage the present momentum for individual customers, and we are going to &#x2013; we want to become the benchmark bank in Italy for corporate customers.</p>
          <p>I think it's very important that we capitalize on the cross synergies between BNL and the CIB platform, and also which is very important, we are going to take advantage of the group leading position in the Mediterranean, you know, in Libya, Indonesia, in the Gulf, in Egypt, in Turkey. No Italian banks there and a lot of corporate Italian customers there. So we've already opened BNL desk in those countries and we will concentrate and try to have a big market share in the Italian corporate trade flows and business flows to these regions which are economically and culturally and in geography pretty close to Italy as they are to France.</p>
          <p>We're going to leverage the group's expertise and the economies of scale, and we will share IT development. I think what will be very important, we are now at the time where we should think of the CRM and the workstation of the BNL branch sales person in the next few years we will share the same as the French network, that's a big project. That will, they will, it will not only be very advanced, but it will be also very cost effective and all the best skills and practice that we have deployed with very big investments over the last few years, for the French retail will come at a marginal cost and with a very good timing for BNL which is very important in terms of competitive landscape for BNL in the Italian market.</p>
          <p>So, revenues up 6%, and still 5 full points per year of positive jaw effect.</p>
          <p>International retail, banking and financial services. As far the 2007 results are concerned, we &#x2013; emerging markets, we are continuing a very strong and sustained development. We won last year, in one year 1.5 million new customers in the &#x2013; for branch retail banking network, basically between Mediterranean, Turkey and Ukraine. We have opened last year 190 branches in the same market, and we've also got through that treaties with Cetelem in Russia. And we acquired a banking &#x2013; bank started in Libya and consumer lending companies in Bulgaria and Brazil. So emerging markets will be back to it, they've done it very well in 2007 and they should continue.</p>
          <p>Personal finance is an important initiative of the group; we decided to merge CLM &#x2013; Cetelem and UCB creating the #1 European player in personal financing solutions provider. I think that we need to provide solutions, innovative solutions combining, I mean mortgage and consumer finance. The growth in outstanding for both CLM and UCB was 17% altogether for 2006, and as I already mentioned the increased provision rated for the growth in emerging markets and retail risks same for today.</p>
          <p>BancWest had a difficult second half and certainly a difficult fourth quarter last year.  Also the sales and marketing drive was strong despite the downturn.  The outstanding loan grew 7.5% of constant exchange rate.  The revenues were at constant exchange rates down 1.2%, not too much for the full year, and were positive 2.9% for the fourth, for the last quarter of last year.  We certainly had an unfavorable change in the US dollar-Europe parity down 8.3% for 2006.  And as I said, the cost of risk was altogether &#x20AC;335 million, last year, which is a high number.  And that includes 280 million in exceptional provisions due to the crisis. I would say about half of it is on the investment portfolio and half of it is on the loan portfolio.  The pre-tax ROE after all of these was still for the whole of last year 25% pre-tax for BancWest.  So altogether revenues up 8% and profits down 10.7% for the Division, for the core business in 2007.</p>
          <p>What do we expect? What can we expect from international re-consumption from this core division, core activity in the near future?  Well, we are going to continue to grow the customer base. We are going to open 600 branches by 2010. Then we will have 2,600 branches in the emerging markets against basically 2,200 in France.  So we will build over the few years a lot by organic growth, beside our acquisitions in Turkey and Ukraine.  It's lot of organic &#x2013; quite a retail setup.</p>
          <p>In terms of new customers, we expect 6 million new customers by 2010 compared to 2007 and over 20 million new customers, including consumer finance and specialized finance.  We want to sort of double Cetelem origination via Internet.  We are going to continue to integrate the banking network of the specialized financial services.  We want to continue to grow the revenue for customers and we have quite a program to substantially improve the approach and efficiency in terms of reducing the number of platforms, and also have the re-engineering process under, being proactive in that field.</p>
          <p>Altogether, in terms of revenues, our target is a 10%, I mean over 10% gross on an average per year.  And we expect by 2010 that one third of revenues of this core divisions would be originated in emerging markets and we want to keep 1% positive jaws effect on average. Also we are going, as we said, to continue to have quite a significant organic investment growth effort, whether you look at especially opening of the 600 branches.</p>
          <p>Asset management services did very well in 2007.  Assets under management stood at &#x20AC;584 billion as of the end of 2007.  We had positive net asset inflows in the fourth quarter of last year, which is a rare thing, and a nice thing to have.  And overall, the net asset inflow for the all of 2007 was 23 billion Euros.  The international expansion continue especially in India, Brazil, and Singapore, we had a sharper Euros in Italy, and I already commented the revenue growth of 21% and the profit growth of 21%.  So, I don't want to add more on strong revenue and cost-of-risk side.</p>
          <p>For the near future, well, we believe that the savings dynamics of structural, the structurally developed markets because the bulging population and the growing need for accretionary savings and they are growing &#x2013; the savings dynamics are very strong in emerging markets because of new middle class and increasing number of wealthy customers.</p>
          <p>So, we would just want to take advantage of that and we want to continue to outperform the market.  We have quite a bit of strength because we enjoy multiple distribution channels and a very comprehensive open and effective products offering.  We are going to accelerate international expansion. In Europe we want to continue to grow market share both offshore and onshore in Spain, in Belgium, in different countries.  Certainly we have quite potential for more growth in onshore and offshore in Europe.  And in terms of the activity in emerging markets, as you see we want to bring or to increase the share of revenues  originating in the emerging markets from 5% in 2007 to 10%, we want to double it in the next three years.  India, Brazil, China and Korea and I said Brazil will be important.  So altogether, over 10% gross per year on average for assets under management and over 10% gross per year every year for gross operating income.</p>
          <p>Last but certainly not least: corporate investment banking.  The 2007 results &#x2013; I already commented the record revenues of 8 billion 293 million Euro up 2.5% against 2006 despite the crisis.  What I want to strongly emphasize is that this is mostly due to the client revenues dynamic which has been very strong.  A strong client revenue dynamic for the year 23% rise and for the last quarter 34% rise. That's very important because certainly you better have, and you rather have, a rise in client revenues than in property revenues those days.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses: nothing really to say, good flexibility and they have been overall under control.  Cost-of-risk, I already commented.  Everything to 28 million cost-of-risk for this year, I said 256 and I apologize, the exact figure is 264 so 264 write-backs in 2006 which makes a big difference from 264 to 28; that's a difference of &#x20AC;200 million so certainly it's there.  The &#x20AC;28 million as a cost of risk includes, that is still very limited especially if you consider that in the fourth quarter of this year, the &#x20AC;28 million for the full year includes &#x20AC;138 million related to the US real estate sector where we took some portfolio provisions for the real estate developer &#x2013; for some of the real estate developers in the US.</p>
          <p>So altogether, the pre-tax income, as we already commented, is down 8.8%.  That still leaves us last year with a pre-tax ROE of 30 you see here, a 30% pre-tax ROE.  So altogether a client-driven model that is really very good relative performance in a very difficult market environment.  I want to also say that we do enjoy a very favorable geographic business mix compared to a lot of our peers in corporate investment banking.  Europe stands for 49% of the revenue, well not to say 50.  Of that France is only 15% which shows how much European is now our platform.  And in Europe, well, we are going to pursue a sustained development in France; in Italy we had over 25% client revenue growth last year and we are going to continue to leverage the BNL franchise cross-selling with CIB and the rest of Europe.  I think we put some press release, every few weeks, that we hire some key talents in Germany, in England, in Spain to complement our platform. We don't need many people. We need very good talent. And certainly we are in a good position with our brand and with our results to hire such key talent. I mean by little quantity but by high caliber going into 2008.</p>
          <p>Asia is very important.  We make 27% of our revenue in Asia. That's more than France. That's about twice &#x2013; I mean 27 is not far from twice France.  So, we are much more an Asian than maybe everybody thinks.  And we are much more Asian than we are US &#x2013; by the way &#x2013; 27 is more than 21.</p>
          <p>And we are enjoying out of the Peking, Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore quite a growth &#x2013; we have quite a growth there.  And it has become a significant business.  And by the way, the growth over &#x2013; was over one third compared to 2006.  The last 21% results coming in, before we went to Japan, come from America.</p>
          <p>In America we're very happy that we kept a targeted and selective US CIB platform.  We only do what we're good at basically, equity and interest rate derivatives and energy and commodities financing and we're going to keep it that way because we like it that way.  So we have some significant powerful drivers and one of the key reasons because we have set ourselves a target of having reaching the gain in 2008 the record number of revenues of last year is that this geographic mix on one side and the fact that the businesses, which are the most affected, namely LBOs, securitization make only less than 10% of our revenues at CIB.</p>
          <p>So it is a favorable geographic mix and a very favorable business mix that have made it and beside that, this is a 2008 target yes we want to match this year the record revenues of last year and certainly we want to sustain the cost/income ratio below 60%.</p>
          <p>In terms of powerful clients business drive, in Europe I've already said that we want to step up penetration and in particular in Italy.  Asia and American markets I already commented.  Let me add one word on finance institution because I think that's an important one.  Banks, insurance company, central banks are very important customers to BNP Paribas.  The flow of revenue with them to some extent more important and more regular than it is with corporate.</p>
          <p>It is a very strong franchise of BNP Paribas.  Our FIG group, finance institution group, in terms of coverage is very important.  We are also expanding with some new high-caliber people the sales force and the coverage force of FIG.  What we see at the beginning of 2008 is that there are not so many players around whose ratings, whose financial results, whose balance sheet and reputation is such that the key banks, central banks and insurance company of this world wants to do business with.  And this will help us.  And this year will be very good for that business because all of these players need capital or they need long-term financing and there the PNB Paribas platform is ready to talk to them and to give them the full service.</p>
          <p>So this is very important and I'm very eager all of them to see a &#x2013; well month-by-month how we're going to do this year in this particular, I mean in this particular segment of customers, which is, mind you, this is one of the things that in the old days we didn't do at BNP and I just said the FIG customer base is something for which the BNP Paribas platform in terms of product range and how we are organized is just very different from what it was.  And we're going to reinforce this just in 2008 because we are at a term where a lot of these financial institutions, all of this industry need advice, need financing, need capital, need long-term financing and liquidity and we'll be very active to provide them with those products.</p>
          <p>Strength in global franchise in structurally growing markets, well we have only two key franchises that we grow in the worldwide basis because we want to be focused and we want to be selective.  The one is derivatives and the other is emerging commodities and we believe that the two will offer still with a strong potential dynamic and so we're going to continue to selectively invest in growing these two key franchises, especially in Asia and in emerging markets, and maintain the risk control policy, well certainly this is something we want, so the targets I have already commented.</p>
          <p>Let me now have a word on risk management culture and the solid financial structure.  Risk culture and financial structure are nothing new to banking.  It's just that at some point in time they are even more important or they are more noticed because I don't think that they are never &#x2013; they are always important, that sometimes they are always fashionable.  They are back in fashion and we don't think that they should be considering the fashion.  They are conditioned that the basics of industry, so you better keep them all the time because it's too late to discover them in the turmoil.  You have to &#x2013; we have to do risk control, risk culture when it's sunny.  It's too late when it gets bad on the sea.  I won't comment that.</p>
          <p>We believe at BNP Paribas that the top management of a bank should keep close attention to the risk-reward balanced throughout the cycle I mean everyday, every time, every year and we believe this is what we have tried to do.  A long-term approach of customer relation and risk management means that you are focused on long-term customer relationships.  You try to finance real customers for real things.</p>
          <p>The banking risk approach is focused on economic fundamentals, the ability of the customer to repay you are not the value of an asset.  A banking risk approach also &#x2013; which takes former operational risk management.  On operational risk management we've had the group policy since 2003.  I'm sure we'll get back to it.  I would say that regarding operational risk management I feel comfortable, but I don't &#x2013; certainly don't feel complacent about where we stand at BNP Paribas.  I'm sure we'll get back to it.</p>
          <p>But this is very important.  Top management in a bank should be involved directly in the risk, in setting risk policies and limits.  You don't want to do &#x2013; you don't want other people to do that in the rank and file or you don't want to be &#x2013; this to be done by computers.  And so at BNP Paribas when Michel P&#xE9;bereau came to BNP in May '93 and we privatized BNP in October '93, just a few months later Michel P&#xE9;bereau decided to set-up, it was quite, not strange, but unparallel at that time, decided to setup a special committee of the board only dedicated to risk, internal control and then we added compliance.</p>
          <p>And we have &#x2013; this is one of the most important board committee in BNP Paribas that meets very regularly to look, check and somehow voiced me as a Group CEO, well somehow double-check where we stand on the risk-reward balance and on internal controls.</p>
          <p>I chair personally as Group CEO and with Jean and Georges, the Chief Operating Officer of BNP Paribas, we are very much involved in the key risk policy committee that sets the policy, the risk policy standards, look at risk concentration whether by sector, by geography or by business line.  And I think it's very good that we argue directly with the business line and that some point in time we decide whether we want to have more or less, whether it is LBOs, whether it's any business, they propose and we decide and that's how it should be running the bank.</p>
          <p>In terms of front-line management's involvement at all levels in risk management, yes, operational management should be involved in risk management and it should not have risk management only done by people outside of operational management.  Apart from operational management you need in a bank powerful and independent oversight functions because you need to control and that comes on top.</p>
          <p>At BNP Paribas today, as we speak, 2,480 full time staff are dedicated to group risk management, compliance and internal audit.  All of these three functions are worldwide functions.  They report to me directly and they are totally independent from the key businesses.  The staff number of 2,480 is up 21% compared to 2005, so I don't know if we have enough, but I am sure we'll increase the number.  And this is a cost, the cost of doing business and the cost of controlling your business.</p>
          <p>I believe that we have best-in-class technical expertise, combined with highly experienced management.  I believe that expertise is nothing without strong management and management being involved is very important.  So on risk culture and risk control this is where I think that we should combine somehow the technical expertise with once again management involvement and management's experience.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity situation, BNP Paribas hasn't seen its needs increase a lot.  We were lucky.  We were lucky because we never relied on securitization.   Securitization at BNP Paribas is a mere &#x20AC;13 billion in cash at the end of last year, which is nearly &#x2013; I mean it's nothing for BNP Paribas, so we never lost securitization because we never used it.</p>
          <p>Limited exposure to conduits, you know the number, the number is another &#x20AC;11 billion.  We never sponsored SIV.  You can't be in every business, so we were not in that business and our sustainable loan deposit ratio, it's improved in 2007, which you wanted to do in those days.  It was &#x2013; it stood at 132% at the end of 2006 and it went down to 128% as of the end of 2007.  Also we increased our loan portfolio by 13% in 2007 and I think that's important regarding the needs.</p>
          <p>Regarding the resources, certainly the AA+ rating has been quite a strong competitive advantage to gather well deposits and resources very much from customers and from the markets, so as to limit the recourse to the Interbank market, which we've been successfully doing in the second-half of last year.</p>
          <p>Therefore we had a very limited impact on the increase refinancing cost of the bank in 2007.  We found we've been raising funds generally below the market price and we have been very proactively managing the liquidity position of the bank.  So this is a major competitive advantage, but there also we are not complacent.  We have made quite a big effort group-wise to launch quite a number of actions that we are proactively conducting as much as &#x2013; just as we speak now in 2008 to make sure that the liquidity position of BNP Paribas and the loan-to-deposit ratio will be on the strict guidance because things are not over.  And on balance sheet strength, as much as on liquidity, you want to be on the right side of the fence and we don't take this strong position as a position to lie in comfort.  We see this position as a position of strength to continue to act proactively to improve it and once again not being complacent.</p>
          <p>The capital base is very simple.  If you have profits you increase your capital base and the reverse is true and so because we have a dividend of 3 billion and you don't need to raise equities, that's what I like with it those days.  So 3 billion dividends that we &#x2013; what we want to give to our shareholders, well as trying to thank them for having been well with us last year and staying with us and so because the profits were &#x20AC;7.8 billion, I skipped the &#x20AC;800 million of new goodwill attached to the acquisition of last year and the net hybrid issuance of another &#x20AC;800 million plus the minus 8 and the plus 0.8, well they compensate.</p>
          <p>And so therefore the Tier 1 Basel I capital of BNP Paribas stood at &#x20AC;39.2 billion as of the end of last year.  This is a 7.3 Tier 1 ratio Basel I, which is the same as at the end of I think basically, yes, September.  So I think it's okay.  In those days you &#x2013; if anything you want to have a bit more capital than net capital, so 7.3 is okay.</p>
          <p>Now we are moving &#x2013; we've done on the 1st of January something that the banking industry is doing every 20 years.  The Cooke ratio entered the banking industry in '83, so when I entered this was not Cooke, but then we met Mr. Cooke, that was in '87 and we've been running 20 years with Captain Cooke and with the Basel I ratio.  We are now moving to Basel II, which I consider a much better system.  It cost BNP Paribas a few &#x2013; well, quite a big money to get there in terms of IT systems and I think it will be a much better system.</p>
          <p>We are certainly moving now to the advanced methodology of Basel II and because of the quality of our portfolio because as you all know, in Basel II the regulatory capital needs is much more linked to the quality of each &#x2013; well each credit and each counter-party.  The risk-weighted asset, as you see here, which stood at &#x20AC;540 billion at the end of 2007 are now down to &#x20AC;457 billion and so this is improvement that for BNP Paribas moving to Basel II.</p>
          <p>There is a floor, and as you all know because you are expert of that, 90% floor in 2008, so we will have a &#x2013; we have a limited cap for 2008 to the advantage in the reduced figure for risk-weighted assets.  And regarding the eligible capital, it is partially offset because we have more restricted &#x2013; Basel II has a more restricted approach to eligible capital.  So instead of having &#x20AC;39.2 billion of eligible capital that we had under Basel I, we're going to have dozen work we're going to have only &#x20AC;36.5 billion under Basel II.  So all that said, when you take the new ratio, we're going to move from 7.3 to 7.6 from the end of December to the 1st of January from Basel I to Basel II.</p>
          <p>You will have all of the details and I'm sure we'll be very happy, our investor people, to answer to all of your detailed questions everything you wanted to know about Basel I and Basel II.  Anyway, that's where we stand and so a new ratio and we believe in 2008, a year to observe the new ratio dynamics at BNP Paribas</p>
          <p>Capital management, nothing very new there.  We like to grow the dividend, well I don't think this is very strange.  We continue to prefer organic growth.  We forecast around 10% risk-weighted asset growth for 2008 and we want to maintain stringent external growth discipline.  So risk management in terms of strengths that provide the groups with the means to implement an ambitious growth strategy are there.</p>
          <p>I like now to switch to what will be our growth strategy over the next few years for BNP Paribas.  Just looking back once again at the last three years from 2004 to 2007 we have grown the revenue of the group from &#x20AC;19 billion to &#x20AC;31 billion, which is 1.6, it's a ratio of 1.6 times for three years.  What I like is that we did that with the cost income ratio we went down, but that's what cost income ratio should do.  Revenue should go up and cost to income most &#x2013; well, we prefer them to go down if possible.  Then they went down from 62.8 to 60.5%.</p>
          <p>Therefore the net income group share increased a bit more than the revenues because it went from &#x20AC;4.7 billion to &#x20AC;7.8 billion, which is a ratio of 1.7.  This is the numbers, but behind the numbers what I think is more important is that in the last three years we changed BNP Paribas.  We turned BNP Paribas, which was well I think a competitive French bank with international exposure to a European leader.  We did that by certainly acquiring BNL and now enjoying two domestic markets in Europe and by having a bank, a group, banking group that today has three-quarter of its revenues in Europe and from the 190,000 employees of BNP Paribas, 60,000 are in France and 60,000 are in Europe outside of France.</p>
          <p>So it was controlled growth with I think a good and permanent risk control policy and the business mix has been maintained.  We like, as you all know, the one-half retail, one-third CIB and one-sixth AMS and we've kept that over the years.  So the growth strategy of BNP Paribas has proven as much its ability to grow fast when weather is good as to risks and crisis when it gets certainly more shaky.</p>
          <p>The earning per share had 15.2% on a CAGR basis and the dividend per share up 18.8%.  This is I think a certain track record of growth and value creation.  Now 2004 to 2007 is the recent past.  What about these in the near future, I mean the next few years?  I think that we have a very clear idea at BNP Paribas of what we want to do.  We don't want to be everything to everybody.  We want to concentrate on five key priorities and I think the first one, the five priorities are here.  I will comment them.</p>
          <p>The first one is pursue the development of the integrated banking model in Europe.  This is the core of the group.  Europe is three-quarter of our revenues, Europe is our domestic market and in Europe we &#x2013; as we see in a second, I believe we enjoy a set-up which is nearly already without equivalent and I think our skills and our set-up speak for continuing to deploy the fully integrated banking model of BNP Paribas in Europe.  That's our first priority.</p>
          <p>Our second priority is to speed up the pace of development in the Mediterranean and far Eastern Europe.  I don't usually use the croissant, but around Europe you see that lighter green map, that should easy to &#x2013; well Mediterranean on the South of the Franco Italian and then certainly to the East, it's part of Eastern Europe.  So it's nothing very strange there, but this is where we like, this is where we've decided that we would build up over the years a strong retail presence, combining branch banking or specialized finance service company.</p>
          <p>Much of the same, by the way, of the integrated model we run in Europe.  What we like about this region is that they are in terms of culture, in terms of geography and in terms of economies, they have a lot of natural links with Europe and we believe it's easier to do this there than to do it at the end of the world.</p>
          <p>The third in terms of retail banking and fully integrated model, the first thing is yes, we want to capitalize on the already strong positions we have in Greater China, in India and in Brazil.  Well these are the yellow parts of the world map that you have here and certainly we want to return to revenue growth in the Western US retail network.  While revenue growth we will do it very rapidly and then certainly from revenue growth to profit growth that will be maybe a bit more challenging, but this is certainly something we want.</p>
          <p>And the last is, as already mentioned, we want to reinforce the global leadership of BNP Paribas worldwide in derivatives, in energy and commodities financing.  Well on Europe I already commenced it, but I want you to see here on here, but I want to say that, yes, we want to fully leverage our two domestic networks of French Retail and BNL by, as I said, sharing more and more resources and expertise between Rome and Paris and cross-selling certainly in both key markets with all of the group's other key product platforms, whether &#x2013; and the other platforms is the next thing you see.  We want to extend and reinforce the business lines that make BNP Paribas pan-European leadership in product platform.</p>
          <p>In CIB, in corporate investment, we're already there because as I said whether you take the Financial Times last survey where we see BNP Paribas as the strongest brand for CIB in Continental Europe, not yet here, but in Continental Europe.  Whether you take personal finance and equipment solutions where we've been the number one serving personal finance and in asset management services we are either number one or leader in the key businesses.</p>
          <p>So the product platforms are already very strong.  And we're going to get the retail-banking platform to converge.  I already commented between France and Italy in terms of French banking and we're going to have the joint processing between the networks and the specialized businesses that we activated, so drawing out an increasingly integrated model in Europe is strategy priority number one, number one for BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets, I won't go into more details, Mediterranean and Far Eastern Europe on one side, for branch banking, for retail banking and for specialized financing, also capitalizing on the CIB presence, in particular, energy and commodities financing in this part of the world.  And then the Brazil, India, Greater China, more focused on CIB and Asset Management Services businesses, excluding &#x2013; well just in Brazil where we have also consumer finance.  And in three years we want to double the revenues in the emerging markets to &#x2013; they make 11% of group revenues to-date, we want them to make 15% of group revenues by 2010.</p>
          <p>The last thing which is very important for me as a Group CEO is I want BNP Paribas to have systematically an industrial approach to its efficiency group-wide.  I have hired a bit over a year ago Alain Marbach who was for 15 years one of the executive members of Schneider.  He has been doing a lot from &#x2013; in India, in the US where he had been posted for a few years, in Japan, to well a lot of I would say industrial, well those research and rationalization and I wanted somebody from the industry.  Because I believe that in the financial service industry you should apply exactly an industrial approach to process improvements, there is a lot to be improved.</p>
          <p>Not only in terms of cost and productivity in terms of measure by cost, but also quality-wise, time-wise and therefore satisfaction-wise for customers, which is very important.  So Alain Marbach is now on board since a year, well this would be &#x2013; it will be a year-and-a half in the summer and we are progressing very fast in having a much more systematic approach to rationalizing our platforms and our set-up, both for IT and for back-offices at group level.</p>
          <p>But I can say clearly that in terms of IT development we now have decided that in Europe we'll have only three major centers: Paris, London and Rome and in the world in emerging markets we'll have four development centers: Casablanca, Istanbul, Mumbai and Chennai, which will be very cost effective.  And we're going to rationalize all of the group IT development alongside or around these different hubs.</p>
          <p>In terms of group procurement function, we have quite a program to &#x2013; we already &#x2013; we've done quite a few things, but I think we can do more and the last thing is we are rolling out now with a much higher speed and extension, Lean Six Sigma program.  We've found that as you see here in four examples, we can have very impressive results by applying this industrial approach that both General Electric and Toyota have been applying with success to well, industry, to the service sector, mainly to the finance services or oil industries.</p>
          <p>At Arval, which is the car fleet management company, vendor claims by such a process re-engineering has been reduced by 50%.  Customer correspondence reply time for &#x2013; at the insurance has been reduced by 50%.  The Internet query conversion rate at Cetelem has been improved 10% and the customer relations open productivity at BNP Paribas Securities up 30% total.  So these are things we are going to systematize and we're going to increase the number of experts of Lean Six Sigma four-fold by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>So BNP Paribas at just at the beginning of 2008 comes out of 2007 having delivered I think a strong set of results, actually a set of record results in a very, well, 2007 started in very good conditions and ended for the finance service industry in a very, well, challenging environment.  So our growth strategy has proved to be very resilient.</p>
          <p>We have powerful franchises and a solid financial structure and BNP Paribas is well positioned to out-perform the competition in 2008 and beyond thanks to its expertise and business model.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.  It's Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse.  I've got two questions, one relates to commercial mortgage-backed security.  Could you maybe tell us commercial mortgage-backed securities, could you maybe tell us of maybe the size of your portfolio, the geographical profile and your &#x2013; the vision of the risk in that portfolio?  And the second question relates to the corporate and investment banking target to have stable revenues in 2008 just as 2007 and basically you said in Page I think 67 in the financial statements that the crisis I suppose added 850 million to the CIB top line.  So basically you are saying that next year underlying can drop 851 million, which is roughly 10%.  You've also said earlier that the businesses, LDO, CDO, securitization accounted for 10% in the past.  So does it mean that everything else would be stable and could you maybe give us a mix as to how you see the overall stability in CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can answer to this second part of the question.  Let's say the &#x2013; let's say our objectives are &#x2013; you have to see on several points of view. First of all, that means that we don't anticipate further markdown, significant markdown at the level of CIB at BNP Paribas, let's say, which perhaps is normal, but we want to emphasize that.  Second, we are in the beginning of the year, it's difficult to anticipate exactly what will happen. The only thing we expect is we are cautiously comfortable about the revenue of CIB and when we expect that we match, we want globally to match the revenue to '07 perhaps we be 5% more or something like that or equal, it's very difficult to express that.</p>
          <p>But globally what we see is as the clients in our businesses are still there, they continue to be there, we continue to work with them, so globally it's a global guidance, it's not &#x2013; you are not to compare minus 10%, 10% and it seems to be correlated. We are at the beginning of the year, the only thing I wish to express is that everything is okay with BNP Paribas CIB and continue to be okay, despite let's say a very volatile January month.</p>
          <p>And for example I would like to mention something you see that on the Slide 47 concerning monolines.  We have taken credit adjustments with a maximum spread widening in January 2008.  That means that we think that we are in a good situation concerning any further mark downs, this was two messages, but not plus 10%, less 10%.  But it is true to add that in term securitization, the business has not yet begin back, so we are in these positions, we see nothing on that.  And you know very well that in terms of big LBO, the market, there is no more market; we have just small LBOs, specifically in Europe.  So we anticipate not to do a lot of business in that field.</p>
          <p>The first question was &#x2013; at the level of CIB close to zero. <mark type="inaudible" /> So, it's awfully close to zero.  You have to have in mind that we were not at all in that business in the US, not into muni bonds, not into mortgage and so naturally we have no drama on that because we were not in that business in US specifically.  We were very strong in energy and commodities, commodity derivative, equity derivative, ForEx derivative, interest credit derivative, not credit derivative, so hopefully nothing, so no further markdown in that field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  This is Jean Francis from Goldman Sachs.  Two quick questions, one related to French Retail Banking: On net interest income I understand that margins are a bit under pressure there, I was just wondering whether that was the traditional foreign bank group and commercial pressure or whether there was any impact from the funding side in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question on CIB, you mentioned the part of that on the CMBS and on the mortgages you don't seem to have exposure to other type of exotic mortgages as per e-logs and things.  However, do you have in your investment portfolio on top of your LBO underwriting commitments where is your exposures to CLOs?  And the second question is on the cost of risk in CIB, in the financing part your cost of risk is rising slightly.  Is that a result of a deterioration in credit as in more defaults or is it the result of let's say less gross write-backs?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On French Retail Banking activities you have noticed that our net interest margins have increased by 0.9%, which is a slight increase, a little bit better than previous quarters and that we maintain strong growth in fee commission business.  So the increase in fees is related to the increase of our market share.  We gained new clients, which are using our products; and we sell more and more products, more and more sophisticated products to our clients, both individuals and corporate.</p>
          <p>On the margins themselves, well despite the crisis in terms of liquidity, I must say that spreads are more or less stable in France.  They are not increasing like they do in the international market.  But anyway, there is another impact of the crisis is that our deposit base has increased at a higher pace than previously.  If you look at the evolution of loans and compare to the evolution of deposit you can see that we are close to 11 plus percent, which is something new because of the dis-intermediation, people are now using more deposits instead of money market funds, which is not bad, which is good for the business.  So that is the global trend we have, so that's why we are confident when we say that in average we should show a 4% increase in revenues in the French Retail Banking activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So coming back to CIB for the underwriting commitment, we have the underwriting commitment we have disclosed concerning the LBO business.  On the other part we have no specific underwriting commitments in anything except in large corporate acquisition, which is normally free and for example we are successfully underwrite and sell the LaFarge operation with Egyptians, so naturally we are very activity in large corporate acquisition, but this is very fluid, now the conditions are much better for the bank and we sell very quietly.</p>
          <p>Concerning the cost of risk and the provision of the cost structure, I think it would be interesting to go to Slide 49 because we continue to have some write-back, but also you see we have a specific increase especially in US real estate sector of roughly 100 million, 94 million and then on top of that we have completely write-off the residual exposure on RCR, the monoline exposure, so let's say it's a one-off.  So globally we don't see a deterioration of the cost structure concerning our clients we will see in the future, but we are still confident on that.</p>
          <p>And another point I would like to mention if you remember on &#x2013; during the results of the third quarter we have emphasized about more future counter-party risk, if you remember.  And so because we tried to see what could be in front of us, and naturally we had in mind at that time the monolines.  You remember that we were the first to procure some kinds of activity.  We have naturally a large one-off in term of revenue, which explain the decrease of the revenue of the cost structure of CIB.  We have a one-off, we can see that on Slide 45, of nearly &#x20AC;500 million concerning the monoline and so &#x2013; and today we have no message of that type saying how we think of something, so just to express that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  It's Kinner Lakhani from ABN.  I've got two questions, firstly if you could provide your thinking about potentially how the monoline situation may evolve from where we are today?  I know that BNP has been mentioned at least in the press as one of the players in looking at the solution at Ambac.  So if you could maybe link those two together actually.  And secondly across your businesses, whether it's corporate investment banking or let's say the US retail business, BancWest, to what extent do you think you can benefit from spread widening, plus the steepening of the US yield curve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So concerning the monoline situation, I think we can come back on Page 47.  I think concerning monoline situation we have in fact two main issues:  The first one is let's say the situation of the monolines in itself and the second question is "the system increase under municipal bond."  I would not speak without let's say the system increase concerning municipal bonds because we are not involved at the level of BNP Paribas in municipal bonds.  So let's say it's an issue for a lot of US investment banks.  But globally I think that at the end due to that system exists, we will see that a lot of people would like to help monoline insurance, especially the two big ones, MBIA and Ambac and I'm not speaking of ACA or the other one.  So we see that in the newspapers, personally I anticipate that some solution will be found in the next weeks, in the weeks coming probably or the days coming first of all.</p>
          <p>Second, at the level of BNP Paribas we naturally look carefully what's about that kind of activity.  So first of all, I would like to mention that we are not really concerned by FGIC because we were mentioned on rescue plan concerning FGIC, you can see that we say that the there is some sort of exposure is Ambac, CIFG and MBIA, not FGIC.  So I deny totally that we were involved in anything concerning FGIC.</p>
          <p>So I come back to the two main monolines, we have MBIA and CIFG and Ambac.  You can see that globally our net monoline exposure is not very important because I will let's say global our exposure after all the CDS and so on is 1.1 billion with credit adjustments kind of provision of 40%, 40%.  That means that we think if and I don't think so, the monoline would have some problem, it would have not to pay anything to have any let's say any issue at the level of BNP Paribas.  So globally if something is going very, very wrong, perhaps we will have some additional 10, 20, 30 million, but at the level of BNP Paribas not very important. And mostly concerning FGIC, also &#x2013; and so globally my personal view is that MBIA and Ambac will be okay, will be okay.  The other one I have no idea.</p>
          <p>CIFG will be okay because they are fully supported by not Netic, KC Baring and Banc Popular as I say okay because they're supported by banks here.  So globally at the level of BNP Paribas it is no more an issue.  It was an issue with 1.1 global exposure after the provision of the fourth quarter.  It is no more an issue, we don't want at all a system increase.  So concerning Ambac naturally we are one of the counterpart, but you will probably see in the next weeks that at the end this will be the proof by the pudding that okay we were a simple participant and very simple.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question was &#x2013; there was one question on spread widening and yield curve, well I think you can answer for CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Spread widening is a good thing for us because as Baudouin mentioned we have still a balance sheet, we anticipate to continue to deliver credit to our clients and the spread are really widening since the beginning of the year, which is very good for the revenues.  So we think it's back to normal because if you remember in 2006 and the beginning of 2007 the spread was ridiculous, so now we are back to normal.  So globally it's a good situation when you are able, which is our best to lend money.  So it's a good situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding BancWest I would make two comments, one on the spread widening and the other on the <mark type="inaudible" />. Yes, well the wider spread on the lending side of the loan portfolio is nice, but on the same time everybody in the US wants to catch deposits.  And so the deposit are priced under pressure, so I think that you cannot take one without taking the other.  I don't say that they are exactly the same, but some spread widening on the loan portfolio is compensated by some pressure on credit and deposits because as I said, all over the world it should be back to basics.  So if you want to make loans you need to have deposits, and that's one thing.  The other thing is that on yield curve I think that yes over time yield curve will be positive for BancWest.  So altogether my comment is that it's altogether positive, but with some slight deposit deduction and regarding yield curve you need some time.  So &#x2013; but it's overall positive.  Other questions? Yes, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hi.  It's Phil Richards from Execution, three question if I can:  First of all, if I can just back to that Slide 47.  I was wondering if you could talk us through a bit of slide in terms of how you get from the 3 billion exposure to monolines down to the 1.3 and to be honest, I'd look at what is the overall exposure BNP has or what's the risk of BNP and what's the number that we're looking at?  Is it 3 billion take away the 400 million and you have already taken the charge already, etcetera?  If we can get a feel for the total exposure is?  Secondly on the mutual funds under management, which fell 7% in the French Retail Bank in September...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Can you speak just a little slower so that we understand the question because we're not native?  Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Second question was in the French Retail Bank, the mutual funds under the management fell 7% since September.  I was wondering if you could say a few words on what's happening there?  Is that people moving their funds into &#x2013; are that people leaving BNP with their funds or is that moving them into your deposit balances and if it's the latter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to question two is exactly what you say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well then can you give us a bit of the impact or the net impact that has on BNP on the revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the revenue side it's allowed to move to that <mark type="inaudible" />anyway based on the long-term I think that to have assets under management and to have life insurance product is not bad.  But anyway currently we benefited, as I said, these shifts for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's still a net benefit overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  Well the last question is just on Basel II.  I mean you talked about the decline in eligible capital by 2.7 billion.  Can you just give us a little bit more on which parts the capital are no longer eligible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Philippe will answer you through that.  The Basel II capital, why it's capital, can you answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I need the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The question is in Basel, I got that one, you can't be lost all the time.  That one is why is capital on the Basel II, can we get the slide on Basel II?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  It's due to the fact that switching from Basal I to Basal II, the regulators decided that a certain number of deductions, which were done at the level of the total capital are now going to be split 50:50 between Tier 1 and Tier 2 and this was under Tier 2.  So this is a first reason &#x2013; under Tier 1, sorry, this was under Tier 1, especially when you have a stake in another bank, it used to be deducted in order to avoid double accounting, if you want, of making capital for nine months. It used to be adjusted from total ratio numerator.  And now it's 50:50 to simplify.  So this was under Tier 1.</p>
          <p>And second we have also a more stringent attitude towards insurance business conducted by banking groups.  And it's really complex, but part of the capital which is invested in insurance activities is now deducted from Tier 1, which was not the case before.  So for those two reasons mainly you have this reduction in the numerator of the Tier 1 ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I come back to slide 47.  So you remember during the summer we have explained that we had no exposure at the level of CIB, no net exposure concerning subprime, in fact no net exposure we disclosed that today is 3 billion exposure reinsured by monolines at the level of 3 million.  So globally we have &#x2013; at 3 billion, sorry, 3 billion, but in that type of exposure we have naturally some value in it.  It's not only CDO, we have also a triple layer of subprime.  So we don't anticipate all would be value for zero, so we'll anticipate and it is the net present value that our risk is &#x20AC;1.3 billion, entirely naturally re-insured by the monolines.</p>
          <p>On top of that we have all the exposure entirely insured by monolines.  Those exposures are specifically mainly corporate CDO exposure and normally it could &#x2013; it would have accounted for zero, but due to the spread widening, there is some net present value of 600.  We don't anticipate at all any final counter-party risks in those part because, for example, if you have &#x2013; it's not the case, but the CDO with Nestle or Danon, okay the spreads are widening, but we have absolutely no issue concerning let's say the payments at the end.</p>
          <p>So globally the net present value of this is 600 million due to the spread widening and only due to spread widening, we don't see any risk on the total, on monoline we have 1.9.  We have both credit derivatives from banks or other counter-parties on those monolines, so at the end, our risk is 1.1.  On top of that we have put what we call credit adjustment in fact this provision, so our net exposure is at 700.  As I mentioned, in my view, with this personal view, we don't see any other future markdown first because it could mean that the monoline would pay less than 40% in the case of Hana and second, in my view, what interests us, which are MBIA and Ambac.  I think at the end we will see some improvements in the future, but you will see that at the same level as me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yes?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Antonio Guglielmi from Merrill Lynch.  My first question is on the capital allocation and the cash flow situation of the group because you've had an outstanding year with almost 8 billion net profit and more than 4 it's effective internal capital that you're generating.  But your Tier 1 is actually reflected much lower from 7.3 to 7.2.  So it's like saying that the excess capital you're generating, your cash cow retail operations, is actually allocated to the strong risk-weighted asset growth in CIB.  I think in '07 it's almost 25% risk-weighted asset growth.  So my question is can you keep growing this weighted asset that much in the current environment?  And if this happens are you still in a position of generating excess capital given the uncertainty of that business?  So can we actually see Tier 1 going up in the future?  And my second question is actually related to the slide 33, where you are addressing the five pillars of your growth strategy, you're talking about strengthening your European network, growth in Eastern Europe and Far East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Global leadership in derivative and revenue growth in US.  Well, sorry to be so straightforward, but it looks to me that at least four of these five points would actually be strengthened by a link-up with SocGen.  So my question is why not, if I may?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Concerning the first question, first of all you have to keep in mind naturally we had very large increase of the Cooke-rated asset of the Basel II asset in the first two quarter of the year.  But then we have expressed that we wanted to stop and &#x2013; you see no increase between &#x2013; at the level of CIB between June and December.  Globally our target rose to stay at, let's say, a high single-digit in terms of growing the Cooke-rated asset and we are still at high single-digit at the level of CIB, which is profitable and interesting because the margin are much higher, we see a re-mediation and a lot of competitor are no more there, so it's very good because we lend money at a good price and we develop cost savings.  So globally we stay at this level of high single-digit for CIB.  So naturally all the excess capital is for the other part of the bank and Baudouin mentioned that for example we have made some acquisitions especially in the retail and we have paid low level of goodwill, 800 million.  But at the end it's a use of capital.  So globally my feeling is that the level of CIB will stay at sort of products a little lower in term of capital allocation for the future.  And on top of that on Basal II, CIB will need less capital than on Basal I.  But it's too early to answer, it is mentioned it is an observation year, but you have seen that.  I don't anticipate BNP Paribas globally and CIB in particular will benefit of Basal II compared to Basal I.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think really on capital management....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you sort of the big picture as kind of confidence, <mark type="inaudible" />, so if you take as an assumption what we said, which is that risk weighted assets would grow by around 10% for the whole group, including deposits, but for the whole group as well with the capital generation we have with our result it means that if you keep a kind of stable Tier 1, which is okay, as you have seen we are, okay?  It is &#x2013; we are left with something like 1 to &#x20AC;2 billion available for acquisition, in fact and which we used to do in the past.  So targeted acquisitions 1 to 2 billion, small to medium-sized acquisitions are possible on top of organic growth of around 10%.  So this is the growth picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this really a team because Philippe said what I wanted to say.  We really work &#x2013; we work everyday.  So now &#x2013; well it's still &#x2013; and then I think regarding really SocGen, your question of SocGen, I think that first of all SocGen is certainly an important bank and an important player in the banking industry.  Really my view is that the recent events at SocGen are absolutely unprecedented in size and to some extent in gravity.  And the repercussion of this recent situations are very complex let's say, especially in markets which in terms of volatility and turmoil are also about to the top of what I've known in banking.  So in this context my view is that the developments are just not obvious at this point.  And given that I think to comment any further would only feed the rumor mills, which is turning very actively anyway and so I basically will say nothing further in this subject, whether in Paris or in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Cyril Meilland from Lehman Brothers.  I have a couple of questions.  The first one is regarding BancWest.  It seems that you are not really optimistic about rapid recovery of the growth in this bank.  I was wondering what kind of multiple of the Group you would expect in retail banking in France?  You can expect from BancWest and therefore is it worthwhile to keep this asset given that -- we can understand you stay in France, but it's hard to understand why you stay in the US?  The second...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, accept that we stay in France.  I like that you know because I understand some people wouldn't -- we could also stay in France for them I mean we have to go abroad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question I have is regarding your monoline exposure.  If we go back to Slide 47, I am trying to understand whether your 0.6 billion in non-subprime exposure is likely to move in sync or when the net present value of your non-subprime exposure is likely to move in sync with the value of your CDS that are covering it or whether there is -- I mean it's totally un-correlated and we can expect that at some point you have over coverage or under coverage?</p>
          <p>And the last question is regarding life insurance in France, I mean you have done better than the -- or you did better than the markets in 2007.  There is obviously a search for deposits or a chase for deposits right now in retail banking.  Do you think that this business has changed its prospects or is it still business as usual?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I can answer for the CIB question and the monoline, so we can come back to Slide 47.  No, I have never said it is not correlated.  I've said it concerns large corporates, so I don't anticipate the drama concerning large industrial corporates but the spread can continue to widen, I don't know you see, but these corporates are A, AA, do I don't see any issue concerning those non-subprime related monoline counter-party exposure.  Perhaps, we can see that those exposures let's say being a little bit higher, but we don't see any issue concerning provisioning policy that's the reason why I anticipate that, as I mentioned, we have nearly at the maximum view by BNP Paribas concerning its own exposure concerning the monolines.  As you know we try always to have an adequate provisioning policy so my message is clear and if you remember that's the reason I expect that it was too difficult to exactly note the figures that in November, at the beginning of November, I wasn't &#x2013; I was not let's say explaining the results. Philippe was explaining the results, but we mentioned specifically growing counter-party risk in capital markets.  You asked a figure there and now I say for &#x2013; at the level of BNP Paribas I see nothing more concerning to monoline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, I think that concerning BancWest let me maybe give some details of my thinking of BancWest.  A lot depends on BancWest on I would say the horizon you want to come into BancWest.  If I was sitting in this room and telling you that I am very optimistic for BancWest for the next few quarters it means I will be very tied, and I think it's &#x2013; I am not tied to that point so I think BancWest is in US and so the US in the US so for 2008 it's going to remain challenging.  And still even in the short term I think that at BancWest we will still take advantage of -- in terms of quality of portfolio and I think we will have &#x2013; we have a better portfolio than most of our peers.  We have basically, first of all, we never participated in subprime, so innovative ARM and all the rest and so we will -- I mean, the downturn of the US economy &#x2013; we will not be immune but we will suffer less than the other players.  In terms of revenues, we have seen in the last quarter, as I said that the revenue is now positive.  I just commented on the impact of the widening margins and the yield curve so all of this will feed the revenue base of BancWest positively, but certainly it will remain on a short term basis, it will remain challenging.  Beyond that I believe that the demographics of Western United States is -- remain very positive.  I like the demographics, I like the dynamism, I like the responsiveness and I like the proactiveness of the American economy.  This is not new and then this -- and I think this in the Western part of United States because you have Asian immigrants and Hispanic immigrants who love to work, save, and be entrepreneurial, I mean this is a great place to do business and this is a great place to do retail banking, and this is not going to change even if there is a cycle and there is a down part in the cycle, and this is where we are.  So, this is not going to change and this is there to stay.  For that reason on the medium to long term and that's how you should look at key assets in a group when your solvency and your overall position is what it is at BNP Paribas, I think it is still one of the best places in the world to do retail banking and that's my -- that's what I believe.  Apart from that certainly, as I said, the return on equity from value creation perspective for shareholders in a difficult year in 2007, that is on the second half, the return on equity on pre-tax for BancWest has been 25, for the French Retail it was 28, so we don't have a &#x2013; it's not such different.</p>
          <p>So the last thing is that, as I said on everything for BNP Paribas, we don't have to be complacent and I like to improve the performance of BancWest as much as like to improve performance of any asset of the Group.  We need to do better at revenues, we need to watch cost all the time and we need to be able to be better than others at managing the risk over that period and this is what I instructed the new CEO of BancWest to do and I'm watching it carefully and well this is well on my personal list I mean the performance of the BancWest, the relative performance of BancWest is something anybody watching me will tell you I look at it regularly and I watch it carefully, but that's it.  And in all of the world I mean there are not many places which are better for doing retail than United States, well except when it's a downturn in the United States, and this is where we are, but you shouldn't look at activities and assets on a short term perspective, at least that's what I am convinced, but then you wanted me to....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that you have to keep in mind that BancWest is very dynamic I mean they &#x2013; the commercial evolution of BancWest is very positive and if we compare to a peer group I may add some figures to the big set you have already in your hands.  We &#x2013; on the Q4 loans have been increased by 7.5% and for the peer group it was only 3.5%. If we look at it for the whole year, we have as well a higher growth than the peer groups, so that means that BancWest is a really dynamic bank and in this region and the community banking approach is something which is valuable. So, I think that it confirms what Baudouin has said just before.</p>

          <p>...last year and I was wondering there are some concerns today that life insurance in France is deteriorating because banks are chasing deposits and prefer to collect deposits than life insurance because of increased issues.  Can you give us some, I mean, your views about this market and especially your business in the retail network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, first of all we have to follow customer's choice.  I mean, we can have a policy which is more oriented towards deposits or towards insurance products, but anyway in the end it's customer choice.  Second point we see as worth noting is that in the insurance business we have fees which are the fees we receive as soon as the client signs the life insurance product and afterwards we have a regular fee which are on the management of the &#x2013; on the life insurance investment.  So, in fact it's a good business for the bank, so it's a question of a fair balance between liquidity questions and reward and profitability as a group.  That is exactly what we would like to manage.  Anyway, in the end it will be the customer's choice and the product is very good for the customers even if some rules have changed in terms of fiscal impact of these life insurance products in France.  Anyway it's a very interesting product of the &#x2013; for the bank.</p>

          <p>Just one more comment on that.  We were not under pressure to have more deposits as Baudouin mentioned, so we were not in a rush to continue to collect the life insurance and in my view we will continue to do so in 2008, so no dramatic change on that.  Perhaps a less favorable year, but still favorable for life insurance at the level of BNP Paribas.</p>

          <p>A question from J.P Morgan Asset Management.  If as you said, the US remain as one of the best place in the world to do retail banking, I would have thought that the current environment is providing you with the perfect opportunity to increase your exposure to the US and to buy another US bank, do you agree with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I don't think we are in such an acquisitive mode as you believe all together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you are buying US assets when asset prices are much higher there.</p>

          <p>Why not buy, why not buy, why buy?  I mean, we have you know, if you I mean, I have shown you 47 slides on the group.  It's already very -- the platform is great and we can grow the platforms as it is, and I will show you that, I mean, I will demonstrate that.  So, why buy, why not buy?  I mean, okay, so, I think that you know, control your platform and grow your platform is right.  And we have growth identified to such a kind of platform that a lot can be done as it is to grow it.  And organic growth I mean just not that we showed &#x2013; it's just not that we showed in the slide, I am convinced that we can do that.  And then there is a lot to be extracted from the platform those acquiring customers and organic growth and also our rationalizing further the platform.  So, in the next two, three years, I mean we know and just it's not fair to grow an impression.  We know what we are going to do and we are just going to do it.  And for that, we would just need the simple method and I think it &#x2013; I think that's moot.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it comes from a long position.  And that's normally at the time we took this position it was one year ago I remember.  In fact, it was totally reinsured by the monolines. At that time the monolines what particularly and we showed that we had no net exposure especially at that time, we assess that there were not net exposures.  Globally in our increasing debt, we have sometimes re-buy and recover; this is a result of that.  And fortunately the people leave monolines at no more, we will be no more required it, that's the reason why we disclosed that.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Jean-Pierre Lambert from KBW.  I look at the map Page 33.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is your extension plan and I was wondering general questions like it's a major effort going to emerging markets and diversify geographically.  This also envisions, a universal banking vision.  What are the risks involved in this huge transition and not all the large banks which have multiple geographies have been successful as some names come to mind?  What are risks in this transition?  Any of you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is an interesting question.  And certainly we are answering like any question.  At BNP Paribas when we do the strategic thinking that the Executives Committee should be doing, what we assess is that presently the part of revenues at BNP Paribas that comes from the emerging markets, which stand at 11%, is I mean still very limited compared to a lot of other players.  And we feel that again we will send you a somehow long-term risk reward, we see something that the group management should manage.  We think that having a bit more of that to emerging markets like going from 11% to 15%. 11% to 15% would change but it's not a key change and you will measure that either in geography or in businesses we are very much for &#x2013; we don't like the combo and advance for most things, we like little 55 yes.  And so that's what we do in geography as much as in business mix.  So, as much as in business mix since we created BNP Paribas we have seen the range of rate to CIB to AMS fairly stable, in the same way in geography we don't want to make the big difference.  We don't want to make the big change.  Because we think in banking you got to move cautiously in way.  And so moving in three years from 11% to 15% is both a significant step because to get there we need to double the revenues.  But it's a measure; it's a measured effort.  And we know that's my first comment.</p>
          <p>So it's a measured effort and it will still leave BNP Paribas by the way my view is that if we take a sort of large share group, the share of the emerging markets would be 19% of that today.  So 11% against 19 and then we think &#x2013; we still be a bit less exposed to emerging markets in another place.  People will like it, people well that's a market you can invest in different shares, BNP Paribas certainly is there, and if you should invest BNP Paribas you will be a bit more exposed to emerging markets in three years but certainly not more &#x2013; much less than other peers.  What I want you to do, as the shareholder of BNP Paribas I want you to write on the door this company should be in three years 15% emerging markets, I don't if I have a computer but that's where and what that's what we stand for.  And we tell you when, where, and how.  When it will be three years.  Where it will be undergoing problems.  I believe that Mediterranean and price in Europe is not too far from my home and from Europe.  And let me tell you in Morocco, in Nigeria, in well, all of as I mentioned in and certainly in Turkey and in Ukraine and Ukraine is Europe and so there we are not so far away.  And so, in flying it takes two hours and its up timing differences is not so big.  Then the national flows of business I mean, we see all of our key customers investing there, opening.  And so, this is close to the home market of BNP Paribas, which is now by expansion Europe.  I told you it's long ago, we are not French anymore, we are European and I view Europe as my home market.  So, this is the intend then to speak like this.  This is the emerging market, which is the integral to my home market, that's one thing.</p>
          <p>And branch banking and really millions of customers I want to view that there because I have a, because it's because this is probably the reason that I had mentioned.  It's very interesting because out to be very open and frank.  We didn't mean this was very different three years ago before we had Italy, before I mean, we were build it and we make it you know, like always strategy is a strategy in a company is how you make a problematic rationalization of what you do and what you are.  And it's not, but we would somehow we have now a much more precise view of what we want.  Because when we try to engineer &#x2013; where we do want to be in the emerging markets, where?  And also because of the BNL connection, BNL so, now we know that we have reached what we have want and this is a precise.  And this is a vision, we have set for the next few years and this is what we are going to do.  Two years ago, three years ago, it was different because we are in France, we are not in Italy and okay and all of the rest.  And also I must say I am very happy.  I think the acquisition we made in Ukraine and in Turkey were great because they were cheap, the timing was excellent and we got assets in those markets before it was doubled.  And double time we hate.  We would like others buy a double and we okay, so, we didn't buy a double.  The Turkish economy bankers it was a great move and Ukrainian the one thing I love in life is when I buy a bank and two months later as a competitive buyer another bank bids more twice the price, that's what I love.  And then I can really rest on weekends.  And I have seen that in Ukraine and I have seen that in Turkey.  Well the other thing you might even have both enough at bigger banks, the only thing you regret you should buy it cheap, is that putting &#x2013; a bit bigger that's okay, that's right.  I would rather buy a little smaller but cheap, so that's what we did in Turkey and we did in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>Once we have that we have to build it to grow and grow and then certainly what we like is, what we do in Ukraine as what we do &#x2013; in Ukraine what we basically go. We go to bank with several branch's and not many customers, so we are getting customers, I mean its incredibly successful.  In Turkey what we did is we go to bank with two branches and we open branches and we get customers.  And in each time the value I mean, there is real value for our shareholders because like always in that you better buy cheap because that's very important.  So that's what we did and that's a emerging market.  Now the Greek, I mean the China, India, Brazil it's different, why?  Because these are, I mean India and China are certainly enormous markets because each of them is a &#x2013; over a trillion inhabitants where as Ukraine is 48 million, well about the size of Poland big by open standards but not big by world standards.  But in China and India I view these two markets basically closed to foreigners, which is basically what they are organizing even if they belong to the well &#x2013; well the organized financial market.  And so its very difficult to enter there but we are in these two markets and I think in India which we have done lately is very good and we are building CIB and all that we can, and Brazil I think also we had strong position but I don't see us, we are not going to be doing retail in a large measure because in China and in India you cannot buy the majority of the bank, you can buy 5%.  So what we do is if we can't get by the door we go by the window and that's what we do in having both, well new problems taken in online brokerage company, in the mortgage finance company, in an equity finance company because that's what if we can do that lets do that, but at bank you cannot buy control of the retail banks in India.  And in China it works differently but its' basically the same.  So that's for the Greek country.  So I think that in emerging markets, what we have done is I think we exactly know which one to do.  The last thing I want to say is that we have found out that, at the Executive Committee where we are 11 members of the Management Team of BNP Paribas the world is too big for everybody to look after everything.  So we have decided that each of my, one of my colleagues would be in charge to coordinate an important strategy for each key markets and so we have &#x2013; and then we say each of us he is a sponsor.  And George is a sponsor for Ukraine, for Russia, and for the Gulf, and Jean-Paul is the sponsor for China, for Brazil and we've found out that we now have a very clear view of what we want to do, and there is one person at group level that can speak and coordinate the strategy of the group, and it now goes for I think year and a half, and I think that we have found it effective.  And I think what we have now is a much clear view of what we can do as a company.</p>
          <p>What we don't want to do is just as important as what we want to do.  And we have decided that this is what we want to do.  The world is too big, there are 170 nations at the United Nations and we can't go everywhere.  So we are going to do this, and what is not on this map we're not going to do.  And I think for you as shareholder or investor it is just as important to know what we are not going to do and what we are going to do.  This is why I wanted to set on this slide anything that is not there, and if you see BNP Paribas doing it you could say, well, I don't say that we need a ticket, that traffic ticket, but basically we should not be doing it.  Anything that is within the &#x2013; it is within BNP Paribas strategy, and I think this is very important as we are big and that there are lot of opportunities that we better set precisely what you should expect from BNP Paribas.  Because we have cash flow and what should we do with the cash flow.  And I think it's very important that we don't want to be unless you have that there are things to buy every year, you can go to the ocean every day, and then you got to collection of paintings, and at the end of the day it's nothing.  So that's what we want to do.  I am very happy that I think the strategic thinking that we've done and that this is result, it seems very simple, but it took us quite a bit of time to assess what we are, what are our strengths, where do we belong, and what do we want to do as a company.  I think any company has to do that.  And we've done it, and this is a team work, and I think a lot of team commitment and certainly commitment of the general management's being prepared to be there.  Other questions?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just have a question on BNL if I may, because 256, we are certainly above some 6.5 revenue growth in Italy, I am wondering if we could have a bit of breakdown on net interest income and fees, because the number itself is in line, maybe at such lower than the average top line growth I am expecting from Italy considering a bit of synergy support they get in this number.  But you are also talking about fee growth, which is quite remarkable because the country is affected and facing a massive low down there and the volume growth.  So does it mean you are suffering a bit of net interest margin contraction maybe in revenue because otherwise the 6.5% revenue growth seems tough to reconcile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you speak of the gross for 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The year-over-year is 6.5%. Let's say that the country will grow 7, 7.5 on my expectation, which sink or maybe flat.  So if you have, let's say 2%, 3% of the income growth, it means that the net interest income wise, maybe there is a bit of margin compression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on Italy &#x2013; well, in Italy there was misunderstanding, he's now more in the government, there's no new government.  So which is which, but finally there was the low and then decrease will really damage the banking revenues of Italian banks because you couldn't do &#x2013; you cease, you have to stop doing things that they were charging to customers, and well, BNL was impacted by that as I see.  And, so I think this is what I mean the reason what in terms of fee and the cession.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the three elements which to be kept in mind for Italy, first of all the global outlook, the economic outlook which is not very prudent because in fact we are forecasting the economic growth of less than 1%, and currency, I don't think that that could be one of the most &#x2013; one of the countries that show them the most important growth.  The second point, which is looking in that competition evolved which a normal thing.  We have a tighter regulatory government than one would hope.  Even if you have a positive viewing is that for the time being the implementation of the second phase of this for the time being he is on position hold, which is good news, because it would probably have pushed down the evolution of commissions in Italy of that, and the first half which was nothing at the out flows, out flows of mutual funds because of the customers' behavior.  Anyway, in this environment I think that BNP Paribas and BNL are well positioned.  You know, you have in mind the product regulations which have been implemented by BNL, and clearly customer satisfaction is really a fantastic set of products we offer to our clients and we are congratulated by everybody in Italy and something which is very productive for our economic growth.  I think that based on these we still think that Italy and BNL is one of the main growth engines for BNP Paribas for the future.  So, I think that's ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can I assume that the 6.5 is kind of a combination between 3, 4% fee income growth and 7, 8% direct interest income growth or?</p>

          <p>EBIT.  Because you know it depends on the policy how, for example mutual funds.  Therefore these employees will be provided something which will be adapted depending on customers demand.  So that's why we didn't give it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would see in revenue a bit more inline.  But I don't see that it will be so stretched between I think a little less stretch but what you mentioned between the fee growth and the net investment growth.  Yes.</p>
