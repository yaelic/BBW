      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen. We are very happy to welcome all of you at this another teleconference dedicated to the publication of a consolidated financial reporting by Gazprom under the IFRS for 2009.</p>
          <p>Apart from myself, also in attendance are the representatives of the Department of Economic Expertise and Pricing, representatives of accounting, the Head of the Department for Consolidated Reporting, Mr. Rasseev, who later on will also have a brief presentation to make, then the Head of the presentation for foreign economic activities, Department for Marketing, Finance and Economics and Gazprom Exports.</p>
          <p>We are holding this teleconference in our traditional format and we shall start with the presentation. As usual the slides have been uploaded on the Gazprom site in our financial reports link. And so let me begin with the brief overview of the financial results by Gazprom through 2009 as well as our operational results for the Group during the past year.</p>
          <p>Please if you'd take at look at slide number four, compared to the high result of 2008 revenue of the company in 2009 went down by 9%, adjusted EBITDA by 26%, nevertheless the net profit of the company last year grew by 5%, and I would like to elaborate more upon that issue and therefore would ask you to switch over to the next slide now.</p>
          <p>So slide number five; as was expected, by the end of '09, our debt burden contracted compared to the reporting period during the first 9 months of '09. And considering the net debt the difference practically was RR100 billion, which is about 7%. The overall debt went down by 8%. And so the average cost of debt in terms of servicing during the reporting period was 7.6%.</p>
          <p>So it is notable as well that the relative debt ratios were going down as part of our target range. And so, considering the results of the reporting period, the overall debt to EBITDA went down to 1.5%, which principally speaking, is the kind of the target range that we have been trying to achieve. And so the net debt to EBITDA came down about 1.3%.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to maintain the structure of our debt portfolio, adhering to the policy of extending our debt servicing profile. By the end of '09, the short term debt was 26% to the overall portfolio and currently I would like to switch over to the next slide where we will consider our operational results.</p>
          <p>So let me begin with our reserves. We are doing the independent assessment of our capital reserves and equipment where the SPE/PRMS [Society of Petroleum Engineers/ Petroleum Resources Management System] standards. And that so as of the end of '09, proven and probable reserves of Gazprom Group amounted to 21.9 trillion cubic meters of gas, 722 million tonnes of condensate and 1.154 billion tonnes of oil, which in aggregation amounts to 143 billion barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>And here you can see the dynamics of our reserves and their net present value. By the end of '09 the net present value of our reserves in hydrocarbon category was valued at US$241.3 billion. At the same time there is a very good potential for <mark type="inaudible" /> Now let's consider our production results during '09.</p>
          <p>And so slide number 7 can show that by the end of the year we produced 461 billion cubic meters of gas, which by 16% lower compared to '08. Particularly dramatic decline in demand was observed in the first half of the year when production went down by 25% in order to avoid our design output in our reservoirs we limited production our fields in their original stage which contains additional reservoir and compression potential.</p>
          <p>The mature fields were being developed in their planned mode, and issued results testifies to a very good resilience and a high flexibility in our production cycle against fluctuations of demand for gas.  Since the middle of '09, demand in the main market, and following that, the indicators of our production, started climbing back to normal.</p>
          <p>The production of oil and gas condensate in '09 was less considerable, comparing to the results of '08 production of oil went down by 1.8% and 7.4% in gas condensate. As far as the long-term forecast is concerned, they have been prepared by the Group based upon conservative estimations, therefore, longer term, we are predicting substantial growth in the production of hydrocarbons by 2020. The global economic crisis which was and followed by the reduction of the industrial output and energy consumption in the main industrial market, led to the reduction of sales of natural gas in '09.</p>
          <p>In the next slide is where you can see these sales dynamics. One can note that the reduction of the amounts of sales to a very large extent affected our financial results.  For example, in '09 net revenue from the sale of the gas into Europe and other countries in dollar terms went down by 13% compared to '08. This kind of reduction became the result both in the reduction of demand as well as the substantial reduction of gas prices in this market cluster.</p>
          <p>The net revenue from the sales of gas into the former Soviet Union countries also went down by 13% which can be explained by the reduction of overall volume sales by 41% which was partially compensated by the gas prices growing in the former Soviet Union countries denominated in Rubles. In Russia, considering the results of '09, net revenue from sales of gas went up by 5% which can be explained by the growth of the average sales price for gas in the domestic market established by the Federal Tariff Service by 12% however, this was partially compensated by for the reduction of the sales volumes by 6%.</p>
          <p>And let's talk other segments of our businesses are concern the sales from the sale of electric power and heating grew by 45%, from the sale of oil and processing products by 17%, from the sale of crude oil and gas condensate went down by 18%, from the sale of the transportation services went down by 7%. So overall through 2009 the net revenue through the group reduced by 9%.</p>
          <p>In conclusion of my half of the presentation I'd like to comment upon the situation in gas market which we saw during Q1 2010, as you may see upon the subsequent slide which is slide number 9 the volume of Gazprom sales of gas in the traditional sales market grew, but in the preliminary estimations by the management the sales of gas in 2010 in Q1 grew by 22% comparing to the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>During the period since January until April, production of gas in the company exceeded the planned one by 4.5 billion cubic meters emerging to over 171 billion cubic meters per gas.</p>
          <p>And now, you can take a look at the next slide. And I would like to draw your attention to the main trends, which we expect will be manifesting themselves in 2010. This is slide number 10. And because of the demand for gas growing back in our main markets, we have improved our outlook for the production of gas up to 530 billion cubic meters this year. We also expect that the growth trend within the main lines of our operation, specifically production of gas, oil, production of power, and heating will also sustain until the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We also predict that the revenue will be growing; control over the cost will also remain. In terms of the overall group debt we expect this particular figure to go down during the year.</p>
          <p>So these are the main points with respect to the activities and various trends that the company will be demonstrating according to as we expect within 2010, so let me conclude my presentation and pass the floor over to Mikhail Rosseev, who is the Head of our Consolidated Reporting Department within the Department for Accounting. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Before I specifically switch over to presenting the results of our consolidated reporting I would like to draw your attention to certain changes in the format according to which we will be presenting this data covering the results of the so called trading activities within the period under review.</p>
          <p>Previously, before the '09 reports were being prepared. These operations were very reflected upon our aggregate report both in terms of the operations and our revenue on a more elaborate basis.</p>
          <p>And because of the growth in the numbers of such transactions as well as considering your scrutiny of these activities, we decided to go back to this issue and additional analyze the way we were presenting these data within our first reports and we came to conclusion that simply because it is not about the physical delivery of extra specific consumers but rather about the maximization of profit by way of entering into number of sales and acquisition transactions within the organized platforms without physical delivery so we thought that it was necessary to reconsider its way we presented them in our reports.</p>
          <p>And second, after having done such analysis we decided that the most optimum way for presenting it and reflecting the results of these transactions in the report about our consolidated revenue in the form of a separate financial results which is reflected separately from the revenue and operational expenses.</p>
          <p>And I believe that you might have noted already that in our reports about consolidated revenue there is a new line item, the net revenue from the trading operations from physical delivery. And so to ensure credibility, we also recalculated our results of '08 within our reports in '09.</p>
          <p>And these changes, they are not the ones that are related to changing of the accounting policy or our various appraisals. Just the form of the presentation, we continue looking at it as part of our operating nature. And we believe that the way changing this particular presentation improves the level of transparency with which we present our results.</p>
          <p>And basically, you can see up on slide number 12 that although the results of these transactions are not very considerable comparing to the overall operations results of the Group, however, during the past year, profit almost doubled to the value of 8 billion rubles.</p>
          <p>And now let's move over to the next slide where you can see the data reflecting operational expenses of the group in various categories and we are that this particular element is the one which is under the strongest scrutiny amongst the majority of those following our work.</p>
          <p>As can be seen from this slide the basic growth in our operation expense took place because of the cost growing for the purchase of oil and gas around somewhere 7 to 8 billion rubles at the same time the cost related to the acquisition of gas by 71 billion rubles 19% and the overall growth like we have considered in terms of our intermediate reporting primarily was related to prices grown for central Asian gas.</p>
          <p>And without taking into account the growing expense in this particular line item, overall operational expenses grew only by 6%.</p>
          <p>While the cost growing for the transit of oil and gas climbed to RR3 billion is primarily related to cost growing for transportation of gas through the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan territories.</p>
          <p>The depreciation expenses by RR26 billion, which primarily was related to expanding our fixed asset as well as because of new acquisitions and specifically the Gazprom Neft group expanding its portfolio of assets as well as changing the remainder of the gas and underground storage and respectively, changes in the right-off of the expenses that are related for that particular item.</p>
          <p>Another element which continuously is being debated in the course of our telephone conferences is the Other expenses line item which during the reporting period grew by RR35 billion which primarily was explained by the influence from the following factors.</p>
          <p>The first one on the list is the reduction and profit from the revaluation of our profit in terms of receivables denominated in foreign currency. So the influence from this factor reflected in growing cost by &#x2013; our expenses growing by RR7 billion.</p>
          <p>In Other, now show RR7 billion grew because of the profit growing down because of the derivatives. While 5 billion in incremental growth was expenses for legal and consultancy services, RR9 billion for R&amp;D and 5 billion because of certain fixed assets being written off.</p>
          <p>The next slide, which is number 14, demonstrates basic changes in the structure of the Group and as far as establishing control or acquiring new companies is concerned. So changes in the structure of the Group during the past two years has been the kind of factor which required explanation because of the various dynamics that were expected in our reporting.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn over to slide number 15, which presents the most material one-off type of operations which occurred in the reporting period and which considerably affected our financials.</p>
          <p>So within that particular slide the most considerable one-off transaction was the attribution of the revenue from the small asset &#x2013; asset small transaction with Ruhrgas as a result of which we have turned over to that company our share in starting up from in the amount of 25% and in exchange of it we received the share in Gerosgaz company which is the owner of 2.93% shares of Gazprom.</p>
          <p>And according to the accounting rules one must appraise the assets received marking them to the market and therefore in our reporting we are affected to the revenue in the amount of RR105 billion.</p>
          <p>Another one off considerably one-off transaction was an acknowledgment of revenue because of the acquisition of a minority stake in Gazprom Neft's past of the auction arrangement buying 25% of the shares for Gazprom from ENI.</p>
          <p>And the further difference in the RR14 million also positively affected to the financials of the Group.</p>
          <p>Upon the next slide which is number 16, here you can see that the influence from the reduction of sales and the result of it the reduction of profit, to a great extent, was compensated by one-off revenues as well as their positive dynamics related to the associated company.</p>
          <p>And as a result of it our annual revenue grew by RR22 billion or 3% and revenue related to the Gazprom shareholders grew by RR36 billion or 5%.</p>
          <p>Thank you, very much. I'd like to finish my presentation with that, and in case there will be any questions we will be definitely very happy to answer that.</p>
          <p>Yes, indeed ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to answer your questions. We have about 40 minutes, which will be dedicated to Q&amp;A and myself and my colleagues are at your disposal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Lev Snykov from VTB Capital. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question is whether the person who was asking understands correctly that the new agreement with Ukraine will start working as of Q2. And that's starting as of Q2, it won't bring about any changes in the revenue of the Group. And will it be related to any changes in the various terms and conditions which are regulating the destinations for the gas delivery? Will it bring about any reclassification of the gas flows?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about SeverEnergia. Could you give us any understanding of what will be happening because before June you were supposed to come to an agreement in terms of the period of time and the level of output which will be specifically related to this project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question is concerned we will have Victor Ivanov who is the Deputy Head of the department for working with the immediate abroad countries, while the second question, Pavel Zurovik who is the Deputy Head of the department for foreign economic activities will be giving us the answers to these two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are quite right in the way you understand this agreement and so basically there is nothing for me to add to what you just mentioned because we indeed are not losing anything and so these agreements will come into force as of Q2 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again as far as these agreements are concerned they won't affect any reclassification of our gas flow deliveries at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in terms of the question about SeverEnergia, Pavel is speaking, and so the development plan, as far as particular company is concerned, it already has been agreed in due quarters so the start of the production of gas is expected as of the beginning of 2011? As of 2011 not from the beginning from sometimes during 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Oswald Clint from Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening, two question please. The first one is, can you give us any further information on any renegotiation of long term oil and contracts into Europe since your last update in February after strategy day so has there been any further customer requirements in Europe for changes to the pricing terms of those contracts since February? Thank you. And the second question is, you talk in your report today about the strategy of the demanding market focusing on the improvement of profitability of sales in the domestic market, you've given us revenue and volume numbers today, can you talk about whether that profitability was or had it improve more in 4Q the second half of 2009 and what do you expect for 2010 for our particular business unit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in answer to the first question we have Vladimir Shicherin who is the head of the department for working with our foreign counterparts in Gazprom exports. And the second question we will have in terms of this particular question, with respect to the Russian domestic gas market, we'll have Mr. Sukov who is in charge of the department for the distribution of the gas resources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as various negotiations with our partners in terms of price renegotiations are continuing and we are not yet able to quote any specific results.</p>
          <p>The sales of gas in the domestic market grew comparing to the similar period last year, meaning the '08 in terms of the reporting period by 4.5% and that was the result because of the December weather conditions changing when gas consumption grew up in terms of the electricity it produces and households.</p>
          <p>And we will also have Mikhail Rasseev, who will give a few more words in explaining the way it was reflected in our running acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the revenue and comparing it in between '09 and '08 you have to take into account a certain technical point, because of consolidating into the Gazprom Group the power generation asset, the consolidated revenue grows down by the amount of the deliveries respectively to our power generation asset and so because of that it will grow by 23%, has grown by 23% because of the prices also going up and also because right now looking at 2010 the prices are going to be higher and so we expect the revenue in 2010 also to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wonder just has a follow up. Is it possible to say what the EBITDA margin is on the domestic sales, on the domestic gas business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gazprom being a vertically integrated company and operating as such, we are taking into account the peculiarities of our technological process. We are not calculating and we are not disclosing the EBITDA value in terms of this or that market position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Please, next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Karen Kostanian from Bank of America. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the presentation. There are two questions. The first one, because of the political situation in Ukraine improving, will it somehow affect the timing for the launching of the south stream simply because the situation in Ukraine has gotten better and the company might have a chance to count upon the Ukrainian transportation infrastructure and the second question because of the European Gas market situation and the spot prices going down, are you going to continue sitting upon the equal profitability principle with the domestic market and if so, what are you trying to connect this equal profitability to &#x2013; your oil contracts or to the spot price or any other compromise in between the spot price and oil contracts domestically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me give an answer to the first question, saying that south stream has been and shall remain one of the strategically important project for Gazprom. And so no changes, no adjustments as far as the development of this project is concerned are taking place. Secondly, observing the principle of equal profitability for the same kind of a product in any of the markets where it is being sold, be it the domestic one or the external one, that is so far as specifically gas is concerned. This is the kind of principle which we have being following for already quite some time and validating it in terms of being a necessary one.  And so principally speaking, we are in a continuous dialog with the ministries and government agencies pertaining to this issue. But as far as the methodology is concerned for estimating the principle of equal profitability, I would ask the head of the economic appraisal and pricing department, Mr. Vasily Smirnov.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So right now the pricing formula is applied in the estimations done by the Federal Tariff Service by way of an indicative price. And the practical application of this methodology shows that the calculations of this particular price will be necessary in the future and they should be based upon the ratings of gas oil and market covering as the basis the period of nine months, which would correspond to the basic contracts of our export gas deliveries.</p>
          <p>And so the experience so far derived from these estimations in terms of the pricing formula points to there being a need for a transitional period. And so, within this period, we will assess the way the spot market might influence this particular methodology. And by 2013 we'll submit respective ideas and propositions about the way it should be worked in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do we understand correctly then that no matter what kind of equal profitability is there, you won't expect it to manifest itself practically, not before 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes indeed, because the estimations have shown that in order to be able to transit from 2011 to equally profitable prices, one will have to go at it at a very quick pace which is not justified neither from the point of view of the national economy nor from the point of view of making sure that the result is good. So that would be done in a gradual way during the transitional period</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Maxim Moshkov from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are a couple of questions. The first one is about the report. Could you please clarify how many of the fixed assets were acquired in '09 on the basis of a barter arrangement? And the second question is about the reconsolidation of the volume of exports into Europe, because as far as I recall Mr. Medvedev quoted the figure of 148 billion cubic meters and in the reports we see that it is 152.8 billion. Could you explain the difference please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have Mr. Rosseev answering this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So giving an answer to the first particular question, it is possibly necessary to specify a number of things to make things clear, because during the past few years, about 3 years, the volume of non-monetary settlements, in terms of our settlements with the receivables, as well as in our acquisitions and purchases has regularly been going down. And let us say in terms of the receivables, this particular value doesn't exceed 1 to 2%.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the second part of it, the situation is a bit more complicated because partially we are involved in the investment process on our own because we have a division which is directly engaged in the construction projects and processes. Besides, we're supplying our construction facilities with equipments and inputs from our own company.</p>
          <p>And so, if one is to take into account these kinds of transactions related to the supplies of various construction facilities with the necessary materials and inputs, then the share of non-monetary settlements in the investment process is going to be slightly higher than in what we settle with the buyers.</p>
          <p>And taking into account the fact that this particular issue is very narrowly specific and our reports do not call for disclosing any such items, I can tell you that on an indicative basis, this particular figure won't exceed 10% from the overall value of the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>And as far as the second question is concerned, again without going too deep into details, I can say that probably we are talking about comparing two figures, which is export and sales and they are, at a minimum, different from each other by the purchases of gas which are done outside of Russia and consequently being sold in the European market and these are transactions which can be done by both our subsidiaries as well as the company itself.</p>
          <p>Thank you, very much. Next question please.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Alexander Burgonsky from Renaissance Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so there are also two questions.  The first one is follow up to the previous speaker's question, could you be more specific, if at all possible, because from the figure which you reported 153 billion cubic meters gas sold to Europe, which part of it ,which share of it, from this particular amount, comes from the trading operations?  And the second question, again looking at the report in terms of the segmented information, which is supplement number seven the overall amount of depreciation during '09 RR397.5 billion and in the operational expenses the amount of depreciation expense is cited at RR221 billion could you explain the difference please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first off, I'd like to say that with respect to the trading operations it is necessary once again to clarify going back to the point in the presentation, what makes a pure trading when the transactions, when in the trading platform it's been entered into simply for the purpose of generating revenue rather than physical delivery is not reflected in the volumes of gas sold which we are expecting our according as sales per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, we have various transactions when we buy or acquire gas in the European gas or outside of Russia and sell it in the European market to the end buyers with a physical delivery to the end buyers as part of a normal trading activity. And so, respectively, the difference between the exports and the overall trading gives you this particular difference. I think the figure quoted was 148 and 153 -- or 142. So it is 142 and 152</p>
          <p>And in terms of the second question, it is necessary to give you a bit of an explanation because as of 2009, the company has been reflecting information within segments with requirements from the new IFRS number 8 standard.</p>
          <p>And so, in accordance with this particular standard, the information that we are specifically looking into in terms of the segments must be disclosed as from the point of view of the management approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the new standards require that the information about the segments to be disclosed from the point of view of the management approach, as was already stated, and so we do not reflect this particular result in what we present, because our subsidiaries who operate in the market, they do not prepare independent reporting. And so we when considered their results we put it together and prepare on the basis of the statutory accounts, Russian statutory accounts.</p>
          <p>And so because of this, the depreciation that you basically see within the information about the segments is based upon the depreciation which these companies accrue and basically this is the depreciation under the Russian statutory accounts.</p>
          <p>And also, in terms of the segmented information, there is a separate chart which is being disclosed in the way the financial results are reconciled in terms of second to our revenue before taxation in line with the IFRS requirements.</p>
          <p>And therefore this particular point constitutes the biggest difference. But there is a slighter difference, which is related to the capitalization of depreciation in the incomplete construction projects as well as the reserves.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and please next question, and please note that we've got about five minutes, which means that we have enough time for one big question or for a couple of small questions.</p>
          <p>So please accept my apologies in case somebody won't have enough time to raise question that you wanted, but since we already have a tradition, if we will end up having some unanswered questions, you will have an opportunity to mail them in electronically and we will also respond in writing. Next question please.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Vaden Meschorshen from Alds Creed. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first question is about the purchases of gas. Is it possible to quote the figure for '09? And separately, within that particular figure, could you identify what comes from the central Asian gas acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the acquisition of gas, it is 113 billion cubic meters of gas in '09 and about 111 &#x2013; 112 in '08. We are sorry, but we are not in a position to identify separately what came from Central Asia, simply because it was not only the parent company that was involved in these acquisitions, but also a number of subsidiaries. So we don't have this particular itemization in our hands right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question was that Mr. Kruglov, in his presentation, stated that in the current year, the company is expecting a certain further reduction of its net debt position. Are there any preliminary understandings in terms of the amount by which the net debt of the group could further decline?</p>
          <p>So as far as the company's consolidated debt level is concerned we, clearly speaking in terms of the parent company, are expecting this level to go down by about 3 billion. However, this is as far the parent company only is concerned, apart from that we have subsidiaries which are consolidated into the &#x2013; into the consolidated reporting, this is Gozpam Neft and the power generation units, which may demonstrate a certain increase in their debt, but a roundabout reduction of the debt we expect to be as a minimum by about 1 to US$2 billion.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. The time for our presentation and this telephone conference has come to its end.
