        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to the Full Year '08 Financial Results. I would like to thank all of you for coming to our offices. We have people on the phones. We have people watching via the webcast, as well as people here in our offices.</p>
          <p>And this morning, John, Mark and Cameron are going to give you a bit of an overview. This afternoon, John Hooper will host a conference call, talking about conduits. Both sessions will have Q&amp;A opportunities, so feel free to save all those questions up. I'm sure you've got a few.</p>
          <p>And then just finally, what I'd like to do is just hand over to John for his last results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hany, and good morning, everyone. Well, the last six months has been characterized by chaotic and dysfunctional debt markets. We've seen huge write-downs in banks all over the world. And as a result, some banks have gone out of business and others have run for the support of a friendly merger partner or government capital.</p>
          <p>Obviously, NAB, as most international issuing banks has not escaped, unscathed either because earlier this year we announced that we were taking a charge for bad and doubtful debt, so circa $1 million in terms of our ABS CDOs.</p>
          <p>But notwithstanding that charge and notwithstanding the fact that economies that we operate in have gotten worse during the year, then we are pleased still to be able to announce a cash earnings figure of $3.9 billion for the full year ended in September.</p>
          <p>And as you'll see a little later, when we go through the detail of our results, when Mark goes through the detail, you'll see that there are strong underlying results in all of our businesses and these are characterized by continuing revenue growth and excellent cost management.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm also pleased to say that we've maintained our focus on both customers and on communities. Also during the period, our employee engagement has improved and our talent management has continued to excel. In fact, that's something I think the group is very good at nowadays.</p>
          <p>So the combination of these factors, of the underlying businesses with the other factors, make me confident that this group has the strength and has the resilience to continue to deliver shareholder value, even through the most difficult of times.</p>
          <p>Now, you will recall that at the half year I mentioned that we had very tight business settings, and in fact that we deliberately were putting strength and stability of the group before cash earnings.</p>
          <p>And as you'll see when we go through the results, all of the businesses have done well. All of the results are good, CDOs apart. And in fact, in terms of the Australian Bank, quite frankly, it's outstanding.</p>
          <p>We have again demonstrated our ability to manage costs in a sustainable and ongoing way. Now, that ability is going to be even more important in the future as we find harder economic times. Now, our costs, in fact, for the year were down 2% on the previous September.</p>
          <p>Now, as you would expect, in worsening economic conditions in all of the markets in which we operate, there have been increases in arrears and in impaired assets. But notwithstanding that, we have spent a lot of time looking at the quality of our portfolio in every geography and we are very happy with the soundness of that portfolio and that we're well provisioned.</p>
          <p>Now, given the volatility in the debt markets this year, a particular focus for us has been liquidity. And you'll see at the end of September we held more than $60 billion of liquid assets. Now, just to give you some idea, that's approximately $35 billion more than we are required to hold by our regulators.</p>
          <p>Also during the year we raised $28 billion of wholesale term funding. Now, that was in particularly difficult markets and that makes me confident that the figures that we strive for in the current year, which is between 14 and 19 billion, should be achievable and we should be able to complete that program.</p>
          <p>Now, this &#x2013; I'm also pleased that we're able to declare a final dividend of $0.97 fully franked, which means that our dividend will be up 6.6% on the previous year. We have a strong Tier 1 capital ratio at 7.35% on a Basel II basis, but we will outline to you later some plans we have to increase that ratio further over the next year.</p>
          <p>Well, this is my last set of results that I will give as CEO of NAB, and what I intend to do is leave any comments about the future of the bank to my successor, Cameron Clyne, who will speak to you a little bit later. But given that I am probably the elder statesman of the industry, I thought it might be appropriate for me to say a few words about the banking system in Australia because we have seen in recent months both governments and regulators across the world scurrying to try to call to calm the markets.</p>
          <p>And let me assure you that Australia has been ahead of the game. What has been incredibly pleasing for me is that since the beginning of this crisis 12 months ago, there has been serious goodwill and cooperation and trust between governments, regulators, including the Reserve Bank, and the commercial banks. Now, I believe that's a distinguishing feature of this country and I think that will stand this nation in good stead for whatever the future holds in store for us.</p>
          <p>So let me stop there and hand over to Mark, who will take us through the detail of the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everybody. It's my pleasure to take you through the detail. I think not unreasonably many people here today would really like to focus in on the issues of asset quality, in particular the conduit assets which are getting quite some attention, getting a feel for the future growth rates for the business, and of course the whole incredibly important situations around funding and capital, given the volatility going on in financial markets today.</p>
          <p>And rest assured, we will deal with all of those issues. And in fact, as Hany already mentioned, we are having a separate session on conduit assets this afternoon to go with considerably deeper disclosures around those positions, as NAB has moved to voluntarily adopt disclosures recommended by the Financial Stability Forum.</p>
          <p>So everybody will have a chance to dig into those and have all their questions answered. But we won't deal with conduit assets at more than a headline level as we go through the results presentation because I think it might require more time.</p>
          <p>But before we go to each of those issues, I do want to take some time to emphasize the strength in the performance of the underlying franchises. And I think you can see &#x2013; as we go through, you will see positives in all of them.</p>
          <p>I think that in the long run, when recessions pass and capital markets settle down, the strength of the franchises is the most important thing. And also I would point out that, as you go through difficult periods, periods of dislocation, market shares become more fluid. So it is a great time to have momentum in your businesses. So we draw some comfort from that.</p>
          <p>So let me just give you a summary view, first of all, beginning with the strength of the franchises. As John has already pointed out and you have no doubt already assimilated, the Australian Bank performance was very strong indeed, with a 19.9% year-on-year growth in cash earnings and 14% for sequential halves, so constituting an acceleration in performance in the second half.</p>
          <p>And that performance is characterized by continued strength on the revenue line, a gaining share in SME, a strong performance on deposits, excellent cost control and very considerable attention to the asset quality side, so it's an all-round robust result.</p>
          <p>The UK and the New Zealand franchises, of course, are operating in what are already more difficult markets. Both of those economies are acknowledged as being in recession. But as we measure those franchises, we are comfortable that they continue to perform well above their local peers. And when we get into the detail, you will see a slowing in asset growth in those businesses or revenue growth in those businesses in the second half and this is a conscious effort to focus our capital around areas of highest return and, again, to be cautious on asset quality and the nature of business we write under tough economic conditions.</p>
          <p>And turning to nabCapital, obviously nabCapital stubbed its toe with the CDO write-offs during the year, but when we look at nabCapital at the underlying level, you will see strength in most parts of its portfolio continuing to come through, in part reflecting investments we've made in people and systems and in part reflecting re-pricing opportunities and a return to sensible pricing for risk in the corporate sector.</p>
          <p>Then, as John has &#x2013; as we emphasized at the half-year and John has just recapped, in terms of our business settings, if you like, that have been adopted over the last six months, these are the most important. We have the additional levels of liquidity John pointed out and that actually proved to be quite valuable as we've entered a period of illiquidity over recent weeks, prior to government intervention and now have had, I think, by far the strongest liquidity position in our industry.</p>
          <p>We have substantially reduced the term funding task, as John said, by being conservative in the execution of the 28 billion of term funding that we undertook in the last year and favoring very long maturities. And we've also less obviously moved to term out our short positions considerably as well and we are tapping the six-month to 12-month part of the curve very substantially. And therefore the amount of paper that we have rolling at anytime and the nature of our term funding ask are both considerably reduced.</p>
          <p>Both of these initiatives come at some cost to cash earnings by the way because the further you move out in term, either at the short end or at the long end, obviously cost something. And this is evidence of us putting the security of the position ahead of the cash earnings while we go through this dislocation.</p>
          <p>Now, our capital ratios &#x2013; the policy bands are under review with the Board as we settle into our stride with Basel II. At the moment, we are managing the business to a 7% Tier 1 minimum because that is the level that the rating agencies have determined is the level they will be comfortable with AA banks operating at.</p>
          <p>As John has already told you, we came in substantially ahead of that, at 7.355%, and we've already announced initiatives to take our capital to a stronger position through use of a dividend shortfall to supplement capital. A combination of that and hybrid capacity should see us heading towards 8% quite quickly.</p>
          <p>And then finally, on asset quality, we've had considerable emphasis around conservative lending, constantly reviewing our settings, migrating the portfolio to progressively higher levels of secured lending and engaging in various risk management practices.</p>
          <p>Now, the obvious one in the nabCapital sense was moving to hedge the weakest part of the purchased assets in the conduit portfolio to levels that we are comfortable with in the current environment. And in the mainstream businesses, that means working closely with customers to move them away from the points at which they may get into trouble before that happens. And it also meant undertaking a year-end review of the bottom $50 billion of our credit exposures right across the portfolio and emerging with the conclusion that they were well understood and appropriately provisioned.</p>
          <p>Then on the cost front, we've continued a very strong performance in costs. In fact, our costs actually dropped 2% year-on-year, although that's helped by foreign exchange movements. And foreign exchange adjusted, the costs grew 1.5%, which is well within our guidance and brings the Australian Bank to what we believe is at the moment the lowest cost-to-income ratio in Australia and probably one of the lowest for a full service bank in the world at 40.6% average for the second half. And I must say, as you go into a period where revenue growth may be under pressure and there are other headwinds faced by the business, it's good to be the low-cost producer in any industry.</p>
          <p>We are reconfirming our guidance that our cost growth will be around inflation. We measure inflation in Australia at approximately 4% at the moment and in the UK it's about 5%. Now, we all expect that that inflation will ameliorate at some stage, but I think we can be comfortable in assuming that that sort of inflation will prevail over most of the coming year. And therefore, we would expect our cost growth to be around 4%.</p>
          <p>And finally, as we committed when we brought forward the conduit provisioning a few months ago, we have looked through that provisioning in terms of setting our final year dividend and we've maintained it, matched to the first half at $0.97 per share, which gives an increase year-on-year of 6.6%. Now, that leads to a temporarily high payout ratio for the year and in the second half in particular. But on a look-through basis, our payout ratio would be 67.5% and so we're comfortable with that level of dividend.</p>
          <p>Just a snapshot of the group result, which I'm sure you've already had a look at, our net operating income grew year-on-year 5.8%, although foreign exchange adjusted, that grew 9.1%. Obviously, now with the Australian dollar in decline, we may be entering a period where the foreign exchange may work to help us, particularly nabCapital US dollar revenues and the UK bank, but anyway, 5.8% year-on-year. Operating expenses, as I said, notionally declined 2%, giving an underlying profit growth of 13.9%.</p>
          <p>The charge for bad and doubtful debts grew considerably. If you take out the &#x2013; just over $1 billion for conduit provisioning, that &#x2013; the underlying bad and doubtful debts grew by just under 700 million, so a near doubling, in any case, with about 200 million of that increase coming in the Australian Bank, 100 million in the UK bank, and about 375 million in nabCapital.</p>
          <p>Our ROE and ROA have fallen, in equal parts a function of lower cash earnings and higher holdings of capital.</p>
          <p>I do want to point to some of the headwinds that we've been dealing with through this year, and so I've singled out some here, some you know well already. One is conduit-related costs, and in here we have the provisioning as well as the cost of the hedging that was undertaken and announced a little while ago. The impact of currencies on business earnings, as I said, that's something that hopefully will begin to move in the other direction. The additional &#x2013; just the additional liquidity costs were an $88 million expense after tax.</p>
          <p>IoRE moved from a positive to a negative, taking 53 after tax out of the result, and the additional funding costs that we've incurred at the short end and long end combined to add nearly 370 million to input costs. And our businesses, some of them, were quite successful in passing these along and re-pricing to customers, and others have not had the opportunity, either because of the nature of products or a non-maturing of customer commitments, and so we've had to absorb a considerable portion of that.</p>
          <p>The only positive was on the taxation line where we had some overprovision in prior years that was released. And importantly, the acquisition of GWB allowed us to value some otherwise stranded tax losses in the US and bring those to account.</p>
          <p>You've seen this picture before. It's a summary view of our Jaws and cost to income momentum as a group. And you can see that for the full year to September '08, we maintained our Jaws pretty much at 7.5% on a pre-FX basis with revenue at 9.1, costs growing 1.5. And the cost to income ratio at the group level continues to march down at quite a significant pace, falling over these two years from 54.5% to 46.9%.</p>
          <p>Now, this is a slightly busy slide, but I just wanted to preface the business unit P&amp;Ls at the underlying profit level and at the cash earnings level, before we get into the detail and then I'll move quite quickly through the businesses. First of all, at the underlying profit level, you can see for the year and for the sequential half the strong performance of the Australian Bank, up 21.6% for the full year and 11.8% for the half.</p>
          <p>MLC was just better than flat for the year and down on the half, primarily because of the weakness in equity markets and its impact on FUM and a 1% drop in FUM is worth about $8 million of operating income in that business. So a 10% drop in asset values could take 80 million off the revenue and that's what we're dealing with in that business. So I would expect performance next year to be much more a function of the second half than of the average for the year.</p>
          <p>The UK business and the New Zealand business turned in a very similar performance, between 11 and 12% growth year-on-year and between 3 and 4% growth for the sequential halves, indicating a slowing, and as I said to you, much of that self-imposed.</p>
          <p>And in nabCapital, the second half is a 20% swing to the negative, from 731 down to 578, largely reflecting the conduit hedging costs and other securities impairment, which gets taken through the revenue line, rather than through any other place in the P&amp;L. The underlying businesses were at least as good in the second half as they were in the first. And for the year, nabCapital has moved from 960 million to 1.3 billion, a 36% increase reflecting strength in all the businesses, except structuring and investments.</p>
          <p>And then at the cash earnings level, I'll just focus where the story is really different and that is in the UK bank where a 50% increase in bad debts for the year, coming all in the second half, has given rise to the sequential half falling from &#xA3;139 million to &#xA3;110 million and bringing the otherwise strong year-on-year growth back to an almost flat 2.5% increase.</p>
          <p>And the other is nabCapital, which swings from a positive to a negative, 373 at the half, 417 negative for the second half. And that is really a combination of 100 million in cash earnings of the conduit hedging and related costs, about 470 million after-tax of a difference between the two halves in conduit provisioning, and about another 190 million after-tax of nabCapital bad and doubtful debts being felt in other areas including some of the companies that you read about in the newspaper.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly then flip through each of the franchises in turn, focus on their drivers and then just touch on their P&amp;L holistically. First of all, for the Australian Bank, business lending continued to grow, growing at over 7%. And by our measure and it requires some unpicking of APRA statistics, by our measure, our SME franchise in Australia quite consistently grows above system, despite being the leader. So a 7% plus growth in business lending, close to 5% growth in deposits. There's obviously very considerable competition for deposits, so there are issues around pricing and the like that create attention there, but nevertheless a creditable performance on the deposit side and the housing market also continuing to grow pretty much in line with historic trends.</p>
          <p>The cost in the business has been largely flat over the period or staying at around $3.3 billion, a slight uptick in FY '08, but the cost to income marching down from 51.1% to 41.6. And as I already said to you for the second half was at 40.6. And the net interest margin has been managed to be essentially flat over recent years despite the volatility. Although I should point out that the 2.42% for FY '08 does not include the Australian Bank's share of centrally held liquidity costs that would take about 2.5 basis points off of that number.</p>
          <p>I want to take an extra moment to talk about the SME franchise in Australia. As well as being a market share leader that continues to grow beyond the system, everything we look at inside the business points to very positive underlying strengths. As you know and we have talked about in the past, we are now replicating the agri-banking line of specialty to create other lines of specialty.</p>
          <p>So far we've launched three of those, being health, education and government. And all of those franchises are growing at an incredible pace and are particularly rich on the deposit side. So we're very excited about these and we'll think about where to extend lines of specialty in the future. This is something that a leader can do because it has the scale to have representation in all markets and which smaller players will struggle to replicate.</p>
          <p>We also see a marked increase in the cross-sell between the SME franchise and nabCapital in Australia, which is true in New Zealand and true in the UK. And we estimate that we are operating at about 60% of best practice in this regard. So we have high hopes that we will continue to build that cross-sell in the future.</p>
          <p>Then at the bottom left, the BPA has been successful despite having the highest customer satisfaction in the industry to extend its lead in customer satisfaction, in the last quarter rising 19 basis points in satisfaction with all other banks falling back, except one coming off a very low base that only moved up at a third of the rate. So again, this is a leader that is continuing to invest behind its points of advantage and to solidify that lead.</p>
          <p>And bottom right, we've showed you this before that the franchise is moving to broaden its monetization of customer relationships on the wealth front and on the transaction banking front. And in all sub-segments, we continue to take share of transactions and associated deposits at a faster rate and more consistently than any other bank in Australia. So we draw a great deal of comfort from this franchise.</p>
          <p>We've talked about the P&amp;L, but let me just put it up in its entirety. So 21.6% underlying profit growth for the year, quite a substantial increase in bad and doubtful debts year-on-year, although flat half-on-half rising from 390 million to 600 million, giving a cash earnings growth of 18.5.</p>
          <p>And at the bottom, there's just a split between BPA and retail, which are disclosed more fully in the appendix, but just showing that the retail bank is continuing to hold its own against BPA, albeit 50% smaller.</p>
          <p>Just turning to the other part of the Australian region, MLC. And here it's a mixed story. Obviously with equity markets, in particular, but all asset classes under pressure, the funds under management has come down quite sharply over the last year from 110 billion to something just over 90 billion and has continued to have some pressure in October. The net flows are &#x2013; they are shown as a negative in the second half. In fact, they are about neutral because in the first half, 4 billion increase was one institutional amount that we knew and disclosed was coming in and going out. So putting that aside, we had 2 billion of net flows or 2.5 in the first half and about neutral in the second half.</p>
          <p>MLC's response to softer revenues from this lower FUM was to redouble its efforts in working on cost and you'll see that the business was successful year-on-year in taking about $50 million out of its cost base and those efforts continue. Now, while this is a difficult environment, it's actually an environment that plays to MLC's strengths because it has always prided itself on technical expertise in asset allocation. And you can see in the bottom left there that the balanced funds or the Horizon 4 flagship fund against peers is performing in the top quartile in this environment. And that reflects much more cautious diversification and less of a herd mentality in asset allocation in that business.</p>
          <p>At the same time, MLC has been making &#x2013; has been blazing a path, if you like, in terms of customer efficacy and transparency of fees and disclosures within the industry, which is now gaining currency with government and other commentators. And many advisors are now seeing MLC as a logical franchise to attach themselves to and we have had quite a pickup in the number of advisers and we have considerably more interest in that people wanting to join MLC. So while the environment is difficult, we think structurally it's going to be a period that will play to MLC's strengths.</p>
          <p>No real surprises, I think, in this P&amp;L. I think I have covered the main points. The only thing I would point out is that the insurance cash earnings at the bottom have been particularly strong with nearly 20% cash earnings growth year-over-year and that business nicely dampening the otherwise negative effect on the investment cash earnings side.</p>
          <p>Turning then to the &#x2013; excuse me, I am going in the wrong direction. Turning then to the UK region, you'll see that the UK had &#x2013; has had and continues to have very strong growth in business lending. Although self-imposed, the business really slowed its lending in the second half to only a 7% growth.</p>
          <p>And that was a conscious effort to go through the pipeline of opportunities and to cull those to the very highest quality opportunities. It is a feature of our franchise in the UK that even if the system goes to nil or the system goes negative, we have &#x2013; being a niche player and with distribution that is not full up in terms of its lending capacity, we more or less have the option to grow the growth rate we would choose in that market. Now, we have chosen to be cautious and to dampen the growth, but many other UK franchises are effectively closed for business. And so that is an area of discretion. But we are choosing to be very cautious and sift for the highest quality opportunities at the moment.</p>
          <p>If you combine that business lending growth in the second half and the housing growth, which is very low, and frankly if Northern Rock wasn't forcing customers to refinance as part of shrinking down the government's market share, there would be almost no housing activity in the UK.</p>
          <p>But if you take the housing growth and the business lending growth and compare it to the retail deposit growth, you will see that we ran the bank a 100% retail deposit funded in the second half. And that is the advantage of being in a deposit rich market. Despite a lot of competition and attention to this, when you turn your mind to the deposit side you can have a very conservative liquidity &#x2013; liability side of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The UK has continued its cost performance, being largely flat, and we are now seeing the cost-to-income ratio coming down more quickly because the business has substantially ended its investment in systems integration and its investment in building out the IFS network. So the scale benefits of filling the buckets, if you like, are starting to bring the cost-to-income ratio down quite quickly.</p>
          <p>We have seen net interest margin decline in the UK, but an unpicking of that shows that the decline in the last half is almost all to do with externalities and there are really no effects going on in terms of our portfolio mix. So we no longer have a managed decline in net interest margin. We've settled at a level that will only be affected by market conditions from this point forward.</p>
          <p>So the UK result, the net operating income, a 4.5% growth for the year with a marginal change in expenses giving an underlying profit of 11.9. A considerable slowing in the second half, 1.8% net income and 3.9 at the underlying. And you see a 50% year-on-year increase in bad and doubtful debts, primarily reflecting some IFS exposures in property, as everybody would predict, but really coming down to half a dozen situations rather than a broad, systemic situation. But it does give rise to 100%, almost 100% higher bad debt in the second half versus the first half, and cash earnings we've already discussed.</p>
          <p>Turning to New Zealand, New Zealand experienced strong growth in non-housing lending, 12.8% for the recent half. In particular, there was a good deal of activity in agriculture which is the last robust segment, if you like, in New Zealand industry; an accelerating performance on the retail deposit side, in part recapturing deposits on the business &#x2013; amongst business customers; and a progressive slowing of growth in housing.</p>
          <p>This business has extended to seven consecutive halves its flat cost performance, and for the year is 691 versus 689 for the prior year, bringing the cost-to-income ratio down, again, quite rapidly from 50.1 to 47.5 for the year. There is continued NIM contraction in New Zealand. It mainly reflects aggressive competition for deposits.</p>
          <p>And then, again, we have reviewed much of this, but the New Zealand region result, 11.4% underlying profit. Bad debts have grown reasonably strongly in New Zealand in percentage terms, up 29% for the year, 23% sequential halves, but the amounts are still modest, being 52 million to 67 million, so delivering cash earnings growth of 12.1% at the bottom line and 1.7% for the half.</p>
          <p>Finally, to nabCapital, and you see here what I'm talking about when I focus on the underlying profit. This business was generating underlying profit of 687 million in September '05 and that has grown at a compound 24% to 1,309 in September '08, so a very strong pickup in this franchise. We have had this business pretty much not growing its balance sheet over the last six months, but focusing on optimizing around the right sort of customers and re-pricing.</p>
          <p>The markets business followed its first half strong performance with a strong second half, giving a revenue increase of 35.5% over the year. As I said before, that reflects investment in capabilities matched to better market conditions. And the corporate finance and institutional lending businesses both growing at 15 to 20%, mainly reflecting re-pricing with volume changes really only coming in the first half.</p>
          <p>It's the structuring and investment business that has gone backwards. It's the smallest business, but that is the business that has taken the conduit hedging costs through its revenue line and has had some other securities that have been impaired through the revenue line as well, so that gives rise to that 27.5% decline over the &#x2013; year-over-year.</p>
          <p>And the nabCapital result, again, I've covered most of this, but strong underlying profit performance, big increase in bad and doubtful debts, and I have already taken you through the main contributors to the movement in that bad and doubtful debts. So its cash earnings went from $715 million last year to essentially just below breakeven for this year, but we believe much of those effects are one-offs.</p>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to turn now to asset quality and my mission here is not to convince you of anything on asset quality, but really just to show you some of the things we see and put you in a position to make up your own minds about asset quality because I think there is sufficient uncertainty in terms of where economies are heading and how the system as a whole will fare and it's a brave person that makes predictions in this environment.</p>
          <p>So this is an updated picture of the nabCapital conduit asset position. The first thing you need to know is that these assets are now on our balance sheet following a change in accounting policy and there are very considerable detailed disclosures around them, including the mark-to-market estimate, which would say that the market value of these assets is about 2 billion less than the carrying value.</p>
          <p>It's important to understand when thinking about mark-to-market that essentially that draws on fairly thin markets for these sorts of assets, where the only sellers are distressed and the buyers are few and far between. So the typical discount rate or cost of capital applied in purchasing some of these assets begins at 25% and rises from there.</p>
          <p>So that's what gives rise to mark-to-market estimates like that. Of course, these assets are all still in a hold to maturity state and we control them, and therefore we really don't regard a distressed mark-to-market as particularly persuasive in the way they should be treated. We also expect it to be quite volatile.</p>
          <p>So just to talk to you, again, at the headline level through how we feel about these assets, the four main &#x2013; or the five main categories of purchased assets. First of all, the ABS CDOs are written down to $300 million, against which we have a remaining provision of $131 million. And we're comfortable with that level, given that the only remaining value represents a super senior position that we hold.</p>
          <p>In terms of the infrastructure bonds, we are very comfortable with the underlying customers. They are rated highly because of monoline insurance wraps. If those wraps were to disappear, our provisioning would change by a negligible amount because the underlying credits are investment grade utilities that are well known to us.</p>
          <p>On the commercial property, the CMBS portfolio is a UK blue chip commercial and industrial property portfolio with very high quality tenancies and where the LVRs are &#x2013; I think the highest is 54% and most are below 50%. So there's a considerable degree of subordination and very high quality cash flows attached to those properties. So again, given what we understand today, we are very comfortable with that portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the leveraged loans, the CLOs, these are portfolios of slices of private equity or other leveraged type situation exposures. These portfolios continue to perform extremely well. They are highly rated. They have typically 30% plus levels of subordination. I think the worst of them has only eaten into that subordination to the tune of about 1.6%. So &#x2013; and we have the ability to top up the managers' buffer with these instruments. If particular loans get into difficulty, the manager will buy them out of the pool and replace them with performing loans.</p>
          <p>So there are no triggers in here or anything that would lead these things to collapse or spiral out of control. So again, we feel good about those. Clearly, the riskiest asset class in the conduit portfolio is the SCDOs, sometimes referred to as SCOs, and that is the portfolio where we have applied some risk mitigation, hedging to move the rated tranche that we own further away from the level of defaults that are being experienced.</p>
          <p>Nobody can say that we won't lose any money in this portfolio. It would be naive to say that, as it would be naive to say that about large parts of any bank's portfolio. But what we can say is we have moved them to levels, given the current environment, that we are comfortable with. Our external auditors have been closely working with us through this and, of course, have had to be comfortable with the level of provisioning, which has not changed by any material measure since we made our announcements.</p>
          <p>Or the final thing, I should say, is that the portfolio has grown from $14.4 billion to $17.1 billion. That certainly doesn't reflect any further purchasing of non-originated securities. Really, it's partly a function of consolidation, partly a function of foreign exchange differences and partly a function of further NAB client-originated activity, primarily in Australian mortgages and Australian auto loans.</p>
          <p>Turning to the larger part of our portfolio, we've put in the next two slides to just give you a sense of it. And I won't go through all of the exhibits on these, but I'll just draw your attention to a couple on each page. First of all, the overall portfolio quality remains high with the estimated credit rating for non-retail exposures having fallen from 78% to 77% between the sequential years.</p>
          <p>And then if you're close enough, you can see some of the Basel II disclosures that will be forthcoming around probability of default and loss given default for the various businesses and for the group. And the main point here is just to give you a sense of how these things are changing. And at the group level, the probability of default is really flat at 1.89% to 1.88% over the last 12 months. And the loss given default for the group has actually contracted from 24.3% to 22.3%, reflecting a skew to greater security in lending.</p>
          <p>And you can see the differences for the various businesses. The fact that the UK region has a higher loss given default is not reflective of any lesser level of security in that portfolio. It's really a function of Basel II only being a standard accreditation in the UK rather than advanced accreditation.</p>
          <p>So just moving on to the second slide and, again, focusing on a couple of things, perhaps more focusing on the lead indicators. If you look in the top left, you can see the 90-day past due performance as a percentage of gross loans and acceptances. And you have a very slight upward trend in Australia. You have a degree of volatility in the UK, but no fundamental shift; an upward trend, but a down step in recent six months in New Zealand, giving rise to a fairly benign picture at the group level.</p>
          <p>So we don't see signs of distress coming through in that portfolio, although &#x2013; in terms of that measure, although, I would say, we are working harder at the 30-day past due and 60-day past due to help customers keep out of that getting further into trouble.</p>
          <p>You can see a jump up in impaired assets down below, particularly in the UK and in nabCapital, to some extent in New Zealand. Obviously, some of those positions are secured, so it doesn't necessarily foreshadow losses. But I think it would be fair to say we're in an upward swing in terms of the credit cycle, upward being in a negative sense.</p>
          <p>And then the most lead indicator we could think of giving you is the watch loans, which are things that haven't even hit any of the triggers but where we move them into areas where they get special attention or we work more proactively with the customers. And again, you can see a big pickup in terms of that in nabCapital, primarily reflecting some of the companies you read about in the newspapers.</p>
          <p>But in the other businesses, there is an underlying uptrend in the UK but the others are not changing that substantially. So we all know we're coming into softer economic conditions. We all know that bad and doubtful debts will probably rise.</p>
          <p>But in terms of many of the indicators in the portfolio, we are not sitting on things that say it's imminent and we are not sitting on things that say it's severe, but nevertheless some of the negative trends are evident in different places. I want to just delve into the UK for a second because there is particular attention drawn to the UK commercial property portfolio as an area of potential weakness and just tell you a little bit about that and also about our mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>We have a well diversified UK commercial property portfolio. It represents about 23% of our IFS book and it's about &#xA3;7.5 billion. We estimate that UK commercial property has already fallen 20 to 25% from its peak. And the experience of that fall is already felt in the bad and doubtful debts we've taken charges for or are working through in our delinquencies at the moment.</p>
          <p>You will see that our &#x2013; or you have already seen that our bad and doubtful debts in the UK rose by about &#xA3;60 million. We estimate that a further 20% drop in UK commercial property prices from the levels in May 2008 might cost us about twice the amount of the increase we've already felt. So that's just to give you an order of magnitude of what might be felt in this portfolio, were commercial property to drop, say, 40% from its peak. So that would not be something we would welcome, but it's not something that would be life-changing in terms of this franchise.</p>
          <p>On the UK mortgage side, we actually have a very conservative mortgage portfolio. We did &#x2013; it's mainly owner occupied. It's typically based around our branch network, which is in the Midlands and the north of the UK. It doesn't involve any Low Doc or high LVR lending to any degree and our loss rate is extremely low. So these are markets that were not as hot as some in the UK and they're markets that are not going to move down as much as others in the UK.</p>
          <p>Obviously, what will be critically important to this portfolio will be what happens to unemployment in the UK, which may put some customers in a position not to support their mortgages. But we think and we confidently predict that our experience on UK mortgages going right through this cycle would be better than the average for UK banks.</p>
          <p>Finally, with respect to provisioning, our collective provisions have risen by 32% over the course of this year, from 2 billion to more than 2.6 billion. Our collective provision ratio now as a percentage of credit RWAs excluding housing is over 100 basis points. And as we transition to Basel II and work on our portfolio optimization, that coverage level is expected to increase.</p>
          <p>Our total provisions are now 3.2 billion and we have also put aside effectively another 500 million of provision equivalent in the way that the Tier 1 ratio is calculated under Basel II where there is a deduction in the calculation of Tier 1 ratio for the difference between expected loss pre-tax and collected provisions post-tax.</p>
          <p>So we've put aside another 300 million of capital effectively as part of that calculation, which is worth about 0.5 billion of provisions on a grossed-up basis. So we are very comfortable with our level of provisions. I'm just going to conclude around capital and funding and dividends and then we're done.</p>
          <p>On the capital side, you can see here our capital history and our transition to Basel II. And notionally, at March '08, we had a Tier 1 ratio of 6.9. We have since, partly through the DRP underwrite at the interim and also through constraining some asset growth in the ways I've already described and partly through some portfolio work, we now have a Tier 1 ratio of 7.35%.</p>
          <p>We've already announced an intention to bring back the next two DRPs, the first of which would move us to 7.64% Tier 1 ratio. It's important &#x2013; and then the subsequent and hybrid capacity would move us closer to 8, as I already said.</p>
          <p>It's important when you look at us and you compare us with others that you are really looking at a bank that is 85% Basel II advanced accredited because the UK is not advanced accredited. And we estimate that the value of the UK going to advanced accreditation would be a further 15 to 20 basis points of Tier 1. And we also recognize that we have further portfolio opportunities on the upside. So as well as drawing capital in, we will be working on other levels to quickly establish this at a higher level.</p>
          <p>Then as Commonwealth Bank showed in its results for June, while there is a methodology being established by the ABA for calculating Australian Tier 1s under FSA rules and that methodology has not yet settled down, we estimate in our case it would add at least 180 basis points of Tier 1.</p>
          <p>So as we approach 8% and we seek then to compare ourselves to where the UK banks are heading in aggregate, we will be pretty much close to an effective 10% Tier 1 ratio, which I think is where the UK government would like to settle in any case. So we'll be at world-leading practice in that sense.</p>
          <p>On the funding and liquidity side, one of the important metrics we employ internally is the group Stable Funding Index, which looks at the percentage of our core assets funded by customer deposits and term debt with greater than 12 months maturity. We like to keep that around 70%. You can see at September '08, it was at 72%, having strengthened slightly over the half, given a good deposit performance and a slightly lower percentage reliance on term funding.</p>
          <p>We have already mentioned on the right-hand side, the liquid asset holdings. The only thing I would add to that is that we have internal securitization capacity that continues to grow. It's currently standing at about $13 billion. There are moves afoot to increase that level of contingent liquidity.</p>
          <p>Then, down on the bottom left on the term funding, as John and I have already mentioned, in the second column we completed slightly above our plan in term funding last year bringing in $28 billion. What was less obvious to the markets was that we also took $28 billion of short-term paper that was typically 30 to 90-day maturity and put it in the six to 12-month window. So the amount of paper that we are rolling any given day is a fraction of what it has been historically.</p>
          <p>And this year, our funding requirement just to replace term debt that goes from greater than 12 months to less than 12 months maturity would be $14 billion and we estimate that perhaps another 5 billion for growth, although it really remains to be seen what growth will be going forward.</p>
          <p>In fact, on the growth front, when we prepared our plan for 2009, we were really operating around an assumption of 8% growth in assets in Australia and 6 to 7 in the UK and New Zealand. Obviously, since that time, economies have become even softer.</p>
          <p>In fact, the annualized growth rate in Australia for the last quarter was 6%. So it would require an uptick from here to get to the 8% we had planned on next year. So it's quite possible that asset growth rates will be quite subdued in Australia and New Zealand. Although, as I pointed out in the UK, it's really a matter of discretion as to how fast we choose to grow the IFS portfolio. But I would expect almost no growth out of the retail portfolio in the UK.</p>
          <p>And then on the bottom right-hand side, you can see a tangible measure of how we have expended some profitability to adopt a conservative profile. And in the term funding done last year, the average term to First Call executed by NAB was four years and the peer average excluding that was three years.</p>
          <p>And in the second half, we operated considerably excess of that. So we have been tapping regularly the five, seven and 10-year maturities in term debt, so that we're going to have &#x2013; we're going to smooth out very much the refunding task as it comes to us as existing facilities mature. Again, that comes at some expense to earnings, but it puts the bank in a secure position.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude with dividends. You already know that we have matched the first-half's dividend with the second, giving us $1.94 and a 6% increase for the year. Our payout ratio was 81.4 for the year, but on a look-through basis it was 67.5%.</p>
          <p>So let me leave it there and hand over to Cameron.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Mark. I want to start by thanking John on his last set of results for leaving the underlying franchise in very good shape and building a pipeline of talent which will, I think, serve us well in more challenging times. So thank you very much, John, for that effort. I am 21 calendar days into the designate role, which given the state of markets, translates also to 21 working days. So I need to come back and I will come back in 2009 and talk in more detail about the strategy and where I see NAB going.</p>
          <p>But I want to give you just a sense about what I've been doing. I want to talk about the outlook a little bit for 2009 and then some initial themes. What I have been doing in the last 21 days is listening as much as possible. I've been talking to our staff, I've had detailed sessions with the top 150 executives in the group. I've spoken to regulators. I've spoken to a number of people in this room as well as investors to really get a sense about what your perspectives of the group are. And that's something that I will continue to do and I'll come back to that shortly. But let me talk a little bit about the outlook.</p>
          <p>We think &#x2013; this slide shows that ex the conduits and if you regionalize the nabCapital business, 89% of our earnings come out of Australia and New Zealand. So that shows you where the money is being generated. That's where the focus has to be over the course of 2009.</p>
          <p>GDP growth in Australia will probably be about 1.25% and that's post the stimulus package, which gives you a sense that we are heading into more difficult economic times. System growth, as Mark said, annualized probably is at 6 and it could even be below that because I think that was last quarter before we saw some of the current economic indicators.</p>
          <p>The obvious question is going to be, what is going to be the outlook for B&amp;DDs? So they are going to trend up, but the question I'm generally getting is, are they going to hit '90 and '91 levels? Now, loathe as I am to make predictions, we are probably seeing four things that will give us some comfort that whilst we'll see a trend up that they won't hit '91 levels.</p>
          <p>The first of those is the security we have over the portfolio. Now it's better than it was then. The portfolio is more diversified. Our corporate and our SME customers are less leveraged and in '90, '91, unemployment hit 11%. So clearly, whilst we are going to see unemployment go up, no one is predicting that sort of level. So if you take those four bases of security, leverage, diversification and unemployment, it gives us some comfort that we won't be hitting the sort of '91 levels with regard to bad and doubtful debts.</p>
          <p>As John flagged, the government initiatives, both around funding and guarantees, are very welcome. The government is being very decisive. We welcome that. Obviously, details have to be worked through and we'll obviously be a participant in that process. But that's certainly a significant bonus for us and the industry.</p>
          <p>If I talk a little bit about the UK, look, there will be very low growth in the UK, probably flat throughout 2009. Unemployment could reach 8%. At this stage, we are outperforming the peers on asset quality. Our housing book is &#x2013; 90 days past due in the housing book is less than half the national average. So, again, that shows that the areas where we are now performing far better. And as a niche player, we, I guess, have the opportunity to participate in a range of growth initiatives there.</p>
          <p>If I go to New Zealand, a market that I'm more familiar with in recent times and I'm proud to see, you'll see the new brand up there that we launched on 1 October, so we continue invest in our business. But New Zealand is in recession. It has been in recession for most of the year. You'll see that in the second half numbers.</p>
          <p>Again, the B&amp;DD trend will be up, but the same mitigants exist. In fact, the unemployment rate in New Zealand is below Australia, so that again is a relative mitigant. You've got the same issues with regard to leverage, portfolio security and diversification of the portfolio there.</p>
          <p>The government initiative there probably needs little bit more momentum and urgency around the funding guarantees and probably greater alignment with Australia and that will help.</p>
          <p>If I finally go to the US, which is less than 1% of our portfolio, obviously that will remain in recession through to mid-2009. The areas we are in in the Midwest &#x2013; in South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa &#x2013; is experiencing above the national average in growth rates. That's partly driven by commodity prices. Even though that's softened, it's also driven by demand for biofuels. It's 100% retail funded, in fact experiencing deposit inflow and the asset quality is stable.</p>
          <p>So whilst that's a fairly somber outlook, I think it's consistent with what most people are saying. But there's a couple of things I take from that. One is that 89% of our earnings are coming out of two economies that will generate about 1 to 1.5% growth next year, when the rest are flat. That's something. The second thing is, of course, that we had excellent cost management discipline. As you go into a softening revenue environment, having that cost management discipline is absolutely essential.</p>
          <p>So what I've told the businesses, the four businesses is this. I've said all &#x2013; you need to continue the excellent cost discipline. That's critical. You need to find innovative ways to grow revenue and particularly innovative ways to grow revenue that don't chew up capital. But specifically &#x2013; and you also need to generate and continue to gather deposits.</p>
          <p>But specifically, clearly, the Australian business needs to keep its sustainable out-performance going. It needs to continue the focus on its next-gen IT platform, I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment, and needs to grow share in the excellent SME franchise. I've said to the UK business that it needs to take advantage of a dislocated market as a stable and niche player to grab the best credits while it can because there's clearly an opportunity there as that market goes through dislocation.</p>
          <p>I've said to New Zealand, you need to continue the profitable growth and I've said to the nabCapital business, you need to optimize your business, particularly under Basel II, as we get to grips with price cyclicality and you need to take the opportunity to re-price. So there's clear guidance to those businesses, what they need to do as we transition into 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, the obvious question is what will I do? I will need to come back in 2009 and talk a little bit about strategy. But let me make some initial comments about my focus and what will be four overarching themes that you'll see that then be supported by the strategy that I will come back with in 2009.</p>
          <p>The first of those is culture. This is something that we need to continue to focus on. We've made enormous strides in culture, but I think it's even more important in a more challenging economic environment that you continue to work on culture. Your staff and customers become uncertain. If you're creating a collaborative culture, that's obviously very important.</p>
          <p>It actual also is not about sitting around and holding hands. It's actually about genuine financial impact. If I look at New Zealand, which has the highest staff engagement in the group, in our seventh half of flat costs, we deliver the highest branch satisfaction in New Zealand, the best staff engagement, 17% year-on-year uplift in sales through the branch network and touching on 7,000 efficiency ideas coming out of our staff as they generally believe in the business.</p>
          <p>So the reason you focus on culture is for genuine financial impact. It also is going to have important implications for risk management. We again have made significant improvements in risk management, but as the environment softens, there has to be that focus on risk management, and a lot of that is around culture. That's clearly one of the prime focuses I have.</p>
          <p>The second is communication. If you are in volatile and uncertain markets and we need to improve disclosure and transparency to try and minimize that level of uncertainty that exists. If 2009 is going to be challenging, we have to increase levels of disclosure and transparency, and that'll be a focus I'll be putting on myself. And I need to, as I've flagged, come back to you in 2009 and talk more about where NAB is going, it's strategic direction and what it stands for as a business.</p>
          <p>Probably the most important, one of the two to three most important things I'll do in the next X years, fill in the gap, as CEO, will in fact be re-platform the business. This is a once-in-a-generation issue where you take your core banking platform and replace it. It is a significant investment, and therefore I need to actively sponsor that. Getting that in will be one of the two to three most important things I do and I need to focus on that. It provides great opportunity to converge a range of processes and technology. And irrespective whatever strategic directions I come back with next year, that re-platforming of the business is absolutely the top two to three things that I need to focus on.</p>
          <p>And finally, as Mark mentioned, oops &#x2013;  we are sitting at 7.35 Tier 1. We've got a number of organic strategies to move us towards 8. I need to look into the portfolio, particularly under Basel II, and look at where capital is generated in the business and preserve that strong capital position. And also we need to watch global developments.</p>
          <p>Now, if we land at some point around the 8%, as Mark said, that gets us towards the FSA definitions of 10. But we need to watch global developments. So we're comfortable at 7.35, 7.64 on a pro forma basis, with the first DRP shortfall. But clearly, that focus on capital now.</p>
          <p>I will come back, as I said, in 2009 with some more definitive views on strategy, but you will be seeing me returning at least at an overarching level &#x2013; beyond the operational guidance I've given our businesses, at an overarching level to these three themes, creating an empowered culture that's focused on risk management, increasing disclosure and communication to the market about where NAB's going and what it's standing for, about converging our processes and technology, and generating and preserving capital.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to close there and hand back to Hany to run the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thanks. It's Craig Williams from Citi here. Could you perhaps provide some color on the NIM outlook for the group, in light of the fact that you've had some repricing initiatives through the course of this year that you get a full-year benefit from and I presume that'll be ongoing. Reduction in competition would seem to be the case in most of your key banking markets. Now you've got additional capital in your business; likelihood of no further sort of liquid asset build up, after a dramatic build up over the course of the past 12 months. Basis risk looks like being reduced; decline in the UK in terms of that managed margin decline; and perhaps within the context of that too, some of the market's noise that we're seeing in this NIM performance this half?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, I think what you intimate is that some of the pressures might reverse, and I think I would agree with that, that we're already starting to see some contraction in spreads. And what you've already seen from the behavior of the banks in Australia is a tendency to pass that on for competitive purposes. I think in the UK where we've pretty much been locked into a mortgage portfolio that was base rate tracking, and therefore had considerable basis risk locked into it, that will, of course, provide some relief, because all of that was being absorbed.</p>
          <p>So my sense, across the three banks, will be that there will be considerable competition for deposits that will make that &#x2013; will continue to put pressure on it from that side. There will be some relief in the wholesale markets. And where we have been re-pricing for that, it will probably get passed back to customers. Where we haven't been re-pricing for that, we will capture it, would be my summary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you here me, Craig? Look, in terms of NIM, I think it was a good result for the Australian region over the last 12 months or so. I think if you look at that result, it's a rear-view look at what has happened. And I think your question was more forward-looking, in terms of what's going to happen, but if you understand how we manage to get that NIM, it might give you a bit of a perspective into looking forward.</p>
          <p>The first point is, is that while it was flat, if you break it up between lending NIM and deposit NIM and treasury management, what you find is that lending NIM was actually down 4 basis points year-on-year, and that's a net down 4. And then on top of that, Mark Joiner referred to the 2 basis points for liquidity costs so &#x2013; that were held in the center. So that's really 6 basis points that the lending NIM is down. So that's looking back.</p>
          <p>Secondly, that was offset as such by two other big actions. One is on the deposit side. We've had an active campaign. You know, if any of you've been following us for the last couple of years, we said to you, deposits are really important and we're driving and winning share. So winning deposits, in particular in transaction banking, you saw that was a key part. That has really been a terrific job, both in the retail bank as well as in the business bank, in driving on the deposit side of it.</p>
          <p>The third element is actually the brilliant job that our treasury department has been doing throughout 2008, both at the group level, with  Eric and the Australian region level. We've been, right across the group, actually been really thinking very hard in treasury. How do we manage? How do we hedge in this very difficult and challenging environment? And some of the benefits of bringing the term funding in early and some of the active management in that area has provided a buffer over the last 2008 period to help us manage in this very difficult time period.</p>
          <p>So when you take those three points into consideration, then you look forward into what's happening to the NIM, I actually think 2009 NIM is going to be doubly challenging compared to 2008. For a start, the cost of those deposits that we've been generating has skyrocketed. The price of getting the deposits is really up a lot and so we have to manage for that issue.</p>
          <p>Secondly, hedging gets you some benefit, it doesn't get you benefits all the time, you've got to re-hedge and re-get the treasury area. Eric's going to give me a Christmas card I think. And so that's going to be challenging as well.</p>
          <p>And the third part about the NIM, when we think forward about it, is the short-end and the term funding, it's great on the &#x2013; that we've got so much, but it's quite expensive. And as we roll out term debt going forward, the cheap stuff rolls off and the more expensive stuff comes on. That's going to push us up and you all know the OIS spread today sits at 55 basis points. In 2007, it was at 14 and most of 2008 was 44.</p>
          <p>So these are real challenges to the NIM that's going to make it very difficult going forward to sustain that kind of performance. Now, we've done a good job of it over the last couple of years and we intend to do a good job of it, but I don't want to leave you with a false sense of comfort that we can continue to do what we've done.</p>

          <p>James Freeman, Goldman Sachs JBWere. I just want to ask on the ROI. Looking at the UK division, it is still a very poor ROI, seen around the 0.6, obviously well below what the other group divisions are delivering. I just wanted to get indication as to why that continues to be so low, and just when and if that can actually head back to the group level?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's partly a function of having put all the infrastructure spend into developing a business and having not filled that business up. So the marginal economics of a new loan in the IFS business are considerably more attractive than the average economics, because the full cost structure is in place. But the &#x2013; it's not at scale, if you like, in terms of the assets that are working and delivering contribution.</p>
          <p>So I suspect it's partly that. It's partly also that we've been a price taker, and in some cases a slight price discounter in that market as we've been establishing a new franchise. And as that matures and as the customer relationships mature, as we get the cross-sell moving more effectively, all of these things will contribute to migrating that in the right direction.</p>

          <p>All right. Thanks. It's John Mott from UBS. A question about the dividend going forward, and if we do see a hard landing coming through in the economy and, say, high bad and doubtful debts continue. Under what condition would you actually cut the dividend going forward and what would the maximum payout ratio that you'll be prepared to take, if we do see further losses continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to be here. This one is going to one of you guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, obviously, while we are going through this period of dislocation, we're bringing back the dividends anyway and recapitalizing. So I don't think there's any need for us to immediately react on the dividend front. As I said when confirming the dividend, we're very comfortable with this. Underlying, it's only a 67.5% payout ratio.</p>
          <p>The only condition I could see where we would revisit the dividend is when we get through this volatility, if the whole industry settles at a lower level of profitability, for example, and then you look at the ability of the business to generate capital and to sustain a particular level of dividends, if the industry is at a fundamentally lower level of profitability, we would all have to revisit our dividend assumptions, because no one wants to be in the capital recycling business.</p>
          <p>But that given the projected asset growth we're likely to experience over the next two or three years, if anything, that takes the pressure off the ability to support dividend. So I think the chances of us making a significant change on that front are pretty low, but in this environment, you can never say never.</p>

I'm trying to hold you to this set of results, as you have comfortable with carry values, whether it's in conduits, collective provisioning, capitalized software, that we're not going to look at the sort of new CEO 101 in the first half of next year, and that you own these results as much as John Stewart does.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm Jarrod Martin, ABN Amro. I'd just ask a question just regarding revenue and expense growth Jaws and seems what, to be a slight softening in your expense guidance versus previously less than inflation, now around inflation, and just the impact that with asset growth likely to be mid-single-digit at best that you may face the prospect where you do get negative revenue and expense growth Jaws in the next period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll pass it to Mark. On the second, I think it's highly unlikely we would have negative Jaws. All, Mark, in his session was being was realistic that when we go into almost recessionary situation in most of the market, maybe with the exception of Australia, which might not go into recession. Then you've got to look seriously at your income line. And then what we're pointing is that we will still stay within inflation for our costs, but you really shouldn't be expecting that to be about flat. Mark, do you want to pick that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I did say that when we put our plan together we were looking at a range of 7 to 8% asset growth for the businesses, and that plus continued monetization of relationships and growth through cross-sell should support reasonable revenue growth, albeit that if the volumes slow that could come lower. And I think it's probably not fair for everybody to have that NAB's going to grow at 2% expense growth if inflation is nearly doubling in the background because we have wage pressures, and rent pressures, and all the things that every other business has. So we think to be around 4% when Australia is at least 4% and the UK is operating at 5%, it's probably a reasonable ask. Of course, we'll always do our best to beat that, but I think it would be a reasonable expectation for people to have. Now, the combination of those two things is still probably revenue growing 50% better than costs. And we still &#x2013; while cost to income ratio is an outcome, we still want to see that declining and that obviously the Jaws is critical to that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick one to Mark and then to Cameron. Mark, just with your comments on the capital position, are you able to really reiterate to the market and quell the concerns around a surprise capital raising at some point by saying that NAB's position ex any significant exogenous factors is comfortable with the DRPs going forward and there is no need to raise capital at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you would never say never because market conditions change in the light. But we have no current intention of doing anything like that. I think the two DRP underwrites bring in 2 billion. And I've pointed to several things we can do internally to generate capital. So I think we're headed on the right path, but I think we would remain open, but we are not incubating any plan to do anything on that front.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The other question on market concerns to you, Cameron. You mentioned this is once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-generation opportunity to address your IT. Also we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for consolidation of the industry and two of your peers have potentially significantly moved ahead of you, with the St. George/BankWest acquisitions; Suncorp has been a topic. It has been a topic of other banks to look at. I wonder if you can just elucidate us as to your views as the opportunities of a Queensland expansion, if you want to get into the technicals of how you think you can get rid of that embedded tax liability from the GI structure under the bank. But more importantly, how do you see consolidation going forward and non-organic growth to the NAB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The consolidation outlook has probably changed a little bit since the series of government guarantees came in. I think prior to that, that was probably looking like there was going to be fairly rapid consolidation. I think that's probably elongated the period in which consolidation would occur. But we obviously don't comment on M&amp;A, but we made, I think, the comment at the time we announced the transition that we've got a pretty low appetite for M&amp;A. We think there's some organic opportunities in our franchise to focus on. So that's probably the primary focus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, JPMorgan. As tempting as it is to ask about whether we can expect to see some more of this unrecognized future income tax benefits miraculously flow through and inflate the result, the question that I would actually like to ask is also about capital. If you have a look at slide 85 and 86, it would appear that the transition from Basel I to Basel II has probably created something like 80 basis points in Tier 1. If I have a look at all the great campaign that all the banks are running at the moment to talk about if you're regulated in the UK under the FSA, whereas it seems to me you're actually regulated in Australia. None of these adjustments at any point kind of highlight the pro-cyclicality that we're seeing under the FSA, whereas assets values falls to nabCapital. Isn't that suggesting that that 80 basis points could actually reverse, which is saying that really you're back where you are if you were to be in a falling asset value environment as we seem to be anywhere else in the world because when you add it to all the guidance commentary, it is suggesting that asset values are falling. How can we be certain that we won't be sitting here in six months' time talking about some kind of a rights issue to basically top-up to this unexpected pro-cyclicality that you've flagged in all the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Pro-cyclicality is something that the industry is going to have to come to terms with and learn to manage, and there are a number of potential responses to that. One which the architects of Basel II would propose is that during the nine times we have strong Tier I ratios and during difficult times we have low Tier I ratios and that the analyst community just learn to get comfortable with that. Personally, I think that might be a bit of an ask, which leads you then to say, well, should we raise capital during difficult times and shed it during benign times, which again is the wrong time to be doing those things. Or should we sit with a capital buffer and just have lazy capital during peaks and just enough capital at the trough? The answer lies somewhere in the middle of that. I don't think it's obvious to the industry what the response is. Nobody knows exactly how marked the pro-cyclicality is going to be. It's certainly going to lead to portfolio decisions about what sort of risks you are prepared to take to balance sheets because do they augment or do they ameliorate those effects. For example, all the way through to portfolio construct of what businesses you will have in the portfolio that may behave in counter-cyclical ways. So it's a very open question. I think at the moment, we're just moving to a strong Tier I ratio that would under any reasonable amount of pro-cyclicality allow us to accommodate that. But I think there's going to be a maturing of strategies around this over the next few years.</p>

          <p>It's a billion, yes. Just north of a billion was the gross revenue from markets. And just this sales and trading things are real art form, okay. So we run some proprietary trading desks. They make us about $30 million a year. We do very little pure proprietary trading. People come in, put a cold towel around the head, try and workout which way the Aussie dollar is going in the next ten minutes, which is an achievement at the moment. We're very little at that. What we do is to attempt to divide our earnings into sales and trading, and most of our trading activities therefore are to deal with the flows that get into our business from our clients, whether we hold them, whether we hedge them, whether we sell them on and what we choose to do. And that spread typically in our business is about 60/40 sales/trading. However, that is an art form, as to &#x2013; if you were to talk to any sales person or trading person about who should get the credit for a particular trade, you will find that how much of an art form that actually is. So that's what we attempt to &#x2013; how we attempt to divide our earnings. But the bulk of our business comes from managing risk that comes to us in foreign exchange, in rates, in commodities, and in credit products from the business we do with our clients, whether those clients are other financial institutions, large corporates or increasingly the franchise that sits in the Clydesdale Bank in NAB here and in BNZ in Australia. And that &#x2013; the latter comprises about between 30 and 40% of our revenues depending which region you are in. So that's how the money is made, if that's helpful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. My question was on the UK bad debts and your comment earlier about nothing systemic. If we look at the &#x20A4;115 million in the second half, that looks like about a 115 basis point charge to non-housing lending. The first part of my question was, what was the business loss rate within that? And secondly, if we consider that your book is still fairly young in many parts and what you've flagged in terms of the property losses potentially going forward, I am just wondering where you think the loss rate to non-housing might top out in the UK? And secondly, just how sure can you be that you'll beat your peers on the business banking front, even though it's pretty clear you're doing a lot better on the housing front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, I think you misunderstood what Mark was saying when he cited potential losses in the UK. What he was doing was giving you the results of a stress test. And the stress test was this that housing &#x2013; not housing, commercial properties already dropped between 20 and 25% in the UK. Now, that's in the 115 that we've recorded. We have taken some of that pain in the UK. What we said is, supposing they dropped another 20%, so that would be 45% in total. No one is predicting that, let me assure you. When we stress test that, it only came to about 120, a 130 million, so it was not life threatening to the bank. And as part of our normal risk management that we do, I am fully sure &#x2013; I don't I have the figures to hand, but even on our young book, as you've talked about for the IFS book, the real statistics are approximately about half to two-thirds of the industry average.</p>

          <p>So we got Lynne on the phone. No. Are there any more questions on the phone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no further questions on the phone.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A question with Brett.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Brett Le Mesurier at Wilson HTM. The credit risk weighted assets increased by 1% from March to September, which would imply &#x2013; and particularly given you had asset growth about 5% implies that you think that credit quality has improved, yet obviously we've seen the bad debt charge go up a lot and provisions go up a lot. Can you reconcile those two concepts for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that the credit quality has been improving quite remarkably. If you take, for example, the SME franchise in Australia, it's gone from low 60s to high 60s in terms of the amount of security attaching to those loans. And so various other businesses have also been emphasizing either the construct of the product or, as I said, the security backing it to obviously attract less capital to those things. So it's a combination of getting into our stride, if you like, on Basel II and learning to respond to the signals it's sending us. And that's one of the things that's going to change the sort of things you're going to see on bank balance sheets going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why are the collective provisions going up so much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, collective provisions went up about $600 million. More than a third of that was because we've effectively put it in an economic override by putting an extra $200 million in &#x2013; on the way through the course of the year. So we've being building those provisions to bring up the ratios as &#x2013; in a precautionary manner in excess of that demand above the portfolio.</p>

          <p>John, I think we've got Lynne on the phone.</p>

          <p>Lynne, did you hear the earlier question from Matthew?</p>

          <p>John, I think &#x2013; I think I heard it. But I think it <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Lynne, I'm afraid you're breaking up. Can you speak...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can take it offline and call him back.</p>

          <p>Speak closer to the microphone, see if we can get a clear signal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. It keeps coming back onto me, John.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, look, it's just probably best. Matthew, we'll come back to you and contact you this afternoon, if that's okay. We'll give you an answer to that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have just run past our allotted time. But what I would like to do is thank you all for attending. This is my last results presentations. So I would like to personally thank you for that support you guys have given me over the last five years. Wishing you all the very best in the future. And contrary to popular belief, we didn't actually move results early, so I could start my next week earlier. No, this is &#x2013; you can kill that rumor. And we will talk to you a little later this afternoon at John Hooper's conduit conference call. Thank you.</p>
