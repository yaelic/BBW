      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter progressed largely as anticipated against the highest core growth quarter of last year. Sales from the developed markets grew slightly, with the U.S. again noticeably better than Europe, which declined this quarter. China revenues were essentially flat, while the rest of the emerging markets grew at a high-single digits rate.</p>
          <p>Overall we were encouraged by a number of factors. Both shipments and orders improved sequentially through the quarter. Organic order growth was about two points higher than revenue growth, as we built backlog across many of our businesses. This was most noticeable in China where our book-to-bill exceeded 1.1. Also in a number of markets, sell-out by our distribution partners was stronger than our sell-in. We were pleased with the team's execution in the quarter, which led to 85 basis points of year-over-year core operating margin expansion, a 37.5% year-over-year increase in free cash flow and a 19.5% increase in EPS.</p>
          <p>We continue to aggressively invest in new product introductions and go-to market initiatives. During the quarter, we launched a number of exciting products, a few of which we will highlight through the call today. We remain active and optimistic on the M&amp;A front. As you saw last week, we announced the pending acquisition of X-Rite, a global leader in color measurement. Even after closing X-Rite and three other deals in the quarter, we expect to have approximately $5 billion of M&amp;A capacity over the next two years.</p>
          <p>So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported record first quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.73, a 19.5% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. Revenues for the quarter increased 31% to $4.3 billion, with core revenues up 1.5%. The impact of acquisitions, primarily the addition of Beckman Coulter, increased revenues by 30.5%, while the negative impact of currency translation reduced sales by about a point.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin for the first quarter was 51.8%, a 250 basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our operating margin in the first quarter decreased 80 basis points year-over-year to 17%.</p>
          <p>DBS continues to be the primary driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. First quarter operating cash flow was $651 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow was $534 million, an increase of 37.5% versus the prior year. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was greater than 100%, inclusive of more than $50 million of incremental year-on-year cash spending related to our fourth quarter 2011 restructuring program.</p>
          <p>And finally, our tax rate in the first quarter was 25.3%, which was modestly higher than we had forecast. We expect the rate to be closer to 24% for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>So now let me turn to the five operating segments. To start with Custom Measurement, revenues there, core revenues increased 2% for the quarter. Core operating margin for the first quarter increased 195 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 190 basis points to 22.6%. Overall, our Instruments business's core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. Fluke core revenues were down slightly in the quarter, as growth in the U.S. for our service and installation tools was more than offset by weak demand in Europe and China.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we launched the new Ti100 thermal imager platform designed for industrial and building inspection applications. These imagers feature easy-to-use innovative on-camera tools and plug-and-play connectivity with Fluke's SmartView software to collect, edit, and analyze thermal images. Initial orders have been quite strong.</p>
          <p>Tektronix core sales declined mid-single-digits in the quarter with continued softness in Europe and China. In the U.S. we continue to see solid POS, though our sell-in to distribution partners declined year-over-year. We were also encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in order activity across the business with book-to-bill finishing at 1.0 for the quarter, an acceleration from the mid-90's rate last quarter.</p>
          <p>The recent launch of Tek's 70000 D Series 33-gigahertz oscilloscope is off to a great start and our MDO4000 Mixed Domain Oscilloscope continues to gain broad industry recognition as a game-changing technology. In the quarter, the MDO4000 received a prestigious ACE award in the ultimate product in Test and Measurement Systems category, the ninth major award recognizing the innovation at the foundation of the MDO4000.</p>
          <p>Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter led by healthy demand for Tektronix Communications network management solutions for wireless carriers in North America as well as our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. Customer response to Fluke Network's recently launched OptiView XG and Arbor Networks Pravail network security system continues to be strong.</p>
          <p>Moving to environmental, revenues increased 4% in the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. The segment core-operating margin declined modestly in the first quarter with reported operating margin decreasing 70 basis points to 18.6%. Water quality core revenues increased at a low-single-digit rate while orders were up mid-single-digits due in part to solid demand across most industrial verticals. Municipal spending was stronger than anticipated in the U.S. but remains constrained in China, but project funnels are encouraging there.</p>
          <p>Trojan is continuing validation work on its ballast water treatment solution and remains on track to begin shipping systems in earnest later this year. During the quarter, the U.S. Coast Guard issued their highly anticipated ballast water discharge standard, an important signal to the global community that the U.S. supports international regulation.</p>
          <p>Chemtreat continues to outperform based on the strength of their sales footprint and technical capabilities. During the quarter they had several significant wins including a major U.S.-based manufacturer with over 20 sites. The first quarter marked Chemtreat's seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth, an outstanding achievement.</p>
          <p>Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew low single digits, led by a demand for our dispensers, vapor recovery solutions and automatic tank gauges. Our 2010 acquisition of the L&amp;T Dispenser business in India has allowed us to significantly expand our localization initiatives in that region. Recently Gilbarco launched a new Dispenser platform designed and manufactured in India. Customer reception has been extremely favorable, helping drive greater than 20% growth in our Dispenser business in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to Life Sciences and Diagnostics, revenues for the quarter increased 146.5%, largely due to the addition of Beckman Coulter. Core revenues were up 2% in the quarter. Core operating margin for the segment was up 25 basis points in the first quarter while our reported operating margin decreased 110 basis points from the prior year to 13.3%, largely as a result of the Beckman Coulter acquisition.</p>
          <p>The Diagnostics business has got off to a solid start to the year with mid-single-digit core growth, which as a reminder, does not include Beckman Coulter. Radiometer's core sales increased at a high-single-digit rate with broad-based strength across most product categories and geographies. Demand for our ABL80 blood gas analyzer in China was particularly robust, growing more than 20% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Following last year's regulatory approval, customer adoption of AQT in China has been strong, driven in part by the outstanding value proposition presented for our customers. A large Class 3 hospital in China recently purchased an AQT and informed us that they experienced a 66% improvement in turnaround time for cardiac marker results, which allows the hospital to perform 2.5 times the number of cardiac tests versus their central lab. We're obviously thrilled when we hear that sort of customer feedback from core customers.</p>
          <p>Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low-single-digit rate with mid-teens shipments and order growth for advanced staining. The core Histology business was flat in the quarter, largely driven by weakness in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our Life Sciences businesses experienced flat core growth in the quarter. AB SCIEX core sales grew modestly in the quarter; however orders were up mid-teens, positioning the business well for strong core growth in the upcoming quarters. Mid-single digit revenue growth in the U.S. and emerging markets was largely offset by weakness in Europe. The team continues to do an excellent job on the margin front, as core margins were up over 100 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At the PITTCON Conference in February, SCIEX debuted several new products, including the 4500 series of mass spectrometers, the Eksigent 100 series of analytical flow rate liquid chromatography products and a new micro flow rate instrument. The 4500 delivers ten times better sensitivity compared to competitive systems in the same mid-range class and is well suited for applications in high-growth applied markets. The 4500 replaces the 4000 series, which is the best selling mass spectrometer in company history. The 4500 was just named Top New Product at PITTCON by Instrument Business Outlook.</p>
          <p>Leica Microsystem sales were down slightly in the quarter, as solid demand in the life science research and industrial markets in North America and the emerging markets was offset by weakness across Europe.</p>
          <p>Beckman Coulter continues to exceed our expectations as DBS continues to make an impact in many facets of the business. In addition to the progress we've made in terms of quality with the resolution of sodium and glucose, we're also making progress in other customer-facing parts of the business. As we implement DBS across Beckman, we've been able to increase our on-time new instruments installations in the U.S. by more than 20% and reduce unscheduled service calls by close to 15% since the closing last June.</p>
          <p>We've also seen a dramatic decrease in past due scheduled maintenance calls, which when we closed in June, numbered over 2,000, and today are below 200, with a line of sight to an even lower number.</p>
          <p>As customers see the progress, the improvements are starting to show up in the numbers. Previously we talked about improvements in the retention in new win rates in November and December of last year and the first quarter saw a continuation of those trends, resulting in the second consecutive quarter of positive, though modest, revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Operating margins in the quarter improved over 400 basis points year-over-year and represented the best Q1 performance since 2006. While there is a lot of work ahead, we are happy with what the team has accomplished in the past nine months.</p>
          <p>Turning to Dental, segment revenues and core revenues increased 0.5% in the first quarter. Reported operating margin increased 200 basis points to 12.7%, reflecting the actions we have taken to accelerate their profitability. Dental Consumables' core revenues grew slightly in the quarter, led by sales for our Orthodontic Solutions and Infection Prevention products across most major geographies. This was largely offset by softness in our General Dentistry Consumables where we believe our sell-in to distribution partners was less than our sell-out.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we introduced several new orthodontic products, including the Damon Clear passive self-ligating bracket solution for the lower arch. Customer reaction here has been extremely positive.</p>
          <p>Kerr reached a significant milestone during the quarter, with the millionth SonicFill shipment. SonicFill is a first-of-its-kind product that enables clinicians to perform posterior restorations with a fast, easy to use and reliable bulk fill technology, using a sonic activated hand piece. The technology, developed in conjunction with the KaVo team, has been a tremendous success for Kerr and KaVo, exceeding our expectations each step of the way.</p>
          <p>KaVo core revenues increased slightly in the quarter, with growth in imaging and equipment in North America and Europe offset by weakness in instruments globally. During the quarter, KaVo received recognition for its LUX 550 (sic) [540] LED light, which won the Most Innovative Product in the Devices and Equipment category, as voted on by the recent IDS trade show attendees.</p>
          <p>Moving to our Industrial Technology segments, segment revenues increased 8.5% for the quarter, with core revenues flat. Our core-operating margin declined 20 basis points in the first quarter, with our reported operating margin down 150 basis points to 20.6%. Product Identification core revenues grew slightly in the quarter, led by solid global demand for consumables and Videojet's continuous ink jet printers, primarily in Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, last week we announced our merger agreement with X-Rite. Headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, X-Rite manufactures, markets and supports innovative color solutions through measurement systems, software color standards and services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.03 in 2012 and $0.04 accretive in 2013. We're excited by the strategic opportunities that lie ahead for Esko and X-Rite, and I look forward to sharing more about this opportunity with you in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Our Motion businesses' core revenues declined at a high-single-digit rate in the quarter with softness in the industrial automation technology and renewable energy markets across most major geographies. We are encouraged by recent order trends as this was the second quarter in a row where our book-to-bill has exceeded 1.0. As a result, we expect to resume growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up, the year started largely as we expected. We were particularly pleased with the team's execution, which led to excellent core operating margin expansion, cash flow, and earnings performance, and are encouraged by the momentum with which we exited the first quarter. The sequential improvement within the quarter, solid bookings growth, and an attractive acquisition environment we believe positions us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We are initiating second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.76 to $0.81 for the quarter, which includes approximately $0.01 of anticipated dilution from the pending X-Rite acquisition. The second quarter earnings per share guidance assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth. We are narrowing our full-year diluted EPS guidance from $3.20 to $3.35 to $3.25 to $3.35, which includes $0.03 of anticipated dilution from X-Rite.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Larry, can you fill out the thoughts a little bit on China? You guys have talked about some of the signs you had seen of easing there last &#x2013; on the last call. How have you seen things sort of play out through the quarter, and how has that contributed to this overall kind of pickup in orders you've seen through the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, I think, Shannon, China was certainly central to a good bit of what we saw improve during the course of the quarter. Our book-to-bill in China in the first quarter was greater than 1.1. I mean that's obviously helpful in terms of our internal metrics. I'd add to that in a number of businesses, water particularly, we saw strengthening through the quarter in our project funnel, and I think that's part of what gives us the optimism that some of the external data that we see strengthening, like PMI, suggested as we go through the year here, China should get better. So we obviously weren't pleased with what we saw in China. I wouldn't say by the same token that it was particularly surprising in that regard. And as we look here, I think we'll see a strong acceleration in China and we should see China, I think, in the mid to high-single-digit range here straightaway in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you said it was flat in 1Q, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can you maybe just talk a little bit about the trajectories on Tek instruments versus Motion? So I think Tek was down like mid-single-digits in the quarter, Motion high singles. You said Tek is going to improve through the year. I mean does that go positive already in 2Q? I know Motion doesn't, it stays negative. So can you just talk about, I guess, the different trajectories in improvement in those two businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think they will &#x2013; both businesses will improve in part because obviously the comps will get easier in both businesses. And again, I think we're seeing encouraging trends both with respect to our internal metrics, i.e. bookings, in addition to some of the external data points, be it PMI, NASDAQ, what have you. That said, I think it's going to take Tek longer to go positive. I think they'll both be challenged here in the second quarter. I suspect we'll see Motion go positive in second half. It may well be though, Shannon, I think until the fourth quarter that Tek Instruments is positive on the core front.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, could you just maybe just give us a little bit more color on kind of the full-year outlook? I mean you gave us obviously a lot of detail back in December, but earnings numbers have come up about $0.05 at the low end. But in terms of businesses or geographies, can you just maybe just give a bit more context in terms of what you're seeing right now compared to December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that what we said in December, again I think played out by and large as anticipated here in the first quarter. I think that as we look forward here, Nigel, again I think we are encouraged by a number of the bookings trends that we saw, particularly in the U.S. and the emerging markets. We again saw that spread between the U.S. and Europe, this time about 700 basis points. Obviously we saw Europe soften a bit. One key point with respect to Europe as we look forward is the second quarter is really the last quarter of last year that we'll be working against where we saw mid-single-digit growth. So the European comparisons get a little easier, but we're not anticipating any rebound in the underlying market conditions in Europe.</p>
          <p>That said, I think the U.S. book-to-bill numbers, the sell-out, sell-in/sell-out dynamics, our funnels and the like, give us optimism that barring some change in the macro scene the U.S. will continue to be good and strong for us. If we look at emerging markets ex-China, we were very pleased with what we saw in the first quarter. We were up high-single-digits. And again, if that holds as we would suspect it will, that in combination with an improving China gives us more tailwind out of the emerging markets than we've seen here in the last couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>So I think all-in we certainly have a number of dynamics that we're working through. We talked to Tek, we talked to Motion a moment ago. But on balance with what we've seen in Life Sciences and Diagnostics, very encouraged there. I think when we look at Product Identification, there as well encouraging outlook. Environmental, both within Water and at GVR, I think is going to be getting better as we go through the year. So barring some sort of cataclysmic macro change, we think we're going to continue to see the acceleration we talked about with you in New York in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then the sell-in versus sell-out dynamics, have we seen that channel destocking, would you characterize that as now largely complete? So &#x2013; or are you still seeing some pressure there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that where we saw it, Nigel, probably most pronounced in T&amp;M and in Dental, I would say that it probably by and large has run its course, but I wouldn't want to speak for the network of distribution partners that we have around the world. I think a number of them, despite good healthy sell-through in the first quarter, continue to take a conservative posture. That's &#x2013; we're going to play the long game here and work with them to make sure they are stocked with products that they need and that we're both generating demand in the marketplace. But in terms of that continuing at the rate that it has here of late, I would find it &#x2013; I find that unlikely to be the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just one more if I may. Environmental margins were down year-over-year. Could you maybe just talk about that? Was that mainly mix?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, it was a little bit of mix, but it was really more investment. They had a nice step-up. I mean, all across the segment, good step-up in year-on-year gross margin percentage. We have stepped up some investment there. Obviously the ballast water is part of that as well. The margins were obviously relatively flat year-on-year, but a lot of that was driven by increased investment.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Deane Dray of Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On X-Rite, I was hoping you could walk through the value proposition of this business both from the color brand management but also a bit more on the technologies. If I'm not mistaken, there's some overlaps with &#x2013; of all businesses, Hach, in the photo spectrometer side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deane, you're absolutely right. We actually were once in the color business back in the old days with Dr. Lange, both Lange and Hach use similar spectrophotometric technology to glean the analytical results that their instruments produce. So it's a space that we know for a long time. I think that with X-Rite &#x2013; or excuse me, with Esko, our perspective on X-Rite really evolved from it being an attractive opportunity, one that just made a ton of sense. It was the number one company atop the Esko funnel.</p>
          <p>I think from a value prop perspective for shareholders, I think we'd say that this is an attractive $600 million adjacency to what we do within product identification. Good underlying growth, I think the company clearly is the market leader here. They have a strong 3X to 4X share lead on competition, two great brands in both X-Rite and Pantone. I think you see all that play out, both in the 60% gross margins and the 20% operating margins. And I think the deal economics are such that we should hit that double-digit return within three years, probably do better than that, as we have at ESCO. So in terms of the space, the company, the deal, we like that.</p>
          <p>What X-Rite enables us to do is basically help brand managers throughout their entire supply chain, from the time they conceive the packaging for a new soda or a new tube of toothpaste, all the way until that packaging is manufactured and sent into the distribution network, to not only manage the packaging thoughtfully, often in a digital frame, but now add to that the key element of color management. So whether you talk to a Unilever, a Procter, a Coke, they see this as a fundamental challenge and opportunity in their business, not only with respect to cost savings because they'll often have literally scores of versions of a white, a red, a yellow, but also the complexity as their businesses have globalized, in keeping those brand standards up to the global standard.</p>
          <p>So we're off to a great start with Esko. As you well know, this has been a, just a strong grower for us from the get go, and I think the opportunity to partner with X-Rite is going to be another good addition to Danaher, but also turbo charge what we're doing in product ID going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Great. Thank you. And then over on the tool side for Apex Tools, can you comment on operating results? And I know you have to be a bit guarded on how you comment on, about the timing, but are you thinking about the opportunities to monetize this asset? And what might the timing be?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deane, this is Dan. Off to a good start there. The combined business posted the best ever gross margins in their history, even on a kind of pro forma basis. Very good operating margins as well. Naturally a little bit slow here in Europe, but continued good progress in the emerging markets. We're not going to comment on external rumors. I think we've said from the start, we wanted to &#x2013; the team to really get after a lot of the cost savings and the go-to market opportunities. That continues and we'll see what happens over time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thanks a lot. Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jon. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. So Larry, can you just give us a bit more color on Beckman? Obviously you had some modest growth there, better than the flag you talked about. Can you parse out kind of the core chemistry in Immunoassay businesses from the Life Sciences piece? And any expectation on a troponin refiling, or change in expectation? Would love to hear an update there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, let me try to cover a number of those bases. I think we couldn't be happier, just as a headline, with where we are. As you point out from a performance perspective, the top line is improving. There's no doubt about it. That is in part a function of, I think, what we're doing on the quality and the service front. I'll come to that in a moment. But obviously we're also seeing, I think, excellent progress on the cost side.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; in terms of the core, we were at a low-single-digit growth number. We were not flat. We'll take that as encouragement. That's two quarters in a row now. I think the underlying dynamic there really is in and around the retention and the win rates, which continue to improve. What we saw back last year continued through the course of the first quarter. We were up I think, on a retention rate basis, up about 700 basis points, say the last five months versus the preceding five months. So good traction there just for a whole host of different reasons. The win rates are improving as well. So if you think about that as a trajectory, I think we couldn't be more pleased with the recovery in the marketplace and in turn, though there is a lag effect, to growth in the business.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we were really pleased with the way the first quarter played out. If you go back in time, you really have to go back to 2006 to see them at 16% at the operating level, and it's more than 400 basis points from where we were a year ago. Just lots of things coming in as we had anticipated. I think from an integration perspective, the reception to Danaher and DBS continues to be thoughtful, strong, just as good as it could be. You talked about the Diagnostics and Life Science split. We have split the businesses, as you know, organizationally. We will be &#x2013; once we're in the core growth reporting mode, we will report those businesses separately.</p>
          <p>But to your question as to how the core growth splits, both DS and Life Sciences were in essence both at that low-single-digit rate. The organizational evolution, as part of that integration continues, we brought on a new Chief Medical Officer, an important and critical hire. There are a number of other things that we're doing lower down in the organizational chart now that I think bodes well for the future.</p>
          <p>And you asked about troponin. On the quality and service front I think we continue to see DBS changing the way that we are doing the work there. Quality clearly is job  one. Very pleased with some of the other assays that I mentioned in the prepared remarks that have been cleared, sodium and glucose. Troponin has been slightly slower, but the results have been steady, the progress good, and I would expect that while we are not going to try to provide a real-time update on these filings going forward, we should be in a good place on troponin very soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Very comprehensive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Services also, Jon, just if I can just add one final point, what we're doing on the service side, you heard some of the data around installation performance, up 20% from a year ago, unscheduled service calls down 15%, a 90% reduction in past due maintenance calls. These are all sorts of things that most Danaher businesses take for granted. Huge opportunity for us to possibly impact customers of Beckman by way of DBS. So all in all, a long way still to go here, but nine months in, we're thrilled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. That was very comprehensive. Thank you. My follow up just quickly on SCIEX, did &#x2013; up modestly, but bookings up mid-teens. How impactful was the introduction of the 4500 intra-quarter, meaning did it impact the shipments of kind of that legacy system, and was that the primary driver to the booking strength kind of in the &#x2013; let's call it the second half of March? Or did that not &#x2013; did you not start to book actual business from the 4500 in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, the introduction of the 4500, while exciting, really isn't a material part of that dynamic. I would say that really what we saw was strengthening in the order books at SCIEX through the course of the quarter. Timing is part of the reason you see that book/ship delta that we highlighted. And obviously, with a bookings quarter like that in the double-digits, it gives us a lot of optimism on top of what we introduced at PITTCON, and hopefully we've got a few things to show at ASMS that, as we go through the year, we should continue to see AB SCIEX be an important growth driver for the segment and for the corporation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You guys mentioned Automation being weak. You kind of called it out. You don't usually do that in the 10-Q. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of color geographically and how bad was it in the quarter for Motion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that Automation, a number of the machine builders that we service at Motion, both at Kollmorgen and Thomson, have seen build rates in some of the verticals that we serve, as we highlighted, Steve, slow. I think the build rates are clearly what's impacting our growth in those segments currently &#x2013; or in that segment, those businesses currently. I think we are heartened by the strengthening in the order book and the book-to-bill, but as you well know, that's going to really be a second half positive effect on our core growth in those businesses. So I wouldn't say that it was horrible or a disaster or anything like that, but I think coupled with some of the softness that we've seen in China, particularly in some of the Cleantech verticals there, that combination had Motion down in the quarter as we described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But that Automation stuff, that's separate from the Technology you called out? They seemed like two separate, kind of discrete end markets you were talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the China pickup, I mean, is this &#x2013; it seems kind of interesting that it kind of turns on a dime here. I mean, you see one good kind of month of lending come out of China. I mean, do you find it kind of strange that the translation from what you see in kind of the macro data converts that quickly to orders? Or is there something different going on there? Is it really kind of a loosening or is it just the end of destocking? It just seems to have kind of turned on a dime for you at the end of the quarter. From flat to up 8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not sure I would characterize China turning on a dime here at quarter's end. We certainly saw slowing through the second half, anticipated a slow but improving start to the year. And I think that's on balance what we saw. I think that we would have anticipated in a few places, frankly, the business to have done a little bit better. If I look at Water for example, encouraged by the funnel build here, but we were down in China in the year &#x2013; or in the quarter against what was not a particularly strong comp. We talked to Motion. That's an important dynamic for us in the quarter in China as well, as is Tektronics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure, but I guess, but flat to up high-single-digits in the second quarter seems like a pretty significant turn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. But part of that's just the calendar. A lot of what &#x2013; a lot of the improvement we're expecting in Q2, we booked in March. So I mean our order growth rate was much better than our shipment growth rate in China in the first quarter. So we go in with a fair amount of backlog. So yes, from a shipment perspective, we're thinking flat to maybe mid to high single, but from an order perspective, it's gotten better, but that trajectory is not quite as steep, if that makes sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just one more quick question. If I do the math on a 3% to 5% organic in the second quarter, I'm getting to something, I think, like a 20% incremental margin to get to your EPS numbers. Am I missing something there? And that's ex-dilution. I've kind of pulled that out. So is there some reason why the incrementals are going to be &#x2013; core incrementals are going to be weaker in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I'd have to look &#x2013; I'd look at that. I'd be &#x2013; I don't think &#x2013; I'd be surprised if it's that low. And there could be some &#x2013; I don't know if there's any acquisition noise in there. There may be again some with X-Rite. But I would expect it would be more in the 30s, but I'm happy to look at that with you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, I want to get a sense of &#x2013; your long-term core growth rate has always been &#x2013; your target at least has been 5% plus. And I went back, I looked at the average, I think since 1999 it averages kind of 3.1%; since the last five or six years it's 3.5%. I mean how much should we care about this? I mean DBS obviously helps a lot of margins, but it doesn't seem to be doing much on core growth. I mean it's &#x2013; you spend a fair amount on R&amp;D. I mean is this something that becomes an increasing focus as time goes on? Or just the nature of kind of your business model, you have to bring in assets like Beckman and kind of slow down growth to fix things and that's just kind of what we should expect is this 3% to 4% rather than a 5% to 6% or something? How do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I would, for one, not accept and wouldn't allow anyone on the payroll to accept 3% to 4% core growth through the cycle on a core basis for this portfolio. I mean, we certainly have, I think, as you look across the business stem to stern, a strong set of businesses. Clearly new businesses are going to come in. They're not going to be performing at a peak level. But that said, I think we're a mid single digit plus grower through the cycle with the businesses that we have, and anything we bring in will be brought in to strengthen our ability to grow, let alone generate margin expansion returns for shareholders. So I would argue that DBS has positive impact on business' top and bottom line, on the balance sheet as well.</p>
          <p>This is a quarter perhaps with a headline number, though it being I think what we had talked about for some time working against the highest growth quarter from a year ago, it's not a headline we relish putting out there. But that said, I think as we look at the underlying trends in the businesses, whether we look at book-to-bill and backlogs, whether we look at how we're performing in our markets, some of these issues around the channel dynamics at the start of the year, I think we feel very good about the acceleration that we talked about. The comps do get easier, and that's an element to be sure, but there's no reason you should lower your expectations. I'm not lowering my expectations with respect to what we can do through the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's a very fair answer. Just getting back to your point on the sell-in versus the sell-out, it seems like kind of a common theme on this call is that your distributors were taking down some inventory. Why was that exactly? Is it product cycle? Is it just kind of timing? What's the common theme there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that &#x2013; I think it's hard to characterize what we saw, Scott, in two very different markets, T&amp;M on one hand, Dental in another, with two or three truly common denominators. I think, that said, we saw, I think, in a number of places at the end of last year, despite good sell-out, a cautious position on inventory on the part of a number of our partners, all well-managed businesses, that carried into this year, again, despite some of the strength that we were seeing at the counter and elsewhere on a sell-through basis. I think that corrects itself. It has to. So I'm heartened by the sell-through.</p>
          <p>The inventory adjustments that we take here in the short-term perhaps create a little pressure, but I think you take a long view here, we want to be working with partners who are growing at or above market. We want to be their core, or their key supply partners. And I think we're in that position. Again, part of the rationale, part of the logic that gives us the confidence to say as we move forward here, we'll benefit from that pickup, that readjustment, if you will, on the top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just as a quick follow-up, Larry, when you think about the evolution of Danaher over time, does it become more important that you compensate managers for core growth going forward given the size of the asset base you have now? Or not? I mean, not knowing exactly how you compensate everybody, but when you think about it, does that become a greater emphasis over time that, hey, look, these are the assets we have and we need to grow them, we need to gain share, we need to grow them, and 4% ain't going to get it done? So how do you compensate people to kind of do that, to accelerate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, big important topic. Let me simply say this: Yes. We have been increasing the weighting of core in our comp schemes, and we'll continue to do that. Not because we want to be a 5% to 7% versus a 4% to 5%, but the fact of the matter is these businesses that are part of the Danaher portfolio, the best that we have made, are growth businesses in growth markets, right? So this is not a Danaher of a different time where, as some might reflect, was simply a margin play. I don't think it was true then, but it's certainly not the case today. And we need to make sure that we are growing these businesses in order to perpetuate the leadership positions that they enjoy in their markets. If their markets are as good as we think and the businesses are strong and get stronger, we should be delivering numbers more in line with what I think your expectations are, pretty much in line with my own.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you just maybe start with the math on the $5 billion, given about almost $3 billion of free cash flow that you're looking at? How are you &#x2013; just walk me through the math on why it's not a bigger number at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we talk about at least, capacity of at least $5 billion. That's on top of X-Rite, which is at over $600 million, so that's roughly two years of current cash flow and the math is not any more complicated than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of your willingness to borrow or drive the balance sheet any harder, I mean we obviously &#x2013; you see that in select situations. Have you &#x2013; is your thinking changed on that front at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean clearly, as we've gotten bigger, our cash flow has gotten larger, our ability to borrow more under our current credit rating increases and we would expect that to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And then back to the core growth question, just a couple. One clarification. If I just comp on number of days versus a year ago, is that taking off about a 1.5%, or 1% or 1.5%, in terms of how you think about the core growth number you just put up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, we had the same number of shipping days, both Q1s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So no impact on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the NPVI number is still hovering around 29%, right? Or around high 20s%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about vitality of new products? Percent of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess the question there is what &#x2013; if you think about this over time as indicative, we're going through quarter after quarter of a constant drumbeat of new product introductions that as year by year goes by, I'm expecting to see those start to gain a lot more traction. Is that &#x2013; are you &#x2013; what &#x2013; how do you think about that number? And I'm looking for other ways to think about core growth and traction on that from DBS, et cetera, to some of the earlier comments made, and wondering if that's not a decent way think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's one important piece of the puzzle, Steve, but I think there are a whole host of factors. Innovation, new products is one. Obviously the success of what we do from a sales, marketing and service perspective, another. And what we're able to do out of the factory, in terms of quality and delivery is a third, that are parts of that mosaic that when we are executing well on the right things, should allow us to grow at or above market rates. So I wouldn't want to get too fixated on any one input in that regard. I really do think it takes a broad, integrated effort to drive the share gains that we see at a place like Videojet or Chemtreat, that we've seen over the last several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you think 30% is roughly the right number? You're not sort of &#x2013; even though it's only one metric, as you mentioned, you're not sort of thinking that that thing should 35% or 40%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we would always like to take numbers like those, that you believe in your gut are correlated with growth and share, up. But that number, the right number for certain businesses will be higher than it will be for others, right? You take a business like a Micro or Tektronix, where product life cycles are a little shorter, maybe the competitive intensity is a bit more than what we might see it elsewhere, they need to be at a higher number. Likewise, if you look at some of, say, the Water businesses, be it Hach Lange with a high consumables stream or Chemtreat, the new product or the vitality ratio there is not likely to be that high, in part just because of the way you'd do the math if you were being honest about it, and obviously we would be. So I think we try to calibrate those sorts of metrics business by business, so no one business goes off chasing a corporate mandate or trying to clear a corporate bar that isn't appropriate to the context of the market they compete in.</p>

          <p>Hey, Jeff. Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hey, a lot of ground covered. Let me just be quick, with one or two items. U.S. Muni, Larry, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing there? And is this kind of just some random projects that have started to hit? Or are you actually seeing, ground swell's maybe too strong a word, but some true pickup in underlying activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I would say it's more underlying activity than big projects, per se, being let. So we will see that most positively at Hach. Again, because that's more of a razor blades model, as you know there. Conversely, that will pinch us a bit over time at Trojan, as those big projects are slowing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your visibility on China Muni, I think you said orders picking up. Do you have pretty good visibility on when those actually get let and move forward? Or is it still just kind of order activity and pipeline building?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that we have good visibility there, Jeff, with respect to projects. Again, given the selling cycle, given the way the municipalities plan these efforts and when initial planning commences compared to when we actually ship product, there's a good bit of time there. The challenge is really applying historical practice and trends to that funnel and trying to anticipate when orders will be let. I think through the back half of last year and even here early in the year, we've just seen certain projects get pushed a bit more than we would have anticipated, more than we have seen historically.</p>
          <p>So I think that's why we're particularly heartened with the book-to-bill there. So we're seeing these funnels improve. That's good. Seeing a north of 1.0 book-to-bill, even better. So that's the way I would describe it. It's certainly better visibility than we have in some other businesses, but it's been a little noisy, say, in the last six to nine months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally maybe for Dan, price play any role in the organic growth number this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a little bit over half a point. Q1's often a little bit light for us in price. I think that will get a little bit better. Again, we're getting pretty good price on consumables, though it's relatively flat on equipment and instruments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a million for taking the questions. Just a couple quick ones. First, just a clarification, Larry. You gave organic growth or kind of core growth expectations for 2Q, and I may have missed it, but for the full year, just no change to your core growth outlook? Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, Larry, if I think about Europe and all of the danger that Europe is not one country, right, but if I look at Europe, I have to say it's a little &#x2013; if I see the results coming out of your business, it's not exactly what I would expect. You have things like SCIEX and Leica Microsystems down, PID up. Can you maybe just talk about what's &#x2013; what you see happening in Europe and maybe how that's trended over the last few months just given everything that we read and hear over there? And maybe your interpretation of what's happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I was in Europe this week. I'm not sure that having been there recently gives me any truly unique perspective, Jon. I think things are simply sluggish in a whole host of places. We can, I think, understand what happened at Leica and SCIEX; again, while softening, we are heartened by some of the leading indicators. But that said, probably the best thing we have going for us right now in Europe is the simple fact that the comparisons get easier. As we get into the second half, we say good-bye to these mid-single-digit growth quarters that we saw last year, and that will help what we print. But while we're not, I think, unduly pessimistic about Europe, I don't think we harbor any illusions about the underlying economy, particularly in those places where it's soft, bouncing back dramatically as we go through 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jon, as you point out, it's not soft across the board. We were talking about the Muni business and the Water business in the U.S. Actually we had a good first quarter in our Municipal business in Europe. You mentioned Videojet, still decent growth, Radiometer as well. So we still have some key businesses that are performing reasonably well in Europe. So it's not &#x2013; it's not soft everywhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So outside of just broadly, you said, being sluggish, it's not like you can look over the last three or four months at trends in any particular businesses or orders that are going on that you can draw some conclusion about? You just kind of expect broadly sluggish just across all the businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q1 played out very much as we expected, which is consistent sequentially from Q4, kind of the normal seasonality. Some businesses soft and some businesses still posting pretty good numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Jon, to Dan's point, I mean rest assured from an operating perspective, whether you cut it by company or whether you cut it by country, it doesn't mean those teams all get to take a pass on 2012, right? There are countries where we see particular businesses, Dan highlighted a few good examples, where there are opportunities we should be able to grow. And at a minimum, you can always go grab share. But when you roll it all up, obviously Europe is going to be the challenge for us from a geographic perspective this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just, if I can, quickly on Dental, for first quarter, it looks like all-time high margins and pretty good improvement year-over-year. Is that just &#x2013; I know you've been focusing on that, is that sustainable where we're at? Were there some particular one-time items in the quarter? How do you think about the margins there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were not, Jon, there were not one-time items. We got off to a very good start. We had a very good Q4 that was masked, from a reporting perspective, because of all the restructuring we did, but you saw that play out nicely in the first quarter. And if you look at that segment, and you were to add back the amortization, we actually were up, from a true operating profit perspective, we were north of 15% in the quarter. So off to a good start, and think we can sustain that.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. And Larry, congrats on the X-Rite acquisition. I think that is going to look very good on Videojet and Esko.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of the Test and Measurement business, and I guess when I look at the distribution channel itself, are you very comfortable that there's no share gain or loss going on in the distribution channel on the Instrument side of Test and Measurement, in particular at Tek, given the sell-in is lower than the sell-through? And Dental I would think you'd have a better perspective given that the channel there is more concentrated, more consolidated? But are you comfortable that there's no share gains or losses in the channel on the Instrument side in T&amp;M?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if we look at T&amp;M, and when we talk about this dynamic, we're talking about both Fluke and Tek, you're going to have puts and takes in any one month, any one quarter. But I think if we look at the last year or two in those businesses, I don't see it. I know some others may suggest otherwise, but I think if we look at those businesses, particularly with the new product momentum that we think we will generate going through the year, what we're doing to generate brand preference, let alone broad end-user demand, we're doing good work there. And I think as we go through the year, again barring a change in the macro environment, that will present itself more than it has here in the first quarter in our top-line numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in Dental the same dynamic applies. I didn't mean to leave them out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's fine. And then also just within the T&amp;M business, and the Instrument piece, is it fair to say is the tone of business and the book-to-bill, was it greater than one in China, the tone of business strong, kind of maybe turning in China versus Europe? Have we seen the bottom in the T&amp;M side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Rick. You're talking about T&amp;M in China, have we seen bottom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Within the Instrument businesses within the T&amp;M business, so really Tektronix and Fluke, have we seen the bottom in Europe? And conversely, is the tone of business turned in China? I'm just trying to distinguish between geographies there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, overall our book-to-bill was nicely north of one for instruments in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's obviously encouraging, given we had a sub-one in the fourth quarter, to see that go north of one in the first quarter is a good sign.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just, Dan, real quickly, just one question on CapEx. CapEx in the quarter looked significantly high. Does that back off this year? Or is that a good run rate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
