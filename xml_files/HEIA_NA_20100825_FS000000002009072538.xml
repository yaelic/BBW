        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the results are much more better than we published, right? That's what he told you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending once again our Half-Year Results 2010; also for those who are following us through the webcast a very good afternoon.</p>
          <p>As ever, I'm here with Ren&#xE9; Hooft Graafland, our CFO and I will take you through a brief tour of the business highlights and the regional overview, and Ren&#xE9; will dig more into the details of our performance in this first half and then, we will follow with a Q&amp;A and as ever, we will have some entertaining &#x2013; I hope entertaining commercials to show you because we are there to sell you also some beer.</p>
          <p>The technology is providing me with the necessary support. Thank you. The highlights: we started the year with the announcement of the acquisition of FEMSA Cerveza, a special deal with equity issuance from our company to the FEMSA Group, a new kind of deal for us. Deal was closed at the end of April and we started to consolidate FEMSA in the 1st &#x2013; as from the 1st of May of this year. Integration activities have been so far going well.</p>
          <p>The integration team has actually left Mexico. It's all handed over to management and what we can say is that the review we performed confirmed the results of the due diligence we did previously, and so that acquisition is on track. What it did is to rebalance our portfolio of businesses more to emerging markets, the emerging markets being markets where demographic growth times economic growth times political stability are therefore the long-term set to give kind of secure growth sources for our company going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, we have &#x2013; besides doing that acquisition, have been concentrating as ever on our operational programs. That is the TCM, the Total Cost Management program which in its second year and for the first half-year yielded &#x20AC;104 million. Those savings came mainly out of Europe and Ren&#xE9; will give more details about the whereabouts of the program.</p>
          <p>We have a second program which is called Hunt for Cash 2 and &#x2013; which is designed to generate an optimalized if I may use that word free operating cash flow and we increased that free operating cash flow from &#x20AC;383 million last year to &#x20AC;699 million. And Ren&#xE9; will again show some highlights of that program. We continued to work on our recently acquired acquisitions, on our route to create revalue with these acquisitions and we made some noticeable progress in most of our newly acquired businesses.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have increased this year our investment in our brands and it's true that last year, we were faced with an economic downturn, might be said that it's there and certainly in the mature or at least in the mature part of the world and the Western world to sit for quite a time, and we have taken the view that we have to continue to invest in our core brands and marketing activities and in innovations, and so we have step up a bit our spendings on marketing activities.</p>
          <p>We had the &#x2013; we have posted good results in the first half-year due to these programs but also I would say that the very good performance in Africa and the Middle East, in Asia and in Latin America has been clearly supporting the good performance. The Heineken brand has grown again 4% in the first half and finally leading to that 17% organic increase of our net profit beia now.</p>
          <p>And more details of the results on the second chart here. The first two lines concerning our volumes are perhaps on the aggregate level a bit difficult to read because they are &#x2013; the results in the first column changed this is &#x2013; the produce of the first-time consolidation of the FEMSA for only two months. The de-consolidation of Indonesia and New Caledonia and in the Group beer volumes, we have added also for the first time the volumes of United Breweries. So we will &#x2013; when we will do the regional review, you will see more clearly how that played down region-by-region.</p>
          <p>And our revenues though organically were down 2%, they went up 5%. That's for consolidation change but organically, they went down 2%, that's the high impact still of our mature markets which causes that but also some other business like our wholesaling business and soft drink business, and I will come up to that when we talk about Western Europe, but we could produce an EBIT beia growth of 5.7%. And that is because we could maintain quite well overall the level of our gross profits and working on the cost side whilst not disinvesting on our brands, we could produce better margins.</p>
          <p>And the net profit beia has increased organically by 17%, that is due to lesser interest charges as we have been enjoying the result of our cash-generating program diminishing our net debt, hence diminishing also the interest charges of the Group, but also the increasing contribution of our JVs, which on a net basis grew from 66 million in the first half last year to 94 million this year. And in &#x2013; the strong emphasis we have on generating free operating cash flow has account &#x2013; led to reduce our net debt once more to &#x2013; at the end of the period of 2.6 times EBITDA, that is included FEMSA on a 12-month comparable basis and including, of course, the net debt of FEMSA.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; in line with our dividend policy, we have declared a interim dividend representing 40% of the dividend last year, which is &#x20AC;0.26 per share. This is the results in a nutshell. I'd like to focus and zoom in, in our flagship brand, Heineken still 17% of volume and much more of our profits; it stays the flagship brand of our company. I showed this little graph already at the year-end 2009; often, it is said that we suffer from downtrading. In some markets, it's true, but overall the market has grown again a healthy 4% year-on-year. And you will notice again that the performance of the Heineken brand is always better than the one of our global portfolio, with the exception perhaps of the Americas, but that's the overweight of the Heineken brand in the US still in the total Americas.</p>
          <p>A &#x2013; with strong performance in a few countries like France, Portugal, South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Chile, Caribbean, Brazil, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, very strong performance and overall the number of countries where Heineken is really growing by and large over in odd number the ones where Heineken is suffering from downtrading in some of our markets.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the regional overview starting with Western Europe. Here, we have the Group volumes and consolidated beer volumes are in &#x2013; more or less in line. They declined 2.5% and you see our revenues declining 3.9%. Let me explain that first, it is because the high weight of the wholesale activity in Europe, which explains that, that is very much linked to the on-trade activities and the on-trade market declined faster than the off-trade market. And the second is the soft drink activities, which suffered more than the beer activity.</p>
          <p>So that is explaining the difference because the gross margins were not suffering during that period. So that caveat I wanted to make here. And as you can see, we grew also in that difficult context and for the second year already difficult context, we could grew our EBIT beia contribution out of the region by 6% and improving by 90 basis points our operating margins in the region.</p>
          <p>Now, that &#x2013; having said, Western Europe remains a very strong contributor to free operating cash flow. Ren&#xE9; will give more details about that. So &#x2013; and the TCM program, Western Europe is contributing half of the total program. So it is still a very high contributor to the cash generation in our Group; that is also the role it plays. But as I said earlier, it is not because that role that we don't invest behind our brands in tendentiously higher investments, which is about 0.7% for the whole Group, which is again 12.5% of our total revenue. Also, in Western Europe, we tendentiously spend more on supporting our brands.</p>
          <p>Here also, the Heineken brand outperformed the total portfolio. There is a weakness across the on-trade business in Europe. I mean the crisis is affecting, first and for all, the on-trade business, that phenomenon is much more heavy even than the downtrading phenomenon, which is in our industry if I make or has a much more marginal effect than the on-trade, off-trade shift now. We're coping with that and that cost also for quite a number of restructuring and we are absolutely not only following the market, but also anticipating the market and redesigning our capacities for serving the on-trade market, where we exercise leadership in most of the European markets when if not all, where we operate.</p>
          <p>Also, very good performances in France, where we increased again our value shares and the Heineken brand did and also Pelforth Blonde did very well, and Desperados, our key brands in France did well. We had the share increase in &#x2013; also in Portugal and Finland ex S&amp;N countries doing well.</p>
          <p>And in the UK, we have to give in a little bit of market share, particularly in the off-trade and so we gained market share in the cider business. We could maintain and even gained a bit in the on-trade but the on-trade once more is decreasing quite a bit in the UK. But we lost a bit of ground in the off-trade, because this year, we have been battling with a few of our key customers about pricing as we have the experience last year in Italy, taking the view that we still have to exercise our leadership in the market in the UK for the restoration of margins. Operating margins in this country are still tendentiously much lower than in the rest of Europe. And we are on a repair program and that cost, of course, a number of years and that doesn't go without from time-to-time a fight.</p>
          <p>So I'm afraid we missed out on an Easter promotion and even key World Soccer promotions but we will be back on track here in the UK for the Christmas promotion. So this is designed in a voluntary policy, but when we look at how the UK business has restructured itself in the last two years, it's quite impressive. We have been closing now two breweries, not that it is a hobby of ours, but that is intended to be competitive again in the face of a new reality.</p>
          <p>We haven't been investing in UBL, not the Indian one, but the cider mill, because that's still a growing market for us. We've been divesting Waverley because it's a wholesale activity, which was of very low strategic sense to our UK business. So a lot of restructuring activity supported by a very good team of people here in this country and we are making progress in exercising our leadership in the country.</p>
          <p>So after the Western Europe region, let me now turn to Central European region. Definitely, a bit as rosy here, and you see it in the title, it has been impacted by Russia. If you would take out &#x2013; starting with the sales, if you would take out the Russian sales drop, which were quite hefty, the whole region would also decrease 2.5%. So much in line with the rest of Europe which contrasted the pictures and I will come up to there but the Russian situation has been quite harsh for us. The tripling of the excise duty has impacted our business very much. One has to realize we're not &#x2013; normally, we always try to be number one or number two, having strong brands. Clearly, in Russia, we are working on that but we are a distant number three.</p>
          <p>So our market position is not that strong and we have perhaps taken a bit an optimistic view to what concerns the speed at which we could recover the excise duty increases into our own prices and that has led also to quite a hefty market share loss in that country. We're on the path of recovering, that's going to be slow.</p>
          <p>And the region was also affected by bad weather, harsh winter, all the end a series of excise duty increases not only in Russia, but one has to say that the region is absolutely on track on the TCM program. So that has been a very strong point of the region and in a number of countries, we have &#x2013; we have had an excellent performance from which Romania, Austria, Serbia and Belarus have been really posting some noticeable progress.</p>
          <p>The other country where we suffer for macroeconomic reasons, not for market leadership reasons obviously, is Greece, because we have to endure a more than doubling of the excise duty over the last 18 months and that starts to kind of dent a bit into demand, but that has nothing to do with our market position who continues to be &#x2013; which continues to be strong. That is the contrast, that situation in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>I now turn to the Africa, Middle East and by contrast, this is an excellent performance across the region, it's again a stellar performance. I &#x2013; they have to call it. Just starting with the consolidated volume here, which you see is 4.7% lower. This is due to the fact that we don't consolidate anymore the volumes sold in South Africa, previously imported from Europe and fully consolidated. They are now in the Group's volume. So here, I urge you to look at the Group volume. There is no one single geography in the whole region, which is not showing and posting a solid growth. So this is really fantastic and particularly in the DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Egypt and South Africa, a really stellar performance and growing revenue too.</p>
          <p>In Nigeria, you will remember we had a weak first quarter and the second quarter have been restoring the situation quite well. So we are optimistic for the second half in Nigeria. Economic conditions restored quite well and we are, as we see, back on track on &#x2013; with growth in &#x2013; with Nigerian Breweries and consolidated Breweries in that country.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, we gained share and the Brewery is currently under expansions from 3 million hectoliter to 4.5 million hectoliter. As you see, our operating margins stayed unchanged but at a very healthy 26.5% which is one of our best regional performances.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the Americas, which is the most changing region because from an important region, it's going to show up slowly by slowly to our most important region in terms of profit contribution. Yet, we are still in the translation as FEMSA here is &#x2013; FEMSA Cerveza being CCM in Mexico and Heineken Brazil in &#x2013; yeah, in Brazil and are consolidated only for two months.</p>
          <p>Let me start with North America. In North America, the beer market is under pressure. It lost 3% in &#x2013; on the first half-year. Our total portfolio with Heineken USA receded 1.7%, so we did better than the market. This is by and large due to the Mexican brands with a stellar performance again of Dos Equis with a 23% growth, but also a reasonable performance of Tecate and Heineken being still under pressure with a 4% receding, bit more than market, but in relative terms if you compare it to the past, we see that decrease is starting to bottom out. It's a bit early days to say that. We are over what we wanted to re-engineer growth and equity building for the Heineken brand, but it's certainly an early encouraging sign.</p>
          <p>The performance in the Caribbean and Central America as well as South Africa (sic) [South America] was good all over the line, including in Chile where CCU had had a big blow due to the earthquake in the first quarter, restored totally in the second quarter and showing growth again, both for its total business, but also for the Heineken brand.</p>
          <p>Turning to FEMSA, and I will dive into FEMSA, but the CCM in Mexico operationally in the beginning of the year increased its prices on top of an excise duty increase. Or the consumer price went up more than what we got in our pocket, but we had a good price increase. All over the way, it had an effect on the volumes in the first few months, but that is restoring quite nicely.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil, we benefited really from a booming economy. That is really &#x2013; we don't have a very strong position there, but the company is doing really well. 14% more volumes. And the Heineken brand, which is in the premium segment, where we will concentrate our work in Brazil, has grown close to 50%, again, year-on-year. So we are quite pleased with the results so far.</p>
          <p>Let me then turn to specifically the integration of FEMSA. We have called it Lo Mejor De Los Dos, the best of both. The &#x2013; we have done the &#x2013; we have performed a review of the business. And we are able to confirm all synergies and the plans that we saw in the due diligence. Obviously, these things are fine-tuned. But grossly, we're on track, no bad surprises. On the contrary, rather good, encouraging signs. The integration teams left the countries and management is in place and has taken over, and is now working, building the future.</p>
          <p>Key strengths are confirmed. A fantastic organization and people, good brands, good market positions, as you know, as FEMSA in Mexico &#x2013; or CCM in Mexico, sorry &#x2013; has very strong holds regionally. We will work on the revitalization of the brand portfolio and particularly the Sol brand in the year ahead of us. Tecate brand is very strong, very good brand. We're working on the introduction of locally produced Heineken as we speak for &#x2013; in the course of next year. And we are working also on fine-tuning and improving the commercial organization. Those are the broad lines &#x2013; it is of course a competitive affair, but those are the broad lines that in Mexico we work on.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil, as I said earlier, we benefited from a very good economic climate that is &#x2013; that makes it of course easy. And we are working on continuing to sustain the growth of the Heineken brand in the top segment, because that is where the &#x2013; in effect, the value model of our investment in Brazil will be based essentially on the growth of the Heineken brand at premium prices and premium margins. So we are working on that one. So far in broad lines for the integration of the FEMSA.</p>
          <p>And I finish the regional tour with Asia Pacific. There, again, you see very strange movements in the numbers. That has to do with the fact that as we have sold &#x2013; quote/unquote sold &#x2013; in effect, factually, we have sold half of our Indonesian and New Caledonian operation to APB. We have integrated that into APB. We have de-consolidating that on both volume as well as revenue and EBIT account. So that is integrated now in APB. And on the Group volumes side, we have been adding for the first time United Breweries.</p>
          <p>Now, our business in Asia, as I said, so what you see as owned business is &#x2013; those are export-based businesses. We don't have local production base anymore. It's all licenses or joint ventures.  Lion Nathan in Australia and with Kirin in Japan. Or import operations in Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong, which are, let's say, the biggest operations on an export base we have in the Asian regions. And that is what you see as our own business.</p>
          <p>All the rest of the business is done through two key joint ventures. APB that you are accustomed with. And APB increased again its volume over the period of 10%. It was a good performance in Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam, Vietnam being really a star performer in APB.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand, with United Breweries in India, which posted a 30% volume growth year-on-year on the first half, with again Kingfisher and Kingfisher Strong driving the growth. Our market share is now around 50%, double the size of our immediate follower.</p>
          <p>And we're also as Mr. &#x2013; Dr. Mallya, our partner, announced proudly two weeks ago in Bangalore, that we are now preparing an introduction of the Heineken brand, locally produced at UBL, for the first quarter of next year in India. So we are very pleased. And this is a superb platform, I would say, for growth, not only for intrinsically the Indian beer market but also for our &#x2013; and the Kingfisher brand but also for the Heineken brand going forward.</p>
          <p>This closes my tour of the world and I traditionally finish with a full-year outlook. It's always easier to give the outlook when the summer season is behind us, obviously done before. But that is what &#x2013; how we do it and the &#x2013; bottom line, Heineken expects the organic increase in net profit beia for the full year to be at least to low double digit. That is our forecast and that is based on the fact that we continue &#x2013; we expect our volumes to continue to grow in Africa, Asia, Latin America and by that, we remain cautious on Europe and the US for the beer market, it's going to be still tough times. We continue to take a positive outlook on the international premium segment and the development possibilities of the Heineken brand in particular.</p>
          <p>We continue invest in our key brands. So the sign is there, we are here to stay and unlike the crisis, we continue to invest in our brands. The TCM will further contribute in second half obviously and we continue to work on our recently acquired businesses. Their free operating cash flow is a priority and will continue to deliver it. But we want the tax rate for all sorts of technical reasons, which are beyond my understanding, but absolutely in the reach of Ren&#xE9;'s or will be a bit higher in the second half towards the first half.</p>
          <p>With that, I conclude my presentation thanking you for your attention and before handing over to Ren&#xE9;, we have to &#x2013; you will have a commercial coming from Mexico, right. Tecate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And okay, as &#x2013; well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and I will take you as usual through the financials a little bit more in detail and I will elaborate more on the individual programs we have been running. But let me start with the revenues. And they got obviously an &#x2013; a good boost, 7.5 billion, 5.2% growth and that is driven by the changes in the scope of consolidation, notably FEMSA Cerveza, that was the most important one. But also foreign exchange played a positive role and these both offset the organic decline of 2%.</p>
          <p>And looking at the consolidations as such, FEMSA Cerveza, now called CCM and Heineken Brazil are consolidated as of the 1st of May, that's in positive sense. But, we also had a number of de-consolidations, notably the businesses in Indonesia and New Caledonia, which were brought in in the APB joint venture and are not anymore consolidated; secondly, the shift to local production in South Africa by our joint venture over there. It's also treated as a consolidation change because as you know last year, we were still shipping the beer out of Europe.</p>
          <p>What is not yet affecting the revenue figures is the divestment of Waverley, but you should be aware of that although it had hardly any impact on EBIT and no impact on EBIT. The revenues of that business are quite substantial, &#x20AC;0.5 billion on a yearly basis. So when modeling the company going forward, you have to be aware that we take out 0.5 billion of revenues because of Waverley. And as such, we benefited from the foreign exchange; in total, 156 million or 2% of revenues was driven by that, and that's mainly the Polish zloty, the Russian ruble, the English pound or the British pound and the US dollar. And organically, the revenue decreased 2% and you can split that, 3.9% is the result of the volume effect on revenue and that coincides this time exactly with the change in consolidated volume. Normally, we have some discussions about it, but this time, it is equal; next time, it will be different, again, probably because that is how it is. And better pricing and better sales mix contributed 1.9%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the profitability, to start with EBIT, EBIT before exceptional items and amortization of brands and customer relations reached &#x20AC;1.129 billion. And in quite challenging trading conditions, especially in Europe and the US, we could achieve a healthy 5.7% organic increase and that is driven by the improved margins &#x2013; gross profit margins which were certainly also helped by lower input cost, by our highly disciplined approached to cost, our whole TCM program, but also the strong performance of our joint ventures.</p>
          <p>Looking at marketing and sales, and marketing and sales expenses increased 5% organically. As a percentage of revenue, it reached 12.5% which is 70 basis points up compared with the same period last year and it demonstrates that we are absolutely as part of our value strategy is to invest in &#x2013; behind our brands and to &#x2013; and increase that.</p>
          <p>The first-time consolidations contributed to EBIT 61 million and that is again a balance between FEMSA Cerveza on one side and the divestments or the de-consolidation of the Asian assets and together with the currency effect on EBIT of 19 million that drove an overall EBIT beia growth of 14%. And the focus on cash generation had its effect obviously on the debt levels in the company and the related interest expense. Organically, you'll see that interest went down by 44 million, partly offset by the interest linked to the debt within FEMSA Cerveza, 1.5 billion debt is in that company and we had 17 million interest expense linked to that for the two months.</p>
          <p>Net profit beia increased 29% to 621 million and the organic part of that was 17% as we have said already many times. This is an interesting graph. It shows an overview of the performance of FEMSA Cerveza in total. So it is Mexico and Brazil and the international business added all. In the first half of the year, it's all in Mexican peso to make the comparison easier and the green part on the slide shows the months of May and June, and these are the two months which are in our accounts consolidated. And as you can see, and that is a bit the same pattern as we see in our company in total as well, these are the stronger months; in these two months, we realized 40% of revenues and half of the profit.</p>
          <p>And looking at the volumes in Mexico, they were slightly down, especially driven in the first quarter and that was after the 4.5% price increase, which we had in January or which FEMSA at the time had in January on top of an excise increase. However, key brands like Tecate and Dos Equis performed very well with 5 &#x2013; no, 7% and 5% increase respectively.</p>
          <p>Looking at the volumes in Brazil, very positive and more than 14% up. As said by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, the economic growth helped but also good weather. The World Cup, as you can imagine, in Brazil was a big thing in the low season. So that worked very positively. Heineken brand, strong performance, close to 50% growth.</p>
          <p>Revenue increased to 22.9 billion pesos and the EBIT beia was up to 2.8 billion. And in euros &#x2013; or translated in euros, obviously, we benefited from the appreciation of the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real versus the euro. So EBIT beia in euros increased from the 144 million, which we published last week, the 2009 first half to &#x20AC;167 million, of which &#x20AC;85 million is in our own books and is consolidated for the May &#x2013; months of May and June.</p>
          <p>And then, I have a look at the joint ventures, we mentioned that the growth in profitability of the joint ventures was contributing pretty much to the performance of the company and we have quite a number of joint ventures in the company and they are mainly focused on developing markets, as like APB in the Asia-Pacific region, UBL in India, CCU in Chile or &#x2013; and Argentina, Brandhouse in South Africa, BRASCO in Congo, these are all joint ventures operating in fast-growing markets and the real impact of these JVs is not fully obviously reflected in our accounts because we don't consolidate them and we only report our share of their net profit underlying income from JVs and associates that leads in our books to an EBIT contribution of 8% and a net profit contribution of 14% in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>But let me just give you an idea of the size of these businesses. In the first half of this year, the JVs had a total volume of 21.5 million hectoliters and that is 25% of our total Group volume, Group beer volume. The first-half revenue or first half of the year revenues generated by these JVs is 1.8 billion and these are obviously not included in our revenues but would include &#x2013; would they be included, it would increase our revenues by 24% to over 9.3 billion in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>And if we would consolidate these JVs fully in our accounts, they would contribute another &#x20AC;340 million and that would be 25% of our EBIT beia. So that gives you an idea of the importance of these JVs. We are in joint control of these JVs. We work completely together with them but in our books, you'll see only a limited part of that reflected, but they are large, they are profitable and they are growing.</p>
          <p>And let me spend some time on the cost program, TCM, Total Cost Management. And as you know, it's a three-year cost reduction program from 2008 to 2011; it's clustered into four business streams, supply chain, commerce, wholesale and a category others, and it applies to all cost categories as well the fixed as the variable.</p>
          <p>I think it is very important that in the company and we preceded this program by Fit2Fight that already in 2005, we started to focus the company on cost reductions and efficiency improvements because if you look now at the company in an economic downturn, it is very important that we had the effect for instance in this first half of the year of &#x20AC;104 million of savings in the books. And as important is it that it shows that there is a shift in mentality in the company, that there is a shift in mindset in the company and that continuous drive for further efficiency improvement is really embedded across the whole organization.</p>
          <p>And we had obviously in different countries restructuring cost, but individually, they were not big enough to declare them exceptional. So they are just taken in the operational results, like you always will have left and right reorganization cost and you also have to remember last year, we took a big hit with the 170 million and the effect of that is obviously growing also going forward and had an impact on this year.</p>
          <p>The savings are, to a great extent, half of it is driven by efficiency improvement in the supply chain. And as announced already last year, a bit affected. Now, we closed factually four breweries in the first half of the year, the two in the UK, one in the Czech Republic and one in Romania. Next to that, we did quite a lot of work in wholesale. As you can imagine, we were further centralizing the purchasing. We have a big project, non-product-related spends where we address all kinds of cost categories which are not directly linked to the product, the things like temporary labor, insurances, et cetera.</p>
          <p>And you can see on the left-hand bottom of the &#x2013; or the pie chart in the left-hand bottom, you can see the division of the different categories. And also in the countries, you see that the majority of the savings is coming from Europe, Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, and that makes sense because there, obviously the pressure is the biggest.</p>
          <p>So all in all, big savings in the first half of this year, 104 million, bring the total of the program now to 259 million in an 18-months timeframe but also things which is not part of TCM as the divestment of Waverley helps the company to become more effective and more and more focused. It didn't play an important role in the route to market for the UK, but it helps to focus the UK management team. It helps to further improve the operational performance of the business in the UK.</p>
          <p>And then cash flow, that is our second big program from a financial point of view. We've TCM and we have Hunt for Cash. You know the program aiming at an cash conversion rate above 100% up to the period 2011 included and the key drivers of the program are simple: reducing working capital and reducing or optimizing the capital expenditure.</p>
          <p>During the first six months of this year, the program resulted in a free operating cash flow of 699 million and that is coming from &#x20AC;383 million in the same period last year. So that is an increase of 83%, that has been achieved by lower investments in working capital, obviously, in the first half of the year. Normally, we invest in working capital going into the season but these investments were 196 million lower. And we reduced CapEx; same period last year was 345; this year, it's 213. So considerably lower. Working capital as a percentage of revenue decreased from main working capital, so really linked to the business as percentage of revenue decreased from 8.7% to 7.5%.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we expect CapEx level to be at 600 million for the existing company or the company without the FEMSA businesses; 200 million for the FEMSA businesses; and as you will note, the 600 is below the guidance we gave you half-year ago. And for the full year, we are absolutely determined to get to a cash conversion above the 100% despite the fact that we had a very high cash conversion last year, 147% which obviously impacts this year that we will go for a level above 100%.</p>
          <p>And let me summarize you where we stand and the progress we have made. As such, we delivered strong profit growth with 17% organic net profit growth. The Heineken brand grew again 4%, outperforming the overall portfolio and the beer market at large. A strong volume growth in the developing market, Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and that was partly offsetting the weakness, which we have in the mature markets, Europe and USA. TCM delivered the 104 million, bringing the total program now to 259. Free operating cash flow improved substantially with 83% and the performances of the businesses, which we bought three years ago and where we have a strong focus to bring them to the average level of the Group, they made pretty good progress and certainly the UK was an excellent example of that.</p>
          <p>And with the beer businesses of FEMSA, we have expanded our footprint further. We have rebalanced again the balance between mature and developing markets. The integration is on track. The company is in good shape and everything what we see there gives us confidence that it will deliver on the expectations we have when we went in to that. And Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois gave you the outlook for the year and we expect an organic net profit growth of at least low single digit. And that single &#x2013; double, sorry &#x2013; I saw somebody reacting &#x2013; at least low double digit.</p>
          <p>That is what I wanted to share with you. Before we go into Q&amp;A, you get another commercial. It's a commercial out of the USA. It's one of the commercials of the new -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. The floor is open for your questions and there will be also from the webcast and when you have from the webcast, please raise your hand so that I can &#x2013; yeah. And Trevor?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions, please. First one, Nigeria, last year, it seems as if you are losing a lot of market share to hop in Nigeria and so the Annual Report seems that market share dropped in '09, all right, is share stabilized the growth coming through many economically driven or is it a share impacting there as well and the volume trends in Nigeria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have it as &#x2013; yeah, a slight share erosion last year in Nigeria due to a regained momentum in activities from our competitors of Diageo, that is true. And yeah, on the other hand, we were quite short of capacity, so we have been at the same time investing in capacity. So there is always a little bit trade off. And I think we are back on track to the morale and the intention is always to gain share for certainly in such a country but that we would quote as a temporary weakness rather than a structural one, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question relating to barley, remember because last year, you hedged pretty early; this year, I assume you probably have hedged early again. Does that mean that you are still expecting year-on-year savings to continue through into early 2011 and then you'll see what happens after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this year, I think it would be unwise to think we will do further savings. So, crop '09 used in '10 as we speak was of the higher quality and the lower prices as it was the year before. Going forward, I think we will be facing versus a slight, but it is &#x2013; it's nothing to be deemed as catastrophic, I would say, going forward. We have, of course, covered already quite a bit of our needs and covered, I mean, also by setting the price.</p>
          <p>We see the market rather nervous although it came a bit down over the last few days. We use malted barley and it is produced by and large in Western Europe. Crops in Western Europe were good in southern part France, Italy, Spain, France. We are not harvesting in Sweden, in the northern parts of Europe. Denmark, Sweden, and the northern part of England and Scotland.</p>
          <p>So this is coming out of now. As we speak, we don't see a reason to have a kind of a spike that we had in 2007 and 2008. So it's not going to be in the same order of magnitude at all.</p>
          <p>That having said, the situation will be tense around Russian market because there might be physical shortages over there, but we expect them to be compensated by the rest of Europe because the crop &#x2013; the previous crop left a fair amount of excess, anyhow. So we don't see reasons to kind of expect a big, major spike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question. Perhaps one more for Ren&#xE9;. Ren&#xE9;, another very strong half in TCM. I appreciate you are not going to give us a target, but how long do you think that momentum can continue? Is it continuing at this level for the next year or it starts to slowdown in the next half? Or broadly...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we always have said, you will never stop working on the cost and you will never stop driving further efficiencies in the company. Certainly in Europe, as long as there is no volume growth, that will help you to do that in a much more forceful way.</p>
          <p>And we are not going to play the game again &#x2013; what will be the level of the savings going forward. We have been always very clear. We update you half year by half year. I think we didn't disappoint you so far. And let's keep on growing.</p>

          <p>Where do we give the question to? I'm sorry that you keep on raising the hands, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, three questions as well, I'm afraid, please.</p>
          <p>First, on pricing, I thought the statement read quite cautiously talking about modest increases in the second half, really only driven by increases that have been put through in H1. Just wanted to know whether I've read that correctly?</p>
          <p>Second, on input cost, I just wondered to what extent the fall in input costs on a per hectaliter basis was driven by the TCM savings or whether there was an underlying decrease as well?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on CapEx, as you said, the guidance you've given for this year is lower than it was before. I just wonder whether you thought that low level was sustainable going into 2011. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first of all, on the price, normally, you increase your prices once a year.</p>
          <p>So by comparison, the second half is a bit like you have ceded in the first half of the year, and there is no reason that you can say we put something specific in the second year. Also in the US, but there is obviously a big market. We have still not planned for a price increase, knowing that Corona was not following last time. So what you get in the second half of the year is a bit what you got in the first half.</p>
          <p>And on the input cost, you can see the decline like-for-like. That's obviously, on one hand, driven by the volume, but it's also driven by the slightly lower cost.</p>
          <p>And then there are two other effects. One is let losses, et cetera, following the TCM program and our TPM in the breweries. But on the other hand, you see an upgrade of quite a number of packagings, and we go to more expensive packagings. So these things balance each other out.</p>
          <p>And then the CapEx, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the CapEx &#x2013; we deem it the normal level. One has to see that we don't have &#x2013; let's put it that way. The growth pattern in Central Eastern Europe is, of course, not what it used to be. So you also have investments, which are put off.</p>
          <p>So it's not that to 600 from &#x2013; from 800 to 600 million on our existing business. That is an insight going forward. But that is not saying we're going to cut, cut, cut, and that we end up having an unsustainable asset base in our business. That is not our philosophy at all. Has never been at Heineken the case. And I'm surrounded by too many engineers. They would absolutely prevent me to do that, so -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A clarification question quickly on the TCM number that you quoted, the 259. That's a benefit to margin rather than an annualized cost saving figure. So the 104 that came out in the first half you talked about, that was the benefit in terms of profit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. These are not annualized figures. It's just what you get in your figures, and you work from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As I just clarify, thinking about second half, we've still got the full-year effect from first half cost savings, plus any other cost saving detail -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like we had in the first half, the effect of last second half &#x2013; or this second half of last year. And you get always, in all these programs, half-year effect of that. And you build on top, and that is going on into the next period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then your ongoing cost of debt or interest charge. You mentioned there was 17 million in there from FEMSA. If we take the net effect in the second half, it looks like you should be able to fund this business with less than 500 million of interest outflow.</p>
          <p>It looks as if recent bond issuances were a lot lower. I mean is 6% a sustainable figure in that sort of outflow or should we expect actually an improving cost of debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. A big part &#x2013; at least for the coming year &#x2013; of the rates are fixed. So that 6% is what you have to take at the moment. We pay parts and you'll refinance it, you can benefit further from lower levels. And certainly, the last one we did was at a much lower level.</p>
          <p>The figures we have given, as well, for FEMSA, as for the own business, is what you have to take into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But outside of an extra, say, &#x20AC;30 million of FEMSA interest on the first half, there is nothing in the second half that we should be aware of that would unnaturally increase your interest charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, I wonder if you could give us a feel. You mentioned the volume impact from Russia in the division. Whether you would be able to give us a feel of what sort of EBIT impact that volume drop-off had on your Central and Eastern European business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously you don't lose that volume without an impact in EBIT. On the other hand, the fact that we increased the prices and put the excise in it protected a part of the EBIT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But indeed -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we did it too aggressively, so we lost share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with share and volume, obviously we lost -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we don't give these individual country numbers, as you know and we're not going to start to do that today.</p>
          <p>But it would be fair to say that, as I said, we were optimistic &#x2013; too optimistic in the rate that which we could recover. So of course we have to recede also on EBIT side.</p>
          <p>And of course, that receding EBIT come out of Russia has had the major impact on the results of the region that is true. And so the rest of the region is not as dramatic as it looks like. That is I think the guidance you look for. But I will refrain to give the exact numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually like we have written, apart from Russia and Greece, all other companies increased or maintain profitability fully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you used the expression too optimistic or too aggressive that. Does that mean that you will look to maybe roll back some of the price increase, or have you foregone next year's price increase, do you think?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have applied the excise from day one in our pricing, where competition did it right as a face and that has cost us quite some volume.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have a question from Paul Hofman from Chevreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, Paul Hofman, Chevreux. A question on marketing expenses. You said it declined by 80 basis points to 12.5% on a like-for-like base. And I recall that in February, you said, yeah, we will return to the left for the full-year around 11.7%. Does it now mean that you turned a bit more aggressive in that area. That you expect as a percentage of sales, a higher marketing expense, as you said it was the case in 2008?</p>
          <p>And second question and a final question to get a clear on input costs per hectoliter was down around 2%, I estimate. You said you don't expect anymore savings coming from the area, but do you still expect that tailwind in the second half or is it now really over? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the marketing sales, we increased 80 or 70 basis points to 12.5.</p>
          <p>You see that in the first half of the year, we always spend relatively more as a percentage of revenue than in the second half. And that is because you want to spend up-front for the season, and not after the season. Certainly with the World Cup, that is true this year again, so you will see in this second half year, that the overall marketing spend as a percentage of revenue for the year will be below the 12.5%. You can take the increase of around 70 basis point as a good guidance for the whole year and that is in fact returning to more or less historical levels.</p>
          <p>Your question on the input cost was difficult to understand, but I think you were asking if the effect of lower input cost in the second half would be the same as the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. I mean you saw a decline of course, and you said you don't expect any more savings, but does it mean 2011? Or does it already mean in the second half, it will be rather a flat picture versus the second half of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have yearly contract, so the benefits we had in the first half of the year will replicate itself in the second half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And you've given us a lot of information on FEMSA, both today and last week, but if you look on Page 18, we seem to have a business that is growing exactly in line basically with its revenues. I'm perhaps surprised that there isn't any operating leverage, particularly after that strong pricing. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is, is there any integration benefit at all in two months that you've booked this time?</p>
          <p>And the third question, if you go back to FEMSA's reporting for Q1, and I know you can't look at the financial numbers, but I think they reported Q1 volumes minus-6. You are now reporting H1 volumes plus-3. That's a really dramatic turnaround in Q2. Is that a real number, or am I comparing apples and pears here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a real number. Q2 was better for the whole market, but we also increased slightly in market share. It's very short-term. Don't think, hey, now Heineken is there on the wheel that that make that changes &#x2013; that is what the company &#x2013;</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one was weak because of the &#x2013; it was a hefty price increase because you had a net price increase of the brewery plus on top an excise duty. So the whole market receded quite heftily in January, February. Still a bit in March. And then it started to restore.</p>
          <p>That's the pattern. So you have quarter one, quarter two quite, a huge swing indeed. So that has to do with the price increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if, on Slide 18, if you have given us the green bars for last year, we'd see much more dramatic movements is what we are saying. Probably a little -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the two months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, first of all, we don't give it, but we have not restated all their accounts on a monthly basis. So that is very difficult to see.</p>
          <p>You have differences between the years. Obviously, last year, the swine flu. This year, World Cup. All kinds of things are playing in between it. But yes, you are right, if you say May and June were two good months. I fully agree with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just the final thought there. Presumably very little benefit from integration cost benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So we have spent the time to get the systems aligned, to get the people motivated, to validate what we see. It is now &#x2013; or about what we saw would be in it. The synergy plan. But more importantly, also, the commercial few going forward. That is all handed over to operational management. And you will see, going forward that that gradually comes into the figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is two pieces of integration, but they are minor in the costs. And that is the integration of Heineken Mexico, which was our import organization, but frankly, it's negligible in terms of profit. And then the integration of the US operations &#x2013; the export CCM and Heineken import there.</p>
          <p>But again, in terms of cost, it is operational integration but not a cost saving. But it is now &#x2013; it's &#x2013; we have identified all the cost savings during due diligence, and we have been reviewing and confirming them. And the major part of the value creation of the deal sits, of course, in top line creation, i.e. growing market share, growing market, introducing and growing the Heineken brand in these countries. And growing the Mexican portfolio with a full margin in the United States. And of course for us a much bigger motivation. Now that we own the whole value chain, it is also for our people in the US much more easy to put the right efforts behind the winning horses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'd just like to know in Russia, the pricing decision made there, where was that made? Was that made &#x2013; that's a massive decision, was it made locally, was it made at the same time in the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, look that Nico I won't comment. How we run our company is entirely up to us. I'm not going to try to &#x2013; that would be a wrong signal for us. Sorry. I won't comment on that one.</p>
          <p>I mean, I take, as a company, the responsibility of saying we made a judgment error here. Who made the judgment error is nothing that I have to share with you. And that's agreeable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you share broadly &#x2013; not at all how the company is run &#x2013; at what level can management make pricing decisions in Western Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing decisions are much more delegated.</p>
          <p>This is not an answer to your question. In general, we operate in 70 markets. Well, actually, if you include the Heineken brand and associated operations &#x2013; import, what have you &#x2013; we sell Heineken in 170 countries. But we operate 72 seasonable operations with full portfolios. So pricing decisions are made locally, by and large &#x2013; by and large &#x2013; are made locally.</p>
          <p>In some cases, there are &#x2013; well, on regional level, there are always checks and balances in how decisions are made about pricing, obviously. But it is much more the result of a competitive situation, which is locally managed and with a broad portfolio of local brands in any given country.</p>
          <p>So typically, pricing decisions are, rather, delegated to markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Then I just like to understand on Northwestern Europe, the &#x2013; what was the pricing impact there? You did explain that there is obviously a wholesale impact on the difference between volumes down 2.5 and revenues down 3.9. Was price points in general up across the markets?</p>

          <p>Western Europe, UK, yes. Netherlands, yes. France, yes. Spain, not. It's a bit a mixed &#x2013; mixed bag, but it is limited and it's not what we had in 2009.</p>
          <p>If you look at gross profit margins, combined, the slight increase with the lower input cost, we have improved gross profit margins.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the same question in Eastern Europe, where there is about a 5% difference, if you include Russia. How should we think about the price points there? Also broadly 60%, 70% of inflation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have that &#x2013; obviously, because you have inflation, it's much easier to adjust your prices. You also have less concentrated trade in most of these markets. So it is easier to get your prices through. And it is much more competitive game to say can we allow it vis-&#xE0;-vis our competitors, where in Western Europe, it's much more against...</p>

          <p>Your customers and how &#x2013; and the issue we had in the UK and we had last year in Italy &#x2013; that is a different dynamic than what you would have, for instance, in Central Eastern Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a final question, if I may. There is a &#x2013; someone is challenging the structure of the market in Mexico. I think one of your competitors. What's the status of that? And someone saying there is anti-competitive behavior in Mexico, et cetera. Can you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are obviously aware of that. We have not yet got any request for information, but obviously when it comes, we take it very seriously, and we will cooperate.</p>
          <p>We had an extensive review in &#x2013; or FEMSA has an extensive review on the same issue in 2004, I think. And everything was clear. They even came to the conclusion that the structure enhanced competition instead of linked it. And if you see the amount of money which is involved there, it is very much a competitive fight.</p>
          <p>But so we are awaiting what exactly the allegations are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, first one also on the pricing. If I look at the difference between your organic volume growth and organic sales growth, first versus second quarter, it seems that the price and mix elements come down from about 3 to 1. Is that a fair reflection of the real pricing in your beer business, or is something strange going on there with geography or the wholesale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, nothing strange is going on. I think one has to realize that over the last &#x2013; '07-'08, we were confronted with a big price hike, remember, on the input costs. So that has forced us to take really price.</p>
          <p>Now, we have taken the view also to do some gross margin restoration, which we did. We are still of the view that in a number of markets and the UK is perhaps the one the most in need to do that. But of course, with lower input cost this year, you don't have a lot of reasons to go and negotiate and what have you. And on the backdrop of the prices, where purchasing power is given out with a little bit more caution, there is less room competitively to take price.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a very sound and normal and logic market dynamic. But we'll keep on going for pricing because there is still inflation going on in parts of our businesses, and there we apply pricing. But in Europe, absolutely, there is less pricing taken than before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just secondly, on the UK, you mentioned the fact that you've been not able to take part in some of the promotions that you normally would have done in each zone for the summer. To what extent has that hampered you communicating &#x2013; doing to the brands what you would have wanted to do in the UK? And how, if it did, do you get around having to play along with what competition in the trade wants to do next year, if you really want to make progress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These two things are a bit disconnected from each other.</p>
          <p>The programs you run on your brands &#x2013; of course, for part, they are also promotional brands with your clients. But the above the line communication is totally &#x2013; entirely your decision.</p>
          <p>I would say that that is a game that you play on the long term to give your brand the best image. And we are about in the UK too in a program to improve on the number of our key brands where we think that we could do a better job.</p>
          <p>It's a little bit &#x2013; the work we do on Foster's is huge at the moment &#x2013; to rejuvenate and revitalize the Foster's brand, as opposed to John Smith, where we think that the job is well done, very consistent, and is also &#x2013; has yielded and continues to yield the leadership in the Ale segment. Even if that segment is declining, making share there.</p>
          <p>So that is what we do. The customer has the view of saying, okay, you have to fight for having your margins. We have done that once more in Italy with Scope last year. We lost quite a bit of share. We lost a lot of promotional slots. And then in the second half, we went back, but we kept the margins going forward.</p>
          <p>And so that is the view that we have taken in the UK. It's worthwhile having a fight because the margins in this industry are structurally very low, and you have to be able to sacrifice some short-term volume for the sake of a better long-term business model. That's what we do in the UK.</p>
          <p>And then you confront that with the Russian situation. There is where our brands are just too weak to sustain that thing and that is exactly where &#x2013; in one case it works well, in the other case, well, we have to admit it didn't work, right. But in the UK we are pretty confident that the loss of share of this first half is not in the off-trade because we didn't lose in the on-trade, is nonstructural. We take that risk. It's a calculated risk and we think it's good for our business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three questions, if I may. First is about &#x2013; again about Russia, about the SKU reduction, is that finished or is that still continuing and what is the timeframe that you expect that is still needed to continue with it?</p>
          <p>Second question is about the market share. You now talk about a double-digit increase in volumes in South Africa. Can you update us about the market share increase in that country?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on the general conditions. You talk about Russia a gradual improvement; UK, probably you come back in the promotions; Nigeria, you are back. Is it strange to assume that the volume trends might be globally a bit better for you in second half than in first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question about Russia we have been embarking already in &#x2013; early in 2009 in a second round of portfolio restructuring of our Russian business taking the view of taking even a sort of more limited number of brands behind which we would continue to invest that exercise has been done and so they are &#x2013; that's done. We are not going to take one step further. It is now to repair the damage which has been done by too hefty price increases in Russia. But the SKU rationalization exercise has been done in Russia and completed and we stick to what we have.</p>
          <p>Now obviously SKUs are a dynamic thing. You launch one and &#x2013; Russia is a very dynamic market, but it's about core brands that you support, so that is done and we will continue and change supporting these brands.</p>

          <p>Market share in South Africa, indeed we grew double digits, high double digits in markets which was slightly growing as far as I know, but that means that we &#x2013; again in the first half of the year we took market share -</p>

          <p>That was after Norman Adami said he want to go to 90%, probably, I don't know. It's a game as you see. Then volume developments going forward, that is a bit a mixed bag. As we've said, we remain pretty cautious in Europe and the USA, are optimistic in the other markets. Certainly in Africa we see continued growth where we have a little bit of a slow first quarter, but the second quarter was good and we could recon or think that we will continue on that higher pace. Asia will continue to grow as is Latin America. A number of the Latin American markets, for instance Brazil, will not continue to grow at that level because there was a huge impact of the World Cup over there, but the market is positive and growing and we will benefit from that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and hi, it's Andrea Pistacchi from Citigroup. Two things on wholesale please, with the sharp decline in on-trade that we've been seeing and now the disposal in the UK, first could you update us on the size of your wholesale business in Western Europe with maybe an approximate revenue figure? And the second thing, in the light of the disposal in the UK and the continued decline in on-trade, how strategic is your content for European wholesale business and what &#x2013; so what is different from the UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will leave the revenue to Ren&#xE9; because otherwise I will be talking that I couldn't have said it, but it's a big business obviously. It has grown in several markets in Europe for historical reasons in the past and it has served to build our market share in the on-trade in countries like Italy, in countries like France, Switzerland, Ireland, The Netherlands obviously, Austria, and a number of countries in Eastern Europe but less important. It is essentially a Western European business.</p>
          <p>The on-trade market has been affected disproportionately high. That means that our wholesale has been kind of decreasing together with the on-trade market, if you will. Now in the wholesale portfolio, we also carry a number of beers which are not ours, specialty beers that kind of thing, but also coke, water, cognacs, wines whatever drinks, and we do service of course for them. So and this business has been disproportionately hit by the downturn of the prices which affects us. And so the margins have been also disproportionately hit in that business. Why is that because the essential &#x2013; I mean, you have very low capital investments, but you have high fixed cost rate because of personnel that is the thing.</p>
          <p>Now we have over the years variablized a lot of that personnel, but you stay essentially with a human capital and the region of footprint. So, we have been working for quite a number of years restructuring country-by-country all these &#x2013; i.e., reducing the capacities of these wholesale organization and even with a view to the future of even decreasing capacity more than we should but there is a limit to that. I mean, you have to serve your client, otherwise it doesn't work.</p>
          <p>Now so the effect has been high, but also the attention that we give to repair programs in the company and turnaround programs on these wholesaling is high. We have also created a special division on the Western European bases to steer &#x2013; with a lot more benchmarking between the countries to steer that division.</p>
          <p>And so we are en route to restore profitability, but we work against really very hard winds now. The ones in the UK, we disinvested because Waverley was selling essentially spirits and regional ales and very, very few of our own products. So the reason to keep that wholesale operation was strategically not of importance for us because we keep the wholesale to make profits, to be really competitive in the marketplace with our service and product portfolio but in addition it helps strategically to serve our market share construction with our own beers and serving for as an entry point into the outlets to build our brands. That is &#x2013; and if these conditions are not reunited wholesale would not be strategic anymore.</p>
          <p>So we conduct, if you will, a strategic review from time to time on the strategic importance of our wholesale. Now, Waverley fell off the lists pretty quickly, it was a no-brainer, that all the others are strategic because they contribute to that vision in Europe. And there is a lot of work to do into reorganizing the capacity, but I must say this is going on track, but for the moment if you would compare the numbers we don't publish that segmentation, but you would look at the numbers there is more &#x2013; much more margin erosion there than there is in our beer business, but that you can restore by working on the capacities.</p>
          <p>And in addition, to finish, what we also do, it's structural changes which are allowed by modern technology, this business grew historically on the regional basis.</p>
          <p>The secret of a good wholesaling is to have an impeccable service to a region and using as its commercial tool to increase your market share in a region, it's a very regional thing. Now having that across regions in the country, you can centralize back office functions, client contacts and administration function and that sort of things.</p>
          <p>So with modern technology now, we are country-by-country have done the large re-organization programs for efficiency. We have done that in Netherlands, we have done it in France, we are busy doing it in Italy, we have done it Switzerland, we have done it in the Ireland to name that a few. That is how we go about. So, in short, it's another pressure, we're working on that because it's linked to the on-trade. We restored the margins and &#x2013; by cutting over capacity. And we work on efficiency but it has to serve the strategic goal of increasing our market share where we operate. And you gave a number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jason Derise, UBS. I'd like to ask three questions. First question, on your A&amp;P spend, could you talk about where regionally the bulk of that is going to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the increase obviously if you look at it regionally it's a bit everywhere, but within regions you'll see focus areas on Western Europe. We had increases in the UK, and then Spain. If you look at Central and Eastern Europe we had increases in Russia. So that says something that despite the volume decline, we increased our marketing spend behind the strategic brands in Romania and in Africa in Nigeria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in those markets, obviously you're investing for the long term with this A&amp;P spend, but are you seeing any positive signs any of the brand scores improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, you do it with a reason, you &#x2013; and manage it. The reasons why we do it in the UK, because we believe it's extremely important that we reinforce the brands to make it feasible that you can get better value out of the market and there, you see positive signs. The fact that we did it in Spain is that we &#x2013; by increasing our prices last year where competition was not following, we lost some market share and there also you see in terms of market share that we resettled the situations. So there, it is working, but ultimately these investments you should not see half-year by half-year. It is clearly something which you have to see on the longer term. It's important how much you spend but it is even more important how you spend the money and there is a lot of efforts to get the efficiency of your marketing spend better and that is to make sure that you spend it behind the right brands and that you spend it in the right way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, the last question on the Heineken brand, obviously, we have the H1 numbers in front of us, but if I remember correctly, it sounds &#x2013; it seems like the Q1 Heineken brand performance was stronger than it was in Q2, so any reason for the slowdown in the Heineken brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a bit &#x2013; therefore, we don't like Q1 figures because it's such a small season. So there are a lot of incidental things which can help you or go against you.</p>
          <p>I think overall, you see that the Heineken brand is doing well. It is doing well in all regions better than the overall portfolio with a number of star performers in the developing markets whereby you see that the brand has enormous traction and gains consumer franchise. And that makes us also us pretty positive on what we can do, for instance, in Mexico or Brazil with the brand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two questions. The first one is on CapEx, how would you quantify the 200 million mentioned for the FEMSA business for the eight months of this year, would you quantify it as a normal level or perhaps a both normal or below normal? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is technical, based on the current exchange rates is it fair to assume that the ForEx contribution to revenue growth will be a bit more positive in the second half compared with the first half? Those were my two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all the CapEx level of 200 million, it is in line with what it was in 2009. I think the 2009 was 230 for the full year. We'll going forward further asses it. It's for sure that the business in Mexico is surely not an under invested company, but at the same time there is a lot of distribution business involved as well, which takes CapEx. But for the time being I would take this as a good starting point and the exchange rates in the next half is obviously that is in consolidation change and not in ForEx, the benefit we will get out of the Latin American business in Mexico and Brazil. These rates will be good, but that is included in consolidation and not in ForEx. We get more benefit from the US dollar, when you look at the overall hedging rate for this year 1.35 versus 1.43 last year, but last year was very much &#x2013; difference between the first half of the year and the second half of the year. So there, we get a little bit more benefit in the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions please. The first one is on Poland. Can you share with us the underlying trends in the second quarter and then the outlook for the market? And then the second question is on Nigeria. Volumes are returning in the second quarter, but EBIT margin is under pressure given some cost inflation, probably also related to currencies. How do you see that progress, the margin then, in the second half of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Poland, what we said in the second quarter was, that quarter had to do with weather, had to do with the mourning around the death of the President. And we also had some effect of very aggressive price behavior of one of our smaller competitors in that market and &#x2013; but overall and certainly also helped by the Polish zloty, the financial performance of that company was very solid.</p>
          <p>The second question, I couldn't follow. So you have to repeat or I admit you here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the EBIT margin in Nigeria was in the second &#x2013; was in the first half down a bit despite good volumes due to cost pressures. How do you see that progress in the second half of the year?</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Mitch Collet from Goldman Sachs. You mentioned in the slides that the &#x2013; today's CapEx guidance suggests 100 million less than the core group. Could you perhaps give a bit of color on where that's coming from and how that saving is being made? And secondly, I think you implied at the Q1 stage that volumes in Spain were positive and you now seem to be saying they're leveled year-on-year, implying Q2 is a reduction. Is that a trend we should expect to continue in Q3 and 4? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to start with Spain, we think that market has kept the volume remarkably well there despite the economic problems in that country and you'll see it sliding a little bit, but not in a very big way yet.</p>
          <p>But what will happen going forward is to be seen. But it keeps up relatively, relatively well. On the CapEx, it's a little bit across the board. So it's not canceling of one big project or saying, we were planning to build a brewery and when we stopped that project, it is what we call in Dutch the cheese slices are everywhere, it's putting a little bit of pressure and reducing it. But it is not one or two...</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nikolaas Faes from Santander. I would like to understand a bit better what's happened with the UK, in the UK with the Heineken brand. I clearly understand your &#x2013; that you had a lack of promotion opportunities, but I cannot remember that the Heineken brand was particularly vulnerable to that type of activity. So is there anything else going on, especially, as I remember, with the higher distribution capacity that you have now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was actually looking for some strong performance there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very smart question. So &#x2013; really. The on-trade market in the UK was down quite a bit here. It's over &#x2013; the whole market was down 12% over the first half-year, if I'm not mistaken, which is huge. I'm speaking about total market. Now, Heineken brand is over-indexed in the on-trade in the UK. We have positioned it historically and conquering back our position via the on-trade. So one has all &#x2013; it's skewed on-trade. So, first explanation is there you have it for a big part.</p>
          <p>Second part is we have been a little bit bullish or &#x2013; no, another word &#x2013; inappropriate with the quality of our volumes in some outlets. And we want to have it right in the UK. And having it in the right outlets. So there is also a little bit of a voluntary reallocation. So perhaps from a lower base, but a better sustainable growth going forward.</p>
          <p>So there is nothing that we feel uncomfortable with, but we are far away still from where we wanted to be, but we have to have our things in order and rebuilding the equity at the desirable level of equity that we are used to have with Heineken on a premium positioning base is going to take time in the UK because of the history we have with Cold Filtered, which was a 3.5 ABV beer and not really premium positioned in terms of pricing and image.</p>
          <p>So that takes time. We've realized it and that is what that we address and target new generation with. So we grow from a slow base. So there is &#x2013; you have &#x2013; the observation is right. I have part of the explanation, but also the size of challenge going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, three quick questions if I may. To start with the UK as we've been talking about that, what's your market share at the moment? And do you think that will fully recover or bearing in mind that you're obviously not prepared to play the heavy discount game that Scottish &amp; Newcastle was in the past, are we wise to assume that there will be any sort of partial recovery of volumes or market share I should say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our overall market share is between &#x2013; because the figures are obviously not completely fixed, but including cider between 28 and 29%. And in cider, we have, of course &#x2013; and cider is much strong, it's a market share close to 50%, I think it's 48.5% if I am not mistaken. We gained again a bit of market share in cider. In the on-trade beer, we maintained and even slightly grew our market share if I am not mistaken; in the on-trade, we gain and in the off-trade, we lose. But the problem is with that &#x2013; is that the on-trade lost quite a bit as I told you.</p>
          <p>So, volume wise, the UK doesn't look rosy. That's for sure. But on the other hand if you look at the operating profits we make in the UK, we made a really substantial progress and from two accounts. That is, of course, a sustained effort in pricing and that will still last with bits and pieces for years. Investing in key brands, which we continue to do, and the reorganization of the UK footprint as a business. It participates the restructuring of the Globe contract. Closing down two breweries, taking on board the full ownership of the production capacities of cider.</p>
          <p>It's a whole plant that there's load of Waverley TBS. It's quite a big plant, it's a huge &#x2013; I mean, I think it's one of the highest and the biggest restructuring I have seen in my lifetime in the brewery what we have undertaken here. And the speed at which it is done here is absolutely outstanding and remarkable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question is on Central Europe. Have you seen any improvements in trading in that region since the start of the second half?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Because it's not in the press release, so we cannot comment on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On media rates, are you seeing any hardening of those? Or are there any big variations from one region of the world to another? And obviously, I'm assuming the deflation has sort of ended now, but has it hardened it all?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The deflation has ended. In some markets, you see it coming back, again, not a major influence this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just like to clarify something around the outlook. You give the outlook or guidance on net beia of low double digits of first half of 17%. Could you give us indication of the organic growth at the EBIT level or give us an indication of what the impact of the first half &#x2013; sorry, second half versus second half tax basis, so we can get a better feel for the underlying organic growth outlook for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we basically say is that we &#x2013; although you will have some regional shifts, but that we expect the company to perform going forward like we have done in the first half of the year and the tax rates makes that you get this as different percentage on the net profit level because last year the tax rate was, as you can see, relatively low in the second half of the year based on the number of non-recurring elements we got. That has taken us to the outlook. But the main message is we have a good performance in the first half of the year and we are aiming to replicate that in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what I understand you're saying there is that if the operating &#x2013; organic operating growth was 6% in the first half, we should not expect that to accelerate in the second half at similar levels. So, if I reflected that EBIT level, which is the operations, I don't understand the tax either like you commented, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is nothing in the outlook, if you read it, which would indicate either a decrease or an increase of the operational performance. So the caution on the mature markets, the good growth prospects of the developing markets, the relatively slightly higher marketing sales investments, the benefit of the input cost, the pricing going forward. So basically, you have TCM going on. The elements of the business are not changing in basic or in a fundamental way in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear. Would be good to have the guidance at the EBIT level going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; would be nice to have the guidance at the EBIT level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because that's what we look at, just the operations, anyway that's from me. Then moving to 2011, should we expect the tax guidance to move up a little bit as you fully consolidate FEMSA for full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have said the impact of FEMSA is one point on the tax rate. We have explained in the call with the restatement of the FEMSA figures that the tax rate for the FEMSA business will be around 34%, which is higher than the nominal tax rate, but there are number of elements which are not tax deductible in that context. It is higher also than what FEMSA has and that had to do is that tax benefits, which they took year-by-year, we have taken as a tax asset in the opening balance and therefore you get a step-up in the reported tax rate. On a cash basis, obviously it's not making any difference.</p>

          <p>And finally, Jean, your peers are indicating that raw material input cost in aggregate, not only barley, in 2011 should be flat or thereabout. You also fairly progressed in terms of your outlook for 2011. Could you confirm that you'll face a similar situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot confirm that. We will give the guidance in February. As you say, there are many more elements than just barley; there is energy cost, which influence bottle prices; there is aluminum, et cetera. So we are not going to comment on that now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're fairly well progressed in terms of your forward buying, et cetera, across all raw materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the normal progress is progressing. What I said earlier is that on the barley prices, it is better track but it's not going to be an enormous hike, as the current market situation would suggest. Nor there is a physical reason for doing so in the malted barley market and this is still a big, big enforcement.</p>
          <p>As Ren&#xE9; said, the energy prices are never totally predictable. There also you hedge part of it, but, no, I never think so. We're not going to give you an absolute guarantee that it's going to stay flat, that's what we're basically saying, without expecting big hikes.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Adam Spielman from Citigroup. It's a question about Western Europe and the outlook. In this period you just reported, your profit has gone up little over &#x20AC;20 million, in absolute euros. But you've got cost savings from the TCM program of about &#x2013; of a bit over &#x20AC;50 million. Does that mean to say that without the cost savings, profit would have gone down? And that causes me to ask two questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the observation that without the TCM program, the margin would have declined, which I find slightly strange as you said the main weakness in Europe or a lot of weakness was to do with the wholesalers with sort of low margins, and as I would have thought, as a proportion of your business, which is the core brewing, which is higher margin got bigger as your margins would have increased. So that's the question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, am I right to understand that as we think about Western Europe going forward, as far as one can see, we should expect sort of fundamental weakness offset by ongoing cost savings. And the sort of passion you've produced in the first half is something that we can expect to see really while the economy remains as it is, which is pretty weak in Western Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way you have to look at Europe is, for sure, cost reductions is an integral part of managing that region. So it's not you have here the cost saving and there you have the European business. No, it's part of doing that business, right-sizing your infrastructure to the realities of the market. At the same time, we should realize that Europe is a very strong consumer market. It's a very rich market. You see that we make lot of money, we make a very strong cash flow out of Europe and we need to invest in that market to take bigger share of a slightly shrinking pie.</p>
          <p>And in the midst of the crisis, we have been quite reluctant to put in many new initiatives, new innovations, new brands, et cetera. But going forward, in the European market, you will not only rely on cost savings, now you will further rely likely that in the past before the crisis in getting more value out of the market, increasing your market share, be innovative, get more premium products in the market and that's the way forward for Europe. Absolutely, it's not only a cost-saving exercise, but cost savings is part of the game in Western Europe. Corner, yeah.</p>
          <p>So, you really want to have the last question, okay. No, sure, no, I mean, it's not going fair.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You've got a sparkling new brewery in South Africa with 3 million hectoliters. You're raising that to 4.5 million hectoliters. What are you doing to absorb the fixed costs of production that South African production in Europe? Is that those beer hectoliters were produced in Europe? Isn't that weighing on your European margins this particular half-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair questions. To a certain extent, yes, but not really very material. When we took back our brands in South African production of &#x2013; for Amstel, we have been allocating that to three breweries in Europe, France, Italy and Netherlands. We have been looking where we had the overcapacity. And we have meant &#x2013; in terms of technical overcapacity, and we have meant that by flexible labor contracts.</p>
          <p>So what costs you money is manned capacity. Unmanned capacity is just a price depreciation of stainless steel. So that's how we built the temporary business model on a kind of very calculated marginal base across Europe.</p>
          <p>So, the effect, yes, you lose, of course, on the one side; you gain more on the other side, but you lose slightly on the depreciations part, which is not anymore supported by volume in Western Europe. But frankly, this is not a lot, and we have been dismantling that quite well. And then, it comes back to Western Europe. We have to go with the volumes.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; the name of the game, and I've said that many times, it's certainly production capacity. You make 100, you think that the market is going to be, let's say, 80 &#x2013; and this is just an example, it's going to be 80 in ten years time. Make sure that you have dismantled your capacity to 80 in five years time and then you will have a gap to fill, but you're going to fill that up with increased productivity anyhow because we see for 18 years in a row that we'll make productivity progresses in our supply chain still. That's the good news, right.</p>
          <p>So we take that view of having a pro-active capacity dismantling, if you will, and it goes also together with the lifecycles of the investments and hence we can do that and we took that. And one has to take the view on the European market to complement what Ren&#xE9; said. The brutal truth is that we do not have a demographic growth in the continent. And the baby boomers are graying, right. So they are retiring from consumption certainly and perhaps from life altogether. So the -</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Be a bit optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid that it is the bare reality of it today. But the thing is that &#x2013; and of course, we &#x2013; all fast-moving consumer goods can make these calculations. We are a proximity business essentially. So we produce in the neighborhood where we sell, right. So we have to re-tailor our capacities for the new demographic realities in this continent. That does not mean &#x2013; it's a hard job, but that does not mean that there is no business.</p>
          <p>To Ren&#xE9;'s point, there is a vibrant consumer market here and they will continue to drink beer. We invest in brands, which have a disproportional contribution to value, not in the least place, the Heineken brand, but also new products. Think about cider. We have close to 50% of market here in the UK, good margins, growing addressing a part of the drinking population, which is not touching that much beer.</p>
          <p>We do that also on the European continent. That's going to cater for growth. It's not going to happen overnight. Because you don't benefit like in India or Brazil that the magic equation, the so simple equation of saying population growth times economic growth times economic or political stability and that's the easy recipe for growth.</p>
          <p>Game is a bit more complicated, but still high prices, high margins, fantastic cash flows, which also served our company to finance our extension in the emerging markets. And so I would really make a plea, not seeing Europe as a lost case for our business, that's for sure. And have a little bit look through the economic downturn, take the demographics into account, their effect, but we still have a very healthy business with very good return on invested capital in Europe.</p>
