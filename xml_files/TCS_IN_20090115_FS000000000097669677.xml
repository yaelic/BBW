        <plist>
          <p>Ram, Maha, and Chandra will each give you a brief overview of the company's performance followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, TCS does not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Let me remind you that this conference call, which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. These risks are outlined in the second slide of our results presentation, which is uploaded on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. 2009 has started much along the lines of how 2008 ended. The global economic scenario has further deteriorated since we last met in October of 2008. In such times, TCS performance in quarter three has been disciplined and satisfactory. To compare on a year-on-year basis, we have shown a robust performance in terms of growth. The revenues at 7,277 crores or $1.483 billion has shown a growth of 24.10% in rupee terms. The operational strength of the company has resulted in good operational performance with operating profits at 1,802 crores, up 31.44% over last year.</p>
          <p>The growth in net profits to 1,352 crores has been muted because of non-operational factors like rupee truancy and the hedging. Our revenue mix of multiple currencies, which Maha would cover, is also to be understood in the overall context. When I come to quarter-on-quarter on a sequential basis, our performance has been good. Revenues for the quarter at 7,277 crores or $1.483 billion is the growth of 4.65% in rupee terms, and 1.23% in terms of constant currency terms. The net profits at 1,352 crores is a growth of 7.21% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on sustaining long-term growth, balancing growth across markets and verticals, improving the productivity of all our resources and ensuring a sustainable margin scenario. I mean, the situation in such uncertain times for all of us is to best look at focusing on improving our own operational efficiencies, while ensuring that we continue to focus on our customers' requirements, and then help them through these difficult times, and also pursue select engagements, which has resulted in adding 41 new clients in quarter three.</p>
          <p>Our continuous drive to increase our operational efficiencies is yielding. This will continue to be our focus area and some of the very specific operational highlights have been improving in operating margin by 53 basis points through moving more work offshore, increase productivity, exchange gains and great project execution. The offshore mix per se has improved by 106 basis points. We also reduced our overall debtor days outstanding by nine days in quarter three.</p>
          <p>In a tough market, TCS continues to play -- display strong pricing discipline and this is reflected in our numbers. Pricing has been stable, despite these pressures. We completed during this quarter the acquisition of Citi's captive BPO unit, and this unit is being integrated into TCS, and the revenues will start flowing into TCS from quarter four onwards.</p>
          <p>The domain-led banking process expertise gives us the unique strategic advantage going forward. It'll also allow us to offer banks -- all the banks and outsourcing solution for the core operations and also this core domain intensive BPO. We will have the opportunity to allow our clients to derive much more value from the technology spends, in addition to that, IT services spends.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, new opportunities are emerging slowly in areas like integration activity as a result of the mergers and acquisitions, as well as compliance and regulatory requirements, as well as optimization of technology and operations as customers look to reduce costs and drive back to profitability. We remain on track to achieve our hiring target for the FY '09, which is in excess of 30,000. Our attrition has dropped to 11.9%, and we will continue to focus on our employees and capability building.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Chandra to talk about the demand and provide a perspective on operations, I'd like to talk about corporate governance, which has become a frontburner issue of late for all of us and all of you. TCS is rooted in strong fundamentals where our approach is that of institutional building and value creation for our customers and other stakeholders. TCS has always been a role model by adopting the highest level of corporate governance, practices highlighted by the company's transparency, ethics and integrity, value that flow from the Tata Group's code of conduct.</p>
          <p>While we can provide the details, I would like to reiterate that TCS does not believe in fulfilling the requirements of class 49 of the listing agreement as a mere box ticking exercise. We consider the quality of our Directors to be more important than merely the fact that they are independent.</p>
          <p>And speaking about transparency and governance, this is one more aspect that I'd like to highlight. TCS has been paying dividends every quarter since it went public in August 2004. The dividend paid in the current quarter makes it 18 consecutive quarters that we have paid the dividends. I know that this practice is greatly appreciated by over 700,000 retail investors, as well as our institutional investors.</p>
          <p>Thank you and over to Chandra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ram. From our operational perspective, I just want to make three or four important points. It has been a tough environment, what started as a slowdown in the BFS sector has really moved on to other sectors, especially manufacturing, high-tech and telecom. Given that, our focus has been execution rigor and pricing discipline, we believe these two are extremely critical, so that we remain efficient and very disciplined to take advantage whenever the opportunities ramp up.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, we have achieved an offshore movement of 106 basis points and achieved a good volume growth of 2.42% and then maintained our pricing. Second, from a deal perspective, it has been a good quarter. We signed up six large deals at least of which two of them came in the retail sector, one in the BFS sector, one in the utility sector, and one in high-tech, and pharma. Out of these deals, one is more than $100 million value, and the other one is more than $250 million in value, and we expect the ramp up to start sometime in the Q4. In terms of the sectors, where we see opportunities, we see the retail, media, pharma, and utility sectors doing better than BFS and manufacturing and high-tech sectors.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I would like to say that we have a very healthy deal pipeline and we just need to make sure that the closures are happening. And with regard to client budgets, it's still company-specific. There are clients who have worked their budgets out and then have had discussion with us in terms of what the outlook is for 2009 and what projects we are going to do. And there are clients who still are uncertain about what programs they will do. So we are having to manage the business extremely carefully and that's what we are focused on. The other point is in terms of the constant currency also we showed growth this quarter, a 123 basis-point growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you and over to you Maha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. TCS' performance in the third quarter was focused on all-round improvement in an environment, as Ram said, full of uncertainty and turmoil. In this environment, the best bet is to continue the diversification of revenues, move towards sustainable and efficient cost base, improve the collection process, be prudent in cash and currency management and focus on continuing the upward trend. Our operational performance in Q2 has delivered on all these.</p>
          <p>We recorded revenues, as Ram had already said of 7,277 crores equivalent to U.S. dollars 1,000 &#x2013; $ 1.48 billion for the quarter. That's an increase of 4.65% quarter-on-quarter, and 24.12% year-on-year in rupee terms. This has come about through volume increase, a favorable exchange rates and a disciplined approach to maintaining our pricing. Breakdown of revenue growth quarter <mark type="inaudible" /> from between last quarter and this is as follows: Volume, 2.42% increase, pricing has been a drop of 10 basis points, the effort mix, that is movement from onsite to offshore has had a negative effect on revenue to the extent of 1.06%.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange has contributed to 3.39% and therefore the overall figure is 4.65%. That's the revenue increase. The positive effect on the rupee depreciation against the U.S. dollar was diluted by the relative strengthening of the rupee against other currencies, such as pound sterling, euro, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, in which about 33.9% of our revenues are denominated. So while on the total revenue, we got a 5.9% benefit from U.S. dollar appreciation against the rupee, we lost 1.7% as rupee appreciated against British pound sterling and 0.9% against euro.</p>
          <p>Considering all currencies other than U.S. dollar and rupee, our revenues were negatively impacted by 2.5%. Netting the two figures, the incremental revenue in INR as a result of currency movement was 3.4% that is rupees 2.36 billion rupees. However, the negative swing against the U.S. dollar also meant that our revenues when reported in U.S. dollar have come down by 5.8% in this quarter.</p>
          <p>To get a true view of our performance without letting currency volatilities kill the picture, it will be good to talk in terms of constant currency based on the rates of the previous quarter. In constant currency terms, we had a revenue growth of 1.23%. Cost management continues as a long-term sustained program by focusing on each item of cost such as travel, communication, rent, et cetera, we have been able to achieve a reduction in SG&amp;A of 130 basis points. In addition, we continue to shift work offshore, increasing offshore revenues by 1%.</p>
          <p>The margin accretive effect of these profitability levers, lower provisioning for bad and doubtful debts, and a favorable currency movement was diluted by lower productivities from the holiday season. Despite that, our operating margin grew by 54 basis points sequentially to 24.76%. This does not mean that we stop investing in the business for longer-term, selling activities are not curtailed; investments continue to be made globally in people, technology, marketing and branding. So TCS can be prepared for the eventual upturn in market conditions and demand for our services, as they go up.</p>
          <p>In addition to continuing the planned recruitment program, we continued our investment in infrastructure. We brought in 5,139 additional seats in the quarter, resulting in 2.38 billion rupees of capitalization. We also invested 1.06 billion in technology infrastructure and plan to end the year at 14.88 billion in terms of capital expenditure. We made a payment of 25.02 billion towards &#x2013; that is equivalent to 514.81 million towards the purchase of Citigroup Global Services Limited, which has been renamed as TCS e-Serve. This transaction was concluded on 31st December. Therefore, there was no effect on P&amp;L as a result of this acquisition. However, the balance sheet contains the consolidated picture.</p>
          <p>I've talked about the currency movement, our policy of hedging both receivables and revenues have proved to be prudent. We had taken hedges at the beginning of this fiscal to protect our revenues. Since rupee was expected to appreciate during the volatile movement in Q2, we have added to the hedges. Since rupee was in a depreciated state against the U.S. dollar this quarter, we recorded a loss of 2.03 billion in revenue hedging. However, I want to point out that we realized on the U.S. dollar after accounting for these hedging losses. The post hedge realized rate was rupees 46.75, which are higher than the previous quarter's post hedge rate by 11%.</p>
          <p>Our policy of extending the hedging operations to protect receivables in other countries, currencies such as pound sterling, euros, South African rands, Swedish kroner and Australian dollar ensured that we did not suffer major losses. Had we not covered that, we would have lost 2.39 billion rupees if they had been left unhedged. We did not take any additional revenue hedges in this quarter and are secured our position for Q4.</p>
          <p>With the economic environment being difficult, cash is certainly king; we made certain considerable improvement in our receivable picture, bringing it down by nine days, even in respect of accounts, which dissolve their businesses. Our connections has improved considerably. Even after the CGSL acquisition, we have available cash in fund investments of Rs. 21.63 billion. Also during the quarter, we moved a considerable part of our funds to fixed deposits with Indian and foreign banks of proven ratings. The auditors have physically verified the funds deployment position.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to recap, we have held course in very choppy waters and delivered growth. In difficult times like these, our focus has to be on managing risks, being disciplined and delivering profitable margins. We expect to continue on this part of operational efficiencies going forward, as we build a robust company for the future. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you Maha. Rochelle, we can now open the line for questioning.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Shirali. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a couple of quick questions here. First on the Citigroup acquisition. In light have some of the news that's come out on the company in these last couple of days, I wonder if you can give us an update on how you view that acquisition and some of its components and how the overall relationship is doing for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Citigroup relationship is doing overall very well. And if you look at the revenue streams for us so far it has been on the technology side and now it will also be on the BPO side and the news over the last couple of days does not impact us in terms of the revenue flows. So we don't think that has going to have an impact on our revenue flows on the current committed volume of business both on the technology side and on the BPO side. So we expect to meet the planned numbers on the Citigroup side. We have spoken to them not in the last couple of days but over the last quarter several times and that's all I have to report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on the pricing side, pricing came in I'm assuming that it's probably due to currency this quarter but we've heard stuff from competitors that pricing environment is very difficult from the coming both from the competitors and from the present client base. In your internal modeling, what have you put in for pricing going forward? Are you starting to see it more difficult environment and maybe in order of magnitude if you are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the pricing this quarter has been flat I said, more or less, it's a 10 basis point drop on a constant currency basis. So I think, as I said in the opening remarks, we earlier in the quarter decided that we have to be very, very disciplined on the pricing not that we were not before but we thought that we got to be more focused and if it needed all the rigor. That's what we have executed and we think that we need to maintain that kind of a rigor on managing and maintaining the pricing. Given the market environment, I must tell you that the pricing pressure is continuing and it's going to be there. So it is possible that the pricing may decline but I won't be able to give you a definitive number but all I would say is that we will continue to make our efforts to be very disciplined in the way we qualify the deals and do the pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and when that pricing decline if it does take place will show up next quarter or is there a lag time between it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Possibly there is a lag time. There is a lag time. But having said that &#x2013; having said that normally a year-ago or even six quarters ago, if you had asked, I would have always said that what happens is in this quarter will not impact the next quarter. But the way that things are currently and the number of incidents you have seen in a quarter of 90 days, I think it's very, very, very volatile. So we have to be managing it daily basis, weekly basis, very difficult to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My last question here is just on the hiring environment. Maybe you could talk about how many offers you put out for next year, what you're currently doing on that front and if you've changed any of your hiring plans in the last two or three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as hiring is concerned, in this particular quarter that is the quarter that we've just closed, the growth addition has been 11,773 and we have that takes us as far as this financial year is concerned 30,430 that we've already added, and for the next financial year that is FY '10, the training offers that we have made is 24,800 plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you changed your hiring plans at all in the last three months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In this particular financial year, we said 30 to 35,000 and we are on track for 30 to 35,000. We've already taken over 30,000; we have done 30,400 plus already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and that's going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward, as we are looking at the situation and the kind of business planning that we will be doing based on that, we will decide as to the joining plan and how exactly we will do the complete hiring. It's very difficult to give you a projection at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just like to add to what Ajoy said, with regard to the lateral hires definitely we have scaled down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're watching the market ramp up situation very carefully and we will make a call again in February and in March. But lateral hires we have definitely reduced drastically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you Mr. Foresi. The next question is from the line of Mitali Ghosh of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. I'm just trying to reconcile the margin break down in terms of the <mark type="inaudible" /> the margin moment during the quarter, because with the rupee depreciating as well as the SG&amp;A improvement that you have had, just wondering what &#x2013; how much the lower productivity actually contributed? So Maha, if could help a lot if you could just deconstruct that for us, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The exchange gain was about 136 basis points and also leverage about 25 basis points and SG&amp;A improvement is about 166 basis points and then productivity as well as some capacity creation in some of our global development centers contributed to the extent of over 269 basis points negative. So the sum total is 53% is the net improvement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so just as a follow-up to that in terms of when you say productivity, lower productivity &#x2013; how does that tie in with the 10 basis points that you mentioned from a pricing perspective and if you could just clarify again whether that 10 basis points is the change in blended U.S. dollar rate or is that in constant currency that we're talking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's constant currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 10 basis point is in constant currency and the other breakup I gave you on the exchange and the offshore movement and the 269 basis points negatively also involves some capacity creation we made in some of our development centers for specific engagements &#x2013; project related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, just on the environment if you can help us understand that in the last couple of months what is the customer behavior you're seeing? You know this is typically the time I guess that people at least start thinking about budgets, I know those things are not frozen yet, but what is the kind of customer conversation you've been having on maybe project ramp ups, what they are thinking of spending, are they actually going to be breaking up the budget and maybe not giving you an indication for the full year, but just for the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mixed bag, Mitali. There are some clients who have finalized their budgets and we have a pretty good indication of what we're going to do with that. There are other clients who have not finalized their budget and will &#x2013; clarity will emerge as we move into the quarter. And I think because of the uncertainty that we are experiencing, we should expect surprises. Surprises may come in the form of like what happened to Nortel or it may happen in the form of some clients canceling projects. So that kind of negative surprises we should anticipate and we should factor in when we see &#x2013; when we have our growth plans.</p>
          <p>On the pricing, as I said, so far we've been able to maintain the pricing, but the pressure will be there and it is likely that there can be dips. And in terms of the sectors, I think retail, utilities, pharma are doing much better compared to BFS, manufacturing, telecom and high-tech, that's the indication. While the U.S. geography is the most watched geography, I would say that out of the six deals we won, large deals we announced today, five of them came from the U.S. geography. So that is the kind of &#x2013; may say a contradiction. So opportunities are there at the same time you should expect surprises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and just finally, in terms of the &#x2013; in the context of the margin outlook what should we expect for this year and then next year if given the uncertain outlook, in terms of campus offers made, how would you really look at maybe deferring rates or how would you look at managing utilization which actually seem to drop this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the utilization, I would say that we've dropped because it was expected and it's also reflected in the volume and we &#x2013; I think it will go back up again. Already we are seeing slight improvements in utilization in the early January. Again, we have one and announced quite a number of deals. It all depends on whether all of them will ramp up as per plan or there will be delays. If the ramp ups happen and if the customers put focus to aggressively ramp up then the utilization can come up otherwise we got to watch this carefully.</p>
          <p>As I already said that on the recruitment side, we have gone very slow on the laterals &#x2013; lateral hires and also we're driving more offshore movement. We already moved this quarter about 106 basis points, which is on top of significant movement we did last quarter and we expect to continue to push and you will see offshore movements in the coming quarter. The trainee hires for the next year, yes, you know how many offers we have made next year, Ajoy already cited, but the whole joining et cetera, I think we'll take the overall situation based on the demand sometime in February.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks. Nice quarter guys. Looking at your pipeline and if we try to compare it to the previous quarter, can you kind of give us a feel by trend, is it up, down, flat? Can you also comment on sales cycles as are they longer, shorter, similar, I guess we're trying to understand whether things have changed much since the September quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you recall the September quarter and the June quarter one thing we said about the environment is very client-specific. We kept repeating that it is very client-specific. But now we would say that apart from being the client-specific situations and definitely we are seeing slowdown in manufacturing high-tech and telecom as we articulated. Now with regard to the deal pipeline, the deal pipeline per se is healthy. We have announced six deals and some of them are really flexible deals. And the number of deals we are pursuing is quite healthy and it is distributed across geography. We have a good number of deals going on in U.K., Europe, Asia-Pacific as well as in other parts of the world. But the concern is sometimes the deals take longer than before and the second concern is, whether the ramp ups will happen as per plan. Previously, I would say that we were very, very certain about the ramp ups, now we worry about the analysis. That's the only extra comment and caution that I'd like to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what sort of projects are being funded these days looking at the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think there are different kinds of projects. The two large ones announced are full services deals, transformation deals, where we take over the complete application portfolio, infrastructure portfolio and the business operations in both the situations. And then also implementing major transformation program, in the case of the retail company, it is regarding optimization of inventory and those kinds of transformation programs. In the case of the &#x2013; a large manufacturer, we won another deal this quarter, which is a global implementation of the ERP across several countries.</p>
          <p>So there are deals driven by enterprise solutions, SAP and Oracle implementations and multi-country implementations, consolidation into a single instances definitely that those type of deals are coming. And full services deals as well as vendor consolidation and cross audit deal. The financial services deal that we announced this quarter is a vendor consolidation where we &#x2013; the companies migrate is consolidating everything to &#x2013; as in the application portfolio and offshoring significantly. So these are the three trends I would say.</p>

          <p>Hi. Congratulations on the quarter. I just wanted to know of the deals that you have signed this quarter &#x2013; what are the kinds and what is the nature of the deals and how are they different from the last deals you have been signing in the earlier quarters. Secondly...</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, this is the operator, I'm sorry to interrupt. Ms. Nagarajan if you are on a speakerphone, could you please switch to your handset while you're asking the question. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, in case you didn't get my question earlier, my question was with reference to the large deals you've signed and if they are any different from the nature of the deals largely that you've been signing in earlier quarters. And secondly, could you also give us a sense of how many of your top 10 or 20 clients would currently be consolidating vendors please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I think, no. There are &#x2013; if you're asking about the business model there is no change in the business model. There is no change in the structuring of the deal or anything. It's pretty much similar to the kind of large deals we did before. And these deals are either offshoring deals &#x2013; offshoring of IT infrastructure and BPO, those kind of full-services deals. Then with regard to the second question, I really can't answer that question. I think if you really see our results this quarter, we have dropped in revenues in the top client, but otherwise, if you see the top five and top 10 and all that, I think we have managed to keep the revenues in line with the company growth rate; we have not dropped revenues. So I think it's quite healthy.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should take it as pretty much volume, I mean it's because we said &#x2013; if you see the 2.42% of volume in rupee terms and the pricing is pretty much flat. So I would just say that the 1.23% you take it as a --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how would you reconcile this with the 254 &#x2013; 242 bps volume growth that we are talking about earlier?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Congrats good quarter. I have just two questions. The first one is on pricing. Despite the very challenging environment of pricing, so far you seem to be able to evade the pricing declines. Can you just elaborate on what kind of &#x2013; what is the extent of pricing cuts that clients have been demanding? And so far what is the value proposition or the offshore mix that you guys have been suggesting to the clients to evade the pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> evading the pricing. Yes, I think, see, the pricing pressure can always be there, even in a very good quarter, even in a very good environment pricing pressure can always be there. I think what is happening is that if you really look at it, customers are looking at certain amount of efficiencies that they wanted to bring in. So depending upon the specific situation in each client, especially when we are there in those clients for a long periods of time. We are getting our teams to sit down and go through what is &#x2013; what has been the value proposition. One value proposition that has been pretty consistent with all our clients is our experience certainty in terms of our delivery. And to some extent it helps us also because in the uncertain times the last thing that clients want is more delivery problems and which will again result in additional work, rework and so on so forth.</p>
          <p>And apart from that all the other operating parameters we are looking at and all the other consolidation opportunities, not only offshoring opportunities, re-platforming opportunities. We look at across-the-board what all we can do including what we call as a technology consumption management and then carve out a unique value proposition for each client. So it's very difficult for me to just say that this is the value proposition that's applicable to all clients. It does require knowledge of the customer, knowledge of the systems and of course the track record, which the client respects. So all of this &#x2013; and then finally we've got to deliver what the client wants. At the end of the day, productivity we've got to deliver, that's also very important. So I think a combination of factors and we've been disciplined about doing it.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, so this is just one thing, could you clarify on the extent of revenue exposure to Nortel?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nortel on a quarterly basis, I would just say that it's about &#x2013; in the region of about 5 million &#x2013; 5 to $6 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, guys. Just wanted to go back to quick comment on the &#x2013; is what I guess I'm trying to reconcile more than anything else is your commentary that you're not seeing cancellations, there appear to be some delays, but yet the deceleration in growth that we're seeing is still sort of representing the numbers that you guys are reporting. So when you're slowing down the way that you are and the way that the business is kind of trending right now, if it's not cancellation or delay-driven what actually is leading to the slowdown that you guys are seeing in the model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm sorry. I don't think I ever said we are not seeing cancellations. I clearly said, we are seeing slowdown and cancellations and I also named the sectors apart from BFS, it's manufacturing, Telecom, high-tech and transportation. And these are the sectors in which we're seeing the slowdown. We are &#x2013; we experienced cancellations. We experienced what we call as you know, some clients really even at the end of contracts, cancelled some projects. So these are the sectors and it &#x2013; it is happening and but there are other sectors which is &#x2013; which are growing. But again, I still maintain that we've got to disaggregate the data by client. Things are happening client specific, overall there is some affinity towards some sectors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on related to that, can you distinguish between sort of application outsourcing work versus development work, so as the project cancellation is more development type work versus the outsourcing work, in other words is the outsourcing work continuing to sort of run on its course?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, gentlemen. One question, a couple of points of clarification. Firstly on Satyam, can you give us just some idea please of how many &#x2013; what proportion of say your top 20 customers shared with Satyam and what reaction you're seeing from those customers. Are they actively coming to you now and asking you to take over their work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, first, before I answer your question I want to make a small correction in &#x2013; on the previous question. A gentleman asked me about our revenues &#x2013; quarterly revenues on Nortel. It's little under 10 million, it's closer to 10 million per quarter. So I wanted to make this correction. Then moving on, I think in, I can't give you the exact number of clients that we're overlapping with another company. I think with &#x2013; many companies are planning to overlap, but by and large, I would say that there are clients who have approached us to take over work and all that. And our guideline with which we have instructed our teams and how we operate is, we are not proactively going after any of their clients. But when there are opportunities, if the deal makes sense, definitely we will look at it, that's the approach we have taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to clarify couple of things. Firstly, on European growth, you said that five of the six big deals you've announced were in North America that you said the pipeline is pretty even across geographies. So now, it's clear from the numbers that European growth was much slower, declined more so than North America, why is it? Is that the decisions in Europe are taking longer or is that the pipeline is declining faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Actually, you are looking at the number based on the currency. This quarter you had a currency rupee appreciation against the pound and euro. So given the situation you have to look at constant currency. In constant currency terms, we did extremely well in Europe in fact we had a sequential growth of 380 basis points in UK and 410 basis points in Europe this quarter. So Europe and UK have done extremely well this quarter in terms of sequential growth. Now, the deal pipeline, when I said that the five deals of the large six deals we announced coming from the URS, there are no revenues of those deals reflected in this quarter. That will come in the quarters to follow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally the points of clarification on the budgets, you said you have some clients have fixed their budgets, but those who have fixed their budgets, where is the direction of those budgets? Where are they spending more and where are they spending less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the clients who have fixed their budgets are two kinds. There are clients where the companies are doing well and then they are fully going ahead with their developmental projects, as well as maintenance projects. So there they are spending both on maintenance and transformation. There are other clients who are only focused primarily on cost outs, where in those situations there are no transformation or developmental projects, the whole thing is about cost outs. So these are the two types we're seeing, very clearly category of clients. And there is the third sort of clients who are still working on their plans and we still don't have visibility yet.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. My question was on this SG&amp;A. Although, we have done very good job on cost rationalization some of the &#x2013; it's like <mark type="inaudible" />. But I was not able to reconcile on the employee cost front that has actually slightly declined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Employee cost has declined in, Vikas, in the SG&amp;A terms but if you're really looking at the combination of COR and SG&amp;As have gone up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. And secondly, our India business is actually have been degrewing for the last two quarters so that was a bit of a surprise?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>India business degrew this quarter, grew last quarter. See Q1 was a decline, Q2 was a growth, Q3 is a decline. It is one area we're looking at because India business that traditionally has been very volatile. And sometimes it so happens that in a quarter were rest of the world are not growing the India declines that does affect the performance. So it does this &#x2013; it does happen primarily because most of the programs in India as you know is all developmental and transformation programs. They're not annuity contracts. So we're really looking at it to see what we can do to reduce the volatility in India.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Vihang. I have a question, I mean we mentioned that exposure to Nortel like around $10 -- $10 million per quarter is there any outstanding receivables we have right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we &#x2013; see the &#x2013; so far, I'll say a couple of things. One is that the payment with Nortel has been on time all through. We had a relationship with Nortel for more than 20 years. It's been a very long standing relationship. And in fact I got calls today from them saying that they are continuing to &#x2013; there are plans to continue to do work. So we have to wait &#x2013; they have told us that they'll give us more color and more insights as we go into the next few days. In terms of outstanding that is a few million dollars, three, yes, $3 million dollars. No &#x2013; I'll have to check and come back to you on that.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello guys, thanks for taking my question. I have &#x2013; just wanted to get a bit more detail on the first group performance. You mentioned that manufacturing telecom and high-tech had been affected quite badly but just looking at a quick analysis of your results seems that your manufacturing business has actually grown by 16% in this quarter. And I was wondering how does that tally with the fact that you're saying that you're actually seeing a slowdown in manufacturing.</p>
          <p>And I'd also like to ask also about, we had a question earlier about application development and that sort of taking along not growing spectacularly, but I see there's actually quite a lot of growth in your engineering, industrial and infrastructure services. And I was wondering if you could also provide a bit more detail behind that, as it seems they are the only two areas that seem to be growing significantly right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the manufacturing side, I don't know where you looked at it, but the &#x2013; in terms of constant currency, we have a drop of 220 basis points in manufacturing this quarter or the previous quarter. And also when we say that we are seeing some slowdown, we take into account not only the current quarter performance, we take into account deal closures, not only the deal pipeline, the deal closures, and the customers' affinity to doing development projects and transformation projects. So we do quite a bit of analysis and based on which I have to tell you that we will expect slowdown in this sector, at least in the immediate quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then in terms of the second question, I think in the services side you are right, we are doing quite well in terms of the application development. It is growing nicely. And also our full services deals are gaining a lot of traction. So infrastructure and BPO along with application development as a integrated offering is a very important portfolio that we have. And that is getting a lot of traction and we have also mentioned in our commentary as a part of the deck that the infrastructure services is poised to grow as customers unbundle their contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Masood. The next question is from the line of Mr. Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow-up on your comments about the Citi situation. It sounded like you guys had not had any recent conversations when you guys signed this contract back in December when the deal was closed, what were the sort of terms at that point in time, in other words, with the breakup potential here, are you guys really still expecting the same volume trends or would &#x2013; none of that would actually change based on what you guys were expecting when you originally signed the contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, after the December 31, I think we've had a conversation. Based on this breakup, we don't see any drop in volume commitments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was it factored into your original expectations that they would've actually breakup Citibank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See &#x2013; if you ask me whether they will breakup that this particular unit, I mean, no, I mean we didn't factor that, and that's the negotiation we have. The contract that the way we have is with the Citigroup and the business that we're doing is not part of SSB. It's in the other areas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Thank you Mr. Quinteros. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan of Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I was just looking at the overall headcounts that we've added this time 8,000 and odd, it's &#x2013; I think more of trainees, so are we likely to see these would have been committed so going forward into next quarter are we likely to see a similar number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, going forward, see, if you look at our total trainee count that we have added given our offers that we have done last year we have done &#x2013; been too close to 19,800 trainees that we have added in this three quarters. Next quarter the number of trainees that we had given offers most of them are coming. So as a result, Q4, there will be some trainees, who are left they will join. And lateral hires as we have told you earlier, experience says that we are controlling it very tightly and that we have reduced significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just that I couldn't reconcile laterals you look at it this quarter. We did 1,696, or if you look at it last quarter we did 1,587?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So actually it is an increase in laterals. So I was just wondering when utilization is under pressure I think we are seeing some pressure even within the top clients, so why laterals intake is so high at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, the major part of the lateral hires you see this quarter of the 1,600 and odd more than 1,100, I think close to 1200 of that is predominantly in Latin America and it is a combination of &#x2013; there we don't distinguish between the trainees and laterals as we're building up the business. We're &#x2013; that's a pool that we have created there because of the local talent and the contract that's required. And the remaining 450 or 500 people that you're seeing here is some of them are the offers that are closed towards the end of last quarter and we've taken them on board in very special niche skills especially in areas like SAP, Oracle applications and so on so forth. And since then I think we're controlling the lateral hires so it &#x2013; that's the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet. And within the top clients, I think that there has been some pressure there and so is that something that you are likely to continue going forward? And in terms of the total client mix that we have in terms of million dollar, 20, 30, 100, there again have you seen Ajoy have you seen some sort of something going out and something coming in, although it looks stagnant on the higher end of it, has that happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we have done well on the client metric. If you really look at it, when you say higher end leave the 100 million, but if you look at the 50 million and below 20 billion, we have nicely migrated customers upwards. We added to 50 million clients, we have added four clients to 20 million plus. So it's nicely migrating up even at 10 million range. But having said that, the top line has showed some de-growth this quarter. And in our large pool of top 10, 15, 20 clients, even in a very good market, we would expect that there will be some clients who will do grow well in one quarter, another clients will drop that quarter. That kind of volatility you should expect. And definitely you should expect it in an environment, which is so tough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And just two more, one is that if you look at for the next year, the kind of offers that you have given for freshers and looking into the kind of pressures building up in terms of utilization at this point, is it more &#x2013; so is it that we will be able to maintain utilization at these levels or we will see a dropping keeping the current environment in mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is your second question, you can complete that then I will answer both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The second one is that &#x2013; what you call &#x2013; no, I think you can go ahead with it, I'll get back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's okay. See, on the &#x2013; we already answered it, Ajoy also articulated. Our intent is to maintain the utilization. We are used to maintaining the utilization between 76 and 78 until a few quarters back. But about two quarters back, we said that we are going to push it to 80, 81% and we did that last quarter. And it has come down to 79.9, it's not a bad utilization at all. It's a pretty healthy utilization. In fact, we can afford to even bring it down by another couple of more points in general to maintain between the 77 to 80 is a very good healthy utilization is what we feel. But our endower is to push the utilization up. And as I articulated before, we will take a call in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last is --</p>

          <p>Thank you everyone. What I wanted to say was, we are living in times of volatility and this is across sectors and across geographies. The focus should be and will be vis-&#xE0;-vis TCS on operational efficiencies and delivering value proposition. There are going to be pricing pressures and how you articulate and how do you stand accurate and how you position yourself has to be seen.</p>
          <p>From a volatility of foreign exchange point of view again the rupee versus dollars, the rupee versus the pound or the euro are all waving pretty volatile conditions there. The strategic themes are building for the future in terms of multi-geography business models, as well as focusing on the domestic market will continue to be there for us, so widespread across geographies and across verticals. We are likely to experience delays in ramp-ups as well as in decision-making and all our focus on building for the future would be around building efficiencies and looking at the future and investing for the future on people and some of the assets, which we create while focusing on the clients and enabling value delivery. Thank you.</p>
