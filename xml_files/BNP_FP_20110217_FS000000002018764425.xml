        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon and &#x2013; well the key messages for the year, we'll see the revenues of 43.9 billion euros in the new perimeter of the BNP Paribas of the acquisition of Fortis. We are going to reevaluate our synergies for Fortis from 900 million euros to 1.2 billion euros. Certainly decline the cost of risk due to an improved economic environment was very much characterized last year. And we're going to continue to invest two-third of our profits, therefore keeping a payout ratio of one-third. The net income group stood at 7.8 billion euro. The ROE was 12.3%, compared to 10.8% in 2009, and the return on tangible equity increased to 15.8% last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Consolidated Group numbers, in 2010 &#x2013; so for the first full year in the new scope with the integration of Fortis, the group generated 43.9 billion euros of revenue, up 9.2% compared to 2009. Now I think that to be more significant we should move directly to the like-for-like basis and that is this and for the operations divisions only. There we see the revenues slightly decrease by 3.4% compared to the high days in 2009, entirely due to the fixed income exceptional first half results. 2009 was characterized by an exceptional revenue contribution from fixed income in the first half and on a like-for-like basis. Therefore CIB revenues in 2009 were 18.8% lower than 2010 -- than 2009, whereas costs decreased by 4.5%</p>
          <p>On the other hand, on the whole Retail Banking, we show a positive 2 points effect in 2010 compared to 2009 on a like-for-like basis. And for Investment Solutions it's 3.1, so three points of positive jaws effect. So we definitely had last year for the full year positive jaws effects of two points for Retail. And on a like-for-like basis positive jaws effect of 3.1 points for Investment Solutions. And the only reason for revenues to be lower was the very high days especially of the first half of 2009 for fixed income revenues which we very much mentioned at the time.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the sharp decline in the cost of risk, pre-tax income was sharply up at 32.8% and then we get back to the net income attributable to the equity holders also up 34.5% at 7.8 billion euros. There you see the return on equity, the net earnings of 12.3% that I already mentioned. Net earnings per share was 6.3 euros; up 21.7% compared to 2009. And the net book value per share at 55.5 euros was up 9% compared to 2009. So we have a strong increase in results in the new dimension for the Group.</p>
          <p>As for the BNP Paribas Fortis synergies, at the end of 2010, we have realized 600 million euros of synergies against 230 million euros, 229 million euros announced. Due to this very strong move in realizing synergies, we therefore are increasing the total expected synergies from 900 million euros to 1,200 million euros in 2012.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking and Functions includes now the plan of our new &#x2013; well the new merged bank in Turkey that merged on the 11th of February. Jean Bonnaf&#xE9; will come back to it a &#x2013; when &#x2013; getting back to the Retail operations. In Investment Solutions and in CIB, we really see the possibility of higher cost synergies in both divisions in various business units. And also in CIB, more cross-selling. And altogether, this is how we increase from 900 million euros to 1,200 million euros.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs increased from 1.3 million euros to 1.65 million euros including 600 million euros that should be posted in 2011, so this year. So I think this is a significant revision upward confirming the integration skills of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>As far as the net income attributable to equity holders, you see here that we are close to Santander and Citi, and just, well, ahead of the others. I think this very significant net income at group level reflects BNP Paribas' position in the banking industry. In terms of ROE, our ROE of 12.3% is also comparing favorably well. We are really in the first tier of the industry, and it shows that the property built of the group in the last year's environment was relatively high considering the new environment and the overall environment.</p>
          <p>As far as &#x2013; this is the operating division's fourth quarter numbers. We see here &#x2013; so we now switch to fourth quarter performance of the operating divisions. Revenues stand at 10.2 billion euros, and were up 7.9%. This is quite a significant increase of revenues. Gross operating income increased by 8.1% to 3.8 billion euros, taking into account an increase of 8.1% of operating expenses due to investment made to accompany the growth of our operational divisions. Actually our present income, gross operating income increased by 7.5% to 3.8 billion euro. And the increase in operating expenses was 8.1%.</p>
          <p>Here again we had the positive jaws effects of one &#x2013; well, of 0.8% in Retail again, and a positive jaws effect of 2.4% in Investment Solutions. Only CIB had a negative jaws effect and we will come back to it later when we comment in detail the last quarter CIB performance. So for the full year as for the last quarter, we had positive jaws effects in Retail and RS, and negative jaws effect only on CIB but still keeping a very efficient cost income in absolute and comprehensive terms for CIB.</p>
          <p>Thanks to a decline in the cost of risk by one third, pre-tax income increased by almost 60% to 2.7 billion euros, so a strong increase in activity, in revenues and in results for operating divisions as for the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Exceptional items in the last quarter: as for the group as a whole, fourth quarter results include a one-off depreciation of around 534 million euros of our investment in AXA. For accounting reasons, I think we took the cautious and prudent decision to follow long term investments in a highly volatile market. In application of the accounting rule, we had to value at this stock market price of the last day of last year, which was 12.45 euros.</p>
          <p>Actually, however, part of this has already been recouped with an unrealized gain of more than  350 million euros at the end of January 2011. And a one-off amortization, the other one-off items, is the one-off amortization of the Fortis PPA of 176 million euros, due to early redemption and disposal. So all together, we booked in the last quarter in the corporate center revenues a combined, well negative of 460 million euros, and after that negative impact on the corporate center revenues, we came out in the fourth quarter with a net income attributable to equity orders of 1.5 billion euros.</p>
          <p>Getting back to the last -- fourth quarter revenues of the operating divisions, we see that Retail Banking was up &#x2013; revenues were up 4.7%, Investment Solutions were up 13.8% and CIB revenues were up 10%. So all together, the three divisions had good sales and marketing drive across all business units. I won't get to the detail of the different retail entities' revenue increase because Jean Bonnaf&#xE9; will just in a few minutes comment in detail the main entities' performance for the last quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cost of risk, at group level, the cost of risk in the last quarter stood at 68 basis points. This is a steep decline compared to the fourth quarter of last year, a 39% decline, for about 700 million euros of decline. This is, well, stable, only a decrease of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2010. What I think is important is we see a stabilization of the doubtful/outstanding, end of fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. This is the first time we've seen it in the last few years, and I think that this is a good indication of things regarding the cost of risk for the near future, for the future.</p>
          <p>In terms of CIB Financing businesses, cost of risk was 12 basis points. It was very &#x2013; 100 million euros lower than last quarter of 2009; and it was compared with a limited write-back in the third quarter of 2010. Again, limited provisions offset by write-backs and we most probably think that going on we should continue to have a very limited cost of risk in CIB Financing businesses, because we somehow more of, maybe, these write-backs compensating from provisions in the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>In terms of our key domestic franchise, in France the cost of risk was 41 basis points. We have the seasonal impact of the last quarter, which is always a bit higher; it was 47 basis points the last quarter of last year. Overall the cost of risk is &#x2013; we think that the cost of risk is low and should &#x2013; most probably we would expect a slight decline for French Retail in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>BNL bc, the cost of risk is stabilized at 105 basis points. The last few quarters as you see them have been 109, 107,108 and now back to 105. So this is really a stabilization of the cost of risk. For the third significant domestic market for BeLux with a cost of risk of 32 basis points, so low, moderate level confirmed and very, very similar to the previous quarter. And there also we might expect a slight decline in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>In terms of Europe-Mediterranean, for Europe-Mediterranean we see that the cost of risk at 122 million euro for the last quarter is really 133 million euro lower than the last quarter of 2009. It's up 33 million euros compared to the third quarter. This is mostly due to the 25 million euro portfolio provision that we took on a portfolio basis for Tunisia and Ivory, and we've seen, apart from that, a stabilization in the cost of risk in Ukraine and so nothing else really to mention.</p>
          <p>Regarding BancWest, 79 basis points, cost of risk of 75 million euros, well down 200 million euro compared to the last quarter of 2009, so a very steep decrease and also down 38 million euros compared to the third quarter of 2010. We see an improvement in the quality of the portfolio in the more favorable economic environment. So after this very steep decline we &#x2013; well, we will see whether we can have some further declines as the cost of risk has come really to a much lower level regarding where we were a few quarters ago.</p>
          <p>As for Personal Finance, for Personal Finance, we really have a cost of risk which is &#x2013; well, much lower than last year at 210 basis points against 290, 287 basis points in the last quarter of 2009, and also lower than in the third quarter. We see this decline in the cost of risk continuing in the next few quarters and it is a very significant number because in absolute terms it is one of the &#x2013; well, important source of provisioning for the Group considering the type of business of Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>Moving to the pre-tax income per operating division; well, there was really a strong increase in the pre-tax income of all three operating divisions but certainly with quite a rebalancing of the division contribution to the Group. Starting with Retail, Retail well, went from 480 million euros to 1.075 billion euros so it was more than double &#x2013; more than twice the last quarter of 2009 pre-tax income, so a very strong rebound. We will see that this rebound was mostly due to BancWest Personal Finance and Europe-Mediterranean increase. And now we see this Retail Banking being well, just ahead of CIB, the first contributor to the Group pre-tax profit; quite a change to well, to the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Investment Solutions grew &#x2013; pre-tax income grew, well, 40% to 550 million euros, so quite an increase. And CIB also had a significant increase of 23%, well, to about 1.071 billion euros. So we had really in the last quarter of last year a strong operating performance in terms of pre-tax income for every division of the Group.</p>
          <p>I will now give the floor to Jean-Laurent.</p>

          <p>So good afternoon. So for French Retail we enjoyed strong commercial growth for this fourth quarter for the full year. Loans were up 4.6% especially with mortgages at plus 9.3%. Deposits are up 8.8%, especially current accounts at 11.7%. All in all, based on this very strong growth in deposits and loans, we have an increase of 2.3% of the global revenues, well balanced between net interest income plus 2.1% and fees plus 2.6%. And due to a slight decrease in cost of risk, pre-tax income was up 8.4% at 337 million euros, so a very good year for the French Retail.</p>
          <p>As for BNL is concerned, well, amidst a slow recovery of the Italian economy, we posted a very slight increase of revenues last quarter, at 0.8%. On one hand, we see a weak growth for loans, 2.1%, a slight increase in deposits, -0.5%, in line with the market. And on the other hand, we see quite strong revenues in terms of fees based on product offering and cross-selling. On the yearly basis, fees are up 8.5%. Operating expenses are down 0.8%. This is linked to the effects of the first synergies from the merger of Banca UCB and Fortis Italia. And on the other hand, we're still expanding the network with 23 new branches opened this year. So we are now halfway to our mid-term target that is 1,000 branches in Italy.</p>
          <p>Cost income, again, improved. While down to 48.8% on the yearly basis, we can say now that we have fully closed the gap this year with the banking sector after four years of quite hard work, I have to say. And pre-tax income this final quarter of 2009 is up 16.7% thanks to a slight decrease of the cost of risk at 91 million euros. So an in between the situation, but revenues that are well compared to the market.</p>
          <p>For BeLux, what can you say after this full year? BeLux posted strong and promising results for this final quarter as for the full year. This is especially based on good sales and marketing drive, particularly with respect to successful cross selling with CIB, syndicated loans, acquisition finance, bond issues. Loans were up 4.7%, including market mortgages at 13% and entrepreneurs at 4.7%. Deposits are up 11% and the private bank assets under management are up 13%. So it's a very good start for this joint venture in between the private bank and the retail network for the first year.</p>
          <p>Based on that, revenues were up 5.1%, up 840 million euros. Operating expenses are up 3.4%, so we are still continuing to invest in the development plan in Belgium and in Luxembourg. We're still running out IT investments. And all of these, plus the fall in the cost of risk gives us an increase of close to 30% of the pre-tax income for BeLux. So this is a very nice result for the first full year of the integration in Belgium and in Luxembourg.</p>
          <p>For Europe-Mediterranean, of course this division and competitors, a large variety of different geographies. All in all we can say that we benefited from the good sales and marketing drive, plus 200,000 customers as compared to the third quarter of 2010. Strong increases on the development for private finance and cash management. Fees are up 11% and good growth in outstanding loans, plus 3.2%, especially with Turkey plus 24%, and despite the decline in Ukraine, minus 16.7%.</p>
          <p>Revenues are up 1%, 5.5% excluding Ukraine and minus 21% in Ukraine. Operating expenses are up 5.8%, while pursuing investments we've been opening 34 new branches and we are rolling out the multi-channel banking services program in Morocco and Ukraine. Thanks to the fall of the cost of risk, the division again this fourth quarter is break even, plus 30 million euros in terms of pre-tax income, as compared to a loss of 91 million euros last year.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say satisfactory situation as compared to the 2009 last year, and we have reached the main objective that was to be break even this year. For BancWest, all in all revenues for the final quarter are up 2.2%. This is based mainly on net interest margin that is growing. And despite the decrease in deposits, minus 3.5%, but more importantly we are looking at the core deposit data of 5.6%. Loans are at minus 2.5%, but recently we've been seeing a pick-up for corporate and consumer loan production.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are up 7.5%. This is based first on the revival of marketing spendings, and the fact that we are entering in a new phase with BancWest. So we are starting new investment for the years to come. But more importantly, this is also the impact of the new regulation in the U.S., so we have to adapt in many dimensions the bank to this new reality. Pre-tax income is at 156 million euros, compared to a loss of 49 million euros last year. So all in all, BancWest with a net income of close to 600 million euros is really back into positive territory.</p>
          <p>Personal finance continued this year, and for the final quarter to adapt its business model in a very successful way. We have annual good sales and marketing drive, especially in France, Italy, Germany, Brazil and Turkey with low risk profile and good profitability. Revenues are up 5%, consolidated outstandings, 5.8%. The company is improving its operating efficiencies. Cost to income ratio is down by 2.4 points, so we are now at 46.2%. And pre-tax income is at 272 million euros for the final quarter, due to the sharp decline in the cost of risk. So all in all, this year, personal finance posted the &#x2013; booked the best result ever in the very long story of personal finance within the BNP Paribas Group, so it's a very nice performance with an excellent operating performance.</p>
          <p>If we look at the 2011 action plan for domestic networks, well of course first, as always, we continue our dedication to serving the economy, individual customers, entrepreneurs, corporates. For individuals we'll keep on investing in new technologies: Internet, mobile banking, multi-channel. In Belgium we will roll out continuously the private banking business model. In France and Italy, we'll expand the cross-sell with the insurance businesses, like insurance products, but also non-life insurance products. And in Italy we will continue to grow the network with this mid-term objective of 1,000 branches in Italy.</p>
          <p>For corporate and small businesses, we will keep on expanding the product offering and the cross-sell with CIB Investment Solutions. We will continue to develop the cash management services. This is part of the global program that is One Bank for corporate in Europe. In France, we will open 13 new business centers; and in Italy we will continue our move towards the mid-cap segment. So again, this is the full roll out of the integrated model that is going out.</p>
          <p>For the other retails, other networks, for BancWest, 2011 will be the first year of the new business development program. We continue to invest in technology, but also in the private bank and the corporate bank. So we're expecting quite nice results over the mid-term with this bank.</p>
          <p>For Europe-Mediterranean, I will say a word about Turkey in a minute. In Poland we are pursuing  the business development plan we have announced 18 months ago with the integration of Fortis. And in Ukraine, we will keep on carrying on the turnaround of the bank, optimizing the cost base and developing selected businesses line, the consumer lending and cash management, for example. We expect the bank to be breakeven not the next year, not this year, 2011, but next year in 2012. So this is the main target to be break even in 2012.</p>
          <p>About Turkey, you know how the Turkish market is attractive. Close to 80 million inhabitants, half of the population is under 30 years old, so a very promising banking market. On top of it, banking penetration is quite limited, 39% as compared to 148% in the Eurozone. So this is basically the picture. And in terms of geography, it's a getaway between Europe and Asia and this geography is very strongly connected to other core regions of the group, like Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, and of course the Mediterranean area.</p>
          <p>Basically, we are merging the two local operations. So this is first the merger of two domestic banks and this will contribute to three quarters of the total revenues -- synergies, sorry. And the second part is that we're going to roll out the full business model of the BNP Paribas Group from the retail to the businesses of CIB and Investment Solutions.</p>
          <p>Based on the merger of the two banks, we start with the number nine position in Turkey. This is for the core domestic banking business, but in a number of other businesses, we're among the top five banking groups, especially for consumer lending, card issuing, leasing, asset management and insurance. So it's a very strong operation we have now in Turkey.</p>
          <p>In terms of synergies, the objective is 86 million euros in 2013. 2013 because this project started one year after the integration of the BNP Paribas Group together with Fortis. Three quarters is coming from the pure retail integration of the two local banks. One quarter is coming from the investment bank. Restructuring costs should be around 123 million euros over three years. So a very ambitious and attractive program for us for the three years to come.</p>
          <p>For personal finance, we believe that in 2011, personal finance will continue to take advantage of its strong growth potential, both in developed and emerging countries. In France, we launched a full branch of savings products: Livret A, Livret CTLM, insurance life; and we'll implement a new multi-channel device to better get advantage from the customer base of the company. In Italy, this is the second year, 2011, of the development plan we have implemented after taking full control of this company. The first year was quite successful and we're expecting a lot from 2011.</p>
          <p>In Belgium we are going to speed up the distribution of AlphaCr&#xE9;dit products. AlphaCr&#xE9;dit is the brand of the loan consumer business in Belgium, through the BNP Paribas Fortis network. In Germany, we should get substantial growth from the partnership with Commerzbank and we have enough other geographies in which we can expand. These are networks of the group around Ukraine, North Africa or even China, and of course Turkey where CTLM took recently control of TEB CTLM and is going to start new partnerships, especially in the automotive sector. So this is for CTLM in 2011.</p>
          <p>So let's pass the floor to Jacques for Investment Solutions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Laurent. I am now going to speak to you of Investment Solutions first. What's interesting is that the assets under management of the Investment Solutions are now at 900 billion euro which is naturally a good level to begin 2011. We can see that in all the businesses, the assets under management are higher and this figure is higher of 7.5% compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The net asset inflows are positive in the fourth quarter which is, let's say, good, due to seasonal effect because you know that normally at the end of the year, we suffer of some asset outflows, mainly in money market funds and so that this is a negative effect of money market funds. But despite that, Asset Management at year end was as positive outlook. We suffered of some negative asset outflows in Wealth Asset Management, mainly in Europe due to what I call positive 20 effects  mainly in Switzerland and in Luxembourg, so all in all, we have 900 billion of assets under management. We think we begin at a very good level the year 2011.</p>
          <p>And let me remind you because we speak naturally of the first quarter, that for all of the whole year 2010 we have delivered a record year for Investment Solutions with a net asset income of more than 2 billion euro. So if I come back to the first quarter, you see that the revenues are up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009, mainly due to Wealth and Asset Management for 8%, for Insurance, 27%, mainly for those operations due to the high level of assets under management, for Security Services main effects, rising asset under custody, but also that transaction we have seen at the end of the last year lets it better move in terms of transaction at the level of BNP Paribas Securities Services.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are up 11%. We continue to invest in Asia, mainly in Asia, Latin America and also a little in France, but we enjoy a positive jaw effects in all the business lines of this part of Investment Solution. At year end, we have delivered pre-tax income of 547 million euros, plus 40% compared to the first quarter of 2009. So globally we are absolutely on track and in a very good shape to begin the 2011 year.</p>
          <p>What is our action plan for 2011? Very simple, to continue to develop by organic growth. We lack organic growth at the level of Investment Solutions. So clearly we will continue to take advantage of cost saving between Investment Solution and Retail Banking, and cost saving between Investment solution and CIB. Jean-Laurent, for example, mentioned Turkey, so naturally we will make a lot of things with the new TEB</p>
          <p>We continue to develop our wealth management model in our domestic market, but also in our new retail market. I mean Poland and Turkey for example. In CIB we have joint operation with &#x2013; let's say to offer, to hedge fund for kind of hedge. And we continue to &#x2013; and we are in the process to develop more alternative asset management between Investment Solution and Equity Derivative.</p>
          <p>To gain new customers, we constantly gain new customers in wealth management naturally, but also in asset management for institutionals. And in insurance, we want to make a vertical push on protection insurance in France and outside France. Naturally we have an Asian plan. You all know that Asia is a growth area. And we've first &#x2013; we've continued to invest in new stuff. We will naturally have new stuff, but &#x2013; and mainly in insurance we will continue to develop our activities, joint venture in India. We are partnered with State Bank of India, as you know. In wealth management we've continued to develop in Hong Kong and Singapore. So globally, all in all, Investment Solutions is on track to deliver good organic growth for 2011.</p>
          <p>I move now to CIB for the first quarter of 2010. The revenues are 2.7 billion euro, plus 10% compared to the Q4, 2009. It's due to the fact that we are &#x2013; we have a very close relationship with our clients, despite some, let's say, some uncertainty concerning some soaring debt. Globally, our operating expenses are up 15%, is due to the fact that we continuously invest to develop our franchise. I will come back on that in a minute.</p>
          <p>And all in all our pre-tax income is one billion euros for this quarter. I think it's interesting you see that on the slide, you see the level where we are now in 2010, with 12 billion euros of revenues. We are far above the level compared to where we were before the crisis. That means that the business model of BNP Paribas, as I mentioned last year, is well positioned just to be in the situation of the new business model after crisis. And so you see that our first quarter is very good compared to the first quarter of 2009, and we see and we enjoy very good contribution of 16 term  of our equity derivative and on financing business. So our equity return business model is after the crisis.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to look to our cost income ratio. Clearly we continue after the crisis to be one of the best compared to our competitors with 54% of cost income for this year. Let's say that for the first quarter, naturally, we had a negative jaw effect of 5%, because of the fact that the revenues were up of 10%, the expenses were up 15%; it is due to the fact that we have invested in Asia and in the U.S., but if you make the calculation, you see that our cost-income ratio for the first quarter of the year is 57.7%, which is far below the cost-income ratio of our competitors on an annual basis. So you see that we are naturally on track to continue to deliver good cost-income ratio compared to our peers, and so I think it's very positive for the future.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the first quarter for capital market activities, you see that the revenues are up 20% compared to the Q4 of 2009 and we continue to, let's say, to increase our position. You see for fixed income that we are naturally first in all corporate bonds in euro. We work very closely with corporates, but also with investors. In equity and &#x2013; equity derivatives, let's say the business is back; we now continue to sell guaranteed capital structure products and we continue to offer, and we increase our offering of hedging operations for insufficient.</p>
          <p>In corporate finance we are now there in Asia. We are number five, excluding Japan in M&amp;A according to Thomson Reuters. And we are very strong naturally, in equity linked in Europe. So globally, quarter after quarter, we show that our franchise is there, and will continue to develop year after year.</p>
          <p>Concerning financing business, let's say we see a slight decrease in our revenues for this quarter. It is due to the fact that in CTBE we have just changed a little the profile of our customers. So now we think we are in the bottom in term of revenues. And we think that 2011 will show a good start for CTBE, let's say all over Europe. In Structured Finance, you see the situation &#x2013; 40% in Western Europe, 10% in Eastern Europe. So good equity there. And naturally we continue to be there in energy, in commodities, in telecom finance, and in acquisition front. So globally we continue to be with our clients with meeting their needs in their financing operations.</p>
          <p>So action plan for CIB for 2011 is very simple. It is to continue to develop and to continue to increase our market shares. Clearly we are leader in Europe, so we will continue to do so. Just not only for finance, for financing business, but also just to help them to develop their strategic programs, so through advisory, and M&amp;A and so that's the reason why we have invest a lot of senior people in that business time all over Europe.</p>
          <p>In CTBE, which is, let's say, the day to day business with our clients all over Europe, we think we can develop, as probably Jean-Laurent mentioned. For all our clients in Europe we want to develop cash management and tax finance. We have been one of the best bank cash managements in Europe for this year. And so we will continue to make a push specifically in this part of the business in Europe.</p>
          <p>For North America, let's say naturally we continue to pursue selective growth. Clearly we are a strong debt house in U.S. We help clients to issue bonds in U.S. We will naturally continue to do so. And naturally we will also continue to develop our energy and commodity franchise. Probably adding, and we will add some M&amp;A franchise specifically in the U.S. for advisory service for this sector. And naturally we will continue to develop our derivative business activity in North America. In Asia, same, we will leverage on our strong position worldwide, that I mean fixed income and derivatives, and mainly structure, also structured finance and equity derivative. And naturally we will continue to invest in staff in China, India and Korea. So globally, we think we are on track to continue our organic growth at the level of CIB.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to have a word on liquidity, I would like to highlight that the BNP Paribas intrinsic strength allows the group to have access to a wide variety of liquidity sources. We benefit from a large deposit base of 550 billion euros, thanks to our strong positions in Retail Banking at the heart of the Eurozone. We also benefit from 160 billion euros of available collateral eligible to central banks.</p>
          <p>The good quality of our assets we have on the balance sheet enables the group to issue covered bonds. There are currently two programs. One is using our very good quality of euro mortgages as collateral and the second program is the one constituted of export credits warranted AAA export credit agencies.</p>
          <p>All this gives BNP Paribas the ability to issue medium, long-term papers in attractive conditions with a global reach encompassing major financial centers. It also gives us the possibility to be one of the few in a position to issue up to 10-year maturity for sizable amounts, as well as to offer a broad range of issues to various types of investors, and you see here that's private placements, well, Retail Banking, senior un secured public issues, covered bonds, long-term repo. We have used all of them in our program of 2010.</p>
          <p>To illustrate this point, my point, I would like to highlight some of the most recent issues of the group. As we see, we had a successful issue of a 1-year floating rate note for 4.5 billion euros. For this year, for 2011, our medium and long-term issue program has been set at 35 billion euros, of which 7 billion euros have already been placed with an overall increasing maturity of eight years.</p>
          <p>You can see here as examples there is issues in different segments. I would like to quickly comment on the first one illustrated in the graph. This graph shows that BNP Paribas has been able to issue at a longer maturity, ten years, with a lower spread 65 basis point than, well, most all of its peers. The amount in this case was 1.760 billion euros for a ten-year home loan covered bond. So this illustrates the favorable issue price and the accretive terms that BNP Paribas could get present in the market.</p>
          <p>Moving to the balance sheet, BNP Paribas total balance sheet decreased again to just below 2,000 billion euros at the end of last year, down 60 billion euros from 2009. I think this decrease was achieved despite a rise in the dollar of 7.5% against the euro, and we can consider that 20% to 25% of our balance sheet is somehow U.S. denominated. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease in repos and trailing assets for 29 billion euros, as well as loans to central banks for 22 billion euros, leading to a reduction of the trading book by 29 billion euros.</p>
          <p>As for the available for sales asset, the total amount of them was stable at 220 billion euros over the period. And as you know, these assets are marked to market, and changes in fair value are recognized directly in equity. I think it's significant that the impact of this mark-to-market was literally neutral as of December 2010, as you see it was well, a very marginal 40 million euros, well, unrealized loss for all of the available for sale assets.</p>
          <p>In terms of solvency, well, solvency the common equity tier one ratio stands at 9.2% as of the end of last year. This is 122 basis points increase over one year compared to the end of 2009 and a 20 basis point compared to the end of September, so for the last quarter. The tier one ratio stands at 11.4%, an increase of 130 basis points compared to the end of 2009. I think what is very important that shows the equity is up in 2010, primarily through retained earnings. The common equity tier one has increased 5.8 billion euro to 55.4 billion euro as of the end of last year, and the tier one capital at 68.5 billion euro is up 5.6 billion euros compared to the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>As regard risk-weighted assets, risk-weighted assets stood at just, well, about 601 billion euro as of the end of last year, down 20 billion euro compared to the end of 2009, and down 7 billion euro through the end of the third quarter. In the meantime, Retail Banking risk-weighted asset grew 11 billion euro in the last quarter, showing that we have some &#x2013; well we are managing our risk-weighted assets selectively. And, while this 9.2% is a high solvency ratio, and we are confirming 2010 ability of the group, through retained earnings, to continuously grow &#x2013; well, its shareholder equity and consequently it's to have a very solid solvency position.</p>
          <p>In terms of the earnings per share and book value per share, thanks to our stronger earnings generation capacity, earnings per share increased by 21.7% to 6.3 euro in 2010 compared to 2009. And I think it's very important that you see that the book value per share reached 65.5 euro at 9% from 2009 and up 29.4% since 2006. I think this really illustrates the ability of the group to generate robust growth in the value of its assets throughout the cycle, even through a, well, a difficult period.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, the dividends. We are going to propose to the shareholder's at the general meeting a dividend payable in cash of 2.1 euro per share. This compares to 1.5 euro last year. We will keep the payout ratio at one-third, and we think this is, in the present environment, the right balance. We think it's very important that we keep a very solid dividend policy payable in cash for our shareholders, also retaining &#x2013; well, the other two-thirds of the earnings to continue to build up the solvency of BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>And I think with this I will just say, before moving to the Q&amp;A session, that I think the overall 2010 Group performance confirms the robustness of BNP Paribas' business model. We have improved our solvency. We keep a diversified access to liquidity. And our action plan for 2011 is very much focused on organic growth, getting new customers and leveraging the group in its new dimension and also continuing to deliver on the increase level of synergies for the Fortis integration.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And we are now going to answer with Jean-Laurent and George and Philippe who in the meantime have come here to answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a couple of &#x2013; Delphine Lee from J.P. Morgan. Just a couple of questions, the first one is, just to come back on the book value per share and just trying to think how you think about the growth. Is that one of your targets, to make sure that the book value per share increases every year adjusted for any changes in the AFS reserves? Or, just to know how you're thinking about that.</p>
          <p>The second question is on retail. Do you have a target in terms of jaws effect in French Retail? Or at BNL like you used to have in the past?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, in terms of organic growth your risk-weighted asset declined slightly this year. Is that something that you aim to achieve as well in the next couple of years ahead of the Basel III implementation? Or do you see more normal organic growth of 3% or 5% that you used to have in the past?</p>
          <p>And lastly if you have any updates on the current transient investment bank by products, equities and fixed income just to see how it has progressed compared to the first quarter of last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tr&#xE8;s bien. Well, I'll answer in terms of retail the reasons why we didn't give jaws effect this year is really because the new taxes we have, especially in France, are really based on the risk-weighted asset and we'll have to pass them onto the retail division. And they will basically negatively impact the cost. And because of that, I'm not sure we can really produce the kind of overall positive jaws affect between cost and revenues, but just because of that. So this tax will not only take money from BNP Paribas but make some noise on the really reported numbers for our operating divisions. Especially for the French Retail we also have that, but based on the deposits for Belgium. So this is reason why we didn't give targets for jaws effect for this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of organic growth in risk-weighted asset, I think that &#x2013; I don't really think that we should have another, a third year, of negative growth in risk-weighted asset in 2011. On the other side, I think that we're going to control the growth of our risk-weighted asset because of the new, well, because of the new regulatory environment and the capital requirements. So I think that we're going to hope, well, most probably be back to some growth in risk-weighted asset that's not, well, nothing comparable to what we had pre-2007 in terms of speed or &#x2013; yes, in terms of the, it should be, as you mentioned, a sort of low single-digit number most probably. Maybe in Group value per share you can...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can mention something about Basel III because before Basel III we have Basel 2.5, if you remember, end of the year. You have to keep in mind that BNP Paribas is relatively very, very well placed compared to the other competitors. We showed some slide, I don't remember if it was of the third quarter or the second quarter or the first quarter, Basel 2.5 is "only" plus 10% for the whole risk-weighted asset for the Group. So look at what was said by other people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yes, this is the slide back. I think, well, in those times, I mean, it's striking to see that the share price is, well, not that far from the book value per share, and with a return on equity of 12.3%. So yes, of course, I mean the value of the bank is the combination of the earnings per share on the left side, the book value per share on the right side, and the return on equity. So, yes, I think those three ingredients are very important, yes.</p>

          <p>Before coming to the [foreign language], let's say you have seen that &#x2013; as I mentioned, we were very well placed to enter in the 2011 year, and you see that globally business is not so bad at the general level of CIB if you hear what the people say. So you have the answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cautious approach of BNP Paribas management is just to say, not so bad.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Rob Down from HSBC. I had two questions, one was just sort of a numbers question really. It's the second quarter we've seen an exceptional sort of one-off PPA adjustment from Fortis coming through. I assume that's from the, sort of, in-portfolio. Can you tell us what the sort of, whether there's an unrealized gain now sitting in that portfolio? I know you were very aggressive when you saw fair value dip in that book when you first acquired it.</p>
          <p>And the second question is just a more sort of general question about the return on equity target for the group, the 15% number that's bandied about. But it's always referred to as being a challenge to get to 15%, and yet this year you've done 12.3% with an impairment charge that feels perhaps a little bit above where we might normally expect. You've got synergy benefits coming through. It sounds like you expect further operational efficiency gains. The Investment Management business has continued to grow very nicely.</p>
          <p>Why is 15% going to be a challenge? If I go back to the Q3 stage, I think the suggestion then when it came to Basel III was that you felt that if you had to apply Basel III now, in effect, that you were pretty much adequately capitalized, you didn't think you'd need to be much above 7%, what are we missing? Where are the headwinds going to come from over the next two or three years that will prevent you getting to 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe you can answer to the PPA question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While since the beginning of the year, in fact we are seeing some flow of early redemption of some assets, be it loans or most frequently loans issued from the Fortis acquisition, and that were mark-to-market at the moment of the acquisition. And while the two first quarters it was small amounts, so we didn't mention them, and it was very big in the third quarter and significant in the fourth quarter. While it may continue in the years to come, it's difficult to anticipate exactly of course. The thing that we can anticipate is the normal amortization of the PPA of the banking book and we have given the figure in the last slide. It's 600 million euros again. As for the rest, probably there will be some but we cannot give any indication more than that, and that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In term of the ROE target, when we say 15% is challenging, it is really very much in the context of the present regulatory environment where I want to really make two points. The first one is that, even under the 7% new capital definition Basel III for 2018, I mean, this will be because of the new definition, this is quite a high level of capital. We have no problem, no problem that we will somehow comfortably reach it by retaining earnings.</p>
          <p>But, therefore, we are piling up more and more equity every year, which means that to keep and even more to increase the return on equity, you need your profits to really grow constantly at a steady pace. And while this is what we want, but it is a challenge. And the second thing is that we are not yet sure that there will not be a finishing line around CFEs  which should be for BNP Paribas, which will most probably will be considered CFE, a higher number, which then creates an even higher challenge.</p>
          <p>So this is why I think that until we get the final picture, we think, well, it's responsible for management to continue to keep the target but to emphasize that it is challenging. It will be challenging depending on what's the finishing of -- if we were to stay around the present rules, it will be, well, it's already a challenge. Anything higher will be even more challenging but that's the sense &#x2013; I think this is the sense we want to have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add something. After that it's a kind of race between the phasing in of all those new regulations and the re-pricing of the loans, because, of course, all those new constraints are pushed down to the businesses in the internal functioning of all banks. And it translates and it will translate more and more into wider spreads, higher rates for the clients and necessarily, well, at some point, there is a kind of strong mitigating effect on the top line as well. So it's, well, then it's a kind of race and we'll see how it evolves over the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Alessandro Roccatti from Macquarie FPK. Three questions, if I may. The first one is on financing where we've seen revenues down 9% quarter-on-quarter that was due to reprofiling of the CTBE division. I'm just wondering whether you can explain what this reprofiling is, and how long will it take?</p>
          <p>The second question is on interest rate sensitivity. On Slide 52 you gave us some indications of the directions of the profit and loss in case of increase and decrease of interest rates. Just wondering whether you can quantify in terms of hundreds of millions what the sensitivity is to a balance shift of, let's say, hundred basis points? And the second question related is how this government bond hedge is working? If you can give us any detail on that?</p>
          <p>And finally, going back to the return on equity, the sustainable 15%, which you have reiterated just today, 12% is what you are achieving now, so there is an upside in the medium term of an increase of profitability of roughly 20%. Quite interestingly you also mentioned the profitability of the CAC quarante. I'm just wondering &#x2013; that's something which has been done actually by the CEO of SoGen yesterday. So there is some common thinking between the two banks. I was just wondering whether you feel pressure that if the banks are not able to deliver a return on equity in line with the other sectors or above the other sectors, you think there is a possibility of shift away, of asset location, away from the banks into other sectors in the medium term or long term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I will start with the last question. Well, apparently it's by chance that we have the same idea. I think that just -- it's mostly, if I may, to the French audience and public that we want to tell them that it's enough, you know, 12% is something that we should not go down because then we need to get capital and we need to be either equal or above the other sectors, but certainly now below. So, I think that was the message. And I think it's important that it come through, and it's maybe also a way to try to tell to the regulators and to the authorities that you shouldn't pile up equity in such a quantity that you're going to create problems. I think that was the idea. On Slide 52...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, about the Slide 52, the quantification first. You'll find it in the financial statements on Slide 85. We are giving the sensitivity of revenues to the general interest rates risk based on 100 basis point increase in interest rate. And unsurprisingly, given what we are showing on Slide 52, it's almost zero. So the aim and the mission &#x2013; the mission statement of the central <mark type="inaudible" /> management is to try and immunize completely the revenues of the Retail Banking, of all the banking book from the interest rate movements. And while it's really quite easy it's done as well &#x2013; it's relatively well done as shown &#x2013; as far as the level of interest rates is concerned.</p>
          <p>Of course it's a bit more difficult as the year curve is concerned. And as you remember, when the interest rates were very flat and low and when the prospect was relatively that it could last for some number of time, you were worried about that and you were asking. And we were also saying that yes, if it were to last too long it could become a difficult situation. And to the contrary, the steep yield curve is something that is extremely favorable for that because of course you know.</p>
          <p>So, and you have to bear in mind and it's also the purpose of the Slide 52 to stress that steep yield curve, meaning long-term interest rates going up. It's a little bit akin to the debt tension and debt market tension and debt market being not in very good shape because when interest rates are going up bond prices are going down.</p>
          <p>So the purpose of the Slide 52 is to show that while the margin on deposits is of course going down if interest rates are going down, the bond &#x2013; the government bond return &#x2013; the return of government bonds is going up in that case. And because the &#x2013; in case of the interest rates going down, the spread we are making is improving. And then this is what goes into the P&amp;L. So this is what I would say deep into the P&amp;L. It's for real, I would say forever to a certain extent. And, but all those bonds are classified as available for sale. And there are mark-to-market in the balance sheet rules, yeah. But this is more fluctuating. And when interest rates were going down, the bond value was going up and Latin gains were piling up and now it's the opposite. But this is more fluctuating and temporary. And this is why we totaled the lines around the arrows to show that's it's more fluctuating in essence. And that's it.</p>

          <p>I'm not sure that everybody understands. CTBE speaks for commercial transaction in banking Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is what we mention as One Bank in Europe for mid-cap, I would comment on that. When we inherited some portfolio Fortis in Europe there were some risky clients. And as BNP Paribas we prefer to lose some revenues not to add some provisions for the first years. So the future of CTBE commercial transaction banking in Europe is just to offer full-service for the subsidiary of large companies all over Europe or from large U.S. companies, and also to help mid-cap in Europe to develop in high finance and in cash management.</p>
          <p>So the first move would naturally be to reduce the portfolio. So we have reduced the revenue. It's over as I mentioned, so not really too relevant. Now we will fulfill new portfolio of new clients of the subsidiary, of existing clients of Belgium companies, French companies, Italian companies in this business. So as I mentioned, we have seen the bottom in this particular area.</p>

          <p>And the third question, I consider the combination of the following factors: you look better capitalized than your French peers; you've got low funding costs; you probably have still for a few years subdued loan growth outlook. Then you have a great track record in acquiring banks with restructuring potential. So I was just wondering, when I look at the Italian market and the Spanish market where you have already a lot of activity, how you were thinking about that in terms of maximizing value possibly from the BNP platform now and in particular in light of the <mark type="inaudible" /> situations? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will answer the last question. As we said, as I said, I think in the moment we will be very disciplined on our acquisition criteria. We believe that in the new regulatory environment it is very important that anything you acquire, in terms especially of price, is really very, very disciplined, because the &#x2013; so most probably we believe that this year we will see. But we're going to concentrate on organic growth and then when we're not really in the mindset, except if we find something, well an opportunity which is really financially and industrially compelling, and we need fully to have both to be acquisitive.</p>
          <p>And as regards the fixed income margins...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fixed income margin, let's see. We have not actually entered a situation where we were in the beginning of 2009, where the market <mark type="inaudible" /> There were a few number of actors who let's say their margins were very, very high. Now let's say first of all in the Flow business we have the volume effect. When I mentioned for example that we are first in bonds in euro, you have seen that not only in 2010 but since the beginning of 2011 we have a big flow of new issuance of bonds. So as the volume is there the margins are equal, so at the end the revenues are very strong.</p>
          <p>Concerning the Flow business, the volume is out there. Concerning the <mark type="inaudible" /> business, let's say we think that we don't see any more the margins going down. So we have a type of stable level. The main question we can have is what will happen after the Basel 2.5. For me I think I'm personally a little optimistic when I'm looking at what some competitors are saying. They are saying we are using a lot of fixed income of mitigation effect. They speak of $100 billion of reduction of risk-weighted asset. So I wouldn't see that with a very great interest because probably either they will leave some business or they will increase the margin. So globally I think it could be very interesting for subject in BNP Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question it's very interesting strategy question. In fact, the two kind of assets you are mentioning I'm not sure they are competing with each other I think. So the business is one thing and because you are a bank and you are conducting a business, you need a certain amount of equity and for the time being it is even a growing amount of equity. But you always needed a certain amount of equity and now that equity what &#x2013; because in terms of funding as for BNP Paribas, please, you have plenty of funding so you can borrow money and you can fund your activity with borrowed money.</p>
          <p>So your equity, how do you invest it? If you invest it in, well, the regulators dream is that we would invest it 100% in government bonds, but I don't know if it would be your dream. Or I mean &#x2013; and in recent times, it was not paying a very high level of revenues if you were investing everything in government bonds.</p>
          <p>So at the end you end up with the idea that you have some room for kind of diversification and maybe you are going to invest part of your equity, not in government bonds, but in other things in kind of strategy stakes, like with AXA, or in real estate like Kl&#xE9;pierre. So it's not an operating business, as we said, it's classified in the corporate center but it's something that is a way to diversify somewhat the investment of our equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To make another answer also to your question as the regulators are becoming tougher and tougher, you can see that to absolute level of equity owned by BNP Paribas is flat or slightly decreasing. So as we increase our own equity, a part of equity is relatively decreasing clearly, and this is a long-term trend.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Hi. It's Omar Fall from UBS. One question firstly on the numbers, just at BancWest you saw a sharp fall in the cost of risk this quarter. And I was just wondering, you know given usually there's a seasonal uptick in Q4 and delinquency rates are flattish, if there was anything in there, any exceptionals that drove some of that fall? Or is that really the base we should work off when we're looking at our forecast going forward? That's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, on consumer credit, you talked about the strong year that you've had, which is totally fair. However, I guess being as this business is wholesale funded, how much emphasis are you going to be putting on it going forward? Do you think you can maintain the same levels of growth given some of the pressures that you're seeing on liquidity from a regulatory perspective?</p>
          <p>And then, third question, just on the balance sheet, the notional balance sheet. You talked about the reductions that you've made there, particularly on the trading side. Can you just talk about where you believe you need to get to in terms of the balance between the short-term balance sheet and the longer term balance sheet, please? If there's any more work you can do on the repo side or anything else.</p>
          <p>And then last question, just on growth actually because clearly you know you're very biased from a geographic footprint perspective to developed Western Europe, which has been great in terms of maintaining strong asset quality through the crisis. But as we get through, you know, a slow recovery, does that concern you in any way? Are you looking for ways to rebalance your geographic footprint? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you can answer to that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for BancWest what we expect for next year is a decrease in cost of risk. We cannot expect that what we've seen in the last quarter is going to give the trend for the full 2011 years because cost of risk is going down. What is most interesting in BancWest is we're now running the development plan. There is a potential for this bank over three to five years in just an organic way. And we are working at that. 2011 will still be an in-between year. We need to adapt. We need to invest. But just after that we should see the result of the investment programs, so it's a nice operation. It's a business we know quite well. We can add a number of elements that were fair and expect it to be franchised also. So this is the future for BancWest. For personal finance, in fast personal finance you have twofold. You have the Mortgage business and you have the Consumer Credit business.</p>
          <p>Consumer Credit business is half in terms of total balance sheet roughly speaking, and the Mortgage side is also the second part. Those are in terms of balance sheet more or less of the same size. So if you look at the new regulation, these two businesses are quite different, because Mortgages is a story of very long-term funding, and most probably that kind of businesses will not have exactly the same future as previously. And well the key element is are you in a position when you are renting your mortgage loan to a customer, are you in a position to transfer over the cycle this customer, meaning more or less can you sell it or cross-sell to a retail network that will do other things? These are your own retail networks or third parties retail networks. So this is just from a strategy standpoint, for a situation for personal finance.</p>
          <p>But for the pure Consumer Lending business, it's a very strong franchise full of expertise, and obviously we've seen over the two last years a number of competitors exiting that sector. So this explains why we've been able to re-price as part of this while looking also with personal finance at new countries in which we could try to have, I would say, new partnerships, even including universal banks. So the pure Consumer Loans business is totally adapted to the new regulation. There is no problem about that. The Mortgage Loans will have to be looked at in a different way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the balance sheet management is concerned, up until two years ago we are not really managing the size of the balance sheet at all. We were focusing on risk and liquidity management. And since the Basel II talks, clearly there is a leverage ratio looming in the future, so it's not going to be very soon, but nevertheless. And so we think that we have to manage the balance sheet and to make sure that we will be more or less in line relatively with the leverage ratio. So the leverage ratio, it's Tier 1, total Tier 1 roughly on cash balance sheet plus off balance sheet, I said that, that way. While we are there now at 3% so we &#x2013; I mean, wow, so we are happy with the current side...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question on the growth. I think that regarding the growth prospect the first comment I would make is that regarding the Eurozone countries, we believe that &#x2013; first of all, two things. Regarding retail, we could continue to outperform the market and we've seen this market in loan growth and in deposit growth some solid growth. So we expect this to continue to be, well, rather low single digit numbers but over perform the market.</p>
          <p>Always in Europe I think for CIB and for IS, which is an important part of the group, we see &#x2013; especially for CIB, but also for IS, we see a bright future. In the context of the Basel III new capital requirements, we believe that there will be a significant disintermediation of corporate financing, and there our CIB platform, whether fixed income, or all of its products, considering also our corporate position in Europe. There the organic growth of our CIB platform should be, well, high we see year after year, but significant growth coming from structural change in the market over the last ten years.</p>
          <p>Also for Investment Solutions considering the mix of business we have, we think that we can have, well, significantly higher revenue growth than in retail banking. So the Eurozone, the combined growth of revenues considering the full model of retail CIB and IS should be fairly higher than the, well, than the GDP growth of those countries.</p>
          <p>Then we have the &#x2013; basically our emerging market retail operations, certainly Poland, but Turkey would be the best example, where we are running in a significant market the full integrated model, again, having retail CIB and IS as Jean-Laurent explains, running, well, with a strong strategy to capture some of the growth in the different financials for the segments of this key market. So that should really add growth to BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>And then outside of Europe in Asia and Latin America we have organic development plans both for CIB and IS, which by the way explains some of the relatively high organic cost growth that we've seen in IS and CIB, and that should deliver strong growth of revenues in this region. And so BNP Paribas should, with CIB and IS, capture growth.</p>
          <p>If you just taking two examples -- in Investment Solutions, if we take insurance, certainly we have presently a partnership with State Bank of India in India; it's really &#x2013; it has been created 10 years ago. It was small. Then it was medium. Then it's getting bigger and bigger, and it continues to grow very, very nicely. So we have partnerships also in Taiwan and we have other partnerships in Asia. And we have also the insurance activity growing fast, also for our creditor protection insurance in Latin America, all over Latin America.</p>
          <p>And as for CIB, we have just launched an organic plan for the next two, three years to grow organically both in Latin America and mostly for CIB around Brazil, and in Asia, as Georges mentioned, especially in China, India. And we're going to organically capture some of the growth there. So this is the picture. If and when an acquisition come to complement that, we'll see. But once again for the moment we believe that we have a lot to lever in the new group &#x2013; in the group in its new dimension across these different geographies.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeremy Sigee from Barclays Capital. Two questions, please. Firstly, you touched earlier on Basel III, obviously, and the comment about other banks undergoing fairly severe mitigation programs. At the Q3 stage the numbers you gave for your own projections were relatively benign in terms of the Basel III impact compared to other banks. And I think you didn't specify any mitigation, so again, just that it would be less than other banks. Is that still your expectation? I mean do you reconfirm those projections for the Basel III impacts on your business, which sounds like it's a relative advantage versus some of your peers?</p>
          <p>Second question, separately, in some of the divisions, BeLux Retail, BNL and Personal Finance, there was an increase in costs in the quarter compared to Q3, which I think caused some of the variance versus consensus estimates this morning. Is that cost increase in BeLux, BNL, Personal Finance roughly sort of 10% quarter on quarter in those divisions? Is that purely seasonal? Or is there any underlying increasing cost trend in those divisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On question one, yes. We reconfirm, fully reconfirm. The first step, which is going to occur at the end of this year already, I mean Basel 2.5, as they say, should entail a risk-weighted asset increase of 40 billion euros or something like that for us. So it's really small. It's something like maybe 60 basis points ratio, something like that. So on a pro forma basis we are 8.6% if you want, there's a way to say the same thing. And then the whole Basel III up to the end, we are including those 40 billion euros. We are still confirming that our estimate is around 200 basis points, while I would say a smooth start over the 8-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On cost, these figures are not really relevant. You really need to look at the fourth quarter on the fourth quarter 2009, you have a strong seasonal effect in France, Italy, Belgium that are different, but they do exist. So this is the situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Virginia Martin from Evolution. I recall you gave a guidance for CIB revenues of 3.2 billion some time ago, and maybe I'm wrong. I was just wondering, bearing in mind that now you're talking about organic growth in emerging markets, lots of investments and so on and so forth, whether that target is maintained or whether that target is increasing? That would by my first question.</p>
          <p>Then the second question is related to acquisitions. If I recall last...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please, the second question is regarding?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I recall you said in Q3 that you would be looking at acquisitions if they were interesting and apparently there was -- you had some interest in Poland and there were some rumors about some other acquisitions in the pipeline. And now you're saying that you are just going to grow organically. Now, it seems that there's a change of thinking in there, and I'm wondering if that is due to maybe a worsening of the regulatory environment? I'm wondering, first of all, if there's a change in thinking there? And what is it due to?</p>
          <p>And my third question would be regarding BNL, because every time that we look at BNL cost to income seems to be decreasing. So my question is whether there's a target in cost to income there? And also cost of risk seems to be high with respect to what can be achieved, so whether there could be &#x2013; which would be your expectations in terms of cost of risk?</p>
          <p>And my final question would be regarding the systemic charge. If you have any thoughts of how much it could be for a bank like BNP, and also which kind of capital do you think it will be, whether it will be core capital or whether it might be CoCos or a mixture of those two? And that's all. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with your last question I don't think we want to somehow be guessing what regulators will &#x2013; I can tell you what we think we deserve. We think we have been very clear that the 7% high quality Basel III capital is quite sufficient for our group. I think that like BNP Paribas has shown over the last five years, beating earnings are beating in value per share that we were able to create value and so we think it's quite sanctioned. Whether this will be the final decision, the jury's still out. So we'll see. I don't want to somehow be guessing. Regarding the BNL, both on the cost of income target and the cost of risk, Jean-Laurent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost income, as I told you we're now in line with the market. So I would say we did the job. It's always possible to go down but pretty low, so maybe one day we'll be at 55, but this is very strong. Cost of risk, we would expect that over the cycle progressively cost of risk would decrease maybe 75 basis point is something reasonable. Most of the cost of risk of BNL is coming from the traditional mid-size portfolio of small, medium corporates from the BNL. We are shifting this business from small to larger mid cap companies. So this will ease, of course, in the medium term the level of the cost of risk. That's it.</p>
          <p>And in terms of acquisitions, just to add something, we said that we might be ones interested in markets in which we are already operating like Poland or Italy, but we need to have targets. We need to have decent price. This is true that last summer we were in the competition for the <mark type="inaudible" /> in Poland. But if you look at the final price, of course out of reach for our own internal targets. This is the situation, and it seems that there are no banking assets at a decent price. So this is the way it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that because we feel that, we want to communicate to our shareholders that this is the state of mind for BNP Paribas for the present time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps to move to your first question concerning the CIB, perhaps we can move to Slide 31. I would like to make some comments. Last year, beginning of 2010, we would like to be, in order to be very clear with the market, we were surprised that the level of the revenues of CIB in 2009 was exceptional, and we said our targets quarter after quarter is to be between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009, that means between 2.5 billion euros and 3.5 billion euros of revenues per year. I think we have delivered. We don't say you now 12 billion euro is an exceptional level. We say nothing. So that means that probably we don't think it is an exceptional level.</p>
          <p>So what could we say globally? I'm sorry to be mid-term oriented. If you look back just a moment to the situation of 2006-2007, the best level for CIB or BNP Paribas was 8 billion euro of revenues. Now we are at  12 billion euro of revenues. And the pool, the global pool of the profession is done. So I don't want to mention quarter after quarter what will be the revenues, because the market is so volatile, I don't know if there will be some crisis somewhere.</p>
          <p>But the message is we will continue to grow the revenues year after year not quarter after quarter, too difficult for me. Year after year to continue to increase the level of contribution, not relative  contribution because retail will go up also, but to increase the absolute contribution of CIB in terms of revenues and net income. But quarter after quarter, I don't know; too early to have any view on that. But you see the level? Five years ago and now, this is my answer.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. This is Jacques-Henry Gaulard from Autonomous. Two questions; I would like to piggyback on the question of my colleague from Evolution; that's very important. You have gained market share in CIB during the crisis. It's very important. I mean no other European bank except Barclays that bought Lehman did the same. However, it's buried on Slide 36. It's one of your major growth driver probably, going forward. You're investing a lot of money in Asia. You're there, clearly. But somehow you don't have the feeling it gets the priority into the overall presentation or the way the group is maybe perceived from the outside that it should have. So is this a question of more isn't that the big driver of the growth of BNP Paribas in the next three, four, to five years? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is a bit more, I would say technical. You &#x2013; or presentation, more accurately, you gave a one-off slide, which was insisting on the PPAs and on the asset impairment. But that slide was not mentioning the restructuring charges that you had. Should we consider the restructuring charges as recurring because you're going to have another $600 million next year? Or is it just you know the tail end of Fortis and 2011 that's going to be it for the restructuring charges? You see what I mean? I mean how recurring or non-recurring these restructuring charges are? Because unfortunately you had to dig the information a little bit into many different places into the presentation. So how should I view them? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the restructuring charges, yes, we are &#x2013; we always gave a clear indication. I mean Fortis it's a big &#x2013; it's a big merger. And it occurs over several years. So yes, in truth, to a certain extent it's not just one year. But, so we have &#x2013; we are saying that next year, so in 2011, I mean, it's going to be 600 million and so giving you an indication after the current 700 something, 780 or something like that, 780. And in 2012 you will have a kind of tail definitely because of Turkey, because Turkey's restructuring is one-year postponed compared with the main restructuring. And maybe some tail effect on the rest as well. So, but it's going to be much lower.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your question on the &#x2013; clearly CIB is a core activity of BNP Paribas. Maybe because we have only one CIB entity and we have now five or six retail entities you can have the feeling that we dedicate more time to reporting on retail than we do on CIB. But in terms of the equity we allocate in terms of the organic investments we are making in terms of the &#x2013; we are absolutely convinced that the CIB platform of BNP Paribas, both in terms of revenue growth and profit generation can continue to be a very significant contributor.</p>
          <p>Actually when we look on the return on equity and we look on the return on equity including goodwill, CIB has no goodwill, because we never acquired anything. So I think it's very important to say that, like French retail with also very strong profitability and there is absolutely no goodwill. So this CIB is very important to the group, because the earnings generation of CIB in terms of return on tangible equity is very significant. And we view that, as Georges said, behind &#x2013; the Basel 2.5, Basel III and then the new environment will once again make for the key periods of CIB we'll really have the right platforms with the right product offer, the right systems, IT, risk, compliance, all of which by the way, well, cost more and more each year.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons for the cost, the two reasons for the cost of CIB, you count from the CIB platform on a zero cost base, because compliance, risk, all of this in the last few years apart from organic growth in Europe and in Asia to grow the platform, this is a cost plus. This is a fact. So I think it will somehow favor the most &#x2013; well, the most important, they are also the most efficient players, and this is something we think really we want to continue to build. And this is very, very central to BNP Paribas business model and certainly here in London where we have in this building all of our fixed income operations and the head of fixed income, well, it's really managed here from London. So this is quite a strategic and core activity for BNP Paribas definitely.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can add something. Inside CIB, because CIB's corporate and investment banking, let's see as Baudouin mentioned, we will probably see a large disintermediation. So we think that mainly fixed income will benefit a lot, a lot of this disintermediation. Concerning the Financing business, as Philippe mentioned, we will have to see how the margins will react with the cost of liquidity because the liquidity, you know, a lot of what's about new the regulation and nobody knows exactly what will be the final goal of the figures of ACM.</p>
          <p>But at the end we have to take care of not to grow too much. Let's say the Financing business, if we are not sure that we are not okay between the margins and the cost of financing. And today it's not so simple. So the main push we are making concern investment banking because on this <mark type="inaudible" /> we are absolutely sure that due to the disintermediation, let's say, we will have a lot of work to do.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, as we are &#x2013; not in <mark type="inaudible" /> but for domestic market, when you see the cross-selling between retail and CIB, the more the group invest in retail, the more the CIB people is okay. But if you see in Belgium, let's say it's very good for CIB to develop, same in Italy. So globally when a part of the bank is growing, the other part is benefiting and so it's clear on that. So we have to take care on those points.</p>
          <p>We have also, you mentioned solvency but naturally we carefully look at liquidity and naturally we think, as Philippe mentioned, that the margins at the end will go higher, not necessarily next year, we don't know. Because if we see five years sure, in one or two year I'm not sure. So we will have to manage the growth of the Financing business, looking carefully at that.</p>

          <p>Hi. Shailesh Raikundlia from MF Global. I was just on the French retail side, I was just wondering whether you had the increase in the Livret A rates and see net interest margin starting to come down? Whether you could give some guidance as to where you think they are going, and the impact on the health of Livret A, especially since February, we had the 25 basis points increase?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the cost of risk, is that normalized levels now as far as French retail is concerned? And as far as, sorry, revenues are concerned, maybe just some guidance as to where you think the growth &#x2013; revenue growth is in the French retail side? We've seen 2% growth; is that sort of the normal levels going forward?</p>
          <p>And just finally a technical thing, I noticed that the tax charge was quite low in Q4. Was there anything funny in that, or it's just a one-off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jean-Laurent will answer on the Livret A and the revenue growth from the French retail banking, and Philippe will answer on the tax charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the Livret A, it's very difficult to make an assumption. Let's say that it's not going to increase this year, is it going to decrease, I don't know, in terms of spreads given to customers &#x2013; we don't know. The general assumption for the French retail in terms of revenues is 2% for 2011, so this is our, I would say, target, 2% of gross of the net banking income. So this is the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the taxes, you have to look at taxes, not on a quarter-after-quarter basis, because taxes are computed on a yearly basis. It's a cumulative yearly rate that is making sense. And by the way, it's the same in the middle of the year, it's a year-to-date rate, that makes sense. And here we are at 30%, and it's exactly the guidance we gave, 30%. So we had, well, it's a bit by luck. I mean, it could have been 29% or 31%, but it just happened that it's 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one follow-up question to some of the previous ones on CIB, actually. As much as there might be growth coming from there, clearly there is also an issue of returns. And could you tell us in fixed income, based on 2010 results, if Basel III would have been implemented today, would you have made a return above what you would consider to be your cost of capital? I don't know, be that 11%, 12%, 13%? I mean as a follow-up to that, are you concerned that having increased the share of fixed income within your CIB revenue pool this much, that that's going to weigh on returns relative to, say, equity derivatives, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we said in third quarter that the impact of Basel III on our business volume was very limited, because we are not &#x2013; you know, we didn't kind of create this space, securities, asset-backed securities, and so on. We are working more on derivatives, with a relatively low level of value at risk, as you have seen. And so we have said that as far as our market are concerned, and yes it's mostly fixed income, there are additional risk-weighted assets in the region of 50 billion euros or 60 billion euros progressing, out of which only 40 billion euros, as I said for Basel 2.5. And so if you take that into account in the return on equity, it remains extremely over our LIBOR and well above the cost of equity, no doubt.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up, actually. On the ALM hedging that you do, especially around the retail franchises, I just wanted to try and understand if there has been any change in terms of the duration of your hedges, whether you have shortened those hedges. And secondly, are you seeing any kind of competition for retail funding? In the event that that happened, do you think that BNP would feel obliged to participate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot the second question, but I can for the first one. It's &#x2013; there hasn't been any significant change, I would say. We always manage the balance with a long-term view. I mean a five, eight, ten years view. We mentioned that several times in the past already, on the discovering of the equity management today, and it has always been that way and it's no change at all.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>For deposits? Yes, you can see from time to time, some banks, local banks or regional banks, or direct banks that are pushing a bit too far, I would say price is paid on deposit, but nothing that is as of today are going to change the business model for domestic retailers in France, Belgium or Italy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon and congratulations on Fortis bank. Fortis bank is becoming relatively overcapitalized, which will hit you in Basel III. So my question is what is your preferred or most realistic solution to that? What would you prefer to us to meet the dividend, if you renew acquisitions before in Turkey? Or do you want to acquire the remainder 25% of the <mark type="inaudible" /> government? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that for the moment we certainly are ready to see a further, if there were like in Turkey, if there was an acquisition in some other territory where Fortis is active to be logical that that will be the vehicle. Regarding dividends it has to be decided with the other shareholder, and regarding buying back the minority stake of the Belgium government is not on the agenda. It's not yet on the agenda.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your question, well, I don't see BNP Paribas as you can imagine as a banking monster. I see BNP Paribas as a large integrated and well managed organization in financial services. But certainly one of the reasons why we will &#x2013; I will personally be cautious on significant acquisitions of significant size in the foreseeable future is we want to make sure we can, we can manage them, integrate them. And I think that size for size is certainly not. And getting bigger is not, is not really on our agenda.</p>
          <p>As regard the management, as regard the cost of safety, we had very much increased, but like any bank we have made in terms of internal control, in terms of compliance, in terms of, well risk, market risk; we are very much increased going forth, both the stuff and the number of the full time &#x2013; number of full time employees, and also the systems. And we are dedicating quite a strong &#x2013; and I think at BNP Paribas you know Finance division and here's the CFO, the finance, the risk, the liquidity and the &#x2013; and asset ability and also the compliance are very &#x2013; these are very strong group functions that are really keeping I think a tight control over the organization. And we have &#x2013; we have emphasized a lot this improvement as we have made very big investments in the last two, three years. And regarding...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question inaudible]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't translate it in constant commercial directly, but I'm sure that between compliance, audit and it's hundreds of full time employees, maybe like 1,000 that we have added in the last two, three years. So it is really very significant.</p>
          <p>I think, by the way, you know, we've seen it at BancWest in California which is because it is a $50 billion U.S. dollar bank in terms of balance sheet, it is considered a complex organization. If you look at BancWest's investment in compliance and in complying with the new rules, there the cost has been in the whether it's $20 million, $25 million U.S. dollar. And it's not &#x2013; it's also a big investment and BancWest does not sell these. So every bank around the world also independent of its size has seen its cost of control and its cost of being regulated increase. And I think this is a cost of doing business.</p>
          <p>This is also, by the way, a barrier to entry into the industry that both with equity entering now the banking business from the capital, from an equity position as much as from compliance, regulatory, how to manage it, is really building to my view a formidable barrier to entry.</p>
          <p>Getting back to your other question in comparison to AXA, we certainly are aware at BNP Paribas that we want to keep the right balance between I would say business line and geography. I want to make two concrete illustration. We nominated in January of this year, so a few weeks ago, for the first time a high-level BNP Paribas executive by the name of Eric Raynaud who is now posted in Hong Kong, between Hong Kong and Singapore, is the head, is the new head of Asia-Pacific, well, including actually Australia and Japan, and is the head for not only, he's  not only CEO of BNP Paribas CIB platform for Asia-Pacific but he is also overlooking our investment solutions and even our smaller retail initiatives. And so we really have now in Hong Kong a member directly reporting to the executive committee and really empowered more than ever before that is posted in Hong Kong to manage our strategy.</p>
          <p>And he will come back to the executive committee every two or three months to have a direct &#x2013; and then he's directly reporting to the, well, to the general management, who is really &#x2013; and this is quite new because we felt that in Asia we needed somebody with high, well, highly empowered sitting all the time out of Hong Kong, between Hong Kong and Singapore, but based in Hong Kong to manage the BNP Paribas strategy. And in terms of risk people, HR, he has, well, a small but let's say team of senior people working with him to make sure that out of Hong Kong we can manage our Asian operation.</p>
          <p>And the same was, we made the same now the Everett Schenk, who is the head of our New York CIB operations out of New York. He's responsible for North America, which for us includes mainly Canada and the United States.</p>
          <p>And so we have our key heads of regions have, I would say, more power and more responsibility than they had two or three years ago. So this is a tendency to move responsibilities to the key regions. I mentioned Asia, I mentioned New York and North America. I could also mention Brazil for Latin America, well, Louis Bazire, the head of Brazil is also a regional head. So this is a move that we have done and that we &#x2013; so I think we agree in a sense that in the world we live we need, for a number of reasons we need to have key executives of BNP Paribas really make accountable and also in part to manage the implementation of our strategy in the different key regions of the world to answer your question.</p>
