      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, we'll get going. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. I know it's been a big week. I have the executive team here with me and I've also got Lynne Peacock and David Thorburn on the phone. The agenda for the day will be as per previous results, I'll run through and just make any comments then Mark will take you through the result in more detail, and then we'll obviously go to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>This is a solid result. It demonstrates that we have set the right strategy for the group. We are executing well against this strategy, we're improving our return on equity and we are well-positioned to compete sustainably in an uncertain macroenvironment. Two years ago, I set out a strategy for NAB aimed at leveraging our strengths and addressing the issues that were driving the discount in our share price relative to peers. This strategy also reflected the operating and competitive environment we were facing in early 2009. Since that time, we have put the bank on a sustainable footing and made a series of decisions that we believe will position the bank to outperform over the medium to long term.</p>
          <p>Today's result is a product of this approach and reflects the steady progress we've been making, including strong cash earnings growth of 21.7% on March 2010 to almost $2.7 billion, reflecting NAB's continued strength in business banking, increasing momentum in personal banking, solid performances from the rest of our businesses, good cost control with positive jaws and some improvement in group asset quality.</p>
          <p>We have a strong balance sheet position with a Tier 1 ratio of 9.19% and a strong liquidity position. We are more than halfway through our FY '11 funding task of $25 billion to $30 billion. We have significantly improved return on equity, up 220 basis points versus this time last year. And we've increased our dividend by $0.06 to $0.84 from our 2010 final dividend of $0.78. Across all of our businesses, we have extended our leadership position or improved our position relative to peers. We are well prepared to benefit from improving economic conditions in our key markets and to manage the ongoing uncertainties in the regulatory and political landscape.</p>
          <p>With regard to the macro outlook, while I'm increasingly optimistic, uncertainty remains. Global economic recovery has continued despite key issues such as Eurozone sovereign debt concerns, political tension in the Middle East boosting oil prices and natural disasters in Japan. Despite these concerns, global growth is still forecast to grow by over 4% this year.</p>
          <p>In the Group's key markets, Australia has been a standout performer given strong commodity prices. However, we are operating in a multi-speed economy, with export and discretionary consumer spending exposed sectors continuing to suffer. That said, while the natural disasters, particularly in Queensland, have adversely impacted GDP, we expect this to be a short-term issue as it will mean higher growth from rebuilding and investment in the future. We are more optimistic the business credit growth will return in the second half of 2011 and we have seen some green shoots emerge in the last couple of months. We continue to watch this closely.</p>
          <p>Conditions in the U.K., while improved from a year ago, remain difficult with a long period of government austerity lying ahead and as the economy continues to shift towards an economic model more aligned with exports and business investments. New Zealand lies between Australia and the U.K. with high commodity prices, which boost exporter incomes, but as in the U.K., a weak housing and consumer sector. The Christchurch earthquake has also had an adverse impact on GDP. Both the U.K. and New Zealand are experiencing very low credit growth reflective of these conditions.</p>
          <p>With regard to the regulatory environment, while Basel III requirements are now clearer, APRA's interpretation is still to be worked through, particularly on liquidity. The covered bond legislation is a good first step in Australia; however, we still need to take steps to address the wholesale funding gap.</p>
          <p>While the political environment is less heated due to increased competition in the Australian banking sector, the potential for political adversity intervention remains. The Senate inquiry is set to release its findings tomorrow. Fee class actions and other consumer pressures continue, but we see limited downside risk to NAB from these continuing pressures. Overall, while the macroenvironment remains uncertain, we feel more optimistic that things will continue to improve over near to medium term.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased with the progress we are making and how we are positioned. At a Group level, we have anticipated and managed for regulatory and political change. We continue to make good progress with transforming our business processes and re-platforming the bank. And we've made great progress with our employee engagement and focusing our senior leadership on enterprise outcomes.</p>
          <p>In our Australia and New Zealand businesses, we are either maintaining our market leadership or closing the gap to our competitors. We believe we have prepared these businesses well to deal with any changes to the legislative or regulatory or competitive environment. Lots of progress has been made but there is still room for improvement in all of our Australian businesses. For this reason, Australia remains our key focus.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., we are performing better than market benchmarks and managing the business well in the areas we can control. Local management are focused on ensuring they're managing the business on a sustainable organic basis. However, we will still be subject to the impacts of a changing environment and we continue to manage to maintain optionality.</p>
          <p>The SGA team has managed the rundown of assets and risks in that portfolio very well. We tore up the three shorter dated of our six SCDO trades after the 31 March balance date. We'll continue to explore opportunities to exit the remaining SCDOs subject to market conditions.</p>
          <p>Our key focus is to continue to improve the relative performance of our businesses, improve their competitiveness and sustainability, and by doing so, improve return on equity and deliver relative TSR outperformance.</p>
          <p>A key part of delivering sustainable outcomes is our ongoing focus on a suite of transformation programs of which NextGen is an important part. In combination, these transformation programs will deliver improved customer experience, better services delivered at a lower cost improving financial returns, a targeted upgrade and replacement of existing infrastructure to ensure it is fit for purpose for the future and reduce our operational risk.</p>
          <p>The three core areas of our program reflect this approach. They are infrastructure and network transformation, which is about getting the infrastructure layer right, ensuring that the plumbing and wiring are in place. The re-platforming program, which is the core application layer that builds the functionality across core banking, enterprise systems and customer-facing system. This is what is referred to as NextGen. It's only one component of the overall transformation program. It includes the underlying databases, analytic and delivery engines, product engines and end-user applications that are built and implemented over time. And the final stream is the customer process transformation and this represents the business processes and people capabilities required to effectively deliver the customer experience at the front end.</p>
          <p>A significant amount of work has been done and progress made since the program commenced. For instance, we have completed the whole end-to-end design and the detailed architectural plans have been done. We've made significant process improvement, particularly in mortgages, UBank is operational, 28% of our branches have been upgraded with network modernization, we've agreed and commenced the three-year transformation of our infrastructure program with IBM, we've deployed our securitization engine, campaign management, customer analytics applications into MLC. And this calendar year, we will release a key foundation of the core banking application, we'll implement a new general ledger in Australia, and we'll add additional functionality to the securitization engine, greatly helping our funding capability, particularly with covered bonds on the agenda.</p>
          <p>To close, I'm increasingly optimistic on the outlook and our position. We will continue to focus on our strategic priorities. We will continue to improve the performance of our Australian franchise. We are well positioned for a return to business credit growth. We will continue to drive momentum in our Personal Banking business, and we will maintain strong balance sheet settings. We will also continue to focus on sustainable business process and infrastructure improvement. We'll manage the optionality of our international franchises, and ensure that they do not detract from our focus on balance sheet safety while improving their returns.</p>
          <p>M&amp;A is not an active area for the group. We will continue to look at small bolt-ons in the U.S., if they emerge in the right geographic and price construct. We'll continue our small direct investments in direct asset management. In the U.K., we will continue to monitor the market.</p>
          <p>In closing, I'm very confident in our strategy, the strength and capability of our leadership, and their ability to execute. Most importantly, the continuous improvement and enthusiasm, engagement and performance of our people will continue to build our momentum and improve our return on equity.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now hand over to Mark who will take you through the result in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Cameron, and good morning, everybody. Good to see you here. As Cameron highlighted, we think this is a very solid result. We're delivering a 12% cash earnings growth sequentially, 22% at PCP. If we put aside foreign exchange and a fairly substantial swing in the SCDO mark to markets about $126 million pre-tax sequentially. We've still got a sequential cash earnings growth of 9.2%.</p>
          <p>At the group level, the pleasing aspects of the result are these. We've got nearly 5% sequential revenue growth, and on a constant currency basis, that's 6.6%. We've achieved flat costs, which has delivered the positive jaws we talked about last time we were together.</p>
          <p>We have between 9% and 10% underlying profit growth both sequentially and on a PCP basis, indicating an acceleration in the last half. The lift in ROE that Cameron mentioned is now running above 15%. We have a stable NIM with re-pricing benefits offset mainly by asset and deposit mix effects that I'll take you through in a moment. And we have substantial core capital generation despite the $11 billion growth in our GLAs. And in fact on a pre-FX basis, the GLA growth is $16 billion, $14 billion of it coming in housing. And so, that's delivered the core tier 1 &#x2013; the tier 1 ratio rather, at 9.2%, as Cameron said.</p>
          <p>Less pleasing in the result is the stickiness of the bad debts, although they are still falling. The bad debt expense is down 4.4% sequentially. Excluding foreign exchange, and SGA and the wholesale bank both had very good bad debt expense outcomes. If you put those three things aside, the bad debt expense is actually up by $80 million. Now that reflects a number of factors not least the two-speed economy in Australia that you hear much about, but also the natural disasters we've had here and in New Zealand. And of course, the fragility of the economic conditions in markets outside of Australia that we operate.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that we did put aside in this period a total of $100 million for the various natural disasters, which brings the balance sheet amount that we're holding against those disasters to $120 million, because we had taken some in the last half to do with the &#x2013; related to the first Christchurch earthquake. And we will review these overlays in the second half because during the second half, the actual customer outcome should be evident in our provisioning models, and we probably won't need the overlays. So, our bad debt expense is now at 43 basis points, which is our long-run average for a full cycle.</p>
          <p>I'm going to take you through the business units. I'm going to focus primarily at the underlying profit level, because I think it gives you the best sense of what's going on, but I will point out the differences in conclusions down below at the cash earnings level. So first of all, starting with the Business Bank, the Business Bank achieved 4.7% sequential underlying profit growth, despite, as you all know, a weak sector performance, and heightened largely price-based competition over recent months in particular.</p>
          <p>And we had pleasing share gains, there are RBA statistics and APRA statistics &#x2013; I'm using the RBA here. RBA market share now is at 22.2%, which is up 16 basis points over the half. We had growing volumes against a sluggish system. The balance sheet grew $1.5 billion on a spot basis, which was 1.9 times the RBA system measure of system growth. We also achieved a margin expansion of seven basis points over the period, and the business delivered positive jaws.</p>
          <p>Of course, the big issue here is still waiting for the system uplift in business credit; we are starting to see some of that. March was a decent month and we do see still a healthy pipeline. So, if you look to the back of our appendix, you'll see our economists are now forecasting plus 10% in business credit for FY '12. But they have been wrong before.</p>
          <p>Personal Banking, we had 7.6% sequential underlying profit growth, and that business also delivered strongly positive jaws. That reflects primarily a re-pricing that you know happened just before Christmas with volume and share gains. Albeit that the margin effects of that re-pricing is quite muted in the first half. We should see much more of it in the second half. And the Personal Bank achieved 10% growth in spot housing volumes in the half. We've also been continuing to invest in that business and improve customer service, mortgage processing and the like. And we are seeing customer satisfaction gains on a relative basis and expenses in the Personal Bank were up 2.9%. There is some NIM decay and it's to do with growth in mortgages offsetting much of the price uplift, and also some negative deposit mix, which I'll take you through in a little while.</p>
          <p>The Wholesale Bank was up 26% sequentially coming off the bottom in markets, much as we had foreshadowed. There's some pickup in sales and trading, but the activity is actually still quite subdued. So, we have been gaining share in customer accounts, but customer trading activity was relatively stable and predictable interest rates and foreign exchange for much of the period has been more muted. And we had a weaker contribution from treasury given our particular market features. We've had a good period in specialist finance, we've won eight of the last 11 infrastructure mandates, and we're starting to see that win-rate showing through in revenues for that business as well.</p>
          <p>The U.K. continues its slow turnaround with underlying profit up only 2%, reflecting the economic fragility there. The balance sheet is flat despite shrinking &#x2013; continuing to shrink the commercial real estate book with small share gains in all categories and margins slightly up. We obviously need the U.K. economy to get stronger and in particular, interest rates to start rising in that country for us to get back to our full profitability. Also, you should note in this result, we have been handling flow of PPI refunds, as they are settling those claims as they are submitted to us, with costs going mainly through the OOI line and that was &#xA3;15 million impact for the half.</p>
          <p>New Zealand is very stable, reflecting the weak recovery that we see in that market and again low system activity. So, the New Zealand Bank is up only 0.5%. There were slight gains in market share across most products, giving rise to a small increase in balance sheet. The GLAs are up about 1% on a sequential basis in New Zealand. The margins are stable at an improved level with shift to mortgages and some customer re-pricing helping, but we have accelerated the terming out of our finance in New Zealand and that has largely offset that gain.</p>
          <p>On MLC &amp; NAB Wealth, the pleasing aspects of the results are that we had earnings growth of $28 million, which is 7.8% sequential with falling expenses. FUM, average FUM was up $7 billion and PIF up 3.8% on a sequential basis. The Wealth cost-to-income ratio fell 2.3 percentage points to 59.1%. The adviser recruitment has good traction, net adviser gross of 172, but that did include one acquisition. The Aviva integration continues to be ahead of timeline and ahead in delivering on cost synergies. And importantly, we had the launch of the MLC Wrap platform during the period, which was very well received and is an important first step in our platform rationalization. And, of course, the business continues to be well-positioned for the regulatory changes taking shape under FoFA [Future of Financial Advice].</p>
          <p>Less attractive in this result on the Wealth side will be some share loss in some areas. Actually root cause of which is planned product relaunches. As you go into a period of planned product upgrades, you tend to have less traction with the old products. So that has insurance flows, share of flows being below our existing market share, and the same on the retail funds flow, but we do expect to correct that in forward periods. The margin outcome is also down as on the investments side, we have shifted investment mix towards wholesale. And insurance claims remain above the long-term trends, although as you know, that's very much an industry issue.</p>
          <p>And then finally, SG&amp;A, it's now profitable due to $126 million swing in the pre-tax mark-to-markets on the SCDOs, but more importantly an 80% drop in the bad and doubtful debts, to only $21 million for the half. We are taking steps to further shrink and de-risk that portfolio, but we're pleased with the runoff as it is progressing. GLA is now down to $5.6 billion, RWA is at $18 billion. And excluding foreign exchange, RWAs are down about $5 billion over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>If you look then down to the cash earnings line, the four main areas of difference are this; that the Wealth result doesn't look as strong at the cash earnings level because we had about a $25 million tax true-up in the September half that doesn't recur in this period. In the personal bank, the growth in cash earnings is substantially below the underlying because there's a $45 million rise in the bad and doubtful debts. That is almost entirely attributable to the credit card portfolio, where a combination of normal Christmas-related seasonality, repayment holidays that we've given to customers affected by floods, and the fact that during the payments outage before Christmas, we diverted collection staff to helping customers manage through that. A combination of those things have actually delivered higher delinquency statistics in the credit card portfolio that is driving provisioning, but we do expect to get some of that back in the second half.</p>
          <p>In fact, the picture on the mortgage side is substantially different. And in the Australian Bank as a whole, the mortgage arrears are at 54 basis points, which is basically flat with September and down on PCP. So we're not seeing any stress in the mortgage book whatsoever. And the Personal Bank aggregate 90-day past due and GIA to GLA is also down five basis points to 66 basis points, notwithstanding the increase in the bad and doubtful debt charge.</p>
          <p>The U.K. then is much better at the cash earnings line than it is at underlying, given its downward trend in bad and doubtful debts, and we've also had a lower corporate tax rate announced in the U.K. and we have a blended tax rate in this period as we shift to that setting. And New Zealand very similarly is also better given lower B&amp;DD, and a lower but more normal effective tax rate. We had an above normal tax rate in the September half, and that doesn't recur.</p>
          <p>So then to dig into some of the main line items at a group level, focusing first of all on revenue. And at an aggregate level, all the businesses really are back to growth. As I said before, the total revenue growth was 4.7% sequential. And as you look at the stacked bar chart on the left, you can see all the businesses are basically lifting. It looks as though the U.K. and New Zealand are not but that's entirely FX related, and they grew 1.5% and 0.5% respectively underlying.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting, I think, as you look at this chart, the steadiness in the growth of revenues in the Business Bank despite much weakness in business banking sector where it's adding $100 million to $150 million of revenue every six-month period. And you can see the Personal Bank also accelerating off the March 10 base, adding $70 million and then $80 million in revenue in each of the sequential halves.</p>
          <p>If you go across the OOI side, OOI is up 12% sequential. A few points worth noting in there are; largely flat fees at the bottom, and we are pretty much re-based for all of our fee initiatives that have been taken over recent periods. The pickup in markets and treasury which is mainly coming in the markets' area, the actual trading income pickup is about $70 million; and a swing to positive in SGA, which is taking that negative &#x2013; largely accounting for the swing in other there from negative five through to plus 146. Putting aside the SCDOs and at constant FX, the OOI grew 8% in the period.</p>
          <p>NII grew to 2.1% sequential but is 5.2% without FX and the shrinking SGA, and the Wholesale Bank. The group NIM, as I said, was largely steady at 2.23%. If you look at the component drivers, you can see we basically picked up five basis points from re-pricing partly on the mortgage book in Australia, partly in the Business Bank as you've already heard, but also our foreign operations were active in re-pricing. At the group level, we gave up 1% in the deposit margin and mix, and the funding and liquidity costs from the continual roll-off of cheaper wholesale funding being replaced at higher rates, and our efforts to term out our funding book, creating a headwind of two basis points.</p>
          <p>And then, we have a lower contribution from markets and treasury, which is partly lower volatility. We didn't have a Greek &#x2013; helpful deep Greek debt crisis in this period. And we also have some accounting noise associated with customer pre-payments where we take the pre-payment fees in a prior period and we have the economic costs spread out over the period of the matching funding. So, at the customer side, if you take the first three, we're up about 2 basis points. But for a combination of accounting and treasury markets we're in total down 1 basis point.</p>
          <p>As you look over to the business, the main business components, you can see the Business Bank there picking up 7 basis points in the last quarter, and you know what's driven that. The Personal Bank is down 6 basis points. We estimate that we picked up about 6 basis points in the half from the re-pricing. We did get the effect, but we did delay implementing that. So, we had quite a period where the whole portfolio had not moved when the Reserve Bank had moved. But we have been growing substantially in mortgages, which as you know, is a low-margin product and tends to average down. So, that was probably only a small net increment, and we have seen about a 5 basis point headwind from mix on the deposit side with customers shifting to higher-yielding, from their point of view, deposit products.</p>
          <p>The U.K. bank, the NIM is up from re-pricing and better performance on the deposit side. We've created a headwind for them by giving them progressively lower capital benefit from the center, reflecting the low interest rates in the U.K. And we use a two-year rolling rate to do that. So the underlying NIM performance in the U.K. is better. And then, New Zealand, I already mentioned, was this offset between re-pricing and more aggressive terming out of the wholesale book.</p>
          <p>Future NIMs, we always get asked about, is pretty thin ice to forecast exactly where NIMs are going to be. But there are some interesting forces mustering on the NIM side that I think people should focus on. We are seeing heightened competition for assets as we are demonstrably in a low credit growth part of the cycle. There is an emphasis that's becoming clear under Basel III that certain types of deposits are much more valuable from a liquidity point of view than others. And so, there will be intense competition around those kinds of deposits. We will continue to have rising wholesale funding even though spreads have relaxed, and perhaps we're getting to the tail-end of the run-off of cheap funding. But we have in front of us a very substantial terming out that is required. So, we'll be moving along the yield curve at quite some cost. And you're going to begin to see migration in the liquidity books towards higher quality, more expensive to hold liquidity. So, all of those are potentially headwinds on NIM. A pleasing relief would be the expected growth on the business side rather than growth being all on the housing side, and that might provide some relief.</p>
          <p>If you look for a moment at the jaws and as we had hopefully foreshadowed last time, we flipped positive on the jaws this time. We have 4.7% revenue, basically flat on the costs, so nearly 5% jaws. And of course, the cost to income ratio has started to fall as a result. It's down from 46.2% to 43.9%. And on a SCDO, FX, cleaned up basis, we're still 3.3% positive in the jaws. And pretty much, all the businesses have delivered positive jaws as well. So at the moment, we're meeting our aspiration on that front.</p>
          <p>There are of course cost pressures in the business. We are investing more aggressively, you've got a five-period history here of our investment spend. And you can see we're operating at about $150 million above where we normally do, which is, I've been describing as the pig in the python hopefully, because it's an effort to really get some momentum in NextGen and then hopefully we can back off a little bit from that. But the fact remains that we have got a lot of investment going into transitioning the base. And we do continue to invest in the frontline. So we have retail kiosks, we have retail store refits, we have more customer service staff, and we've been adding bankers into the business bank. All of that of course drives costs as well.</p>
          <p>So as you would expect, we have quite substantial and ongoing efficiency initiatives in all the businesses and in the corporate center in order to mitigate that as best we can. So we will stay vigilant and we will continue to try and manage the business to positive jaws from here on.</p>
          <p>On the bad and doubtful debt side, repeating some of the points that I made, but you can see in the top left there the expense falling only by about $50 million to $988 million. We have not consciously adjusted any of our economic overlays or collective provisions and the like, certainly not down. And we have, as I said before, put an extra $100 million in for the natural disasters. So that decline in the expense is not assisted by anything deliberate on our part and in fact has had to do with the $100 million nonetheless.</p>
          <p>Our watch loans are falling. And if you look in the appendix at the roll forward on our credit RWAs, you'll see that in this period, we got our first release from credit scoring of capital, which means that the average credit quality in the portfolio had nudged slightly to the stronger during this period. So, we got $1.1 billion out of RWAs and it's the first time we've seen that for quite a while.</p>
          <p>We are now at 43 basis points expense. You can see here, given you the top of the blue line is our average expense back to 1980 and the bottom part of the blue line is our average expense since 1994. So, we're back to the long-run average and of course, we expect to spend much longer below that average than we do &#x2013; than we have above it.</p>
          <p>The negatives in the B&amp;DD mix are that the impaired assets grew. In the U.K., they're up &#xA3;100 million. In the Business Bank in New Zealand, they also grew and the 90-day past due grew in Business Bank, Personal Bank and New Zealand. But there are no particular areas of concern. There are some things that are flipped into impaired or behind that are well secured. And so we really see this is part of just the sorting out or the shaking out of the last parts of the cycle we've been through. Although the two-speed economy in Australia does promise to keep that going for some while.</p>
          <p>At a group level, our gross impaired assets are up two basis points to 1.37%, and the group 90-day past due is also up two basis points to 55 basis points. And as I said, the neutral factor in all this is that the Australian bank mortgage arrears are essentially flat at 54 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital position has improved from 8.91% to 9.19% and on the current regulatory measure, our core Tier 1 has improved from 6.8% to 7.12%. And you can see the main components there being the profitability. We are assuming in this that we have a 39 basis point &#x2013; sorry, 39% participation in our DRP because we've left our settings unchanged at no cap and a 1.5% discount. So including that, we had 27 basis points of business capital generation, even without the DRP, it's still a positive. And then we got a little bit back out of the U.K. pension, importantly, and a couple of other adjustments. So we're heading in the right direction on capital particularly the core Tier 1, which is becoming the primary focus under Basel III.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an update on how we see the transition to Basel III. There are these two main streams, the capital reforms and the funding reforms. As you've just seen on the capital side, we're sitting at a core ratio of 7.12%. For international comparison purposes, if we calculate our level based on the pure Basel III formulae, we're at 8.32%. But that's not the Australian position; the Australian position is governed by APRA's formulae. And based on &#x2013; there's still a good deal of uncertainty around this since there was last time we spoke, but based on where we think the Australian rules might fall harmonizing for downside effects, we think we'd currently be sitting at 6.73%. Last time I presented a number to you, it did not include an allowance for counter-party credit, it now does include that. So, all the factors are in there. And there is always the potential that through the harmonization, some of the things that are punitive in Australia might be relaxed, and the appendix gives you a sense of what that might be.</p>
          <p>So, APRA consultations are underway. We should see discussion papers in the middle of the year and we will go from there. So hopefully, by September we will have a clearer picture. One thing we know is going to be an important part of the transition on the capital side is hybrid and subordinated debt. And we suspect that our hybrid and subordinated debt instruments today will not meet the new Basel III standards, and we will be into a position of amortizing those in terms of how they qualify for Tier 1 from January 2013. And we're currently working as an industry with APRA to define what adjustments to the terms and conditions of those kinds of instruments would allow us to issue things that do qualify.</p>
          <p>On the funding side, we've been in a long balance sheet transition already, to move to more stable funding, and we've always reported to you our stable funding index, which is not the same as but is akin to the net stable funding ratio. There are really two aspects on the funding side; one is the liquidity coverage ratio, the other is the NSFR itself. And the liquidity coverage ratio is really the more important constraint. It comes into play earlier, it's January 2015. And it's going to force us along a path of averaging up the quality of our deposits, averaging up the quality of our liquid assets, continuing to term out our wholesale funding so as to minimize the extent to which we will expect to rely on the RBA backup facility. So in managing a transition to qualify as best we can for LCR over the next few years, we will have already substantially dealt with the NSFR issue, and there will be a smaller challenge at that point to complete to a 100% stable funding. And obviously the opportunity to take covered bonds to issuance is going to be an enormous assistance in managing that transition, which today is still a $45 billion to $50 billion transition in aggregate.</p>
          <p>Just to update you on our funding and liquidity and using the old metrics here, the group's stable funding index has remained stable at 84%. I foreshadowed last time that we might take a breather on improving this ratio as we supported balance sheet growth initiatives. We have seen good customer deposit flows. They are now a more important part of the mix. In fact, if you look back over the last couple of years, we've been almost 100% customer deposit funded in our growth.</p>
          <p>You can see on the top right, we continue to focus on long tenure issuance, and in the bottom left that we are well ahead on our plan for this year. We had set a target of $25 billion to $30 billion, and we're $16.7 billion at the half including $1.6 billion in covered bonds issued out of New Zealand. Our liquid asset holdings are pretty much as they have been, but you'll see we're starting to get our internal securitization moving in the right direction now as well. So, we have a higher contingent liquidity than we have previously.</p>
          <p>Quickly on the ROE, the top left gives you the picture, 160 basis points roll forward, half of that coming out of the turnaround in SGA, which really just reflects what a drag it was in prior periods. Wholesale Bank picking up in accordance with its profit growth. The only surprise probably in there is Personal Bank which is a 0.1% headwind. That, of course, is because of the credit card bad debt lump that went through, which means that business is essentially flat on a cash earnings basis but bigger because it has had substantial mortgage growth over the period. But as I say, partly for the re-pricing showing through and partly for the credit card bad debts washing out, we would expect that to reverse in the next period.</p>
          <p>You can see a proxy for the ROE for the various businesses in the other two charts. The return on the average RWA is below that gives you line of sight potentially to what's going on in the business unit ROEs, and in the top right for MLC and NAB wealth, and you can see the dark blue bars there showing the insurance returns quite a way below historic levels. And the attractiveness of the investment returns. So it's substantially geared into a pickup in equity markets and normalization in the insurance experience.</p>
          <p>As a team, we're very focused on ROE, in all the businesses we're digging in to get granularity within the portfolios and working to weed out lazy capital. Obviously, the focus on cross-sell should give us a lift in ROE. The cost efficiency efforts and the falling cost to income ratio, and we have separate efforts around capital efficiency as we improve our Basel II and Basel III capabilities. So we're hopeful that all of those things will contribute to further gains on ROE and closing the gap to peers in future periods.</p>
          <p>Then finally, on the SGA, we have been looking to sensibly but quickly exit this portfolio as best we can. And we decided a little while ago that the stars were starting to align, it might be possible on attractive terms to trade out of the SCDO portfolio early. Since 31st of March, we have in fact traded out of three of the six instruments in that portfolio. If you remember, we had Leg 1 positions that we bought protection on and we sold protection at Leg 2s. We've essentially now canceled the sold protection at Leg 2 and traded out of that. That reduces our risk and reduces our RWAs. So we've taken $629 million of credit risk off the table already. We'll get a $2 billion RWA reduction. There's a small accounting loss that's generated from this. It's about $9 million post tax. But the mark to market noise will continue given this stage in the process, not least because we still have the other three instruments but because the hedge premium and that we've been amortizing will continue to get marked to market based on the behavior of the Leg 1s in those instruments. Believe me; you don't want to get into detail.</p>
          <p>With respect to the remaining SCDOs, if the market conditions are right, we may trade out of those too. If we do that, that would release the remaining $821 million of credit risk and another $2 billion of RWAs. At that point, having completely exited the asset class, we would accelerate the write-off of the hedge premium which started its life at $650 million and we've been amortizing and currently sits at about $360 million. So we would clear that out, and at that point the mark-to-market volatility would cease because it would be &#x2013; it would be eliminated from our complexion. To the extent that we generate an accounting loss on exiting the other instruments, we believe that would be adequately covered by the management overlay that we've had generally pointed at these instruments of $160 million that was put in place a number of years ago.</p>
          <p>So in summary, and echoing I think what Cameron said, now we have solid momentum and good upside potential in the businesses, a combination of pricing, share gains, investment and progress on cross-sell, reputational gains, service gains and the like, all suggest ongoing momentum, particularly in the Australian franchises.</p>
          <p>We are focused on ROE, and quite deliberately are managing that to close gap to peers. We have at least one data point saying we've been able to contain costs within revenue growth, but we're setting ourselves to continue to do that. And our balance sheet, we feel very good about the balance sheet. The progress we've made over recent years, and the position we have as we turn to address the challenges of Basel III.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the ongoing regulatory political and economic risks which are somewhat reduced as we come to this result relative to perhaps the last two, but they do continue to present challenges. And we do feel that we're in a good position to navigate those challenges.</p>
          <p>So with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone. As usual, please state your name and organization when asking a question and also try to keep your question to one question with one part, so we can get around to as many people as possible and then we'll come back around. So, I just start right here in the front.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jon Mott from UBS. I've got a question regarding the break-up campaign, which obviously has got a lot of attention over the last little while and had a pretty good benefit in the Retail Bank, but potentially has implications for other parts of the business and maybe in particular on the Business Bank. So one of the issues would be that competitors are saying NAB's Business Bank is a very strong part of the business. You attack then in mortgages; they retaliate by trying to get you in Business Banking, which in theory could be a faster growing part of the business. So I wanted to get a feel on how you are seeing that, are we seeing increased competition now coming back as people trying to get a better piece of that pie, attack your franchise in Business Banking, and how that is going to impact the profitability of that business as that grows and whether the 30% cost to income you're actually spending enough money to protect that business in this environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the break-up campaign was just a step in a process, so I said in March 2009, one of our battlefields will be reputation. So we just saw it as a step, there's more to come. It's had a very positive impact in all of our businesses. Obviously it gets a lot of attention about what happens in the Personal Bank, but we were specific about saying what we were doing was trying to meet one of the key needs for customers in all of our businesses by doing things differently.</p>
          <p>In Personal Bank it manifests itself in fee reductions and interest rate positions that people see as competitive. In the Business Bank, it's had an extremely positive impact. In fact, Joseph and I, and at the extensive number of customer functions we run, I mean, it's a very positive source of competition. We lent $8 billion through the financial crisis, when others withdrew lending capacity of $55 billion. That's what was important to business, that we were there and supporting them. That's an element of being different and part of the break-up campaign. We led the charge in the Wealth business by saying, "you can't have &#x2013; you've got to have transparency, and you've got to have trust." Again, the reforms that are coming through are exactly what we said. That's what's important in our business. So what we're seeing is a positive impact across the business.</p>
          <p>In terms of competition, that's normal. We picked a fight, we hoped people would turn up, and they did. That's fine. And we'll continue to punch. The reality is, this is a market &#x2013; we've had a dance with the ACCC and failed. So I think that tells everyone, this is a market, of organic share gain. So the breakout campaign, yes, it's high profile. But the reality is, the way you're going to win in this market is go out and get other people's customers. We have share gains in every part of our business.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse, a question on SGA, and if I talk quickly, you might not realize, there's a couple of parts to it. Could you &#x2013; looking forwards to SGA, what the profitability outlook is and how we should look at that. In the absence of sort of mark-to-market gains, is it a zero profitability business unit, or should we look at it being profitable going forward? And Mark, you mentioned under appropriate conditions you would look at the other three SCDOs. What are those appropriate conditions and what should be look for in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, on the SCDOs, it's &#x2013; there's a secondary market for these things and so it's just a question of where they're trading at essentially. So that's quite straightforward, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much better does it have it to get?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to talk about active trades, if you don't mind. And then on the profit outlook, SGA is not a business unit we're trying to perpetuate, right? So we would like it to go to zero. So I don't want you to put it in perpetuity or something like that. Essentially, the bad debts are behaving themselves but the U.K. and the U.S. markets are fragile and things could get worse there. Also you tend to get your better credits repaying early because they can, they can refinance and the like. It's never been a bad bank. It's just been a set of assets that we didn't want to be in long run, but it will start to migrate to the things that either can't get refinanced or a long term, some of which we weren't able to re-price very effectively. So I wouldn't be looking for that to be a substantial profit generator. But at the moment, we're quite hopeful that the bad debts are not going to create a significant headwind for us in that. So on that basis; it wouldn't be a significant drag either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on the business lending side, can you just give us a feel for where the growth in that business is coming from? Is it like in terms of skew towards institutional and middle market? The APRA stats is a little bit confusing because your growth looks a lot higher on that. And also just the pickup in the past dues, if there's any particular &#x2013; where that's coming from as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll get Joseph to talk about where he's seeing the pickup. I think &#x2013; as Mark said, there's no worrying trend in the pickup in past dues, and we're not seeing a significant rate of new arrivals into the workout group or anything like that. We're just working through really a series of natural events. In some cases we're getting to the end of a period where we've had customers being worked through, if you like and the Christmas trading period and other events have sort of tipped it into final theme, but nothing in terms of significant trends that we're concerned about but Joseph, you want to talk about the nature of the growth and where we're seeing the pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Be happy to do that. The growth is largely coming from the SME book. We've seen some growth in the institutional book, which has been event driven, such as the disposal of the energy assets in New South Wales, but the general trend at the top end of town, outside the events is for corporates to continue deleveraging. That's been offset from our perspective by some strong pipelines and growth in the SME book, which obviously is our sweet spot. So that really is where the growth's coming from.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I was just wanted to know, of the business profit growth, how much of it actually relates to your mortgage book repricing that is actually in the business division? I mean, you are a bit different of every other bank in that you do include, I think it's what, $50 billion, $60 billion $70 billion of mortgages in that business. I just wanted to get an idea as to how much that's contributed to the actual business growth over that period. And also, Cameron, I just wanted to know are you still happy to be, in the longer term at a discount to every other major bank in terms of a standard variable rate on the $200 billion of back book that you have, not on the front book, but on your back book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are happy with our interest rate position at the moment. We obviously reflect what that is going each competitive opportunity but we're comfortable with our position at the moment. It's driving volume, customers respond to that. We'll obviously assess that interest rate setting over time and what our competitors do.</p>
          <p>The good thing at NAB is of course that existing customers get the same deals as a new customer. And so obviously there's a lot of heat around the mortgage market but I think I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I'm offering my new customers better deals than my existing ones. That's how banks have poor reputations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and on the, I'll have to check and come back to you on that. It's about a six-basis-point uplift on the mortgage portfolio but I haven't got the proportion in front of me. So it will have assisted but the seven-basis-point uplift in the business bank is not just attributable to the mortgage book.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question for Mark and Cameron, I know you'll probably chime in on it as well. If you have a look at housing, there's no doubt about it that the November 2010 rate hikes we saw and basically environment post-GFC, the banks as an industry are gouging housing borrowers, if you have a look at the incremental ROE. But if you have a look at what's basically happened since November, we've had the yield curve flatten quite considerably and you guys have narrowed the gap a little bit. Westpac didn't go up quite as much as you guys last time around. I was just wondering, Cameron and Mark, if we're to see the 90-day bank bill, the short end of the yield curve steepen a little bit again. And we would then &#x2013; and that was to flow all the way up the yield curve and actually see the three-year bond rate go up. Then the ROE I would imagine on some of the new housing lending could actually fall back to being sub cost of capital.</p>
          <p>At the moment it's like a sweet spot for you guys even with the discounted pricing. Could you just give us a feeling on the sensitivity on this &#x2013; on the breakup campaign housing pricing? Should we actually get the yield curve, so it's a few moving pieces here, should we get the yield curve go back to the long term basically cash 90 spread, and we get the three-year bond rate moving up accordingly, your ROE could actually fall on the brokerage and that housing could fall kind of back considerably to being below the cost of capital. I'd just like to get a feel on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's unlikely to go below cost of capital. We're writing mortgages today anywhere really between 19% and 25% ROE depending on what's going on. And all of the banks, while they might have low appetite for off-cycle rate rises and things like that, there's a lot of things going into the mix on average cost of funds. And if you get a situation like that and you've got a rising average cost of funds eventually, certainly on your front book you'll accommodate them. And the question is what as an industry, what do they do on the back book? And what I was describing on the transition to Basel III is going to put a lot into that mixer in terms of rising average cost of funds. That's going to have to find a home at some stage. So, that is an industry issue. So I think it's very unlikely that enough would happen on the part of the curve you are describing to substantially impact those ROEs. And that even if it did, that we would do nothing about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Matt Davison, Merrill Lynch. Just another question on the Personal Bank, year-over-year you've seen 12 bps of margin decay and you've had the SVR re-pricing during that time. Just interested if, as you look out over the next 12 months, whether the other factors you see improving enough to produce a margin decay over that time period that is better than the 12 bps? Because I guess just extrapolating the benefit out of this year's result from the SVR move would be going worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the benefit in the first half was 6 basis points. Theoretically, the benefit, when you get to a steady run rate, should be 18 basis points or maybe a little below that because you have got some non-mortgage assets and some fixed-rate mortgages and the like. But let's say it's 15 or 16 basis points. So other things remaining equal we should see that in the second half. So we should get a strengthening in the NIM in the second half. Because in the first half, we not only had only four months of the six with the new prices, but we hung back for &#x2013; I can't remember if it was three weeks or more, so we had the whole portfolio not priced where the RBA had gone. And so you see very little of it in the first half but you'll see a lot more of it in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other deposit drags that offset that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the deposit drags are really people shifting to iSaver type accounts rather than lower yielding accounts. So I think with the competition, the rates on offer, a lot of advertising, we're educating customers and customers are shifting their money around to a greater extent. I think that's going to go on.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Mark's talked a bit about the funding and term wholesale pressures and what that means to your requirements going forward. In light of those comments, how willing are you to continue to grow above system in mortgages?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've proven through this crisis that we've got a dynamic system where we re-price based on inputs. And there are headwinds coming. I think just because the banks start to pass through higher input cost doesn't mean the economy will end up with higher interest rates. The Reserve Bank can always cut rates to have the economic signals right in the economy and they have plenty of scope to do that. But what the nation is doing is investing in a stronger banking system which will be a higher cost banking system, and that will find its way eventually, it's a question of how quickly, into what customers pay for credit. It also means certain types of customers won't want to use the banking system. They will disintermediate.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of change actually coming on this but I do believe that water finds its level and this will work its way through and it's more likely than not the Australian industry will continue to end up with decent ROEs.</p>

          <p>What about the dollar funding requirement? You said that your requirement this year is $25 billion to $30 billion. You're growing above system in home loans. You expect business loans to pick up and you've also got the headwind of needing more term wholesale fundings because of liquidity.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, how willing are you to continue to grow above system in mortgages? When does it put pressure on your funding requirement?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So we have a good capacity at the moment because we're well advanced, so it's not a short-term issue, it's a medium to long term issue. But one of the other things we're going to have to do as an industry is significantly enhance our ability to distribute assets and not all assets are going to find their way to bank balance sheets. So we will &#x2013; we can continue to play a pivotal role in the Australian economy but we probably can't afford to park all the credit on our balance sheets because that is the Achilles' heel of Australia that we're too dependent on foreign funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just come back from a strategic angle. One of the &#x2013; what was not sustainable in 2009 was to be growing mortgages at half times the system and business at 1.3 times the system. We would not be able to participate in the rebound of business credit growth had we not actually grown mortgages aggressively because we would start to bump into all sorts of concentration limits and other things. So we had to grow our mortgages. We wanted to get that side of a balance sheet moving.</p>
          <p>What's that actually done is actually given us substantial capacity in our various ratios now to participate in the rebound in business credit growth? It's also forced us to make a significant uplift in our capability in front-line sales force and mortgage processing.</p>
          <p>You don't have a burning platform when you're not writing many mortgages. Now, I'll leave others to speculate as to what might be driving differentials in mortgage delinquencies. We were not around in 2008. We weren't writing mortgages. You don't have a real burning platform to fix the process. We've got that and we've done a lot of work on the process.</p>
          <p>So there's a number of strategic levels as well. It just also happens to be where there's some growth too which goes to Mark's point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Victor German from Nomura. A question on credit quality. I think a couple of days ago ANZ highlighted that the outlook is remaining quite subdued and I think if I'm reading your comments correctly today, Cameron, you're also talking about the two-speed economy. In light of the fact that your provisioning levels are arguably slightly lower than your peers, can you provide some outlook comments on the SME book and what those conditions actually are likely to translate to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think, there's a number of factors at play here. There are parts of the economy that are obviously performing more weakly than others. But the reality is there is still unemployment at a relatively low level and predicted to go lower. There is still a substantial infrastructure pipeline over the next decade and we're very pleased in the business to have been an above market participant in a lot of the recent activities.</p>
          <p>So there is still a lot of positive signs that we'll drive activity. There are two factors at play here. One is are we swinging from negative credit growth, which we have seen in 2010, to a positive credit growth? And the answer is yes, we're starting to see green shoots coming through and demand come through, and particularly in the last couple of months, where people and businesses are starting to invest.</p>
          <p>The next question is where will business credit land from a system point of view? There are varying projections on that. But if you take the midpoint of the averages, they're still talking 7%, 8%, 9% type business credit growth, which is actually a much more sustainable long run level anyways, relative to GDP. That's &#x2013; yes it's a lower environment. But that's still a positive environment if you can &#x2013; if you've got business credit growth running at somewhere at 7% to 9%, that's okay. And if you look at the funding pressures, and the other things we're dealing with, that's actually probably not a bad outcome either.</p>
          <p>So we feel optimistic about the credit growth outlook, particularly the back end of this year and next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we feel entirely comfortable with the provisioning as well. We haven't declared victory, even though we're seeing a consistent decline in the bad debt expense, we've left all the overlays in place. We've got Basel II accredited models that tell us what we need to be providing. And we're observing all that. And in addition, we've got more capital ring-fenced than we have purely in the provisions because we've got the GRCL top up in our capital calculations as well.</p>
          <p>So we feel fine on that. As I say, we haven't moved to relax any of that because the world is uncertain but by far, the majority of the indicators are pointing to further improvement rather than a significant worsening.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Credit where it's due for this result and you can in fact read my note out already which does have a Buy-it rating on it now. But with respect to Slide 13 and sort of a bit of a follow-on from Victor's question, you pointed out that your arithmetic average on bad and doubtful debts is 43 basis points over the past 30 years, and that you're sort of kind of there are now with your current charges. This sort of doesn't take much account about portfolio mix shifts in your portfolio. So, while perhaps less than peers, you're still seeing a shift towards mortgages over that time. So do you have a contemporary view on the cycle average loss assumptions in your book, and I suppose the magnitude and direction of your decline in credit cost from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we haven't had a &#x2013; we haven't had a particularly large skew, I mean, I think you go back to 1980, God knows, but if you go back to living memory, NAB was losing some mortgage share for a while, and then it bottomed a couple of years ago, and we pulled back, I don't know, 1%, 1.5% or something like that, so I don't think the mix we have today is substantially out of line with history. So I would imagine that the impact of that would be relatively immaterial. But I would hope and expect that that 43 basis points continues to improve from here. As I've said, we've had a bit of a bump in credit cards, that will work its way out. We're not seeing anything on the mortgage side; the average credit scoring on business is rising. We've had some things shift into GIA in a few areas that are very well secured. And so the rude shocks are really not coming through the way that they were. So I think we feel fairly optimistic on that front without being in a position to declare victory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. I just note the risk weighing on your housing book continued to fall in the first half and if you turn to Slide 35 of the presentation, I note that the LVR profile of approvals also continued to become more conservative. Can you perhaps just explain the extent to which there's a link between the two and then whether this thematic might continue to reduce the capital intensity of the mortgage book going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We've got a, we've got some graduated pricing particularly in the broker channels that favor low LVR mortgages. So we've had a significant swing in the mix of mortgages that we're writing to low LVR, which is on the front book, therefore a very substantial risk weight difference to the back book and it's significant enough given the flows to start shifting the average down. So we are growing primarily in low risk mortgages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair to say that that could continue going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we hope so and we're certainly going to maintain the pricing differential.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Just wanted to focus on the cost side, the employee expenses were down period on period, and I know there's some FX impacts in there. So the uplift in constant currency terms is probably close to uplift in average head count. So I just wanted an outlook for where you think that cost level is and the incentivization of staff and in particular, the equity based compensation was down $60 million this half, so I'd suspect with today's ROE and share price that won't necessarily stay at that level either?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll say some numbers and then you...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're right on the FX effect. Our average FTEs are up 3% and our average compensation &#x2013; or our compensation grew 2.8% on an FX adjusted basis. So it's pretty much in line. And then the incentive compensation is down about $60 million and &#x2013; but that's just a function of true-ups that we do all the time based on which programs are going to vest or won't vest, or whatever. So that just tends to fluctuate through time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, we've got an extensive efficiency program as well about making sure that as we reinvest in the front line and the extensive hiring we've done, I think 350 business bankers in Joseph's business, he's hiring into Lisa's business as well, that we're also taking some high cost and non-customer facing positions out to redeploy so that obviously changes the mix as well. I think, like all shareholders, we would like to see equity based compensation vest. It hasn't because we haven't delivered on a TSR basis, we have in more recent times but that's only a short period and we've got to do that on a sustained basis over time to get that to vest.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, outside Australia it's going to be FX-assisted, I would say, foreign exchange assisted.

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Could I refer to Slide 91 in the pack? And I realize a lot of this is basically inherited. When you have a look at kind of like asset concentrations, the very long cycle commercial real estate is the time bomb for most banks over time. And when you have a look at it I would have thought a sensible concentration would be that no one business should never exceed 7% or 8%. Can I just ask, are you comfortable with those concentrations that we see in commercial property? And does that really open up the headwind to basically grow the mortgage book to offset that. Could we just get an outlook for what you're going to do &#x2013; are these commercial property concentrations too high? And if they are, what are going to do to reduce them? If they are &#x2013; if they can in fact be reduced?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As the risk guardian, so we have been on a deliberate strategy of reducing our exposure to commercial real estate in two ways. The first is to grow other asset classes and the second is to actually reduce the absolute exposure to commercial real estate. Our view was that it was getting a little bit high and we have got a target of reduction over the next couple of years. There's got to be balance with looking after your customers as well and so we're doing it in that way basically. So we have a target, we're heading towards that target, we'll achieve that target in the next year or so. So I'm comfortable.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

            <mark type="Inaudible" /> (1:14:09) because I think the commercial real estate exposure in Australia needs to be understood in terms of its makeup. So about half of the $42 billion is SME-based, where the average loan size is about $1.5 million. So broadly diversified portfolio where we've got small businesses that have acquired the premises that they're working in or made an investment-related &#x2013; investment sorry, diversification related investments, but the average of loan size or half that book is in line with an average residential mortgage in some parts of the country. So it's not commercial real estate as you would traditionally think of in terms of large big-ticket commercial real estate. It's actually commercial real estate very much in line with a large SME bank. So from a risk perspective, it's a very different asset in my view.</p>
