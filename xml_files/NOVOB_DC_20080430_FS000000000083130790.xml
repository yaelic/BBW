          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Q1 2008 Earnings Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to turn the conference over to your host, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our results for the first three months of 2008 released earlier today. I am Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk. And with me I have our Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen our Chief Science Officer, and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our homepage novonordisk.com, along with a slide we'll be using for this conference call. The conference call is scheduled to last approximately 1 hour. As usual we'll start with a presentation as outlined on slide number one. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 30 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number two. As always I need to advise you that this will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation. Also note that this conference call as mentioned is being webcast live, and a replay will be made available on our website after the conference call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number three. We're pleased with the performance of the first month 2008 with the robust sales development for our key products, sustainable improvement on our gross margins and progress in our research and development activities.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio of modern insulins continues to show a strong growth in all key markets. In the first three months of 2008, sales of modern insulins increased by 33% in local currencies, thereby maintaining the momentum in Novo Nordisk insulin franchise.</p>
          <p>Biopharmaceutical area, NovoSeven sales increased 10% local currencies, Norditropin also continue the growth pattern with 17% sales growth in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Geographically, the sales increase is driven by North America with sales growth of 21%, and international operations with sales growth of 32% in local currencies. With regards to our research and development activities, I can confirm that Novo Nordisk still expects to file for regulatory approval of liraglutide in the US and EU before the end of the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The filing for regulatory approval of liraglutide take place in the third quarter of this year. As a result of increased safety concerns surrounding pulmonary delivery of insulin in general, Novo Nordisk has decided to discontinue all pulmonary delivery activities. This implies the discontinuation of all our activities at Hayward, California, the pulmonary R&amp;D center, and increases the expected level of non-recurring costs in 2008 to DDK500 million compared to the previous estimate of DDK300 million when we announced the discontinuation of AERx inhaled insulin project.</p>
          <p>On 25 April, Novo Nordisk received marketing authorization from the European Commission for the room-temperature stable version of NovoSeven. We expect to launch this upgraded version of NovoSeven in Europe in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial performance in the first three months of 2008, a robust sales growth of 15% in local currencies corresponds to an 8% reported growth due to significant negative currency impacts.</p>
          <p>The solid improvement in our productivity and manufacturing have continued throughout these three months of 2008 and contributed to increased gross margins of 90 basis points as reported. These improvements are mainly related to increased productivity in insulin bulk manufacturing and insulin filling activity as well as prices increased in United States.</p>
          <p>Operating profit as reported increased 22% compared to the first three months of 2007, and adjusted for currencies the underlying operating profit growth was close to 35%. For 2008 reported operating profit is now expected to grow by slightly more than 20% as an improved growth margin only partly are able to compensate for the adverse current environment and increased level of non-recurring costs in relation to the discontinuation of all preliminary delivery projects. However, the guidance for growth in underlying operating profit adjusted for impacts currencies and non-recurring items have been increased to close to 25%. This primarily reflects the improved gross margin.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four. In the first three months of 2008, the diabetes care segment grew 16% in local currencies contributing 8% of our growth. The portfolio of modern insulins were the main growth drivers accounting for 70% of sales growth.</p>
          <p>Our pharmaceuticals grew 11% in local currencies. Sales of NovoSeven increased 10% while the growth hormone franchise grew 17%, both measured in local currencies. Sales of HRT increased 2% measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five for an update on our modern insulin franchise. In the first three months of 2008, sales of modern insulin products grew 33% measured in local currencies. The growth in driven by underlying market growth, market share gains for the entire portfolio of modern insulins, i.e. NovoRapid, NovoMix and Levemir. Market shares continue to increase for all three products.</p>
          <p>The market performance for all of Novo Nordisk's modern insulin exhibits a steady and durable penetration of the various insulin segments. Levemir continues to gain momentum with sales increasing from below 500 million in the first quarter of 2007, to above 800 million in the first quarter of this year. From a regional perspective growth is driven primarily by North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>In the first three months of this year, modern insulins made up 57% of our total insulin sales compared to 49% in the first three months of 2007. Emphasizing the momentum in the ongoing conversion from human insulins to modern insulins. NovoRapid is the single largest modern insulin for Novo Nordisk with sales of 1.8 billion in the first three months of 2008. Similar figures for NovoMix and Levemir were 1.2 billion and 800 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Share growth for the three modern insulins are roughly equally distributed with Levemir increasing its share of growth.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number six for some further insight into the dynamics of the modern insulin market. Around 53% of the global insulin market measured by volume has now been converted to modern insulins, compared to 47% at the same time last year. And we expect this conversion trend to continue within all segments of the market.</p>
          <p>This rise in value growth in the insulin market along with the ongoing conversions prefilled devices. Novo continues to gain market share within modern insulins. Novo Nordisk market share of the segment is now 44% measured in volume, compared to 43% 12 months ago. Novo Nordisk continues to be the only company that markets a full range of modern insulins with short-acting mix and long-acting modern insulins in most advanced and user-friendly delivery system such as the easy-to-use disposal of FlexPen.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number seven for an update of NovoSeven sales development. NovoSeven sales increased 10% in global currencies, and 2% reported, in the first three months of this year. NovoSeven sales growth was primarily realized in North America and international operations and were positively impacted by timing and sales in international operations compared to the first three months of 2007.</p>
          <p>The sales growth of NovoSeven reflected increasing sales within the congenital and acquired hemophilia segment where Novo Nordisk is a global leader. Treatment of spontaneous bleeds for congenital inhibitor patients remain the largest area of use.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight for an update on sales. Norditropin. Norditropin sales increased 17% in local currencies, and 12% reported, first three months of this year. Thereby continuing a growth in the growth hormone franchise. Norditropin sales growth were primarily realized in North America followed by international operations. However, all regions contributed to growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>NordiTropin's <mark type="inaudible" /> ready-to-use growth hormone and is increasingly sold in our prefilled delivery device NordiFlex. It continues to be the most advanced offering on the market characterized by significant convenience benefits for patients and their families.</p>
          <p>Now to slide number nine for an update on sales by region. By regional perspective, North America and international operations are the main growth drivers for Novo Nordisk. The first three months North America and international operations contributed 48% and 38% respectively of the overall growth. In Europe, we continued to see solid growths rates for our portfolio of modern insulins primarily due to continued conversion from human insulin and stable underlying market growth. Sales of Levemir grew more than 50% in Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales in international operations in the first three months of this year grew 32% in local currencies. The robust sales growth was positively impacted by timing of <mark type="inaudible" />. The main growth driver in the first three months of 2008 was sales of modern insulins primarily in China and Turkey.</p>
          <p>Furthermore sales of human insulin continue to add to the overall growth in the region, also driven by China, and hence China continues to be the key contributor to growth in the international operations.</p>
          <p>Sales in Japan, Oceania increased by 4% in local currencies. The sales development reflects sales growth in all three modern insulins, NovoRapid, NovoRapidMix and Levemir, which are increasingly being sold in the leading pre-filled device, FlexPen.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has a leading market share in the modern insulin market in Japan, holding 73% of the total insulin market, and 64% of the modern insulin market, both measured by volume. After just four months on the market, Levemir has gained a market share above 30% of the long-acting modern insulin market, and more than 10% of the total long-acting insulin market.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number ten which provides you with an update on the development of our modern insulin market share in Europe and the rollout of Levemir. Nova Nordisk holds a clear leadership position within modern insulins segment in Europe with the volume market share of 51% compared to 50% last year.</p>
          <p>The solid leadership position is reinforced by continued market share gains of Levemir, which holds more than 26% of the total European market for longer-acting modern insulins.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 11 for an update on the U.S. market. Total Diabetes Care sales in North America increased 25% in local currencies, effectively launched this year and by 11% recorded, reflecting the solid penetration of modern insulins like Levemir, NovoLog, and NovoLog Mix. Novo has maintained its position of leadership in the U.S. insulin market with 42% of the total insulin market and 31% of the modern insulin market, both measured by volume.</p>
          <p>NovoLog reinforces its position as market leader within the short-acting modern insulin segment in the U.S. According to the latest monthly market share data covering February, Levemir has obtained around 10% of the total long-acting modern insulin segment measured by volume.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to handover to Mads, who'll give you an update on the development within our pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to Slide 12 for an update on our Diabetes Care pipeline. Novo Nordisk can confirm that the datasets to be included in the liraglutide regulatory dossiers that are to be submitted to the FDA and EMEA has recently been discussed with the U.S. and EU regulatory authorities. Following this, Novo Nordisk still expects to file for regulatory approval of liraglutide in the U.S. and EU before the end of this quarter. Furthermore, the filing for regulatory approval of liraglutide in Japan is still expected to take place in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>At the Annual Meeting of the American Diabetes Association to be held in San Francisco on June 6 to 10 this year, Novo Nordisk expects to present detailed results from some of the global Phase IIIa lead trials with liraglutide.</p>
          <p>As communicated on January 14 this year, Novo Nordisk has previously reduced its clinical development activities within inhaled insulin through the discontinuation of AERx, an inhaled fast-acting insulin. At the time of discontinuation of AERx, specific safety concerns were not apparent and Novo Nordisk announced that R&amp;D activities within inhalation of long-acting insulin in GLP-1 would continue.</p>
          <p>Following recent reports of lung cancer cases in Type II diabetes treated with Exubera, an inhaled insulin product from Pfizer, the likelihood of positive benefit:risk ratio for future pulmonary diabetes projects has become more uncertain and Novo Nordisk has consequently decided to stop all R&amp;D activities in the pulmonary field. As a consequence of this decision, Novo Nordisk will discontinue all pulmonary delivery projects in Denmark as well as the pulmonary R&amp;D center in Hayward, California.</p>
          <p>This decision will, as mentioned by Lars, increase the non-recurring cost for 2008 relating to the discontinuation of the pulmonary delivery projects from a previous estimate of 300 million Danish kroner related to the AERx Phase III closure to a revised estimate of 500 million kroner for the discontinuation of the total pulmonary delivery project portfolio.</p>
          <p>Research at Novo Nordisk in Denmark will continue to focus heavily on both injection based delivery and alternative non-invasive routes to deliver insulin GLP-1 as well as other therapeutic proteins within the diabetes and obesity area.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on our haemostasis portfolio. Last week, Novo Nordisk received marketing authorization from the European Commission for the room temperature stable version of NovoSeven. The room temperature stable product is expected to deliver significant patient benefit including rapid dosing and ease of access to treatment outside of home and hospital settings. Novo Nordisk expects to launch this upgraded version of NovoSeven in Europe in the second half and is furthermore awaiting decision on approval by the U.S. FDA.</p>
          <p>In January this year, Novo Nordisk finalized the Phase 2 safety study for the use of NovoSeven in cardiac surgery. As mentioned in connection with the full year financial release, the study confirmed the safety profile known from the cardiac surgery setting and from previous studies of NovoSeven outside of haemophilia with inhibitors. While the primary endpoint of this trial was safety, the trial also demonstrated the biologic haemostatic effect of NovoSeven on several parameters.</p>
          <p>Based on an assessment of Novo Nordisk's prospects within this indication as regards to NovoSeven and NN1731, the next-generation version of recombinant factor VIIa, Novo Nordisk has decided to focus on NN1731 and thus not proceed with further development of NovoSeven. The rationale for choosing in NN1731 for further development is that it has pre-clinically been shown to act highly efficaciously even under the acidotic, hypothermic and diluted conditions that prevail in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p>
          <p>Based on this strong pattern protection, a Phase 2 study within cardiac surgery with NN1731 is expected to be initiated in the second half of 2009. Regarding the results from the Phase 2 trial with NovoSeven cardiac surgery, these are expected to be published and presented essentially to conferences this year.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Novo Nordisk has completed a Phase 1 dose escalation study where we are confident of FXIII in cardiac surgery. The rationale for replacement therapy with rFXIII to prevent bleeding during cardiac surgery is that low tera-operative endogenous levels of rFXIII appear to be associated with increased risk of bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p>
          <p>In the completed Phase 1 study, a total of 43 patients were randomized to treatment with either placebo or rFXIII. The study confirmed the ability of replacement therapy with rFXIII to normalize FXIII levels in the blood, which is subsequently expected to normalize hemostasis. Following these results, Novo Nordisk expects to initiate a Phase 2 study for the use of FXIII in cardiac surgery mid next year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide on update on other biopharmaceuticals. As for our early stage inflammation pipeline, I can confirm that pre-clinical activities are progressing according to plan and we still expect the first two compounds targeting inflammatory disorders to enter clinical development within the following months. Specific diseases that are relevant to treatment with these monoclonal antibodies include rheumatoid arthritis and certain other autoimmune conditions.</p>
          <p>Now over to Jesper for an update on the financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to slide 15 providing you with the details on the financial results. We are satisfied with the overall sales growth in the first three months of 2008, up 15% measured in local currencies and 8% as recorded. Improvement in gross margin was 0.9 percentage point, but primarily reflecting improved production efficiency in both upstream and downstream manufacturing and higher average prices in the U.S. The improvement in gross margin has been achieved despite a negative impact of around 1.1 percentage point due to currency development, primarily the lower value of the U.S. dollar and the British pound versus the Danish krone compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Sales and distribution costs decreased by 2%, primarily as a result of a provision related to an anti-dumping case in Brazil recorded in the first quarter of 2007, partly countered by higher cost in 2008 related to the expanded sales force in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Research and development costs increased by 13%, reflecting non-recurring costs of 220 million related to the discontinuation of the inhaled insulin project, AERx.</p>
          <p>Reported operating profit increased by 22% in the first three months of 2008. Net financial showed a net income of 39 million in the first three months compared to a net income of 47 million in the same period last year. Included in that financial is the result from associated companies with an expense of 67 million, primarily related to Novo Nordisk's share of losses in ZymoGenetics in Seattle. In the same period of 2007, the results from associated companies was an expense of 60 million Danish kroner.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange result was an income of 70 million compared to an income of 197 million in the same period of 2007. This development reflects gains on foreign exchange hedging activities due to the lower value of especially U.S. dollar, being partly offset by losses on commercial balances in primarily in non-hedged emerging market currencies.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the first three months of 2008 is around 24%, a decrease from 28% in the first three months of 2007. The significantly lower effective tax rate primarily reflects the reduction in the Danish Corporation tax rate introduced in the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on our currency exposure. The depreciating trends for Novo Nordisk's most important invoicing currencies including the U.S. dollar and the British pound versus the euro and Danish kroner has continued in the first three months of 2008. With the decline of the U.S. dollar, the value of our hedging portfolio has increased and as per 31 March 2008, the hedging gain of around 1 billion has been deferred for income recognition later in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Currently, Novo Nordisk has future expected cash flow related to the U.S. dollar 18 months ahead, the Japanese yen 14 months ahead, and the British pound hedged 10 months ahead. Based on our forecast and with the reference to the recent significant volatility in the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the euro and Danish kroner, we have estimated that the expected currency impact on operating profit as a consequence of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar is around 470 million Danish krone. In addition, please note that the related sensitivity for U.S. dollar related currencies is an additional 100 million Danish krone.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 17 for outlook for 2008. Novo Nordisk expects between 10 to 13% growth in sales measured in local currencies for 2008 compared to the previous expectations of the sales growth slightly about 10%. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key strategic products within Diabetes Care and Biopharmaceuticals as well as the expectations of increased competition in both the Diabetes Care area and in Biopharmaceuticals during 2008. Given the current level of exchange rates versus Danish krone, the report sales force in 2008 is expected to be around 6 percentage points lower than the growth rate measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The expectations for growth in reported operating profit for 2008 is now slightly more than 20%, as the expectations for improvements in the gross margin only partly are able to offset an increased negative currency impact of around 5 percentage points compared to the 2008 guidance provided 31 January 2008 in connection with the release of our results for the financial year 2008.</p>
          <p>As explained by Mads, this expectation includes a revised estimate of non-recurring costs in relation to the discontinuation of all pulmonary delivery projects of 500 million in 2008 compared to the previous estimate of 300 million Danish krone for the discontinuation of the AERx insulin project alone.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for the impact from currencies and the non-recurring costs related to the discontinuation of all pulmonary delivery projects in 2007 and 2008, underlying operating profit is now expected to grow by close to 25% compared to the previous estimate of a growth of at least 20%. For 2008, Novo Nordisk now expects a net financial income of 600 million Danish krone, reflecting significant foreign exchange hedging gains primarily related to the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for 2008 is still expected to be approximately 24%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is now expected to be around 2 billion and lower than the expectations for depreciations, amortization and impairment losses, which are expected to be around 2.5 billion, whereas free cash flow is now expected to be around 8 billion. All of the above expectations are provided that currency exchange rates, especially the U.S. dollar and related currencies, remain at the current level versus the Danish krone for the rest of 2008.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen will now moderate the Q&amp;A session. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>

          <p>Operator, we are ready to take the first question now.</p>
        </plist>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will now take our first question from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Thanks for questions. Two questions. Firstly for Jesper on phasing within the quarter, could you just comment on the size of the Chinese OAD contract? Looks to be about 100 million nearly, if the contract is being brought forward there. And secondly, phasing of sales and distribution costs, do you see in the first quarter around 28% of sales? I think you're still guiding around 29% for the full-year, so just a quick commentary on phasing in the quarter. And then a second broad question, I'm just thinking forward a year or so about liraglutide promotion, just wondered if you could comment broadly on your learning points from Byetta uptake, and the difficulties Amolin seems to be having in growing in the market there? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Jesper, phasing in relationship to tender orders and in relationship to the seemingly lower level of S&amp;D costs in the first quarter, considering our guidance of 29% for the full-year, if you'd kindly comment on these two aspects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> It's correct Sachin that there is a timing effect to the tune of 100 million in our sales of OAD in relating to China, which had to do with a label update in China, which prevented us from importing in the fourth quarter and it's been moved to the first quarter. So, that's a timing issue to the tune of 100 million for OAD in China. In relation to the forecast for selling and distribution cost, we maintain a guidance of around 29%, maybe 29 plus. So, the lower level of expense in the first quarter that's solely a timing issue. We would expect to get to the 29% as we move into 2008. I think <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Jesper. And then with regard to liraglutide and our learnings from having observed Byetta, I won't comment on our marketing build-up and the exact marketing positioning for obvious reasons. But it is clear, as you also imply that beating Byetta so to speak is not the objective but growing the segment rather is the objective and I'd like Mads will perhaps say a few words about, how he sees the current GLP-1 segment and how we might assist in building that in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Lars. I think, vis-&#xE0;-vis, Byetta and what has happened, first of all, as it goes for all products in the diabetes patients, in particular injectables, it's critically important that you start by getting the embracement and the endorsement by the key opinion leaders and the specialists who are to actively scientifically kind of promote the use of the product, so that appears in the form of the general practitioners and so on. And this is something that for sure Novo Nordisk would do a lot to work on with the very efficacious liraglutide product that we have on debating. It is no doubt that at one of the last conferences we have heard where Byetta has been discussed by the colleagues from the other companies, the efficacy has been apparently not perceived to be strong enough to warrant the injectable regime by some of the physicians and Novo Nordisk will work heavily to ensure that liraglutide is perceived as it is indeed the case as a highly efficacious product which has certain added benefits, such as weight reduction, such as lack of hypoglycemia et cetera, coupled with a very simple dosing regimen.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. It's Henrik Simonsen with SEB Enskilda. Just to follow-up on Sachin's question on the cost structure. You said that you were upgrading guidance to better gross margin, perhaps yes but could you comment a little bit on your expectations as for the gross margins for the year and also R&amp;D to sales? What we should be expecting for this year? And second question, looking at some of the charts you were presenting on market shares and the insulin market, it seems a little bit like the market-share progression is a little bit slower than we've seen in recent quarters. Are you seeing more competition from Lilly and sanofi-aventis in the insulin market? What's going on right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Henrik. Jesper, first on the cost structure, any projections on the gross margin and R&amp;D to sales development going forward in view of the fact that we have now terminated the pulmonary activities, how do you see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's correct, Henrik that we operate our expectations to underline development in the gross margin. So, now we see 2007 delivering at least 100 basis point improvement in the gross margin and that's an upgrade from previous 50 to 100. Of course, a very significant proportion of this will disappear as a result of currency effect, you saw that we had in first quarter 110 basis point negative currency impact. So only probably a slight improvement in the reported &#x2013; given the current rates for reported gross margin. As for the R&amp;D ratio, we have increased the non-recurring R&amp;D cost in relation to the discontinuation of the pulmonary portfolio. And as a consequence your expectations for the R&amp;D ratio should now be in the ballpark of 17.5% in terms of R&amp;D ratio. And then just finishing off on the guidance and cost ratios; admin cost will be in the 6% rate ballpark and other operating income remains around 300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesper. And then with regard to the competitive situation in insulin, if we look at the total world market IMS in volume terms, we are more or less flat or so, sort of a stable situation between the three different players, but it is corrected when we look at the IMS modern insulin market shares and volume, there are gains in market share have been coming down. So the marginal market share gains have been coming down. And this is a reflection of the fact that we have seen increased activity from Eli Lilly. And hence you can say in some ways that we have &#x2013; we've taken the easy fruits and it is going to be more challenging for us going forward. And this is also going to have some reflection on the required marketing power for the launch of liraglutide because we need to have launch of liraglutide in the near future and maintain a focus on the continued offside that we have with our full portfolio of modern insulin. So, yes, there is increased competition, increased noise level and we also, of course, observing that the markets in creating noise are on the GPP-4 inhibitors. So in reality the cost of doing business is going up. We're still gaining share. It is not growing as rapidly as it was in previous quarters. Thank you. Next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. This is Poul La Cour from Kaupthing. Two questions. One just continuing on Hendrickson, on Levemir. Your launch in Europe and especially in Japan has progressed very well. But you seem to continue struggling in the U.S. despite adding significantly more sales reps. Can you be more specific to why this is? And what we should expect there going forward? And then on international operations, you have been touching on China and a little on Turkey but could you also touch on and give us some more color on the growth that you see in Russia, India and Brazil and perhaps tell us if you are seeing a slowdown in any of these international operations countries, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Poul. This is Lars Rebien here. It is correct that our uptake in Europe and in particular in Japan has been quite strong, we have to say. This is a reflection of our market position historically in these markets. So that we have historically as you know enjoyed 70% plus in the Japanese market. We also have to note that our competition in Japan has made some mistakes which has made our offering more attractive. So we have a real ambition of surpassing <mark type="inaudible" /> in Japan in relatively short order. And also in Europe, it's a reflection of the long-standing relationship with the diabetes community and our strong position in insulin generally in Europe. And the U.S. development is a reflection of the competitive situation that I mentioned before, where there's an enormous pressure from sanofi- aventis, in particular, in the United States on Mantis and we are continuing to expand our market share with around 0.3 market share points per month. This is following our projections and we shall see how the competitive situation unfolds once we get to the next stage of the competitive gain is when we launch liraglutide with a necessary sales force and with the continued focus on our modern insulins. Jesper, do you have any comment on the IO region? In general I would just say as an introduction that Russia is doing quite well. China is doing quite well. We have occasionally issues around tenders in some of the developing countries like Brazil, some of the Middle Eastern countries, but do you have any further comments here pursuant to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's important to note that China in international operation is more than 20% of the turnover in that region so, of course, the growth in China which remains in the 40% loss range, of course being positively impacted this quarter by the higher sales of Novo Nor in Q1. But even if take that out we still seeing a growth in the ballpark of 40% coming from our Chinese operation, that is the most significant market. If we take the other markets, Brazil is showing solid progress in line with the growth level of growth of around 20% coming from our international operations. Russia have had a very positive first quarter of this year, but we have had the benefit of the timing of tenders for NovoSeven and growth hormone in Russia, which in 2008 has impacted our first half of first quarter of the year with approximately DKK 100 million. And last year these tenders primarily impacted Q2, so there's a timing issue there.</p>
          <p>And then finally you asked about India. India being a smaller market but in the Indian market we saw no increase in our business, actually a slight decline but that has something to do with a change in the distribution channel, a pipeline change on the line, we are still seeing growth in the Indian market in the ballpark of 20% when we look at that our full year expectations.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen, it's Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. Couple of questions, firstly to an '07 pipeline, how should we say expect you to act when you get the dates in interim study <mark type="inaudible" /> likely that you will see, that you will start-off additional studies with your new analog, if you do find that you don't see any particular effect in trauma with the current NovoSeven product. And then secondly, do you have any further information on your obesity trial, when should we expect a more thorough update on the obesity trial or upcoming obesity trial with liraglutide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Michael. Mads, what if any are you going to speculate on the future trauma situation after the interim analysis has been concluded and then obesity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well Michael, it is a so-called pre-planned interim analysis assessing whether there's futility or not in terms of continuing the study aimed at hitting the primary endpoint which as you might recall, is in a hierarchical order, first mortality and thereafter followed by mobility through Day 30. And they are kind of &#x2013; it's like not rolling a dice, but tossing a coin. You can say, if there's deemed futility, then what will happen is the study will be terminated in good order and published in high-ranking journals hopefully showing that the compound reduces bleeding and is safe to use. This is what we would hope based on Phase II trials, but we will then not get the label.</p>
          <p>The other situation is that we actually come through the futility analysis with a verdict that we should continue and that would obviously mean that there is a significant increased likelihood of them making the project hit its primary endpoint at the end of the day. If we had futility, would we then kick off a new study with the analog, even though it is molecularly speaking more designed for these kinds of patients, I think the short answer is probably not because the trauma setting is really one of the graveyards of drug development where no compound has ever made it, and I think NovoSeven is as good as it gets in that regard. But we'll see; it'll be very exciting.</p>
          <p>If we look at the obesity trial, then we had and are having negotiations with the various regulatory bodies and I think we are on track to be able to start Phase III before the end of this year. And are having new learnings. Well, yes or no, it's an emerging game, the obesity market and I think the important thing is to make sure that the trial is designed so that we can file for obesity approval after the first year of study, that it's powered, that it's geared in all means and respects to achieve that target. And then the whole discussion about pre-diabetes and prevention, we're taking slightly separately off the primary endpoint at this stage.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have two questions, if I may. Firstly, in terms of the heat-stable NovoSeven in Europe &#x2013; what sort of price premium do you think you'd be able to achieve on that? And secondly, your Q1 underlying operating margin was pretty close to 29% if you strip out the R&amp;D charges. That's considerably above your long-term targets. I'm wondering if you've given any thought yet to reviewing your targets. What timeframe you might see that in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. One for Mads and one for Jesper. Heat-stable NovoSeven, what are you anticipating in terms of value in that that could be reflected in the price, if any, and then on the margin targets and obviously that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to be quite frank, Michael, the way we predominantly see this is as yet a upgrade or benefits for patients in terms of ramping, able to carry around the product and use it upon demand. And what it should mean is that we'll have an increased likelihood of gaining market share rather than losing market share up against the plasma-based product called Fiber. So, rather than discuss price increases, this is the way we see the product. It's a real benefit to the patients and subsequently, potentially of course, also to our long-term stated market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Mads. And then Jesper, in terms of the growth margin, we seem to have strip things to surpass the target in the first quarter &#x2013; in your view, in your optic, give us a cost to revive our target and when?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you calculate through the guidance I gave before. We will be very close to the 25% operating margin level for 2008 at the current level of currencies. It also seems that we are &#x2013; we are growing in line with our long-term targets of delivering a operating profit growth of 15%. Although, there are a number of non-recurring items impacting it this year. In terms of return on invested capital, with the lower achieved effective tax rate, we're also doing extremely well. And there we're also being helped significantly by the lower level of investments, which adds to our return on invested capital. And the &#x2013; cash to earnings ratio is also developing favorably. So, provided that the currencies remain at the same level or actually improves during the year. Then, we would probably be in a situation at the end of this year, where we could conclude we had reached the long-term financial targets, which we set out at the start of 2006 and that I think will be a major achievement. Normally, we set out targets with a five-year horizon and we would have been able to achieve them in a three-year period. And it would be a logical point of time for Novo Nordisk to provide guidance for a new potentially around five-year horizon giving some guidance as to where our business would be going.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen. This is Sebastien Berthon from Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions please one could you update us on the Solostar litigation and if you still are planning to have any decision on this case. And secondly, with regards to your gross margins, you have an underlying improvement of 200 basis points in Q1. And you expect 100 basis points for the full year. I'm trying to see what could happen in the subsequent quarters that would &#x2013; have you achieving lower gross margins improvements than what you have achieved so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Sebastien, firstly Jesper, would you care to comment on the litigation before we go into further discussion on the growth margin development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Sebastien, as you know that there are two jurisdictions where we are challenging deferred situation for the SoloSTAR device from sanofi-aventis. The first is the U.S. litigation where we have had the case ongoing in a district court in the U.S. And it has now been deferred for a special assessment by a patent court, and that will be ongoing for the next around six months before we hear a ruling from this special patent court. So that's the &#x2013; that's was ongoing in the U.S. In Germany, we have an ongoing litigation in two courts in Germany. I would expect to have more clarity on those matters when we get with the &#x2013; get out to the market with our second quarter release.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin development, it is true that the guidance we're now giving is of a full year improvement in local currency of more than 100% it's lower than what we've achieved for the first quarter. Bear in mind that the price decrease in Japan is only impacting the &#x2013; from the second quarter onwards there will be on average a approximately 3% price decrease on our insulin, and slightly high on our growth hormone franchise in Japan and hence having an impact on gross margin, and then also bear in mind that the comparator, I have for Q1 of 76.4 in 2007 is a significant easier comparator then when you go into Q2 where the realized gross margin last year was 77.7 or actually higher than what I achieved in the first quarter of this year. So those would be some of the factors, which makes it more challenging.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just one left for me. You've obviously reduced your CapEx guidance for this year, is your long-term trend still in the sort of 7 to 8% range, or do you feel like updating us on that at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesper. It is correct that we have actually been able to improve productivity and manufacturing hence, the requirement for CapEx has been going down and especially considering now the examination of the pulmonary project, the short-term CapEx requirement is definitely. There is also suspense as a result of that on the contrary, so in terms of target, yes, but for CapEx longer term will that be included in the revenue that you will be sharing with the financial targets or how do you see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that would be an integrated element in the &#x2013; of the long-terms financial targets. But clearly with the guidance we're giving currently, we are more looking at a growth in our capital investment level to the tune of 6 to 7% in the near term horizon, than what we guided previously.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sorry, just two follow-ups, essentially on the CapEx and on the gross margin question. Just taking it to 6% next year, would take it from 2 to 3 billion, I mean, is it going to come &#x2013; basically I'm asking is it &#x2013; is the 67% a long-term or is it as of next year, because it seems like it quite a bit, a steep increase year-on-year in terms of the CapEx? And the second question on the gross margin, last year when you gave your three year CapEx outlook, you said, it's a 50 to 100% basis point improvement in the gross margins for both this year and next year. Now, given that you're ahead of target this year on an underlying basis, do you just get there early, and therefore, there is less of an improvement left in '09, or is this incremental? And then just conceptually, what I'm struggling with is, really understanding the FX impact. At what &#x2013; at what point do these underlying gross margin improvements come actually through on a reported level, what do currencies have to do, do they just have to stabilize, or do they actually have to reverse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Jesper, this is &#x2013; we are into the financial gymnastics at the moment. CapEx developments, a total comment from you and gross margin what will &#x2013; is it &#x2013; is going to be more difficult to reach the 2009 indication of auto based <mark type="inaudible" /> and what will happen with the currencies, and how does is that going to affect, you see, is the gross margin improvement going to flow through with stable currencies, or do we need to see a reversal of the current trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, the guidance, which I give currently which is, I believe, relevant for 2009 and '10 is the guidance in the ballpark of 6 to 7% and that would be reflecting that we expect to initiate a large new insulin filling facility, and that will probably be started off in China. And those costs will begin to materialize probably in the second half of this year with a significant proportion of the costs going into 2009 and '10. So that would be an element driving our overall CapEx.</p>
          <p>In terms of the gross margin, the guidance has been provided, given the current level of currencies. We remain confident that we can continue to improve our gross margin in same &#x2013; the reason why we gave it in local currency was just to basically say how it would develop on a two, three year horizon, if we have stable currencies. So provided we have stable currencies as of this new lower level, it is still our anticipation that looking at the local currency improvement in 2008, it will be in excess of 100 basis points looking towards 2009 and 10. We would anticipate that it will be in the ballpark of 50 to 100 basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a few questions. Again, going back to the gross margin, first of all just for clarity was that for 2009 and 2010, was that 50 to 100 basis points for the two years or was that for each year? And then also, would you just be able to give a bit of the breakdown in this gross margin improvement between what is attributable to our product mix, I assume mainly based on the rapid growth we've seen in insulin analogue. And how much of that is attributable to cost savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lisa, again, the model update on gross margin development. Let me talk, even more clear. The guidance I'm giving both for 2008 and '09 and '10 is a guidance for each year. So the guidance for '09 and '10 of 50 to 100 basis points is an improvement on the previous year, so continued improvement process. If we look at where the improvements have been in 2008, as the guidance for how it looks going forward, the &#x2013; it's approximately two-thirds of the improvement we have realized, which comes from better production economy, and approximately one-third, which comes from net better prices in the U.S. Of course, as I mentioned just before, there is no impact yet on the price decline in Japan that only hits when we get into the year, the later half of the year, or into the second quarter. And furthermore, we would also continue to expect some negative pricing impact from some of the European markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other improvements, the improvements come from &#x2013; the two-thirds of the improvement come from the production efficiencies that we have from better utilization of our facilities. Out of that, it's probably two-thirds that comes from better production of our proteins in our facilities here in Denmark and approximately one-third that comes from higher yield on the second lines that we have globally. You should be careful with product mix, because it's of course interesting to believe that the shift in our business from human insulin towards the modern insulin is improving the mix and hence our gross margin. That is how we're not the case as the prime growth and this was the first quarter where the highest growth contributor of the modern insulin was actually Levemir, and Levemir is due to the production process that I have previously explained, has a lower gross margin than the others. So the mix effect in Q1 is zero, so there's no mix effect. And I don't anticipate any significant mix effect going forward. So it would be higher production efficiency as we bring the volumes of the protein result and we fill them more efficiently into the line that is at the sustainable level. I have not in these 50 to 100 basis point guidance for 2009 and 2010 incorporated any significant levels of price increases in the U.S., only inflation costs and price increases.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper. And then if you allow me, ladies and gentleman, to conclude that we are beginning to exhaust the number of questions to ask for the last question. And then if you have additional questions, we are sitting by the phones with our Investor Relations people to take care of your other questions. So the last question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our final question is from Peter Verdult of Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, guys. It's Peter Verdult here from Citi in London. Two questions, one of them's not on the gross margin. Yes but just a little bit more on CapEx and capacity utilization. I mean you talked about this filling station in China. If we look at consensus for the <mark type="inaudible" />, I think we are looking at least $2 billion peak sales, that's what the growth expected with respect to the insulin analogs. What I'm trying to get a sense of is your current capacity utilization, I mean do you believe that you can support this expected growth with what you've got plus this filling station in China and if not, when in the future where might you need to increase CapEx to expand capacity?</p>
          <p>And then two very quick ones. Mads, just on the obesity data, yeah, last year you had a habit of sort of underpromising or promising data and coming in early with the LEAD study. I was wondering any chance that we might see a press release with the extension study in the obesity with liraglutide which could just coincidently coincide with the ADA. I realize you can't submit an abstract but just wondering when that data might be released to the market. And lastly, if you could just talk a bit more about your ability to put prices through in the U.S. this year versus last year and going forward. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Jesper, CapEx and capacity utilization in view of the fact that there are great expectations as the teams for liraglutide. I will be able to meet those expectations and how will that impact of capacity utilization. And with the filling plant or scott filling operation in China, how that's going to impact CapEx program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capacity for liraglutide in terms of bulk protein is quite significant and we are very comfortable with the situation, although of course there is huge variations in the expectations for the markets and then I would like to say for liraglutide that I think the most meaningful reference for liraglutide will be a very successful launch of an injectable product, of an injectable product within the area of diabetes. But, we believe we are well prepared for that in terms of having adequate production capacity for bulk protein.</p>
          <p>In terms of devices used to market liraglutide, of course we have our current insulin device portfolio that we can utilize and one of the triggers that actually have a significant impact on our CapEx going forward will be upgrades of the current device portfolio used for marketing, not only the insulin, but later also the GLP-1. And hence if we go to new generation of devices that will have significant cost implications on our filling and assembly sites around the world. So that is as a driver that can have implications for the investment to sales ratio. When you look at 9 and 10 and they're as I mentioned I believe that they're being in the 6 to 7% investment to sales ratio is a meaningful guidance for our investors.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jesper, Then Mads do you have any surprise announcements? I realize that if you announce them now then it won't be surprises. On obesity, since you've been able to deliver data earlier in connection with the LEAD studies. So what are your expectations for news flow on obesity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe to kind of let's say find you a little bit you can say that the news flow in general on liraglutide the rest of this year will of course be dominated by the submission process, i.e. updates on what's happening with the regulatory pieces for U.S. and Europe and Japan in Q2 and Q3 respectively. But we have many LEAD extensions ongoing both <mark type="inaudible" /> as you will recall there are extensions studies openly ongoing. But also in the Phase II obesity trial we have an open-label extension ongoing and furthermore we have a deep-six study where we are doing a head-on comparisons between liraglutide and Byetta which also has the chance of reporting basically some time towards the later part of this year. So there are many things that are ongoing in time that we will not necessarily see an open-label extension as something which is of a material nature because you do not gain true efficacy data based on these open-label extensions, but you do of course increase your safety database. So there will be a flow but part of this communications flow will be at conferences, so that for instance the full-blown Phase II data from the Byetta trial is expected to come out in extenso at a major North American obesity conference in the second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, ladies and gentlemen, on prices in the U.S., we have been able to raise this pricing in the U.S., however, at a modest level and remember there are always rebates tax for these prices. If we look at a time perspective of &#x2013; comparing to the last three to four years, price increases have been coming down and it is our expectation and our planning going forward that it would be increasingly difficult to achieve price increases in the U.S.</p>
          <p>With that, ladies and gentlemen, we actually managed to get a little bit overtime. We have passed 2 o'clock Danish Time. We would like to thank you for your participation and your interest in our company. Wish you all a happy summer vacation when you get to that and then we will talk to you again in August when we announce the first half results for Novo Nordisk. Thank you.</p>
