          <p>A warm welcome to everybody to this Atlas Copco Second Quarter Conference Call for the 2012 Results. I welcome, of course, everybody here in the room in Stockholm, but also all participants on the telephone conference.</p>
          <p>We will follow a very known format this afternoon. And I will soon hand over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ronnie Leten who will make a few comments around the results of the second quarter. And then we will move into Q&amp;A session as usual.</p>
          <p>This time I already now would like to ask the persons that are going to put some questions to limit the questions to maximum two, because sometimes it runs out to three and four and that shuts out other people from posing their questions on the call. So if I can ask you to do that, I would be more than pleased.</p>
          <p>So with that I hand over to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans-Ola, and good afternoon to all of you. But before I start to do my presentation, I would like to congratulate you, Hans-Ola, 75 times quarter results. So it is really 75 times he has been doing this, so I think this is a warm applause. I don't think there will be any CEO who will make that so many times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you &#x2013; Ronnie, when you ambush me like that I have to be able to respond. And I can say that you can take it two ways, either there is this, whatever you call him without fantasy, without anything better to do with his life or you can say it's a fountain of experience and everything all. So you choose whatever, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I choose the last.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks, anyway, Ronnie.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the last one. So let's then immediately go to slide number three, where I will comment on the highlight. And we really see a healthy demand in the market. Although you will say the organic order intake has slightly declined that's the fact, but we see still good, stable demand for the small to medium-sized equipment.</p>
          <p>If you make a comparison with quarter one and quarter two, which most of you have been doing, it's mainly the, I can say the lack of order intake of larger orders for larger compressors and mining equipment what makes the difference. And I will comment during my presentation several times on that.</p>
          <p>We see a very, very strong development in the aftermarket, which I'm very pleased to see that the efforts which we have taken since a while is also yielding good result. We see a sequential improvement in Asia, we compare with quarter one and included China, we read a lot in the press these days, but we see a slight improvement. And I'm very pleased to also say that also this time we have a record, we have actually two records. We have record revenue but also a very solid operating profit above SEK5 billion. And we keep, as we have said many times, keep continue to develop strong value.</p>
          <p>Slide number three is this, so that's the figures in summary, so I was wrong with the numbering. Nothing more you can read the figures maybe says, one thing which I like doing stresses the increase of profit 20% up to last year, so above SEK5 billion and a very solid operating cash flow almost around SEK2 billion and also an earnings per share which is also almost SEK3.</p>
          <p>We then look to the orders received side, year-to-date we are up 7% sequentially. You see here and there a softening. I will explain you a bit of the red figures when I'm going to the different regions. And then I'll start with Americas, and I'm now on slide number five. We see a still robust development in North America, so the order intake remains at a high level in almost all businesses we are visiting.</p>
          <p>When you look to the figures, when you compare year-on-year, so you see a minus 5%, this comes from the large order which we had last year in Mexico. You can say unfortunately we had not this year, but it was a big one, so around if I remember around $40 million, $45 million. So on this we had not, but the rest I think it's still at a good level. And we see also good development on the construction equipment.</p>
          <p>South America strong all over, Chile, Peru is really the market which is developing very well. And we see also sequential improvement in Brazil. You remember that I said several times, it is a bit softening but there we also see some improvements. Europe largely flat, if we have to look for the very positive spots it is East Europe and Russia, which are doing very well, where we have tougher conditions. We all know Southern Europe, I think that is no surprise for anyone, but I see also that the Western part of Europe is also getting tougher conditions.</p>
          <p>High level in Middle East and Africa, although you see a minus, but again here we had a very tough comparison, because last year we landed a big order in the Middle East for fuel gas boosters and we also landed a very large order in South Africa for mining, so that made the comparison also tough here. But if we take this away, we also see still a positive development in Africa and Middle East.</p>
          <p>Asia, I've already said, sequential improvement, and sequential improvement also in China. Year-on-year, a good development in mining. When we compare year-on-year, it's still softer when we take the industrial compressors and construction equipment. I can highlight also on that part, if we compare sequentially, it is improving in that area. So from that point of view, we should know that we are comparing with a very strong first six months last year. So that is something to take away when it comes to Asia and particularly to China.</p>
          <p>I see good development, talking about Asia, in India. That is this quarter. I see it also in Korea and I see it also the Singapore region, if I take it and then I mean Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Singapore as such. We see good development in that area.</p>
          <p>And Australia, what can I say more, it continues. Now even we landed a large compressor order for LNG, so which is also nice to see.</p>
          <p>Organic growth, we had nine positive quarters, so we didn't make 10 in a row. So this time we had minus 2% price volume.</p>
          <p>And now I'm in slide number nine, on the bridge. But what is good to see is that price keeps up. I think our work on innovation, new products, all the time work on that part is also &#x2013; and is yielding good stable results on that part. Volume is minus 4%, currency positive. We have all seen that part. And structural is mainly the Schucker acquisition which has given us an extra 3%.</p>
          <p>If you look here to the book-to-bill, you see more or less that we are in sync, so most &#x2013; as much as output as we had input.</p>
          <p>Let me go then to the different business areas. And I start with Compressor Technique on slide number 11. We have &#x2013; at least, that's my assessment, a healthy level of order intake. You can say yeah, but the order intake declined with 7%. Yes, but again don't forget, last year, China, the first three to six months were very strong and also this time we didn't land large equipment orders in this case. But I see a still good development, say, for the small to medium-sized compressors, the normal, say &#x2013; yeah, the normal installations go very well. A good development &#x2013; continuous good development on the aftermarket.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, 22%. We keep investing in presence, presence and presence. We really push hard on the organic growth part. As you also know that, I think, market share is extremely important for us in this business. But also, we keep investing in &#x2013; a lot in product development and really stretch that part more and more.</p>
          <p>And you see also here we have this time, this quarter also launched a full range of vacuum pumps. We have done the same for low pressure. And we all know <mark type="ph" /> cooking (10:12) costs money, and of course that's also an investment which goes immediately to the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>We also signed an agreement to acquire a Turkish company, a Turkish compressor company which has the majority of its activity in the Turkish region, but also in Russia.</p>
          <p>Industrial Technique keep being robust on order intake coming from the motor vehicle industry, which is very strong all over, all over in the world. We see a slight softening, or decrease as it says here, on general industry. But on the other hand, we see a good performance on the aftermarket. And the performance of the business area when it comes to the bottom line keeps &#x2013; continue at a good level, coming around 22.8%, so around 23% almost.</p>
          <p>Mining and Rock Excavation, the champs of this quarter, continue to be strong; on the mining side, a bit less. And you remember also what I said quarter one, that I was surprised to see such a big swing up on the mining side, because at that time we landed a couple bigger orders, which all come together in one quarter and, of course, we accept these orders for sure. So that is when you go to compare it, it will be a negative comparison. We see a slight decrease on equipment. On the other hand, we see a very strong development on aftermarket and consumables, and that continues. Record operating profit in absolute terms and also a fantastic operating margin of 24.8%.</p>
          <p>And the last business area Construction Technique, more or less flat, say unchanged; good order intake in North America that continues to develop very well. We see also a more positive development in Brazil.</p>
          <p>And remember also that was mentioned several times. We see a bit of weakness with Asia and Europe, I what I want to say that it's not that it really now comes back in Asia, although I said there is a sequential improvement in China. It does not mean that it is now suddenly swinging up. There is improvement, and you also know that when it comes to Construction Technique in Asia, we have a lot of potential. So every activity which we do is, yeah, can give &#x2013; yield good results. And the operating margin is around 13% coming from, say, the low 10% we had in the first quarter. So we are on the right track on Construction Technique business area.</p>
          <p>The group total, the figures, nothing more to say, which I have already said, so I will go immediately to the profit bridge where it is all coming from. You see we get a bit of contribution from the acquisitions, we &#x2013; from the currencies they have helped us this quarter. And you see the price volume part which is around 20% in the flowthrough.</p>
          <p>If we go to the business area profit bridge, different ones, really you will immediately spot it on Compressor Technique. Like I already said, we keep investing in the presence, we keep investing in product development and we also, we should say, we had, when we made the comparison quarter two to quarter two year-on-year, we also had an unfavorable mix, make it a negative flowthrough. Although all this are more or less, I think in line what we can all see and read and understand.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet, there is nothing special beside one and you also have read that in the write-up where it says the assets classified as held for sales, so there we have negotiated a sale of some &#x2013; so a part of our customer finance mainly for the &#x2013; mainly and only for the Australian market. So we will see when that really will &#x2013; sale will really go through, but we have already classified that it is for sale. And it has an effect on a couple lines on the balance sheet, but the rest I think it's nothing major on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, like already said, a solid cash flow. Tax paid SEK1.3 billion in the quarter. The rest is mainly straight-forward. You see also the change in working capital get less and less, which I think is also the work we have been doing to be highly focused on the receivables and on the inventory, so giving SEK1.8 billion operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>And then, the most &#x2013; maybe most looked slide on it by most of you here present and listening in, that is, we still believe that the overall demand for our products and services is expected to remain at this current high level.</p>
          <p>And by this, I'd like to give the word to Hans-Ola.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And I will immediately pass it on, if I use that expression. So we enter the Q&amp;A session, and we will start with two questions here in Stockholm this time and then we will move on to the conference call. But in order to start, can we have the operator, please repeat the procedure for the telephone conference questions, please.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you very much. As I said, we start over here then, and I had a question, I think here. Yeah, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kenneth Toll Johansson from Carnegie. A question on Compressor Technique, you say that the margin is held back a bit from your investments into increasing presence and product development. Now, we see that in the order intake, the volumes are falling a bit and the macro outlook is a little bit more uncertain. Are you thinking anything about scaling back your ambitions on increasing presence and then putting money into R&amp;D, in order to protect margins going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, I have to start explaining our business model first, but I will rephrase from that. First, of course, when you see sales going down, of course, one thing we need to make sure that we, with our flexible setup, what we say ours is a agile resilient business model. We need to make sure we adapt on our variable part.</p>
          <p>But I think it would be wrong really to hold back on the design and development. You know also these cycles, how long they are, there are not cycles of three months, there are cycles of three, four, five years. So I think we should keep going on in that part.</p>
          <p>I think it would also be wrong not to invest. And now I'm particularly thinking about Asia to keep further developing our presence, to grow talent, to invest in training, than to go for short-term, one quarter, two quarters.</p>
          <p>So I'm still a believer that there is a great future on Compressor Technique, when we talk, like the example I gave on low pressure, the world will need low pressure compressors. The world will need vacuum. The world will need efficient compressors. So I think it's our task to really work further on that part. So I will definitely not balance that part. Having said that, of course, everybody would like, I would like to have both and that is, of course internally, it's working on efficiency that we will do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You haven't initiated any extra cost out programs due to slowing orders right now or....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the different set-ups, of course it is always that when these things happen, that you must be able to adapt your costume. That is definitely we have done, and we discussed that. And of course, you have been looking that at the last six months already that you feel things coming and we have already worked on that and we are ready to go further on that, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peder Fr&#xF6;l&#xE9;n, Handelsbanken Capital Markets. Related topic, aftermarket growth, could you help us with that, year-on-year, group-wise, to get a feel also sequentially? And you mentioned on Mining and Rock Excavation Technique, but also, I guess, in compressors that, we see a rather decent aftermarket growth year-on-year. Could you shed some light on those topics, please? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think when it comes to the aftermarket and I'm really showing some enthusiastic reaction, I think then you should read me that it is above double-digit. That is double-digit, let's say. That's as far as I would give the <mark type="ph" /> differently (20:31). So it is a solid development that come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the year-on-year figure I guess. Do you see...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also sequential. I think it's still going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not double-digit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Not double &#x2013; yeah, we can &#x2013; giving the year growth &#x2013; yes...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And any division here that needs to be commented upon, a particularly strong or weak one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. When it comes to the aftermarket, of course you have &#x2013; when you take &#x2013; if you take an example on Compressor Technique, which is the industrial aftermarket, that is continuous developing. There you don't get &#x2013; really when it comes to aftermarket on the mining side as we go in, you can sometimes get big orders, big contracts, which you get a little bit &#x2013; that can go sometimes faster for a while now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on the inventory and partly related to this, we have seen an inventory build in relation to sales <mark type="ph" /> gearing (21:25) to structural reasons in the last couple of years, acquisitions and divestitures, but also given the expansion into your aftermarket and service, what should we expect, a couple of years down the road? And with the current structure of Atlas Copco, how much inventory should you actually carry? And to get to that process, is there risk here for a margin overhang? In that sense, do you need to make the inventory more efficient to get the cash flow out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, do we need to make the inventory more efficient? Yes. You know, there is always a better way. I think I'm not going to back off on that part, neither internally, neither externally.</p>
          <p>In the two areas where we had the biggest improve &#x2013; potential improvement on the inventory is on Construction Technique and is on the mining side. So that is from an improvement point of view.</p>
          <p>Then, I think when it comes, if you have seen what we have been doing the last 10 years, Atlas Copco moved from &#x2013; at that time already had a direct sales concept but less than today. We are really moving more and more to a direct company. So that means our supply chain to the <mark type="ph" /> outbound (22:42) is longer. And you cannot eat the cake twice. It's not that when the machine is leaving our factory that we already have sent the invoice to the customer. He will say, hey, wait, because before the order &#x2013; when the machine is delivered in Kitwe in Zambia, it takes a while. He will not accept that I will send him the invoice when it leaves &#xD6;rebro. So these types we also should say you cannot eat the cake twice in that part. So that is something when you make a comparison in Atlas, you should see. And as we get more sales now like to Chile, to Australia and all that, the supply chain becomes longer, which is partly in the supply chain, is capital tied up. But on the other hand, as we do it direct, you also have the aftermarket. And that's what I mean, you cannot eat twice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, it doesn't seem that you are particularly worried about inventory to sales level in <mark type="ph" /> per se (23:40), but of course always working with additional improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not, so to say, worried, I'm not, no. As I look to that, it's not. But, of course, I would definitely work and if you will call in people internally, you will see that is a focused area where we need. Because I see it more as improving our flow, and that's efficiency and efficiency is competitiveness and that helps on that part.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So we go to the telephone conference. The first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question comes from Alexander Virgo [Berenberg Bank]. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much and good afternoon, gentlemen. I just had two quick ones, please. The first, can you give us some idea of what the underlying operational leverage was in CT, excluding the sort of &#x2013; the investments you've alluded to?</p>
          <p>And the second question, again on CT, you mentioned large compressor weakness in terms of the orders. Do you think that that's indicative of a change in customer outlook or behavior? Or how would you &#x2013; how else would you interpret that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I suggest the first one Hans-Ola take, and I will first do the second one.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But it will be very short answer. Of course, this is dissecting the micro parts of the result, and I'm not going to get into that trap. The operational underlying leverage &#x2013; then we are really talking about the third derivate of the slides that we normally show, but it's impossible to &#x2013; even if we wanted to, to eliminate that type of an effect because it appears in many different shapes and forms, it deals with product development, it deals with the market investments that Ronnie alluded to. So I don't have an indication for you to &#x2013; or any answer to give you on what is really the flowthrough from the pure comparable.</p>
          <p>If we look at this way of talking about incremental profit generation from increased sales, of course, we sell sometimes more of exactly the same. But sometimes we sell more of the examples that also Ronnie alluded to. It's not just product development, we also sell more of these. But to know exactly in what phase and what is the underlying leverage coming from those increased sales, we only know perhaps if we look back five years from now and try to understand what really was the composition. So it is an impossible task, I'm sorry about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, then second question you had put forward is on the large compressors. One should know, and that's the comparison we are making, we compare with the first six months last year where we had a very strong Asia, where primarily you also see &#x2013; when you &#x2013; in the mix part more larger compressor orders than you see in Europe or you see in U.S. So that is from a comparison point of view what you should take into account.</p>
          <p>Now, I think, of course, what is also playing, and now I put me on an area which you can debate on, of course, a certain uncertainty, maybe a more difficult financing, maybe may get sometimes more difficult that these orders are landed. So that is another thing what I take into consideration. But I didn't see any &#x2013; besides the China, Asian, I didn't see any pattern in our order intake that it is &#x2013; so it is specific this, so that we...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions. The first one would be on your guidance of stable demand in the near term, and I just wanted to have a bit more color on the outlook for the different end markets. I guess, given the weaker demand for mining exploration, you tend to have a rather cautious view on mining equipment. It's usually a good leading indicator. So, does it mean that you expect the other end markets to offset that?</p>
          <p>And my second question would be about the small industrial compressor, your yellow canaries in China and the sequential development you've seen in Q2 versus Q1 and what is your view for Q3. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think when it comes to the mining part, then of course that is an area which has been in the press a lot. And I will comment only what I see because I'm not, I think, going to talk for someone else in this case. I see that on the equipment side, we still see a healthy demand.</p>
          <p>On the exploration side, we see it's definitely &#x2013; it's not really booming or whatever, it's really on the flattish side, I think, when it comes to the exploration. There are still some spots &#x2013; geographical spots we're doing very well on the exploration. There is a couple of others where you see some hesitations to go ahead on that. Is that really an indicator? If I see on the orders for copper, what is going on there in Chile, in Peru, I see also in Africa, then I'm still positive on the mining side when it comes to equipment.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the yellow canaries, I think they still do their work. I see if I go a little bit deeper than only to take a general, I see still a good development in North America for this part of our business. And surprise, surprise, I see still a good development, a good level for the small to medium-size compressors in Asia. So it's not &#x2013; definitely not falling off the cliff, neither in China.</p>
          <p>You don't hear me saying that I see it going up like that. And then, that is also what &#x2013; that these type of businesses never do. They really listen very carefully on that. But it's not that I see a real drop in that business, a real &#x2013; really ease &#x2013; a really positive flat path, if I can say, on this one, yeah. Try not to sound...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's <mark type="ph" /> Guillermo Peigneux from UBS (30:55). A couple of questions actually. First, regarding mining equipment, through the quarter, is there any particular month that you've seen, a particularly weaker demand, i.e. is the trend one of deteriorating demand for equipment in mining or it's been just flat around the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then second question regarding weak incrementals in Compressor Technique, when do you expect those weak incrementals to normalize in a way? I understand that the volumes are somewhat weaker, but if on a normal volume environment, when would you sort of expect those 25% incrementals to come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the large orders, that's the way I would like to answer this first question. You said it's &#x2013; when you look to &#x2013; when you take sales figures month to month, I think you always, especially on the mining side, you really can have big swings and that you need really to look which are the big orders. And some of these big orders, you sometimes work for one year, two years.</p>
          <p>So then suddenly they get and as we have seen, if you take quarter one, I remember my surprise, because then we got much more larger orders, which maybe I would have preferred them to get them spread over two quarters.</p>
          <p>And that is so, but if I take again and that's &#x2013; I try to comment also during my presentation, we see still a good base development. You see that on the consumable parts that it still runs. So, you see there is still quotation levels going on all over. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a particular month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. If I take away &#x2013; I have to clean it from large orders &#x2013; yeah, yeah. Yeah, when it comes to CT on the incremental parts, I think &#x2013; of course, these investments we do on the vacuum, these investment on low pressure and other matter because they should yield because otherwise we have a redevelopment business with low profitability, and that's not the case. So, I think we should expect that in whatever quarter, in the near-term quarters we get back to a good level that one. Because if I say the 22% is not a punishment, we should really calibrate this.</p>
          <p>I think the 24% because this is a bridge where we compare the figures with the flow-through. The 24% is a very solid level. Maybe the 22% is with currency. We say yeah, you need to look at it. It could be better. But there, I try to explain that it is with more investments we are doing on the organic part on that. But you should expect a positive trend from this flow-through for sure. There is nothing really what you should say that but it is special or whatever, it's nothing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had another question here in the room perhaps. Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So that Compressor Technique had launched certain type of vacuum pumps. So my question is, is Atlas Copco going to be a wider pump company with a broader array of pumps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you take compressors when that is &#x2013; then we talk about gas. When you talk about pumps, people &#x2013; now, I'm starting to explain aerodynamic and fluid technology. That's different when you talk pumps and you talk liquids. Here, we talk really &#x2013; and vacuum is still a gas or air or whatever you do.</p>
          <p>So, that is an area where I think &#x2013; which is the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:52) of Atlas Copco. And the vacuum part, we used to have that &#x2013; yeah, not a full range. We have never been talking about. Now, we really put more focus on this because this is a potential for us which is close to home to for us when it comes to technology, when it comes to the same customers, when it comes to the same people, what will grow it, and also understanding the theory of aerodynamic. So that is what we really explore. Will we be successful because we are small? So it will take a while before we are with the larger players if we ever come to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hans. Our next question comes from Klas Bergelind. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Klas Bergelind from Nomura. I have two questions, please. And sorry to get back on mining, but I'm really interested in the split between the aftermarket and equipment and civil engineering. Given that aftermarket and the civil engineering is basically up year-on-year, is it unfair to assume that mining equipment orders are down, let's say, 20% year-on-year or maybe 30% to 40% sequentially? So that is my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is really a follow-up on that. If you could help me understanding if this weakness was purely driven by a difficult comp or if you see any underlying weakness in mining currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the first one, I'm...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we cannot give you. We can take it together, Ronnie. The exact distribution, we have never disclosed because it's not really numbers that lends itself to follow even on a quarter basis in that way. You are right, of course, in that one is growing and the other one cannot be growing, because the total was down in volume. So, obviously that is the case.</p>
          <p>But we are focusing on the aftermarket and we are growing that piece. We are very happy with the consumables development and the aftermarket development. Whereas on the equipment, I come back to what Ronnie has been commenting many times already that the flow of large orders is not very steady and it doesn't come like a pearl of strings like that. And that is one of these things that we have to take, let's say, into consideration when we compare one quarter with the first quarter or even with the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>So, it's &#x2013; and on the underlying situation, I think well, you can repeat almost what you have said before if there is an underlying weakness in the mining demand for equipment, Ronnie. And I don't know if we should repeat it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I already mentioned where I see where is our biggest exposure on the mining side. It is iron ore. It is copper. That is the majority of then you can say golden part of that. And there we still see some development going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry to follow-up. But I'm hearing from some other guys that iron ore orders in equipment are actually down year-on-year. And I was just &#x2013; so you are basically confirming that that's still holding up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think because year-on-year, I think when you look, I think, on the equipment side, some of the &#x2013; we are really running at a high level. And I don't see &#x2013; and that is I'm talking now. I'm not talking in the future because that I don't know. That would be like I would like to know. If I see now, it's more or less on the same level. That is what that we see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a very quick follow-up and then I'll leave it over to the next question. But when you're looking at inventory build obviously up SEK700 million on a group level, are you taking down inventories in mining given the weak orders or is that inventory build actually happening in mining?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned at in another question. I think the majority of our inventory today is on construction technique and is on the mining side. And then when it comes to on the mining side, these are machines which are on their way to customers. That is you should see our inventory.</p>
          <p>Our inventory, all our machines which we produce whatever in the world got already a customer order. So they are on their way to be delivered. And some of course sometimes it takes a bit more time to get it installed, because we only get it when it's delivered, so to say, and working and commissioned. Then really, it clicks in from inventory to accounts receivable side. So that is the way it works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just perhaps to really stress that last point, as Ronnie says, it's a flow. There is an order to the equipment that is produced and that triggers the purchase of components, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a flow. It's not that we are trying to estimate what is the right level of inventory. So when we say we can do better and drive down inventory, it's only that we can shorter the lead time of our chain by being more efficient. That is what we always are coming back to. That's the way we work with inventory, not saying that let's get rid of 30% of the inventory. It's not the way it works with this present setup that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you make a benchmark between CT and mining a rock excavation when it comes to the level, I would make this statement here. You will never be able to make the same ratio in the mining as you make in compressor, never.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you are effectively saying that when you are getting the sort of &#x2013; when the drill rig for example is on place in Australia being shift out from Europe, that is when you get sort of the revenue recognition that is lowering the inventories to sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's a function of lead times rather than an internal sort of inefficiencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And of course, you always find some inefficiency because you have local adaptations and okay, people are not starting immediately on this part. So I can give you 100 reasons why I believe it should be lower and why it is on this level. And that is also what we are working on because I said, guys, we can do better on that part. Because when you travel in the world, you see these and say, okay, why we have not invoiced this order. Yeah, but we have to do this and this and it hangs here a week and it hangs there two weeks and it stays on the balance sheet.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the Andre Kukhnin. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Andre from Credit Suisse. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, I wanted to check on the labor inflation in emerging markets, especially China. That was one of the issues at the beginning of the year that we talked about it a lot. Can you just comment on that how that's evolved? And what are you doing to deal with it at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we had some salary increases there, which were a little bit below 10% if you take it all over the company and in China. So that is what we had in the beginning of the year. I think we do it once a year. We'll see what happens when we are back after Chinese New Year next year, so where it will come.</p>
          <p>Today, of course, you see the inflation is, compared to last year, a big difference. So I would &#x2013; the likelihood giving lower inflation, the likelihood that the labor market will most likely be less stressed that we will have labor cost inflation. I think that will be, yeah, very remote, I'd say it this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps it could be, to add on that, that what we can do as Atlas Copco in that scenario is not really to make the market have 8% salary increases. They become what they are so to speak. However, we are very focused on reducing, for example, the turnover rate of our people because you might have to accept the salary increase. But the cost, if you have a very high turnover rate, is of course much more difficult to handle. And that we are very pleased that we are running at actually a much lower turnover rate of our employees than the benchmarks that we see for international and Chinese companies for that matter in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our focus, when it comes to labor force in China is make sure we develop our talent and we keep our talent, and second we improve our efficiency. These are the two areas where we are constantly working on. And like Hans-Ola already said, when it comes to the labor inflation, of course you can do something. But if the whole world or the whole China is doing then and you don't do anything, I don't think your talent will stay with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question I have is on CT. Would you say you've taken market share in CT in second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm always very careful to make any public statement when it comes to market share. I think we're working hard to see as much customers as we can, to really also convince them that they had the lowest life cycle cost with us. We invest in presence and we keep doing that. So from that, maybe you can deduct that, yeah, we had positive development. But if you go to ask me, do you gain market share in Czechia or do you gain market share in Canada, yeah, that will be another answer then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Lastly, I just wanted to ask maybe a slightly strange question. But just hypothetically, if we imagine a year of no capital equipment sales growth, like 2015 I think might prove to be, would you say your aftermarket would still grow in that environment? And what kind of range do we think of, the kind of high single-digit that you've achieved, say, on average over the last 10 years or should it be better or worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when it comes to the aftermarket and when you read back about our strategy, I think we have two areas where we work in the aftermarket. It's climb the service ladder so to extend our product offer or service offer to our customers, so to help them to reduce their lifecycle cost. And there, I can tell you that we still have a lot potential. Second, do we service all our equipment when it comes from mining equipment, when it comes from tools, or it comes from whatever construction or compressor? I can tell you not; there is still a lot to take. And that is where we need to work and to develop products and to develop and train our sales people, so to convince our customers that we can do a better job than they do it themself or one of our competitors can do.</p>
          <p>So I'm rather confident that I think we can keep going on with growth. And if you look back 2009, if we take the crisis which was one of the deepest one really, then you saw also that we kept up a reasonable level on the aftermarket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So I look around here in Stockholm if we have another. Yes, we have another question here as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillermo from UBS. One follow-up on China. When you say sequentially improving, is that seasonally adjusted for both construction and industrial compressors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to construction, I think when &#x2013; with sequential, you saw last quarter &#x2013; now, I say last quarter of last year, quarter four and quarter one were very soft in construction. And all what you have been reading is also what we have experienced. I see some positive signs on that part. You see some orders landing on that one. But as I already said, when it comes to construction, China and Asia, Atlas Copco is a smaller player. So all the efforts and focus what we do is a gain. So if you will ask me to say a quote on demand, you should be very careful to what I say and interpret it.</p>

          <p>Thanks, sir. Our next question comes from Aaron Ibbotson [Goldman Sachs]. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I'll be kind to you. I only got one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a favorite talk topic of contribution margins. This regarding sort of the details within the various divisions, as we're seeing equipment sales grow or like sales in general grow &#x2013; sales growth in general slow, should we expect contribution margins to tick up for the group, as I believe previous communication is that contribution margins from aftermarket is substantially higher? And if I look at the group, you've sort of gone from double-digit last quarter up to 18%, 19% this quarter. Do you expect this to continue to increase through the year because of stronger aftermarket or is there something else at play that we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, of course, we would agree that if nothing grows except for the aftermarket, that is normally a good sign for the margin development, because it is significantly more profitable per krona, so to speak. But at the same time, nothing is static. And depending on what phase we are in adjusting, let's say, to a slowdown of order intake or whether we are in a phase where revenues for equipment are falling, but actually, the orders received are stable, that will also affect the load of the factories, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So it is a very difficult question. Normally, what we have seen is that we have seen an aftermarket that is stable even in 2009 or can even continue to grow. And we have seen falling equipment sales. In that scenario, of course, you lose something of the contribution, let's say, the absorption of fixed cost in the factories. And even if Atlas Copco is not a very leveraged operational company as you know, there is of course some effect of that. And so, it's very difficult to say yes, you will see that in that scenario. But your basic underlying question is it still so that the aftermarket will yield a better operating margin, yes, definitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if &#x2013; I'm just trying to understand how you're expanding or contracting your sort of equipment cost base, call it. So if we go back to the previous question, I believe suggested a scenario where equipment sale is roughly flat and aftermarket is up, call it high single-digit. Would you still expect to have a sort of should we call it normalized contribution margin or would you still expect that to be weaker because of not increasing equipment sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would probably be normalized in that very hypothetical or, let's say, theoretical as you said yourself, theoretical example. But again, the phase that we happen to be in in that quarter when we are standing here analyzing, can look differently. And that's what I mean that it's very difficult to talk, have an opinion about that before we are actually there. So I just suggest that we keep on reporting every quarter and we try to keep very transparent how the result is coming out. And that is probably the best indicator for what will happen also in the future.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Andreas Willi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Andreas from JPMorgan. I have just one question as well. It's regarding outlook visibility and large orders. For Q2, you were looking for flattish demand orders, then were down on Q1 because of the weaker larger orders. How much visibility do you have on some of these larger orders that didn't happen in Q2 happening in Q3 and kind of what's been baked in in your guidance or expectations for flattish demand in Q3?</p>
          <p>Did some of these orders just slip the quarter or is this a general change in trend that may be benefiting from Hans-Ola's 75 quarters? What historically happens if you basically have weak large orders across most businesses across most regions? What happened in the quarters afterwards normally? Is it just a leading indicator for the smaller orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even with 75 quarters of experience, your question became more and more difficult to answer the longer you asked. But I just wanted &#x2013; before Ronnie gets his correct answer to the question. Remember that we're only talking about what we see in the demand development from our customer segments. That's what our customer centers around the world are trying to explain to us, as we are in this phase of looking forward one quarter.</p>
          <p>We are not making a projection about our order intake. And that's again because of the situation that Ronnie has alluded to that we have large orders. We have chain. We don't know exactly the timing. And so, our outlook is never, how should I say it, tainted by the fact that we know that we didn't get it now, but we get it in two weeks so to speak. That you should not read into it, Andreas. But I'll leave the difficult part to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think, first I think when you compare quarter one and quarter two, when you say that, I think you should of course first recalibrate quarter one when we were trying to explain it because quarter one was &#x2013; and I got here the question I think you asked me, what about the real orders. Because sometimes, we get larger orders which really make the quarter either look bad or look good look. And that I think you should &#x2013; when you look to an outlook, you should take that away.</p>
          <p>When it comes to what is our visibility and how does it work and how do we work on that or is it just Hans-Ola and myself who sits together and say, Hans-Ola what are we going to say this time and how consistent can we be. I think we talked to all the different businesses and the businesses are all talking to their people. And you know we have a whole roll-up system which we do every month, every quarter, and every year. So that was up. And then we see what comes out of that. And that's where really when we come to the figures.</p>
          <p>Second is when we listen also to the market, what are the leading indicators which we use. And we say, okay, are these consistent of what we see. And that is what we try to do and see where we end. So, that's the type of visibility we have and somewhere, the business have reasonably good visibility because they have their quotation level.</p>
          <p>The only thing is when it comes to the large order and I can tell you sometimes I would like to have the large order end at the 31st of March come in, but it comes the 1st of April, because it just come in. So then we also have to take it when it comes in. So that is the way it works. So, our visibility is, I think, is reasonable. Can it be better? It's not exact science. But it's based on all the different sensors we have in the business, which look to it and we roll it up and then we say, okay, does it match with some general indicators that we had.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have time for another question from the telephone line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Final question come from Ben Maslen [Merrill Lynch International]. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Ronnie. Hi, Hans-Ola. Just one question from me, please, on Mining and Rock Excavation Technique. Hans-Ola, you mentioned factory loading. I think in the past, you used third parties to assemble some of your drill rigs and loaders and so forth. Can you just talk a bit about whether you still do that and how the relationship works? And then just maybe, how of much of your overall assembly capacity, if you can measure it like that, is with third parties? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually don't have a number. So, I'll leave it to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can answer on that one. It's still a significant part and then I don't have an exact figure either. But it's a significant part where we do, say, assembly work with partners outside of our operations which really do that work. Because otherwise, I think we should really have extended the assembly flow space enormous. This happens mainly in U.S. and in Sweden. We don't do that in China and India. But that's also the majority of the work is done for MR is done in Sweden and is done in U.S. But we still do it at, I think, at a higher magnitude as we were doing that in 2007, 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And what kind of &#x2013; is there any way of measuring what kind of volume drop you could suffer in Mining and Rock Excavation and then still have your own factories relatively full?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It can go to &#x2013; no, because you will come back to that, Ben. But I think it is significant we can drop. It's a significant drop, because we know from history that &#x2013; of course I hope it will not happen. But we know that certainly these things can come to a standstill. Because on the mining side, it can all be sunshine every day. But at a certain moment, you get to stop and then it's a stop for a quarter or six months or a year. These things can happen and we are built or we have made our concept like that. I don't allow them to invest in more floor space, more roof. I think they should look for other alternatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I seem to have one final question on the telephone line or perhaps not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Our next question comes from Jonathan Mounsey. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Jonathan Mounsey from Exane Capital Goods team. Just a question on capital allocation. So obviously, we see a strong balance sheet. There have been questions about special dividend or significant acquisitions. I think you've talked about it in the past. Could you give any comment on whether you're considering perhaps a special dividend at the year-end or alternatively whether the pipeline for acquisitions is looking particularly strong right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The sequence of capital allocation is of course to support our business, our organic growth. That, I think, is first priority. I think the second priority, what we have, is acquisitions. It can be small, which we &#x2013; for sure, I can promise you, we will have some more to come on that part. We are hunting and the likelihood you land smaller ones is much larger than you will land a bigger one. But we are exploring the market. When it comes, we will take it. And then, that is the second priority.</p>
          <p>And the third priority is shareholders, is either a dividend or something else. Who knows what will come out? But that, I think, will be a subject which Hans-Ola and I, we will debate and then also discuss it with the Chairman and the board, I think, at the end of the year when we see the reality coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even if I would underline as well the sequence that Ronnie said, we both would like to say that shareholders are not coming third. But they are coming very high up on our agenda. But in this capacity, yes, we go for organic growth and capital allocation, acquisition and then see if we have still capital enough. Then of course, we have no problem like we did in 2005, 2007, 2011 to look at do we actually have too much capital in relation to our plans and still being a conservatively leveraged company.</p>
          <p>Yes, I think that is more looking &#x2013; look in the history and I think that will tell you that there are perfect possibilities that that will also be repeated in the future. But everything comes in that order that Ronnie said so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one thing is also &#x2013; maybe Hans-Ola, we can elaborate. I think when it comes to more CapEx investments going for expanding capacity, that is not much for the time being in the pipeline. I think we have done a couple bigger ones which are now landing the cash flow when it was here in Sweden. I think we did a couple in India, which we will open very soon, and the same is in China. We believe that giving the present volume we need, I think we have reasonable good capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. We don't foresee any further growth in those type of investments, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And knowing that this company makes 20% EBIT plus and you see what the flow through is, then you can calculate yourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that sounds like acquisitions or capital return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it doesn't lead &#x2013; you don't get much left, so to speak, because the organic growth, we seem to be able to satisfy without having a big capital need. That's why we are so cash generative. And again, as a final note, I think the priority of organic acquisitions and then distribution is quite okay with a 38% return on capital employed. So that's a little bit how we like to see the shareholder still being well taken care of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that, I think that we reached the end. Of course, as usual, we, meaning myself and the Investor Relations team at Atlas Copco, we are happy to respond to more questions following this. But I thank you for participating both here and on the telephone conference. Thank you very much.</p>
