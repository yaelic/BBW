          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the News Corporation 4Q 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And then, later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and the instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2012 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>First, we'll give you some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter. And then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-K for the 12 months ended June 30, 2012, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and the reconciliation of such measures can be found on our earnings release and our 10-K filings.</p>
          <p>Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures is included in the earnings release.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you'll have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2012, achieving the financial targets we provided to you a year ago.</p>
          <p>For the full year adjusted total segment operating income was $5.6 billion, 13% higher than the $4.975 billion in adjusted total segment operating income we reported a year ago. This increase was driven by a 19% operating profit growth at our Cable Networks, 22% growth in contributions from our Filmed Entertainment segment and the elimination of MySpace related losses, partially offset by lower publishing results.</p>
          <p>Reported net income this year was $1.2 billion or $0.47 per share, which included impairment and restructuring charges of $3 billion, equating to $1 per share, primarily taken in the fourth quarter and mostly related to the company's publishing assets.</p>
          <p>Additionally, full year results include gains of $270 million or $0.07 per share from the company's participation in BSkyB buyback program and $224 million in costs related to the UK investigations, also representing $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>Excluding the net income effects of these items and comparable items in both years, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41, compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.18. This 19% improvement primarily reflects our operating segment income growth and the buyback of close to 10% of the company's outstanding stock over the course of last year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. And for the quarter, the company reported adjusted segment operating income of $1.24 billion, as compared to $1.35 billion reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. This anticipated decline, which was discussed in our last earnings call, reflects continued growth in our Cable Networks, more than offset by decreases at the company's remaining segments.</p>
          <p>The company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of $1.6 billion, largely reflecting the previously mentioned impairment or restructuring charges that offset segment operating income. Fourth quarter results also include charges of $57 million related to the investigation in the United Kingdom. Excluding these charges and the comparable items in the prior year, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.32 per share as compared to the year ago adjusted EPS of $0.35 a share.</p>
          <p>And now let's &#x2013; I'll provide some comments on the fourth quarter performance in a couple of our businesses. And let's start with the Cable Networks; this segment continues to drive overall company results generating two-thirds of News Corporation's total segment operating income.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter operating income contributions increased over 25% from year-ago level to $792 million, reflecting particularly strong results at Fox News and FX domestically and at both the Fox International Channels and STAR internationally. This growth continues to be top line driven with segment revenues up 15%. Affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 19% over year-ago levels, with domestic affiliate fees up 16% &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; driven by our successful affiliate renewals earlier in the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>International fees were up 31% with about half of the international affiliate revenue increase driven by organic growth and the remainder reflecting the consolidation of Fox Pan American Sports, after acquiring that business in December.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter advertising revenues for the segment were up 9% over year-ago levels, with domestic ad growth of 5% and international growth of 18%. This strong result from the international businesses reflects particularly strength in viewership trends and ad markets in Latin America and India, as well as this year's contribution of Fox Pan American Sports.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter expenses in the Cable Networks increased 11% over a year ago. This primarily reflects increased sports programming due to costs, due to the delay of the NBA season and the resulting increase in televised games this quarter. It also reflects the launch of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as the impact of Fox Pan American Sports.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $213 million, decreased $20 million versus the fourth quarter a year ago. This decline is largely due to American Idol and other rating softness that more than offset higher retransmission revenues and higher political advertising at the station.</p>
          <p>At our Filmed segment, fourth quarter operating income was $120 million, a $90 million decline compared to a year ago, largely reflecting the expected difficult comparisons to last year's very successful theatrical release of Rio and the strong home entertainment titles, Black Swan and The Chronicles of Narnia.</p>
          <p>This quarter results included the launch cost of a number of successful theatrical releases that will help set up the Filmed segment for a solid fiscal 2013, and they include Prometheus and of course Ice Age: Continental Drift, which has generated over $715 million in total worldwide box office to date.</p>
          <p>Turning to SKY Italia, segment operating income for the quarter of $89 million, declined $56 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects the challenging economic environment in Italy, as directly impacting growth subscriber additions and churn. SKY reported 4.9 million subs at quarter-end, a net loss of 42,000 subscribers in the quarter, resulting in reduced subscriber &#x2013; subscription revenue compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>The quarter results also reflect increased expenses related to subscriber retention efforts, as well as a more than 10% negative impact on operating profits from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Given the relatively low pay-TV penetration in Italy, and SKY's strong competitive positioning, we continue to have complete confidence in the long-term growth prospects for this business. However, in the short-term, weak consumer confidence and consumption behavior is likely to sustain the current difficult trading conditions in Italy.</p>
          <p>And at our Publishing segment, operating income of $139 million declined $131 million compared to a year ago. This decrease largely reflects lower advertising revenues at the Australian and the UK newspapers, lower in-store revenues at News America marketing, as well as the impact from the closure of News of the World. The quarter results also include a charge for litigations &#x2013; for a litigation settlement related to the eBooks price on HarperCollins and these declines &#x2013; the declines in these groups were partially offset by higher earnings contributions at Dow Jones.</p>
          <p>Before I turn to our guidance for fiscal 2013, I'd also like to update you on our buyback program. And through August 7, the company spent $5.1 billion, repurchasing nearly 280 million shares, reducing News Corporation's total outstanding by more than 10% compared to 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, three months ago, we increased our original $5 billion buyback authorization by another $5 billion, with a target of completing the total authorized buyback by the end of fiscal 2013. Even with the June announcement that we intend to pursue a separation of the Publishing and Entertainment businesses, we are fully committed to completing the $10 billion buyback program.</p>
          <p>Although, the repurchase pacing will initially moderate to a $3 billion to $4 billion annual rate as we work through the details of the separation process. As always, our objective is to buy back our shares in a disciplined manner without artificially pushing on share price up.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013. As we mentioned in our guidance, we're starting with the fiscal 2012 total segment operating income of $5.4 billion we just reported and excludes from this the $224 million of charges related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom, resulting in a base for 2012 of $5.6 billion for comparative purposes.</p>
          <p>And as we look at fiscal 2013, we expect our Channels businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth, resulting from continued double-digit growth at our Cable Networks, led by further expansion of our International Channels as well as sustained advertising and affiliate increases led by Fox News, the RSNs and FX.</p>
          <p>Higher Television segment earnings, which will benefit from the continued growth in retransmission consent revenue and a strong political advertising market heading into the November election. The growth of our Channels businesses will be partially offset by reduced contributions from SKY Italia, largely due to current economic climate in Italy.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our operating plan for fiscal 2013 assumes development spending in our education group, Amplify, of nearly $180 million, which is $100 million more than we recorded in fiscal 2012. We're also assuming that the contributions from our Publishing segment will stabilize and be no worse than our results reported in fiscal 2012. And also across the whole company, foreign currency rates will negatively impact our growth by about 1%.</p>
          <p>And lastly, we are continuing to exclude the costs of the UK investigations from our forecast due to their unpredictability. Taking all these items into account and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we anticipate our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 to be in the high-single to low double-digit range above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base level.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. I'll use the next few minutes to provide a bit more color on the values that Dave just gave. In a number of ways, I believe our headline in guidance for 2013 does not fully reflect the underlying strength and momentum of our core business.</p>
          <p>The driving force of our growth will continue to be our cable channels and broadcast business. Networks like Fox, Fox News and FX continue to build on their position as unique market leaders. We also continue to meet or exceed our targets for retransmission and subscription fees, reflect the success of those networks.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we're ahead of the targeted growth previously discussed and are always looking to add new dimensions to this business. One of the areas where we are investing for the future is in sports in India. The core STAR business will grow strongly in 2013; however, we will also be investing and building a dynamic Indian sports business. Although strategic investment will more than absorb STAR's growth this coming year, it will take the business to a whole new level of profitability in the next three to four years. These are exactly the kind of growth investment opportunities we're targeting.</p>
          <p>I also believe that one of the things that really sets us apart is our strength in content. On the Films side, the international success of Ice Age 4 has gotten us off to a great start and our TV studio is once again an industry leader.</p>
          <p>Demand for our product is stronger than ever as more companies strive to compete in the dynamic digital world. Nonetheless, we believe the prudent approach for setting expectations in the content business is to be cautious when projecting Film contributions, so our guidance reflects essentially flat year-on-year results on a very large base of profits.</p>
          <p>At our Satellite platforms, we believe our businesses and investments in the UK, Italy, Germany and India have never been stronger competitively. In each case, these strengths reflect the combination of leadership in content, technology and operations. The one business that is facing real economic headwinds and will adversely impact 2013 results is Italy. We're focused on taking steps to position SKY Italia for tough economic times, which will enable the business to resume its growth as we move towards 2014. In all honesty, SKY Italia has never been in a stronger competitive position and we could not be more excited about the future of this business, particularly as the Italian economy begins to recover.</p>
          <p>Another business of ours that we believe has long-term potential is education. However, it will impact our overall growth in 2013, as Dave said, as we're investing an incremental $100 million this year. Our aim here is to build a unique education business, positioned to take advantage of today's digital technologies. These investments are recorded as a loss on our P&amp;L. However, as in the case of other businesses we've successfully built over the years, we believe these are investments that will pay off in multiples.</p>
          <p>Recent agreements like the one with AT&amp;T speak to the unique excitement about this initiative and we have more to come. We know many of you would like to know more about our plans here and Joel Klein is planning to provide that vision for you this fall.</p>
          <p>Finally, our Publishing businesses are clearly in a restructuring mode. Overall, this segment is expected to be essentially flat in 2013. We do expect to start to see some of the benefits of our initiatives in the UK. However, Australia and News America marketing will still be in the midst of restructuring and challenging pressures that will adversely impact profits.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead into fiscal 2013, we also expect to continue addressing our off balance sheet investments. In some cases, like NDS, we've moved to monetize investments. In other cases, like our recently announced steps around <mark type="ph" /> DSF (15:40) and CMH in Australia, we're moving to take greater operating control of businesses.</p>
          <p>This is obviously an ongoing process. And we're not going to lay out timetables for future moves, but we will be optimistic. Equally as important, we want to be flexible and opportunistic. We also recognize the importance of an efficient capital structure to maximize shareholder value.</p>
          <p>We've pursued a balanced approach of buybacks and investments to achieve this goal, and that continues to be our plan. Our under-value stock continues to support our buyback plans. At the same time, we believe there may be strategic investment opportunities to exceed our target returns and strengthen our businesses for growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, we really like where we stand and are particularly excited as we move forward with our planned separation that is really all about bringing focus and alignment to our businesses. There isn't a lot news to add on the separation since we announced it a little over a month ago. But everything is on course, and we're targeting to make our initial regulatory filings around calendar year end with operating details to follow.</p>
          <p>In closing, while these macroeconomic times may test our nerves, we are incredibly well positioned for another year of growth inclusive of the investments we're making. Ultimately, we feel confident that our strategies will bring strong shareholder returns for years to come. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>And now Chase, James and Dave would be happy to take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we go to Michael Nathanson with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two quick ones I promise on domestic units. If we look at your affiliate fee growth this year entered 12%; but it was lumpy, the first half 9%, the second half 15%. But can you give us a sense of next year domestic affiliate fee growth? What's the right range within that ballpark of affiliate fee growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think, it's pretty much what we said in the past, which I think, as we said, we've been achieving those double-digit affiliate fee growth. And I think that &#x2013; as we look out that's the growth we expect. There'll always be a little lumpiness, just because of when large deals come up, and on particular channels they can give a quarter to quarter lumpiness. But as we look out over the next few years, I think we expect to continue the same sort of growth rate we've been generating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, the other question would be, you also had lumpiness on the cost side throughout the quarter domestically. What's the right range of cost growth organically, because I know there's a lot of moving pieces on the domestic side. But what's the right range of cost growth in the domestic networks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, that's a much tougher one to make a general statement, because you've really got such a mix of businesses that are different &#x2013; you know, different prices. I mean, I think, we do think it's important to make target investments to strengthen channels. I think there are channels, where we think we still have room to improve margins, there are probably others that'll sustain margins and there're probably channels that &#x2013; we think &#x2013; where we should be &#x2013; we can grow both the top and the bottom line that haven't yet achieved their potential.</p>
          <p>So, I think, if you look across business: Fox News, which obviously has a much more controlled cost base. Sports business has rights to come up. Their business is like &#x2013; transactions like &#x2013; agreements like the ones with the UFC, where we're investing to build the channel like FUEL. So, I think we feel comfortable with those margins, but again, it's going to be a mixed set of stories as you look across the base of channels. When you have as many channels as we do across the expanse of sports, entertainment, news and non-fiction &#x2013; there are different strategies for each.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I guess two questions on the guidance. One on the Publishing business, you mentioned flat results. Can you talk on the expense side, what you're doing there? It sounds like expenses will be down, at least in the UK. And then on the clean-up around your investments, Chase, can you comment a little more on the Sky Deutschland? I think the business is sort of at an inflection point, you've got the Bundesliga rights now, I think they start being exclusive in the fall, and the business is starting to probably ramp in profitability. Does that make that something that you want to own more of or any comment in terms of the opportunity in Germany? How are you feeling about operations, maybe compare it to Italy to help us think about the long-term plan there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I guess first on the cost side in the publishing. We certainly are focused on the costs and I think particularly in some of the businesses that will be a major focus for the coming year.</p>
          <p>I think your place is somewhere &#x2013; we're a little further along the curve <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:08) in a place like the UK. Australia, we've run a new management just in the first half of this year, so that's probably one that is really going to be moving into a very significant restructuring during this year. So, I think it's a part of all of those businesses, but they're a little bit at different places. Obviously, the UK also has initiatives; they're not just cost-based like the Sunday Sun that bring a dimension back. But certainly costs are our major &#x2013; are our major focus across those businesses.</p>
          <p>On Sky Deutschland, we're thrilled with business &#x2013; there's nothing really to announce, as we said before. We're comfortable where we're at today. I agree the business continues to make great strides forward. I think the management team there has done a fabulous job.</p>
          <p>You continue to see it in the growth of subscribers and the improvement in the financials. And I think if you &#x2013; and in Germany you can really feel it, it's a channel that really is upgraded and we're real excited about it.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:14) real excited about it. They've launched the sports news, there, added an exciting dimension to it. I think the breadths of rights we took &#x2013; we just acquired on the Bundesliga will give us opportunities to widen it again, some of the technological enhancements they're adding to it are really getting traction. So, the business is doing really well. Again, our focus today is on continuing to improve that business and driving everything we can be. And we'll decide as we go from what the right path for us in an ownership context.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We'll go to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Also two questions. Chase, I was hoping you could just elaborate a little more on your global sports strategy? I mean, it really seems like you're focusing in on some really big markets. Besides the rights fees and I think you bought something in Holland today, are you &#x2013; what is the level of investment? Are you trying to develop <mark type="ph" /> plancograms (23:21) ESPN? And are you managing it &#x2013; can they be global channels? And the second question is, can you just give some color on fiscal Q1 advertising outlook by business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:38) &#x2013; yeah, it's not a global strategy. I mean I think it has to start within each business making investments that make sense. There may be as we go forward opportunities to connect it and look at it more broadly, not to do with the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:53) that deal without the delta businesses that we think make sense. And we think where we can drive real value. Yeah, we like sports. I mean those sports, yes, there's a profit attached to it. But I think in a world that is increasingly fragmented in digital, it has been proven time and time again that if there's one area of content that just continues to differentiate itself, it's sports. And I think sports has particularly unique values where you got a large, broad business.</p>
          <p>So, you look at in India, where we got multiple channels and the like and the ability more &#x2013; even in the U.S. where having those big flagships sports franchises create value within the sports. But in many ways it becomes a part of the larger growth strategy for those businesses. But I think it really starts, you have to &#x2013; I mean those bets have taken up, when we make a bet whether it's in Germany, Italy, India or the U.S. or Latin America. We've made all those bets. We've made them based on what we've been &#x2013; returns make sure we believe we can generate the returns we need within those markets. That there are opportunities to then take the breadth of those investments and add dimensions. I think that's something, we always look to do like the fundamentals, are really make sure we can add value there, and clearly when you're adding sports in a place where you've got practically what we did with Sky Deutschland or SKY Italia or the breadth of the businesses, the STAR or the <mark type="ph" /> already (25:23) channels we've got in the U.S. sports plays uniquely important role in driving the business as a whole.</p>
          <p>In terms of fiscal &#x2013; in terms of advertising for the first quarter, yes, it's actually &#x2013; it feels reasonably good. I mean, it may be couple of weeks <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:42) obviously pretty dormant for most of it not the Olympics, but I said &#x2013; including the immediate term. It's &#x2013; the market's pretty good. There are anxieties. The anxieties whether it's Europe or the election here and what are the consequences to those and they continue to certainly keep horizon short and people have been on edge. But you look at the scatter market, the network is still up. It's a low double-digit scatter market. Cable is always a big effect. Cable market's probably stronger than that. And so, it actually is the market &#x2013; it's a reasonably good market. It's not great. It's not off the charts. But a reasonably solid market in a period when clearly there are a level of anxieties about the economy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think in the station business, we've assumed essentially a pretty flat marketplace except &#x2013; where you said the underlying marketplace. I think our marketplace is like low single digits. The market was like 1% &#x2013; 1% or 2%. 1% John's saying. So, I think, we assumed a flat, close to flat marketplace. We do think we can take &#x2013; we've been successful in taking share and that is our goal for the year. But, yes, I think, we've assumed a pretty flat advertising market overall.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, the network is &#x2013; we've come through the upfront. So, you're into &#x2013; the network gets a sense of being a little bit more based on the upfront. So, I mean, I think we achieved what we set out to in the upfront, probably sold about 80% of our inventory and I think we're down a touch on volume, up on pricing. And &#x2013; then, I think certainly achieved what we set out to achieve and the scatter market has been pretty good so far.</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, it's something, the biggest. Yeah, probably start with the business, as I said, that we forecast flat, which is the Filmed business and now it's always stopped at the forecast. We've gotten off to a really good start with Ice Age and with the Ice Age film, but there's that business and even with the TV side, we think the digital world can produce a lot of energy, we're not going to go out and get too far out there. I mean you're getting more international activity than you've had so you've got a lot of &#x2013; you got the energy that exists domestically, you've got more activity internationally.</p>
          <p>We've got to first make sure we continue to be disciplined about how we approach it and I think we've already said, we're not just going to grab a quick buck. But I think see if there are opportunities there and I would not say we project it at a certain &#x2013; any big buyer coming at it a new way, so we've approached it sort of much more based on the world as we know it and in a world that I think is, if I can just say, where do I think that digital world goes, you'll look out in the next couple years and certainly feel like you've going to have more buyers across the world that are looking to try to access unique content.</p>
          <p>And I think, we feel great about our content brands and I think that will give us opportunities to intelligently explore it, while certainly protecting and building our core businesses to channels. But intelligently taking advantage of digital. So, I'd probably say that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:22) will be the execution on content film that we don't put in there and with the digital world providing opportunities that we haven't tried to project.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple of questions also related to Cable Net. First on sports, I think sports is such a vibrant part of what News Corp. is all about and I think some investors who don't like News Corp. really fear that the RSN business is not in a strong position, just given the cost of those networks in current multi-channel world, relative to other networks, as well as just the risk of team-owned networks, when you see what's happening, like in L.A. You seem to have a lot of confidence in the trajectory of the RSN business, kind of help us all understand kind of why you are so confident in that business?</p>
          <p>And then just kind of a related question to the topic of Cable Net, we're seeing new distributors like Google Fiber with the facilities build out and we're seeing some potentially new, over-the-top MVPDs come online over the course of the next few months, can you just update us on what your thought process is? I know you're working with Google Fiber, maybe just an explanation of why? That would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean on the RSNs, I mean I guess &#x2013; yeah, I think the confidence is probably, starts with the simple fact that most of our agreements have pretty good terms to them right now. Meaning most of them, the Dodgers that we're dealing with, yeah, I think most of them are in at least five to six year terms, and some of them are &#x2013; and many of them are decades, so the issues &#x2013; we're dealing with the Dodgers don't &#x2013; aren't really ones that broadly exist.</p>
          <p>And I think beyond that, I think we believe we can navigate those issues. And I think we've been pretty good and I've used Texas as an example, where we did and feel good about the business we came out of Dallas with.</p>
          <p>So, sports is always going to have a &#x2013; all our business is going to get more competitive with more players and that's part of our challenge and job to make sure we've got the strengths and management that can continue to tackle those challenges and build those businesses. And I think we've proven an ability to do it, so, I guess, I think it's a combination of the strengths we've got, the <mark type="ph" /> prep (32:34) factor, we've proven to be able to execute in the face of those challenges and the strengths of the agreements we've got in place for those businesses.</p>
          <p>In terms of Google &#x2013; the Google Fiber, I mean if you really mean &#x2013; you mean the Kansas City thing they're doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they're &#x2013; essentially they're building the ultimate cable system. We &#x2013; I mean we &#x2013; just as we sell to satellite, we don't sell geographic exclusivity, so somebody comes in and wants to overbuild for this next generation cable system, so we can reach the right terms, then we'll do business.</p>
          <p>Now we want to make sure it's with people that respect issues that are important to us around piracy and everything else. So &#x2013; but if they are players that again respect what we think is important about the business then we can reach appropriate business terms. Just as we license our products at satellite when they came on the scene, this is really up to the next generation cable operator building out a cable system.</p>
          <p>I think the whole digital MVPD thing is much murkier and much less clear of who's doing what and what's happening. There's a lot of stuff going on in digital, but I think that &#x2013; that's much more difficult, but I don't think it's really evolved far enough to really have a clear picture of who's trying to do what. There are a lot of people talking, but I think that Google Fiber is much clearer. Again, I think they just &#x2013; whether the economics of that work for them long-term, I guess we'll see, but they just built a next generation cable system and broadband network and the mission for for them determining can you generate enough incremental digital revenues to pay for the incremental &#x2013; for the cost they've invested in the ground.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that why you put an investment in Roku this quarter to just kind of have a seat at that over-the-top table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think it's there &#x2013; it's not that specific. I think it's &#x2013; I think what we know, this digital reign is going to be important to our future. I think you don't want to be spending ahead of the curve, because a lot of business models have yet to evolve, but we think it's important for us to be active in this place and try and get insights to it. Hulu always gives us one important path to try and develop digital businesses. We played a little bit with the YouTube channels and it's a bit small player but it gives us again an ability for a very modest investment to try and develop a different dimension to digital experience, Roku give us again, a little different window into the digital experience. Roku also has some values to our satellite platforms overseas that probably would be different to what we'd be pursuing strategically here that could be enhanced into them as they try and figure out, which is clearly part of their strategy. And you see it today as we roll out products, whether it's Sky Go or SKY On Demand or the like and a better understanding of how do you develop that sort of TV Everywhere concept as a satellite player. So, I think, it's more insight into the digital world in a way that we think is a smart, manageable investment.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you. One for Dave and one for Chase. Dave, just wondering if you have the numbers on organic affiliate and advertising revenue growth of the international Cable Networks if you were to exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the impact of Fox Pan American Sports consolidation. Just looking for a sense for the recurring growth rates of those and then what they look like and what might be implied in your fiscal 2013 guidance for those?</p>
          <p>And then, I'll just give my follow up here which is, Chase, the LA Times reported that you're able to negotiated Fox News with Time Warner at a very favorable step-up initially. Just wondering, if you can comment for us about that agreement. How that kind of played out? What your thoughts are? It was reported you weren't able to renegotiate the other networks early along with Fox News. Just wanted to get some context from you on that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the affiliates to Fox 14% organic and the advertising would be about 13%, if you pull off the three items you mentioned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we said before, I think we feel pretty good about double-digit growth, both on the international businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Cool. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to comment a lot about specific agreements &#x2013; that will be just in our practice and &#x2013; we achieved our &#x2013; I mean, I think we feel good about the agreement. That's not trying to put a stick in anybody's eye. I think our goal on these is to get fair value. We're not trying to pick fights. We think Fox News has been undervalued for the importance of it in the marketplace. I think we talked about the fact by the end of the calendar year we'll have renewed a sort of second renewal on at least half the Fox News universe we've expected. And we've expected to receive significant increases to reflect the value of that.</p>
          <p>Fox Business Network continues to make strides. Well, actually Fox Business Network will be profitable this year. So, it is a stronger channel as it goes forward. We always look to try and look at all our franchises, find the right balance. I will say we achieved what we set out to do and have probably exceeded targets we had, which is pretty much I'd say really the affiliation agreements we've had certainly over the last couple of years. And I think we've tried to be pretty disciplined, pretty clear. Yes, in some places, we have asked for significant increases. But I think what we do reflects the value, whether it's retransmission or Fox News or other franchises. We have continued to achieve or exceed our targets. But I'm not going to get into comments on specifics. We get &#x2013; we have a good relationship with Time Warner Cable and that would be our goal is to continue to have a constructive relationship with them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could you just talk about any change in strategy you may employ in the near term at SKY Italia to get through the downturn? Will you continue the retention program? Has churn picked up? Is it maybe mid to high teens at this point? And has the competitive environment changed at all? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's James here. Thanks, John. I think on SKY Italia, look, I think, it's very clear to everyone particularly with SKY Italia and us that the macroeconomic environment in Italy is providing some real challenges. But really the focus from a strategic point of view is to really handle the cost base as best we can, really attack the cost base to right size the business in an economic environment that is very different than it was a number of years ago. Financially, across the board in terms of operating costs and rights costs and things like that. Subscriber management is clearly a very, very big focus and churn has picked up a bit. But I think that this year we'll see that business sort of stabilize and be able to grow from a different base and we have very high hopes for that business going forward.</p>
          <p>On the competitive landscape side, I would just say that I think we all think that SKY Italia has probably never been better positioned competitively. It's performing very well in a challenging environment there. And I think when you hold it up to their competitors in where Mediaset is, where Telecom Italia is, where the cable industry, which doesn't really exist there is, we feel very good about positioning. And right now, it's just a question of really right sizing the cost base to deal with a subscriber growth environment that really isn't going to be there for a little while and to move from there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chase, on the digital side, it seems like News Corp.'s been a little bit less vocal about TV Everywhere authentication. Can you give us your thoughts on that? And which of your programming or networks you're starting to either get paid for or negotiate for with TV Everywhere and authentication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really &#x2013; we haven't been much <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:39). We think it's the right path. I mean, we think it's the right solution. And there's no question I think it's what the consumer wants is that flexibility to get that content where they want and when they want. Obviously, those become part of larger negotiations in many cases, but we think it's the right path for us and our distributors. We think it enables us to continue to grow this business in many ways. So every time somebody asks me about the cost of the content to a consumer, I say, I think one of the most important ways to address that is to continue to give consumers new things that excite them, that make it more valuable and make them appreciate it more.</p>
          <p>And I use my experience at DIRECTV, where I said I think realistically I don't think in most cases costs &#x2013; I mean not that they don't care, but they really care about a quality experience with getting what they hoped and things that excite them. And if you really deliver on their expectations, I think the business has real I think we have an ability to continue to add dimensions to it. So, we think it's the right path. We have to negotiate the appropriate agreements around it. And in some ways we expressed our frustration that it hasn't moved faster and in some ways probably recognize the importance of doing some things like standardize and simplifying the experience.</p>
          <p>And if there's a question, it's too complicated an experience for consumers, it's too cumbersome an experience for consumers and I think we all look for the simplicity of an iPad and realize how important it is to create an experience that three and four-year olds can figure out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're getting paid. I mean, we've got digital content and we're getting value for advertising today we started a year ago when we went into the upfront of being able to package part of our digital advertising with our traditional television advertising. So, we are measuring it today. Now some of that's sort of just digital sites, but it's going to be part of the whole digital experience. I don't view that as purely an authentication issue.</p>
          <p>I think I view that as digital and some of that digital viewership will come through authenticated viewing, some of that will come through the experiences of the Hulu+ and Hulu and other players, but we are certainly well into trying to develop. We don't have the targeting. I mean, clearly targeting of advertising broadly is an opportunity that's yet untapped and I think one of the real opportunities for the business. I know the cable guys are investing in it and I think that's important for all of us to figure out how do we take that type of targeted advertising to another level, but we've been in it and developing it for the last year and it's an important area focus of growth for us.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions. The first one is to help us kind of evaluate the scale and size of the international cable business, could you give us a sense on a pro forma basis for the fiscal year that just ended, including Fox Pan American Sports and STAR and all those things? What is the split in revenue and OI between international and domestic? And then if you can, give us a sense for what you think that would be underlying your 2013 guidance?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is without addressing any specific partners, can you give us a sense of when you think about the guidance next year, does it anticipate any new additional players of scale coming into the digital distribution business that you're counting on revenues from or is it sort of anticipate the same basic playing field? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Well, on the latter question, I think it's &#x2013; I can't remember who asked earlier about we're at the upside. I think we touched on it there. We think there will be more activity, but we haven't really, you know, our guidance does not factor in a big, new player or something big happening. I think we've looked at it more as largely a continuation of the international side, again, that there's some activity growing into it. But I think we've guided it much more towards what we see today as opposed to try and handicap what the new players do to it. I think that it's an upside. It feels much more than a downside. That is mostly upside opportunity for us, but we haven't factored in the numbers. I think in terms of...</p>

We're ahead of that curve today and then STAR would be on top of that and STAR is certainly a significant additional component of the Channels business internationally.</p>

          <p>Just have a quick question for Mr. DeVoe. I just want to confirm that the guidance that you laid out assumes that the offer for CMJ does not go through or in other words, it's not in the guidance. And if that offer does go through, say mid-year, does it help your OI about 1%, or a 1.5%? Is that directionally about the right number, if you could give us a calendar year, close, mid-year fiscal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not included in our guidance and depending on when I close this, it would help our OI. Part of that at the moment we picked it up as equity on the sports business. So you're not too far off actually with this 1%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two quick ones. The first one, it sounds like the flat guidance for Publishing will be driven primarily by cost cuts rather than any stabilization in revenue, so is this the right way to think about this?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on education, when would this become a contributor to profits? Is this a 12 to 18 month thing or a three-year initiative? And will costs ramp up over time, so we're looking beyond fiscal 2013, that $180 million may grow another $100 million each year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll touch on the Education, let Dave touch on the publishing. I think probably really, as I said, the right way to give you some visibility because we have in it &#x2013; it's a comprehensive plan that is to have Joel Klein do it, which we're going to plan for this fall and then give you some visibility. It will say on target that the spending that we do look at probably 2013 as essentially being a peak year, but &#x2013; and from there restructuring development revenue side of it. And really investing in building phase. We still have to get investment in 2014, but 2013 is probably the peak and I think I have rules about the revenue, but I think Joel's better off to give a better sense of that and a better sense of what the products and plans are and I'll let Dave...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the end of on the objects really it's a combination of both. It's a combination of cost-cuts, but it's also a combination of increases in revenue. We certainly expect our business in the UK to do significantly better in fiscal 2013 than it did in 2012.</p>
