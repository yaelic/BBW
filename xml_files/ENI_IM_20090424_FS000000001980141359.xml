      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first quarter results presentation. Here with me is Claudio Descalzi, and together we will be pleased to answer to your question at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2009 the Brent price continued to weaken averaging a $44 per barrel and declining by approximately 54% compared to the first quarter of 2008. The benchmark European refining margin averaged $5.3 per barrel increasing by 40% compared to one year ago.</p>
          <p>The margins realized by our own refineries did increase, but less than the benchmark as a result of the narrowing light heavy oil differential and CIF/FOB price. The Europe showed a depreciation of 13% versus the U.S. dollar compared to the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>As usual, I would like to remind you that ENI's result are affected by several issues including the seasonal effect or affecting the demand for natural gas and petroleum products used for residential heating. The demand for which is highest in the first quarter of the year, the coldest months and the lowest in the third quarter, the warmest months.</p>
          <p>Therefore ENI's operating profit and changing their debt in the first quarter cannot be extrapolated for the full year. In the first quarter of 2009, the adjusted operating profit was about &#x20AC;3.8 billion, down 36%. This was due to the weaker operating performance of our upstream and Gas &amp; Power businesses segment due to falling oil prices and lower natural gas demand.</p>
          <p>The adjusted net profit also reported a 42% decrease for the performance at the operating level, and for the lower contribution from APT accounted investments. It was also impacted by the higher tax rate in Italy, and in some exploration and production subsidiaries outside Italy.</p>
          <p>Starting from this quarter in accordance with the IFRS, we will include the overall impact of derivatives on commodities, which don't meet the requirements of effectiveness required by the accounting standard in the reporting &#x2013; reported operating profit line, instead of in the net financial charges line.</p>
          <p>The adjusted operating profit will include only the realized component while the mark-to-market component will be treated as a special item. The aim of this reporting change is to better reflect the operating profitability of the businesses, which hedge a portion of their commercial transactions in order to achieve margin targets and is in line with the best practices in the oil sector.</p>
          <p>In the exploration and production division, hydrocarbon production in the first quarter decreased by around 1% compared to the same period of 2008. This performance is the result of the OPEC cut 31,000 barrel a day, the weaker gas demand and the force majeure events, which occurred mainly in Nigeria, Congo and Gulf of Mexico overall 34,000 barrel per day. These negative factors were partially offset by the impact of the production sharing agreements and the contribution of 2008 start-ups.</p>
          <p>Exploration and production adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;2.2 billion down 49% compared to the first quarter of 2008. This decrease was mainly due to lower oil realization prices in dollars, lower production sold and higher DBNA. These negative factors were partially offset by the depreciation of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, higher gas prices and lower depressed &#x2013; exploration charges.</p>
          <p>Starting from this quarter as a result of the regulated business restructuring expected in the second half of 2009 the storage business result will be reported in the regulated segment of the Gas &amp; Power division, instead of in the Exploration &amp; Power division. The 2008 figures have been restated accordingly.</p>
          <p>As for the Gas &amp; Power division, overall gas volumes sold including both consolidated and associated companies increased by more than 6% totaling around 31 billion cubic meters. In particular, international gas sales increased by more than 46% reflecting the Distrigaz acquisition and the higher volumes sold in the target markets, despite a declining gas demand.</p>
          <p>In Italy including oil consumption gas sales decreased by 22% as a consequence of the economic slowdown, which caused a significant decrease in gas sales to industrial, a decrease of 20% and power customers less 44%. The Gas &amp; Power adjusted operating profit amounted to approximately &#x20AC;1.4 billion down 18% over the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>This reduction was primarily due to the lower volume sold in Italy and the weaker contribution from power activity. This negative element was partially offset by the favorable trend in energy parameters to which gas purchase cost and selling price are indexed and the acquisition of Distrigaz.</p>
          <p>Furthermore regulated business accounted for a lower adjusted operating profit as a result of the revision of the tariff mechanism that has moved the seasonality of the distribution business as well as the lower volume transported as a consequence of the lower gas demand. These negative elements were partially offset by the incentives provided on the new investment in the transportation network.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power pro forma adjusted EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. This compares to &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2008. The marketing segment result was effectively flat. The lower volume sold in Italy were offset by the favorable trend in energy parameters. The acquisition of Distrigaz and the adjustment for the impact of derivatives and commodities and the exchange rates related to the sales in other accounting periods.</p>
          <p>The regulated business EBITDA declined for the reasons commented on the EBIT adjusted. Finally international transportation showed a 10% increase versus the first quarter of 2008 thanks to the increased transport capacity. Refining &amp; Marketing adjusted operating results for the first quarter accounted for &#x20AC;55 million compared to &#x20AC;12 million in the same period of 2008.</p>
          <p>These result reflect the lower utilities cost and depreciation of the euro versus dollar. These positive elements were partially offset by the lower throughput, due to planned and unplanned maintenance activities. The marketing activities showed a stable operating result.</p>
          <p>As far the other business are concerted, the Petrochemical posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;111 million due to the economic downturn driving 25% decline in sales and weaker based chemical margins.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering &amp; Construction sector, the first quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;272 million versus &#x20AC;214 million in 2008 and the increase is attributable to higher results in all business segments.</p>
          <p>The overall results from other activities and corporate was substantially flat year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the operating cash flow. These amounted to &#x20AC;5.4 billion in the first quarter, divestments accounted for &#x20AC;0.2 billion. CapEx amounted to &#x20AC;3.1 billion inline with the first quarter of 2008. Net financial debt at the end of March declined to &#x20AC;16.5 billion. Since then, we have paid &#x20AC;2 billion to Distrigas minorities' shareholders. And we can confirm to have received &#x20AC;3.1 billion from Gazprom from &#x2013; for the 20% stake in Gazprom Neft at the end of April; our gearing is therefore below 0.32.</p>
          <p>At the year end, gearing is expected to slightly increase versus the 2008 year end level.</p>
          <p>So thank you for your attention and now together with Claudio, I'm pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And the first question comes from the line of Dave Thomas from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I've got a couple of questions please. Firstly, regarding E&amp;P, in your outlook statement, you're projecting a, what you call slight reduction in your production growth expectations for 2009. Can you say what slight is, and also can say what additional impact we should assume from OPEC reductions assuming current production quotas remain in place for this year? And secondly, can you confirm what assumptions you're making regarding CapEx for this year and dividend payout, it's saying that gearing will be within levels required to retain your current credit rating? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Talking about E&amp;P production, when we talk, we project our production to the year and we talk about a slight reduction, we talk about 0.9% without considering in the OPEC &#x2013; OPEC quarter reduction and also some frost measure an issue that already occurred especially in Nigeria and West Africa and Gulf of Mexico. So that is the reduction that we expect to have at the year end at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just clarify that's it's 0.9% before the OPEC cuts and any force majeures, but OPEC cuts is something around 30 to 40,000 barrels a day, you suffered in the first quarter appropriate still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yes, yes that the OPEC quarter cuts accounts for 30 about 31, 35,000 per barrel per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the leverage and the dividends of that you mentioned before, I have to confirm that we have so far not changed our strategy that we have announced on the 17 of February. It means that we are maintaining our target in terms of CapEx, which should be slightly lower than those realized in 2008 and we are still committed to maintain and to deliver the three basic pillars of our strategic of 2009, which are to maintain a strong credit rating to drive grow through our CapEx program and to continue to distribute a superior dividend yield.</p>
          <p>And as far as dividends, what I can tell you is that our dividend yield will be superior if we based the dividend yield calculation on the share prices on February 13, the day of our strategy presentation. And as far as the definition of superior, it means that our yield will be among the highest in our peer group. And for peer group &#x2013; in our peer group, we include Shell, Total, Conoco, Chevron, Exxon and BP. So far the basic assumption are not changed, and we confirm, and we are committed to deliver these highest &#x2013; one of the highest dividend yield in the sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate it. I just to really clarify I mean in terms of the gearing levels being slightly above the 38% at the end of 2008. Given the $43 per barrel Brent price, the CapEx you've already guided to of about &#x20AC;14.1 billion for 2009. And therefore assuming and say a flat dividend pay out, from what you paid out cash terms, is that what's driving the gearing to slightly rise? So in other words, what should be the cash cycle for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not saying that the dividends will be flat compared to last year. I'm &#x2013; I confirm that the -final decision about dividend will be taken by the Board of Directors. The &#x2013; as far as the account &#x2013; the advance portion will be decided in July and the final, the balance will be decided in February 2010. I mean I don't want to confirm that we are talking about flat dividend. I strongly confirm that we are committed to deliver a superior dividend and as far as the definition of superior I have already clarified before.</p>
          <p>We expect to face a slightly increasing in our leverage at year end because in the original assumption we didn't include the total residual acquisition of these triggers because in our original assumption, we expected to have &#x2013; to acquire only a portion of the stake, which was held by Publigaz. Whilst during the offering period, Publigaz has notified their total adherence to the public offer. And we have liquidated; we have paid the consideration on the 8 of April. So It means that the &#x2013; slight increase compared to the level we had at the end of last year, is primarily due to the acquisition &#x2013; the total acquisition of Distrigas.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Mr. Bernini.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Domenico Ghilotti from Equita. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and congratulations for the good quarter results. My question is still on the CapEx, you used a slightly different wording in your CapEx guidance, but so far we have confirmed your indication presented in February. I would like just to understand if you see some further optimization achievable on your CapEx and not already, let's say, included in your guidance so far, but you see some opportunities for some CapEx optimizations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about E&amp;P that accounts for about 2.2 billion. I think that we can say that we can reach additional CapEx optimization in respect of the CapEx we had in 2008. So about 5, 10% over 2009, that is reduction optimization that we expect in this year. For that reason also, we delay or postpone some project just able to catch these reductions that we forecast for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, E&amp;P represent the most important portion of our CapEx program, because the remaining significant portion of our CapEx program is represented by the CapEx of the engineering and construction segment, Saipem in other words. And they are committed to deliver the vessels at the certain due dates, so they cannot modify of course their commitments. And accordingly, we don't see any possibility to optimize this portion of CapEx. But of course, our most important efforts will be authorized to the exploration and production division, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's about the refining marketing, just to complete the review?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Refining marketing, we, of course, are seeing some &#x2013; we consider the refining and marketing segment that they're most weaker considering their present environment. We have analyzed critically some projects and we have identified some additional room for savings, but we are talking about various light amounts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Irene Himona from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had the two questions, please. Firstly on Gas &amp; Power, can you give us an idea of the expected decline in 2009 Italian gas amount, and is there some guidance concerning your Gas &amp; Power EBITs in 2009 versus '08 in light of the recession? And then, secondly on the Gazprom, you've just announced that you have received the cash for Gazprom Neft, but can you clarify what is happening with the rest of the assets, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me &#x2013; So as far as the Gas &amp; Power division, you may remember, of course, that a significant portion of the Gas &amp; Power results are represented by regulated and semi-regulated business, for which on an yearly basis we do not expect any major changes compared to the amounts historically delivered by this segment. And just to remember that effective from January '09, also the storage business will be part of the Gas &amp; Power margin segments.</p>
          <p>So having said that, of course, the results of the margin segment, the marketing segment inside Gas &amp; Power will be affected the by the lower gas volumes sold in particular in Italy, where we expect a significant reduction in terms of volumes, but more than compensated by the volumes sold by Distrigaz at international level. So all in all, the EBIT levels expected at the end of year of Gas &amp; Power will be more or less in line with those achieved in 2008. As far as the -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gas demand in Italy. Okay, so I'll talk a little bit about the ex-Yukos asset. First of all, I want to say that the upstream activity on these assets on this field is proceeding according to the schedule. And in the first quarter, we drilled and completed two wells, and we are working with Gazprom and Enel on this issue. And for the rest, because of the situation of the gas demand in Russia and also because of the financial markets, we are discussing with Enel and Gazprom to rephrase and schedule the call option. I think that the updates gave you &#x2013; provided by the party, Gazprom, Enel and ENI, have defined a final agreement. We are in discussion but from an industrial point of view, we are working on the project.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. There has been some speculation that you've drawn-up a list of non-core assets potentially for disposal, and in the event that you haven't sold your G-Neft call option. Can you just make some comments on potential disposals for 2009 and order of magnitude that could be? And then possibly a question on tax, I see that the 4% supplemental tax apply to Eni from the reparations treaty with Libya. Do you have any rate of appeal to that, or is that something that a certain stone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all talking about disclosure and there is an ignition of our asset in 2009 there is a normal walk and that we perform on our assets and is a matter of rationalize and capped small assets reduce our cost to fine synergies and that is a daily exercise. For sure we are forecast for 2009 maybe some small operations on new assets and aim especially to reduce our cost and find new synergy and position our asset in need our efficiency in fact is much better. So that is the issue. We are not talking about big ignition, big disposure or so not the impact on production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the tax issues are concerned, I would remember that the modification in the Italian tax low significantly affect the comparison between the first quarter '09 with the first quarter '08, because the amendments of which has increase the statutory tax rate from 27.5 to 33% has been introduced in the second quarter of last year. So effectively comparison between first quarter of this year and the last year reflects also this situation, which was then recorded in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Then as far the surcharge &#x2013; tax of surcharge as accounts sequence of the Libyan tax treaty. We confirm that we have started with the appealing process because in our rules <mark type="inaudible" /> flow and back with the result, the outcome is expected only in the last part of '09. For the time being in the first quarter the application of this surcharge affected the bottom line by an amount, which is not so significant because it is in the region of &#x20AC;70 million because we expect on yearly basis and amount in the region of &#x20AC;280 million. But we are confident to have good reason to contest with the application of this loan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hello, Alessandro. My first question is about the dividend again. I must &#x2013; I'm bit confused by your dividend policy, it seems to me it depends on the dividends paid out by other companies. The price of the shares of other company's and the price of shares of your own, and I would have thought the main driver would be your balance sheet position and the cash generation. So maybe you could just explain us again how you see the dividend evolving, bear in mind if you talk about the yield it includes another moving cost, which makes it difficult for us to access, and also bearing in mind your CEO is reported to make some public comments about the divided ahead of the cash from Neft option exercise. Maybe you could clarify that, and I also have another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I wanted to clarify that our dividend strategy never, never refer to Gazporm Neft. It was absolutely independent from the exercise or not the color on the Gazporm Neft by Gazprom, first. Then you are right the yield is basically a ratio, which on the &#x2013; in one side there is the market value of the share and on the other side the amount of the dividend. We have clarified because; of course we had a <mark type="inaudible" /> because originally there was some misunderstanding on the market.</p>
          <p>We have clarified that we want to deliver. We are committed because of course the final decision will be taken by the appropriate bodies, which are Board of Directors and shareholders. But our aim is to deliver to our shareholder a superior dividend, which means &#x2013; dividend yield, which means you can refer to the value &#x2013; market value of our share by the 13 of February when the promise was released to the market.</p>
          <p>And in order to obtain, let me say the relevant amount you can take also the market value of the shares of our peers, which means Shell, Total, Conoco, Chevron, Exxon, BP at the same day and considering that we want to deliver a superior and for a superior we classify it to be the first or the second one, you can easily obtain the final amount to which we are committed to recognize to our shareholder, but of course finally the decision pertain to our Board and shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And if they declare their dividend after you then you won't be certain whether you are going to be superior or not I guess?</p>

          <p>Well, it's still dependent on what the other companies declare for their dividends, so if they declare them after you, then you won't know whether you are superior or not is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, you are right in a certain way but since they also our peers they have declared clearly their policy about their dividends and since we want &#x2013; we are committed to be the first or the second one giving in a precise terms, which is the market value of our share at the 13 of February, you can &#x2013; it is not a dependant on the fluctuation of the shares of Eni and the other peers group companies in a certain period of time.</p>
          <p>You can refer to the market value of the shares on the 13 of February and accordingly comparing then with their declaration and at the end of the day since we want to be the first or the second one you can ascertain very easily what is the amount in terms of dividend that we are committed to recognize.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Alessandro. I have a one other question for Claudio. We are getting reports from the Middle East for example that cost on new projects, may have fallen even by as much as 50% on new contract tenders. Could you comment on the recent trends you've seen in the contracts that you are looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the recent trend in the first quarter was not so high from our point of view -- we recorded an average about 10, 15% no more than that. We have an expectation to reach 20 &#x2013; around 25% by the end of this year. That depend on the &#x2013; if you consider raw material services or contracts, for example for deep off shore and ultra-deep offshore within the recorded any kind of strong reduction.</p>
          <p>So we are still in the range of 4, 5%, no more than that, so for that kind of risks and for vessel, we recorded in &#x2013; a drop of about 60%, 50, 60%. So we think that we have to wait till end of the year to have strong reduction in our cost. So for that reason, we are organizing some our project portfolio to catch the maximum value and create the maximum value in our projects, but that's the range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning everyone. I have just two questions. First one on the E&amp;P segment. First of all to have an idea of the <mark type="inaudible" /> effect on Q1 production. Second question again on the E&amp;P is elaboration regarding your view, regarding the potential cost deflation within the coming month. And finally, I have a question on the gas side, in particular regarding your investments in the bottom making of the import pipelines, that target PSC -- is it possible to have a precise idea on when this additional capacity will be available and your view regarding the supply demand balance in the Italian gas market in the next quarter? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting from E&amp;P. First of all, the asset that we added in the first quarter is about 1,000 barrel; they on the PSC asset per dollar, so that is a continuous updating. It depend on different things on the stage of the projects, on the price. So that is an average on all the package. We run new model and that is what consolidate in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Talking about the reflection, of cost in the next period as an outlook as we said &#x2013; I said at the moment we reach an average about 10, 15 and we think that we can reach as an average 25% on the new package and the new <mark type="inaudible" /> and the new project by the end of the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, three questions please. Firstly, on this &#x2013; on your cash cycle this year given your comments early on, can we assume that in your scenario of $43 a barrel we will not be looking any acquisition this year or is it the case that if you see an attractive acquisition, which could well be possible in the current environment you would then revisit these commitments through a superior dividend yield.</p>
          <p>Secondly, listening to your comments on the dividend policy, can I just ask why would you not just have a payout policy and how did you actually arrived at the policy that you seem to have in the moment, which is somewhat ambiguous and confusing. And then finally, the Iraq oilfield I believe you're bidding on along with your competitors. If I understand it rightly, it's an EPC contract, which again if I'm right, and I might be wrong will give you no exposure to oil prices.</p>
          <p>Could you just take us through the thinking of balance &#x2013; the balance that you think of in trying to get into that region against accepting a contract, which presumably will have low returns and no exposure to oil prices. What you are think of longer-term there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the first part of your question before to talk about Iraq, our strategy &#x2013; our cash &#x2013; our estimate relating to 2009 in terms of cash flow, you're right that's being prepared, estimating that all over 2009, the cash flow generated by the operation were based on Brent of $43 per barrel, which is more or less the actual figures, confirm the appropriateness of our estimate.</p>
          <p>So far we confirm, since as part of our estimate, the cash flow generated by the full of Gazprom Neft was part of our estimate. What happened today doesn't modify at all what was already estimated at the beginning. So we are still committed strongly for in with an organic growth and we pay attention to, let me say, a smaller acquisition, but only to the extent they are &#x2013; they satisfy the requirements of synergies &#x2013; to be synergic with our presence in certain countries where we have historic and stronger presence. But we are only talking about very, very, very small &#x2013; very small transaction, which can be considered as part of our normal portfolio management, we cannot talk about acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of dividends, I believe that nobody of the various oil companies declares a dividend policy, a clear dividend policy, nor ENI did it in the past. So I believe that the elements that I given before in terms of what can be expected in terms of dividends is a quite precise and should eliminate all of the misunderstanding or the various, let me say, doubt which affected the dividend policy, the dividend expectations which ENI is committed to recognize to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Of course, this policy &#x2013; these are our sentence to pay a superior dividend yield is based, of course, on the view that all over 2009 the Brent will remain at least at $43 per barrel and the crisis, the economical crisis will maintain the effect which we have already estimated. Of course, if the crisis will reinforce negatively the effect and will continue all over 2009, worsening the present situation, of course, we will review accordingly our economical expectation. But so far, there are absolutely no changes compared to what we have already announced on the 13th of February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, so we can talk about Iraq. We &#x2013; as you know, we <mark type="inaudible" /> few days ago, and so I can't talk about this bid because it's under evaluation by the first party. But I'll just talk to you about concept. This bid is related to a early production phase. So it's just a preliminary development of the field and with a target of $150,000 barrels per day. And looking at the full field development, I think that we can consider an EPC contract for a full field development. That is just a first step, a preliminary step.</p>
          <p>We don't have just facing upstream normal challenges and risk, there is also country, security, first mover, because other countries started a upstream project over there. So for this first and preliminary phase we consider, we want absolutely to reduce and minimize our risk. But for a full development, our aim is to have a PAC contract or a service contract where a normal contract where we can book our service and keep our upside and develop and invest trying to optimize the field development and also the upside potential and the final value of the development.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks I've got a question for Claudio. You already mentioned in the press release that one of the elements contributing to your downward revision is production day's guidance was project rescheduling. Can you just confirm for us which projects that affects and where you think you've got the greatest leverage to improve cost and which projects are most in need of cost improvements? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Now I think that the main area is Africa. We rescheduled our some projects in the West Africa and one project &#x2013; one of the project is <mark type="inaudible" /> and not into oil production but of gas recycling and water injections that we pushed out in the last year. Because we went from 10,000 barrels a day was injected to now we are injected 50, 60,000 barrels a day with a target of 200, so we rescheduled little bit this growth and of what injection to get the best value.</p>
          <p>And other projects in Nigeria, also Nigeria and also offshore because we have scheduled some oil project that is still going to be in production this year, but we did different growth -- in term of investment. Other project, in Libya and project in Norway. Norway and Libya don't, in fact production in 2009 and '10. So we have just a small impact in West Africa. And that allow us to save 100 million of the oil investment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Two questions please, gentlemen. Claudio, the question you answered about production, the first question. Could you just confirm what you said there &#x2013; I thought I heard you say that you expected production to decline this year before the impacts of OPEC and force majeure, was that correct, because in the press release it says, you're going grow excluding those. So maybe I heard it wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Iain, I was not able to express clearly my views. No, there is not reduction before OPEC and force majeure. There is a &#x2013; we're going to increase our production following our schedule just small light reduction because of the optimization, but before uptick and force majeure there is no &#x2013; there is a growth production. Maybe I expressed not correctly, sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that we're in a growth rate of 2% &#x2013; 2.2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question was on the hedging, could you just remind us what the hedging policies doing on the Dominion assets in terms of protecting your oil and gas prices, in terms of how it works?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well that &#x2013; at this time, the time in 2007 we have defined and agreed with a group of banks, the revertible in order to secure the prices relating to a production of around 25 million barrels, part of which already &#x2013; they have been already produced and a portion amounting &#x2013; amounted to more or less to their half, it's still to be &#x2013; to be produced.</p>
          <p>So as clearly stated in our press release, through this contract we have secured the prices in the range of 64, $65 per barrel, because it is not a fixed prices as there is a cuff and collar. So more or less average on an average basis, we have secured the sale of this production for an amount of 64, $65 per barrel. Considering what are the present forward curves, this contract allowed ENI in the first quarter of 2009 to realize more than &#x20AC;100 million in terms of gain.</p>
          <p>Since in the first quarter a production of more or less 17 million barrels had been realized. So presently we are &#x2013; of course, we have suffered in the past, but presently these hedging contract is creating a lot of satisfaction for a small portion of our production and the mark-to-market evaluation of the receivable portion, which affects our equity research of ENI, presently is in a positive situation of some &#x20AC;100 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Can you just say what &#x2013; premusing you have some mark-to-market of the &#x2013; of the contract, what was the actual realized part of &#x2013; in the first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions on Gas &amp; Power please. First is I appreciate you have already given two year EBITDA for the division, but could you perhaps talk a little bit about the competitive position with regards to marketing margins in Italy this year with falling demand would improve capacity etcetera. Margins seemed to be fairly resilient in the first quarter you didn't mention the time lag on selling prices. But you also commented both on derivatives instruments, and has your &#x2013; hedging policy changed any in Italy? And I have a follow-up question as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course as far as the margins domestic margins are concerned, in our estimates it seems that beginning when we have prepared our original budget for 2009 and so it is already part of the original announcement to the financial community. We have estimated a pressure on our margins as a consequence of the generic economic downturn, and also because in the second half of the year we expect that due to the starting operation of additional facilities in Italy there will be additional gas available on the market, which will create additional pressure on our margins, but effectively this was already expected, forecasted, so pleasantly in preparing our forecast, our updated figures as these doesn't change too much, because it was originally estimated.</p>
          <p>As far as the hedging policy are concerned effectively in order to basically &#x2013; basically it is not to change the policy, it has changed the accounting, the accounting treatment because ENI, in order to secure the margins when the market is significantly volatile, we put in place a specific derivatives in order to froze the margin that we expected to realize from a specific transaction, and this affects, both gas and power and in particular refining market. These are the two business lines which are predominantly affected by commodity hedging contracts.</p>
          <p>Starting from first quarter '09, we have decided because also as a consequence of the pressure of our auditors, but also because more or less all our competitors do the same, the effect of those hedging contracts which only for accounting reason cannot be considered hedging contracts and from an accounting perspective they should be considered speculative, but of course we do not secured execute any speculative transaction.</p>
          <p>It is only because that the IFRS39 provide a lot of requirements in order to consider a specific hedging contract to be in hedging contract. And some times happen that we are not in a position to meet all the accounting requirements, but considering that all these hedging contract that we put in place are only to secure margins and only for industrial or commercial reason, we have agreed to reflect in the EBIT directly in the EBIT, the effect also of those hedging contract which don't meet the requirements of the accounting requirements in order to transfer at operating &#x2013; the operating margin, the entire effect generated by discounted, which previously were booked in the financial charges line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's fine. You said the policy hasn't changed, but has the activity level changed?  It seems that you have actually increased the volume of gas or whatever that has been forward sold to fix in our margin. Is that fair comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, I want to repeat we have not changed our strategy, our policy. The policy was &#x2013; is and will remain the same, because we refer to hedging contract only to secure margins on industrial and commercial transaction. Then, of course volumes that can change according to the market volatility, because of course if the market is significantly volatile and we want to secure the margins of a certain transaction, we can increase or decrease the volume of the hedging contract in accordance with the market volatility, but so far, we do not expect to modify significantly the volumes of the hedging contracts that we have already put in place in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say that what the benefits or otherwise was in the first quarter from these derivative volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the first quarter the effect was not at positive effect that because it was minus in overall, it was minus 190 million euros. So basically is not so significant, but these amount then we will be recovered in the following months, when the sales of the gas are purchased and on which we established and hedging contract will be realized. So it is only a timing effect this amount, which presently is negative in the first quarter will be recovered in the following quarters. So on a year basis, we do not expect to face any significant effect at EBIT level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So most of that 190 million is in the gas and power business in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right in the 170.Yes, you are right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
