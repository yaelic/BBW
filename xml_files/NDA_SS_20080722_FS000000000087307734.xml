          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Nordea Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Johan Ekwall, Head of Investor Relations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And warm welcome to the Nordea webcast and telephone conference in relation to our Q2 report. I hope you all have found our slides for this telephone conference on our website. It's a separate telephone conference package, which is different from the ones we show this week. It's slightly different compared to the one we had this morning.</p>
          <p>Together with me here in the room is our CEO, Christian Clausen; our CFO, Arne Liljedahl; and our Chief Risk Officer, Carl-Johan Granvik. And they will all have short presentations focusing more on the numbers and the credit portfolio. And then, after those brief presentations, we will enter into a Q&amp;A session. So, Christian, please.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and welcome to this meeting. I will make a fairly short presentation now, as Arne Liljedahl will cover most of the financials and Carl-Johan Granvik will cover most of credit and risk. I'd like to highlight, on page three, the eight main story lines for today that we have, indeed, seen very high business activity in Q2, and we show record results from customer areas, both in operating profit and revenues. And this is due to a continued strong delivery from our growth initiatives. Execution has continued according to plan in first half year, and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>We have seen volatile and weakened financial markets, which have given some negative revenue impact in our treasury operations. Credit quality remains solid, with only five basis points in net provisions. We have a strong capital position. We have a stable and well-diversified funding base. And our funding operations have been conducted at very attractive terms throughout the period. We maintain our ambitious, long-term targets to double the risk-adjusted profit in seven years. And the outlook for the full year 2008 is guided at a growth in the risk-adjusted profit to approximately 5% but with increased macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>
          <p>The business activity is really the most important part of the result. It shows that Nordea has a very strong revenue growth and a very strong earnings potential. The second quarter was the strongest ever, very much driven by revenues from net interest income. And volume growth is up, and lending is up considerably. Deposits are up 10%. And we have the savings accounts up as much as 23%.</p>
          <p>Also, on the customer-driven capital markets activities, we see record results very much driven by the need for corporate customers to have risk management advice. We see the number of gold customers up 6%, number of private banking customers up 12%, inflow in asset management in Q2, after seeing outflow for three quarters in a row. And we also have a strong contribution from new European markets.</p>
          <p>As I said, we see strong delivery from growth initiatives. Our growth initiatives are still alive. We have been working with them now for one and a half years, and it's really satisfying to see them all delivering. On the household side, we migrate customers to the gold segment. We have 2.4 million gold customers, so that is growing in this period, 6% year-on-year. So attracting new customers and moving them up towards premium, gold and private banking is the core of the household strategy. Especially in private banking, we have seen a very positive development with 12% new customers.</p>
          <p>Then we have focused on growth in Sweden, which is also getting results. We have a considerably higher revenue growth in Sweden than our peers now, and we are continuing that focus. This summer, we are actually planning to implement our deal with Svensk Kassaservice, where we are taking over 76 of their branches. Private banking is continuing, as I said. We have a huge potential in private banking internally, and that is going to be an important growth driver going forward.</p>
          <p>The corporate side has actually been a main driver for our growth, with 20% growth in lending and also a strong growth in the capital market area, where the risk management products are really needed. And we have a large base here to penetrate, and that requires that we educate more staff, which we're doing. But also here the potential, as I said, is big.</p>
          <p>On the global and European business lines, especially shipping is growing still at a very low risk level and very strong development in the earnings. New European markets are expanding according to our plans. We expanded distribution capacity in Poland. We've broadened the focus in Russia, and we have a selective growth now in the Baltic countries. These growth initiatives are supported by a number of efficiency programs, and these are, of course, increasing efficiency, but they are also freeing up time for more customer meetings. And more customer meetings is equal to more gold customers, private banking customers, and so on and thereby, to more revenues. It's extremely important programs for our growth.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the operating income, which is up 3%. It's driven by customer areas and customer income, and we have, as I said, some negative impact on treasury revenues from the volatile and weak financial markets.</p>
          <p>Cost is at the same level as last year. Close to half of the cost increases are related to the investments in growth areas, which are, as I said, all delivering on the revenue side at the same time.</p>
          <p>The funding base in Nordea is very strong, and we're conducting our funding operations more or less on a normal basis. We are highly rated, and we are having all sorts of -- all the markets, which I mentioned on the slide and more than 65% in long-term finance with the wholesale funding. And we feel comfortable that we have a solid base here.</p>
          <p>On the ambitious targets, we have the three targets set out. You should know about the TSR, where we want to be in the top quartile in the European peer group. We are in the top quartile. Actually, for the full period, we are number two, right after Santander. The risk-adjusted profit is to double in seven years. We are following that.</p>
          <p>As the next slide shows, in the most recent quarter, we're just 1% down, but, with the outlook we have, we expect to be more or less close to the red line, the 10% growth line again. And the target was set up as a seven-year target to show that it was covering a full economic cycle. So I think it's satisfying to say that, we even -- if we have a downturn in the economic cycle as we have now, we can still deliver fairly well.</p>
          <p>Are we in line with top Nordic peers? It comes out at 16%, and that comes, as well, to the peers we have seen. So we are actually delivering on that as well. And that brings me to the outlook from 2008. We are saying that we obviously see increased uncertainty on the macroeconomic outlook. Most forecasts are revised downwards and also in the Nordic area. And, therefore, we expect lending growth to be lower the remaining part of the year but still at a high level. And we say that high level could easily be 10% for the second half of the year annualized. And corporate lending margins will increase further. They have increased somewhat, but we'll see them increase going forward.</p>
          <p>And, as I said, we expect customer operations to deliver according to plan. They have done so in the first half of the year, and we expect that to continue. And, then, we get to the outlook, which is that we expect to see the risk-adjusted profit of approximately 5%. We are also saying that the development in financial markets will affect the outcome. The sensitivity is very high, as it can easily be calculated, so the growth can, of course, come out somewhere above or below 5%. The cost growth is expected to be in line with what we said previously, somewhat higher than last year.</p>
          <p>And the overall credit quality will remain strong. And, with the Baltic level -- Baltic countries, we're seeing some increased impaired loans, but it's at a low level and we are well provided -- we have provided well for what we see happening and what we expect to happen. In the second half of this year, we'll see somewhat higher loan losses than we saw in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. I'll hand over to Arne Liljedahl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. And I will now continue on slide 13 from the presentation material. You see the income statement for the first six months this year compared to the same period last year, with operating income up 3.2% following the strong growth in our customer areas and somewhat negative impact from the volatile and weakening the financial markets. And I will return to this. Costs up 6.4%, in line with the guidance, leading to a profit before loan losses unchanged. And with the shift in loan losses from positive to negative, it took the operating profit to below 1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 gives a comparison between the second quarter and the previous quarter this year, where we now could see that the income was up 2%, supported by improvement in net interest income as well as commission income, and a decline in net gains following that we had an impact from an interest rate position, which was positive in the first quarter and negative in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, we can see the growth in numbers that we already have touched upon. Total lending effects due to the repos was up 16% and deposits up 10. And the strong growth in all business volumes continued during the last quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we see that net interest income was up as much as 18% compared to last year on a year-on-year basis. It's supported very much by the strong lending, as well as deposit volumes was up and we saw, especially, improvement in the corporate sector -- segment and, not least, improvement of margins in that segment. We maintained that strong growth also in this second quarter this year. And more detail in a moment in net interest income could be seen on slide 17, where we -- it's worth observing that, for the first time since long, we can see positive impact from volume and margins from lending as well as from deposits. So it's contributing -- we see volume and margins all together contributed to the income growth.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, the structured SIIR risk, or interest income risk, is fairly stable over time and roughly &#x20AC;250 million. Commission income, on the next slide, is down 6%, very much affected by savings-related commission coming down following the weak equity markets and also some net outflow from the funds, not the least into the saving deposits in the bank. We also saw effects from lower transaction activity and a margin decrease in existing funds due to the shift in asset mix. Lending-related commission is strongly up following the volume growth. And payments commission is up at least especially the card commission.</p>
          <p>Then, on slide 20, the net gains/losses on items of fair value. Year-on-year, it was down 23%, or 147 million. And that line has been impacted by, first, still limited but still a negative impact from the market turmoil. We have calculated that to be in this quarter around &#x20AC;20 million and for the full six months &#x20AC;50 million.</p>
          <p>We have also a negative impact from an interest rate position where we entered into an interest rate position in the end of first quarter this year to protect the earnings -- the return on the Group's equity. And, when rates turned the other way around, we had this marked-to-market valued, so it affected negatively the net gains. You should also bear in mind that we did have a very strong revenue gains in the first and second quarter last year from listed and non-listed equities, not least our OMX holdings had some good upsides in last year.</p>
          <p>Turning into the next slide, 21, one can see that the net gains coming from the customer areas is still almost unchanged, despite the volatile markets. So we have seen the customer-driven activities being very strong and led to good earnings in this area.</p>
          <p>And, summarizing the income development, on slide 22, it clearly demonstrates that a strong revenue generation from the customer operations, not least from our lending activities, our new European markets, and capital markets and, especially then, in the corporate segment, took the income up as much as to more than 9%.</p>
          <p>However, of course, the savings commission came down due to the weak equity markets. And as also mentioned, we were negatively affected by this interest rate position that we did enter into to protect the return on our equity, as well as the strong comparison to last year, took the interest income back down to 3%. And the valuation losses we had experienced, the limited one on &#x20AC;50 million, could be found in the capital markets products. So, even including those valuation losses, we have good contribution earnings from that.</p>
          <p>Moving into the expenses on slide 23, expenses all in all up 6.4%, very much driven by investments in growth areas. We saw staff costs coming up 9% following an increase in number of employees by 7%.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, it becomes clear that almost half of the cost increases are related in one way or another to our investments in our growth areas, including where we expand in Russia and Poland, and adding that together with wage increases or wage inflation. We partly can offset the cost pressure with efficiency gains, which we have calculated to be in the area between 2 and 3% during this six months and we have somewhat slightly lower values as well taken the expense goes up to 6.4%.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, we can see that the 7% increase in the number of employees corresponds to roughly 2,000 fulltime equivalents. Half of those are employed in the new European markets and the other half in the Nordic markets. We also have still a fairly high turnover, which is good for the flexibility, and approximately 2,500 FTEs left the bank, and we recruited more than 4,000 during this -- compared to 12 months back.</p>
          <p>All in all with income and cost development, on slide 26, you can see that we still have, considering the circumstances, a good cost/income ratio; however, somewhat higher than we had in the first half last year. It's 54 compared to 52.</p>
          <p>Net profit went down 9% following that, as explained, the profit before loan losses were unchanged -- the shift in loan losses is still very low but going from positive to negative and somewhat higher tax rate this year compared to last year took the net profit down 9%.</p>
          <p>This still gives a good return on equity as well as the legal equity as the risk adjusted. We have return on equity coming down from 19 to 16%; again, with unchanged profit before loan losses and a higher equity. And the risk-adjusted return on capital at risk is still at an acceptable and good level and, not least, in the customer areas, where we have very strong risk-adjusted profit.</p>
          <p>And, on slide 29, you can see that the risk-adjusted earnings per share is unchanged. However, of course, the nominal EPS has dropped somewhat.</p>
          <p>On slide 30, you see the structure of our balance sheet, which is strong and solid. And we fund the loan book by deposits and roughly 130 billion in wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>And, looking at the funding side, if you turn to next slide, 31, you can see that we do have a broad funding base when it comes to markets on instruments and our external funding on 275 billion consists of our deposit base just below 150 and the wholesale funding on 128 and we can, since we have broad access to different markets, not least, the good functioning covered-bond markets in Denmark and Sweden.</p>
          <p>On slide 32, you can see the structure of our funding. Out of our 128 billion wholesale funding, roughly 65% are long-term, and approximately 60 billion are covered bonds. And we have gradually increased the portion of long-term funding during the year. And, we have been able to issue both covered bonds and senior bonds at attractive levels. And looking at the maturity structure of our wholesale funding, all in all it is around 46%. But that includes all major part of the short-term and approximately 50% of our long-term funding have maturity less than a year. So we are, I think, in a very good situation.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the capital position, on slide 33, we have seen increase in our risk-weighted assets, including the transition rules, the risk-weighted assets ended at 214 billion, and was up 6% compared to the previous quarter. In the calculation of risk-weighted assets, one should bear in mind that we are still in the approval process for our retail portfolio, which is the major part of the improvements we can achieve in Basel II environment. We expect that to lead to a reduction of risk-weighted assets in the area around 12%. And this calculation &#x2013; these risk-weighted assets take our tier I ratio to 7.0, when it comes to the -- including the transition rules and 7.9, excluding. Again remember that, that will be improved even further when we have our retail book also approved.</p>
          <p>So -- we think and we consider our capital position to be good, considering the stable profit generation and this approval process in which we expected to achieve during the year. And we will release -- disclose our more precise capital targets later on this year.</p>
          <p>Few words on the customer areas operations, and starting with, on slide 36, you see our profit by different markets. In general, it's fair to state that we have strengthened our market positions in all four Nordic markets, with -- especially notable market share gains in Norway and Sweden, at least on the corporate lending. We see strong income growth in Norway 7% up, in Denmark 11 and Sweden 5, and still a very strong profit level in our banking operations in Finland, the risk-adjusted return close to 40%.</p>
          <p>In new European markets, we see &#x2013; we have so high activity and organic growth continued. Income was up 6 to 7%, and we are -- have a low cost-to-income ratio on our operations in European markets, especially considering that we are in investment period for future yields in this area.</p>
          <p>And moving to the next slide 37, you can -- we can see the different markets within new European markets. And that the growth, volume, and also profit continued, particularly in Poland and Russia with a profit before loan losses up close to 160% in Poland, and 115 in Russia.</p>
          <p>In our other customer operations, financial institutions and shipping, we also have good development, our financial institutions divisions has strengthened its market position and maintained the high-income level. And in shipping, you can see with income growth of 16%, that is an evidence that we have kept our strong position in all segments.</p>
          <p>Slide 40, moves into some product areas and product results. The first one is the capital market products result, which despite there was the negative market turmoil as developed strongly, and especially if we compare this quarter with, for example, the third quarter last year when we started to experience the market turmoil. And we see income coming up &#x20AC;65 million compared to that quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next slide 41, looking at the savings products and asset management area, we of course have suffered from decline in total asset under management, putting pressure on income and product results. Income margins are down 13 basis points to 56 following the shift in asset types now from equity to fixed income but also to lower activity level when it comes to transaction.</p>
          <p>And one way to analyze and describe that is to look at slide 42, where you'll see that the income coming down 23% year-on-year roughly &#x20AC;100 million is coming from more or less four equal parts. One is the consequences of the net outflow, then we have the performance or the market depreciation but also the margin decrease following the shift in the assets that are left and then finally the lower transaction income and that all-in-all took the income down to -- with 23%.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the flow in the Asset Management on slide 43, we can see that we actually did have a positive inflow, net inflow in the last quarter on &#x20AC;0.5 billion. It was especially strong in our Nordic banking activities. And however a continued net outflow from our Retail funds in this quarter by 1.1 billion and we had a net outflow in the first quarter 1.7 billion, all-in-all 2.8 billion. But that should be compared with the inflow we had seen on our saving accounts. During the same period, saving accounts increased by 4.5 billion and looking at 12 months period, we have experienced outflow from our retail funds of 5 billion but inflow to our net savings deposits on 8 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, then the Life &amp; Pension product, we see strong improvement in premiums in most -- many markets and of course that is important for the future earnings. And the product result was down compared to last year, but unchanged compared to the previous quarter and we still have acceptable level of financial buffers. With that, I'll hand over to Carl-Johan to finalize his presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Arne. And on page 46, we try to describe a little bit the diversification of our lending portfolio. It's a huge portfolio of 270 billion, but it's not only the geographical split in roughly four equally big parts, but also the split between corporates and household and then within the corporate sector within the various industries that give it good diversification.</p>
          <p>What they're trying to show in this picture is breakdown the biggest part of the corporate portfolio being the real estate portfolio. It's showing that it's well spread between the Nordic countries with Sweden though being the biggest with more than 15 billion of the total volume and that the Baltic, all the Russian markets are fairly small. But also splitting it into commercial and residential real estate, which also give a good mix in terms of risk structure in the portfolio. So, in this respect we feel that we have a very, very diversified portfolio also able to meet future harder times.</p>
          <p>Loan losses on page 47 shows how we arrived at that 57 million for the half year. The last two quarters have been showing small losses, five basis points annualized. But you can see that the actual new charges are lower the last two quarters than previously. And then we have seen reduced recoveries as we have been forecasting making this five basis point net.</p>
          <p>Looking forward maybe to slide 48, the impaired loans indicates also the stability of the portfolio. There is virtually no change over these five quarters being shown here. And, also it's worth noting that more than half of the impaired loans are actually performing loans, i.e., where we have seen it good and prudent according to IFRS who is to make a provision even if the customers are still fully servicing the loan.</p>
          <p>The small change that you saw in the last quarter is more or less totally attributable to the increase in the Baltic states, where we can see now that we have 1% of the loan portfolio being impaired compared to 0.3% in the bank overall.</p>
          <p>Looking at slide 49, we breakdown the impaired loans as well, over a longer period. We're also showing the allowances, how they have developed. You can see that we have both individual allowances, those being 547 million in the last quarter, and then an increasing part of allowances are actually allowances collectively assessed loans, which now have grown to 383 million. All in all, almost 1 billion representing 63% of the impaired loans. So we feel that we have a fairly good coverage of the classified credits.</p>
          <p>Page 50, shows a breakdown in our impaired loans into the industrial segments, with no big changes during the quarter and also a fairly stable and good division otherwise personal customers being the biggest one. But also, there we have the best collateral and therefore the allowances in terms of coverage is lower there on the industrial part.</p>
          <p>Turning to market risk on page 51, we have seen a slight increase in market risk during the quarter. But that is also then very much attributable to the fact that we changed the model during the quarter. The reason being that the back tests that we did with our model following the turmoil, the high volatility that we've seen in the last 10 months, showed that our VaR model was not conservative enough. And we therefore changed it to be more conservative, increasing the figures by 20 to 40% depending little bit on the various risks.</p>
          <p>You can also see that it's basically interest rate risk that we carry, otherwise, we have very small risk positions in equity and credit spreads. And there's also a good diversification between the market risk. Overall, taking the size of our capital and the bank, the market risks are on a very moderate level.</p>
          <p>Finally, a few comments on the lending exposure in the Baltics. First of all, it's well divided between the three countries 30, 30, 40 you can say Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. And it only represents 2.5% of Nordea's total loan portfolio. And, if you look at how it's broken down further, we can see that household accounts for roughly 40% total exposure, leaving 60% for the corporate.</p>
          <p>And out of that corporate exposure, 25% is actually Nordic related, meaning that we have in excess to a Nordic parent or Nordic ownership, giving it further stability. Also here, we see the same tendencies as in the Nordic portfolio, real estate being the biggest but not more than 18% of the corporate.</p>
          <p>Finally, if you look at the individualized loan losses in the Baltics on page 53, we can see that we have had very small losses, representing only 10 basis points now in the last half year. But we have increased our collective allowances in anticipation of the weakening economic environment that we can be foreseeing.</p>
          <p>And with the increase of 10 in the last quarter, we now carry a total provision for, primarily, the real estate sector in the Baltics or &#x20AC;90 million, which is more than 1% of the total exposure in the area, which makes us feel that we have a fairly good coverage of the expected losses that we can see coming there.</p>
          <p>We have been growing our lending in this area, also in the last year. But then, of course, the percentages are high because we're starting -- we starting at a low level. And also, we have basically been supporting our good customers completing their projects, and we have seen opportunities also in the difficult market to continue the loan activities.</p>
          <p>Those would be my short comments on the credit quality and I'll leave it to Christian to make a short summary of the presentations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's easily done. Just go back to the headlines, and I would say that the main takeaway is that we have actually record results in our customer areas and very high activity. And we're actually delivering according to our plans in the first half-year, and we expect to do that in the second half year. It's due to the initiatives -- growth initiatives, which are also producing the revenues according to plan. And then we have the impact from the volatile and weakened markets as Arne has explained. Credit quality, capital position and funding is all strong and solid, and we maintain our long-term targets in the growth and risk-adjusted profit, and we expect this would around 5% for the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken Capital Markets here. I have three questions, if I may. First, on the credit quality, we've seen the GDP forecast being downgraded across the Nordic region. And I was just wondering does this translate automatically into higher collective provisions or how is the dynamic working? As you mentioned in the Baltics that has happened. The second question is on the fish farming sector in particular, how do you see the developments there, and have you made any collective provisions during 2008? And thirdly finally, in the calculation of the risk-adjusted profit, is it the -- is the credit risk charge constant or should we expect that to change a bit depending on the economic developments? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start. First of all, the GDP is of course is one underlying factor when we evaluate the need for particularly collective provisions, but it's not an automatic that just gives us increased provisions. We are looking at industries according to our requirements under IFRS, and trying to identify the loss events which could lead to future need for provisions. And that is how we are conducting the evaluation.</p>
          <p>And as you can see the outcome of that is that we have increased, in particular the collective provisions up to the level of 380 million during the last few quarters. Fish farming, we don't really see that as a problem industry for the time being. Prices for farmed salmon is good, outlook is stable, and the whole industry has been restructured with stronger players coming in. There has been a consolidation in the industry and we therefore see that that is risk as good as any of course, subject to market fluctuations, but for the time being it looks to be a stable industry. Now if Arne would like to go with the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the expected losses follow the change in volumes and the potential change in competition in the lending books. So that's -- yeah, it follows that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically, if lending growth goes -- lending growth increases, the credit charge will increase as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Derek De Vries from Merrill Lynch is now online with the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Derek from Merrill. I have three areas of questions as well, if that's all right. I want to start with page 39 in your press release. You give CDO exposure in the table at the bottom there. And I was wondering if you could explain that to me as if sort of I haven't seen it presented that way, bought and sold and what does mean? And then you gave some disclosure about 567 of your bought exposure is sub-investment grade. And I'm just wondering if that still held at notional value or is it held at what you bought it out or have you marked it down? So that's the first area of question, just a little more disclosure on that CDO table. The second area is I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the difference between non-performing loans and impaired loans because the trends were pretty different in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If I strip out the Baltic impaired loans, it actually looks like your impaired loans fell during Q2, which is a pretty big difference between what happened to your non-performing loans, which were up, I think, 11% or 12%. So maybe, if you could just walk us through the process, or the difference between an impaired loan and nonperforming loan? I think we can all work out what the latter is. And then the third area of questions I have was Denmark in your retail banking. A very good result there, and it seems to be driven by, among other things, improved margins. I was wondering if you can just talk &#x2013; is it a competitive situation? Certainly, a few competitors, at least, have been weakened or is it a shift in the sort of loans themselves or what's driving that improved margin? If you could give some qualitative statements there, it would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If &#x2013; I'll try to comment a few words on the CDO exposure. It's very difficult to look at this isolated because the CDOs are part of a bigger trading group, which also comprises individual credit bonds, but also comprises CDSs, credit for swaps bought on those bonds. We are ourselves building CDOs that we sell to our investors, primarily our Nordic institutions. And when doing that, we buy protection by CDSs or individual bonds or primarily, of course, meaning that we sell the whole package further on to the final investors. All of these are daily marked to market.</p>
          <p>And obviously, also the underlying structure is fairly simple. It's not the instruments that we cannot value because they are, as I said, basically made up of highly liquid credit bonds. So, in that respect, this is just an additional information that we like to give to you in order to give a feeling about the volumes of this business. And, as I said, it's all marked to market, and the positions change day to day and are including in our market risk, credit risk VaR, if there's an open position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just is it all level one and level two then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, regarding the impaired loans, yes, it's true that if you exclude the Baltics, we actually are slightly down. But that has to do with the fact that we have not seen any need for further provisions in this market. You can see that, if you look at the division between performing and non-performing, the non-performing are slightly up, but that is basically the Baltics, while the performing is down.</p>
          <p>And that basically indicates that some of the previously provided credits have become healthier, which means that the provision that we carried, and therefore the grading of that loan has been improved and therefore removed from the impaired table. So that is a strength in itself. That this has been the trend in the last quarter. But obviously as you say, in our long-term outlook we are dependent on the future development of the macroeconomic environment. And the development in impaired loans and in losses is covered in our outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on Denmark, might be somebody else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the question on Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the strong performance in Denmark &#x2013; I think, if I start, anyway &#x2013; to say that the fact in Denmark is that it's easier than in any other country to increase margins on corporate lending, and that we successfully did early in the process. We increased all the board 25 basis points in our corporate margins, and that shows up nicely. And we also have had a good volume development in Denmark, both on deposits and on lending. So we have had easier to adapt to the changed market in Denmark, and that's why Denmark stands out as the best profit improver for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's fair to say that what you're seeing in Denmark, the improvements in the margin, are related to passing on higher funding costs and then some, as opposed to any change in the quality of your loan book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we did.</p>

          <p>Per Lofgren from Morgan Stanley is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. First of all, a question on asset quality. You see loan losses rising in the second half of '08, according to your outlook and I just wanted to hear whether you see the stress coming. And also...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Per, it's a little bit difficult to hear you. Can you get closer to the microphone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I am trying. Hope you hear me better now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said, you see loan losses rising in the second half of '08 according to your outlook. And I just wanted to hear where do you see this stress coming. And the same thing, in a slightly different way -- you were talking about here that your assess loans according to IFRS, which is natural. But what would have been the difference if you were still under Swedish GAAP? I'm just trying to figure out the dynamics of what we see in terms of numbers and what you sort of anticipate. And a second thing is just a clarification. You say corporate margins are expected to increase. I guess that we get part of the answer there with Denmark. But, just to make it clear, do you mean like generally in the market, or is it any part of it that's a mix effect in Nordea related to strong growth in high-margin lending -- for example, the shipping segment? Those were my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I start again, yes we saw a slight increase from 21 million for the first quarter to 36 in the second. Talking basis points, it's, in our book, extremely small change overall. 10 million out of those 36 are actually then the Baltic general provision increase that we convey, and the rest is then made up of bits and pieces. You can see the breakdown. For instance, in Nordic banking, you see it per country, and there are small charges in most countries. So, in other words, no major item, no major concentration to any country.</p>
          <p>So it is just a slight deterioration in the net position, primarily coming from fewer recoveries, as we saw the total new provisions actually down overall. So it is a matter of fewer recoveries, and that is also exactly what we said before.</p>
          <p>If we talk about how we provide, I would say it's more looking backward that I would say the difference between IFRS of today and the old what we could sold -- commercial bankers best judgment way of provisioning. I mean, during the good days, we should remember the exceptional years -- that we had three years of net recoveries in banking under old rules, we might have actually built up some higher resource, which was not possible to do under IFRS.</p>
          <p>But we still feel that we are adequately provided by general resource because of the possibility of making collective impairment and collective resources as we have been doing. But, anyway, you can say that the volatility is going to be higher under the new regime than it would have been under the old accounting rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. That's clear. And a second thing on the mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can -- as I told on the more corporate volumes, we see now margins coming up overall. And, as said, it is strongest so far in Denmark but also in Norway and Sweden. The only one that we see lagging a little bit is Finland. But it's mainly in the merchant banking and large corporate segment. But we expect that to continue more into the medium segment as well. So it's no specific segment as such, but it is more different in timing when we are able to see margin improves to deflect in the increases on the higher market price on capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Q1, the margin increase was only seen in the corporate merchant banking division. Now we start to see a little bit of pickup was in other. But it's clearly led by the largest corporates. Okay. Next question please?</p>

          <p>Jan Wolter from Deutsche Bank is now on line with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The first question is around the guidance. I think, if we look at the guidance right now, it seems like you guide for 3.9 or so billion in the pre-provision profits for this year. And you're talking about cost growth, which is slightly above '07 levels. So if I look at the revenues then, or what is implied by that, then it looks like revenues must be up the second half-year. Could you talk about what underlying assumptions do you have for your revenue generation in the second half? What are the crucial assumptions there -- corporate lending margins or general lending growth, et cetera? That's the first question. The second one is on reversals. How should we look at that? Is it correlated in any way to long bond deals or any other factor in the economy that is more important than others? Those were my two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I should start on the guidance part. Obviously, we are guiding revenues higher the second half of the year. Actually, the simple way to look at it is that we have performed between 5 to 10% on all the customer areas, if we exclude the impact on the volatile markets, in the first half-year, and we expect that to continue in the second half year.</p>
          <p>Actually, there is not much that could make us change that. We are assuming that the economic development will be as we expect now, so it is close to the 2% growth in the Nordic area. We are still there or not too far from that. And we are also expecting that the volatile markets behave in a way -- we're not giving specific forecasts for that, but that we see markets continue the way we have seen them and not shift more than that.</p>
          <p>But we are also saying that, especially the financial environments can influence the results, so it can be somewhat above or below. It's very hard to predict. The sensitivity is fairly thick, only &#x20AC;25 million shift the risk-adjusted profit 1%. So what we do know is that we are fairly confident that we will deliver between 5% of the customer areas. The question is whether it will actually deliver on the impact on the financials. And that will make the average for the full year to come down to the 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on the long bond deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the reversals, I might not have understood your question right. But, if I start by saying that loan losses are, of course, not related to bond deals. They are not fair value, as said, but they are amortized, of course. That's how we treat our loan book. And that means that the bond years as such is not really the paramount there. What actually influenced the reversals on loan losses is what happened to the either the individual customer that has been provided for. It might be taken over by another bank that pays us out. It might be sold to another company, and we get a good -- new owner, new equity. Or it might just be able to recover because of better trading conditions. And the same goes for the collective impairment changes in the actual outstandings or, then, positive or negative development in the outlook for the sector. So it is very much an individual judgment that on a company or customer, customer basis that actually drives that development.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, it's Per from Danske Three questions, the first related to your outlook. Can you rephrase your economy profit tied into GAAP outlook, as I've been looking for positive GAAP between revenue and cost quote. The second question is whether you can comment a bit more on your net interest income in Finland that continues to be rather sluggish. Are the competition that much fiercer in Finland? It looks like your volume is growing quite nicely out there. And, thirdly, a question on your net interest income hedges on your deposit base. What are you doing currently? Are you still hedging them from 12 to 18 months forward? And, if that is the case, I guess it's fair to assume that you have a lag effect now after the interest rates have started to rise. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start -- well, on the first one, I don't think we don't guide any GAAP analysis on the risk-ad to profit. It's -- the guidance is on the risk-ad profit. But, of course, doing the back-book calculation, you will then have for this quarter with solid positive GAAP in the second -- for the second half of this year. But that is not what we disclose, our own calculation of that. On the margins in Finland, it's correct that we have been -- it's a fair competition in Finland, so it's a pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>And in Finland, they have also, when it comes to development, the net interest income, been suffering somewhat from pressure on deposit margins. However, in this particular quarter, we actually saw some improvements in the bond deposit margins as well in Finland. But it's mainly, so far, strong competition on pricing in Finland. On the depository -- the deposit hedge, we still have that. It did have a slight negative impact year-on-year comparison this half year. But it's -- we have taken it down, both on the maturity and volume, gradually.</p>

          <p>We -- no -- we have not--well, of course, with the interest rate scenarios, it might be interesting maybe to take another view on it. But we have gradually said that we should take it down, and we have done that. We haven't -- we will not disclose exactly the outstanding volume. It's part of our ordinary business, and we don't highlight that specially.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Paavo and I am from Evli Bank, Helsinki. Some of my questions were already answered, but couple of quick questions. First, I think I saw somewhere a quote today that Nordea is not interested in acquiring Roskilde Bank. I just wanted to check if this was the official statement by you?</p>
          <p>And, secondly, on your guidance of slower lending volume growth in second half of this year, I just wanted to check that are you anyway still expecting double-digit lending growth for the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first on Roskilde, it is so that we are not interested in taking over the bank. But we would be interested in building at the branch network if that comes out for sale, which is a clear possibility. Whether we are a likely buyer or not is another question. We are the number two bank in the Roskilde area actually in there, so it might not be -- we might not be the best suited by it. But we will take a look at it.</p>
          <p>But the whole bank, as such, I think, is a tricky one not only because of their bad credit, but also because of the fact that they have sold their own shares to a very large extent to their good customers for the savings. And they have a large number of good customers, which are in really bad shape. So I would say the branch network could be of interest, and we will look at it if it becomes available.</p>
          <p>The slower lending growth, well, we are saying that's our general forecast for the second half year. Things will slow down somewhat. But we are saying that it could easily be 10%. So it's slower growth, and 16, we're still at a high level. And that could be like 10%. But, again, the uncertainty in this outlook is fairly big.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm going to ask questions in two areas. One is on this issue of loan growth. I mean, as I understand it, the economic outlook is worsening quite considerably in the Nordic region, and you're talking about, say, 90 basis points of GDP growth next year. I mean, could you explain to why you think corporates are borrowing so much and whether it's just that they haven't really taken account of the full economic reality?</p>
          <p>And then kind of a related question in terms of Denmark. I'm quite surprised there are very low provisions. And have you taken any collective provisions in Denmark at all? And if not, I mean, are there any industries you're worried about because I understand that quite a few industries are under pressure there from high commodity prices? I wondered if you could just talk a bit more about the Danish economy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I'll first start at a more general loan growth outlook. Yes, it's true that the outlook, particularly for next year, are being cut down to below 2% growth in the Nordic area, but it's still a growth. They are not seeing the trucking industry. So we foresee that the loan growth will continue. But, clearly, it goes down from the so-called 15% that we have seen in last couple of years, actually, to maybe single digit next year.</p>
          <p>But, this year we still see healthy demand. We actually have full employment in all the four countries. And many of our good customers are still performing extremely well. And so are also the households performing well. So that's why we don't really see any disaster scenarios and the so-called stop of activity just overnight. But depending on how much the global economy is going to come down and thereby also affecting our economies, it has to be reassessed, I would say, quarter-by-quarter. But as it looks today, it still looks fairly strong.</p>
          <p>Regarding Denmark then in particular, I think of course there the difficulties have been rather limited and limited to two sectors. First of all, the construction and real estate sector, where it started with the slowdown of the housing market in Copenhagen. But very much affecting only the sort of upper segment of that market and not really hurting the whole industry. And then, it spread to also the rural areas when it comes to smaller construction projects, which is maybe the reason why we have banks like Roskilde today in problem.</p>
          <p>But it's not an area where we are highly exposed. But, obviously, it's one of the areas which we are following very closely and also one where we have taken some provisions both individual and collective. But they have been a very small level.</p>
          <p>The second area which has had trouble for the last 12 months is the agriculture area, very much based on the huge increase in the feedstuff. You have seen prices for wheat and other grain types going up 100% while the pig prices, for instance, have not increased in the same way. And, therefore, we have also there a very close scrutiny and also taking some collective provisions on the agricultural sector. So we have been analyzing the situation very carefully and taking the provisions that we feel necessary for the time being.</p>

          <p>Maybe I could add on that it's possible that when you analyze the economic growth in Denmark you have to look very carefully at it. I mean, the statistics generally right now reporting very good results. And Denmark is extremely open economy, so most companies are very active outside of Denmark, too. And they are a lot of our customers. Where we talk about Danish lending, it's actually the domicile of Danish companies. And they are generally doing growth, like we see those there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the private area, it's important to note that we have full employment in Denmark. At the last count, we had 58,000 unemployed people. With full employment and fairly low interest rates, the private individuals are repaying their loans as normal and servicing them. So it's not really a loan loss issue. It's more an issue coming from the real estate market where some of the values that were created during recent years are disappearing right now, which is slowing down consumption somewhat. So I think it's important to analyze Denmark in fairly quite a lot of detail before concluding.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Yes, I've just got a very brief question on the relationship of the amount of lending you're adding versus the deposits. You've grown lending by 25 billion and deposits by around 5 billion so far this year. Are you comfortable continuing to grow lending significantly faster than deposits, or are you starting to see it as an issue if you become increasingly reliant on wholesale funding? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are following that, of course, and we are also now focusing on deposit side. And that's why we offer our clients very competitive interest rates. But we are not in that situation yet that that is a big concern. We have good access to funding. And, if you look at the loan-to-deposit rate to include in the covered bonds we are on a very sub-sector level. But, of course, in the long term we need to have a balance also between the deposit and lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for the next 12 to 18 months or so, you're happy continuing with 2, 3, or even 500% sort of incremental loan-to-deposit ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that that will be the case. I think I said a number times that the loan growth will be more subdued going forward, and we're also now focusing on deposit to gain deposits the new European markets as well. So we are building the deposit base.</p>
