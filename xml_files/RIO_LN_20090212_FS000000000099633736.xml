      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning to all of you here in London, good evening to all those who're joining us from Australia. In fact, we have people in a number of different locations this time. And I hope that in the Q&amp;A that follows, we will be able to do justice to all of you.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation will cover both the announcement of what I think is a landmark transaction in our corporate history, as well as Rio Tinto's 2008 full year results. The transaction with Chinalco announced today will reposition Rio Tinto both financially in the medium term and strategically in the longer term. It offers significant value to shareholders now and competitive advantage for the future of the business.</p>
          <p>We're delighted to have President, Xiao; and Vice President, Liu of Chinalco with us in this presentation today. Welcome to London to both of you.</p>
          <p>Tom is also here with me in London; and Guy Elliott, CFO is joining us from Melbourne, and Guy can see you very clearly. You are hearing us okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. So the schedule is that we will present first on our recommended transaction with Chinalco followed by a transaction specific Q&amp;A session. We'll then take a short 10-minute break, after which we will present the highlights version of our usual financial results also with accompanying Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased to announce today that Rio Tinto has agreed to enter into a pioneering strategic partnership with Chinalco. The proposed partnership will entail the investment by Chinalco of U.S. $19.5 billion in our company through a combination of asset level investments and the issue of Rio Tinto convertible bonds.</p>
          <p>The asset investment of 12.3 billion will occur through the creation of three commodity based joint ventures in aluminium, copper, and iron ore, while the balance of 7.2 billion will be gained through the subscription by Chinalco for the convertible bonds to which I referred.</p>
          <p>The proposed transaction will deliver multiple benefits to Rio Tinto. Firstly, at premium values, and we will discuss that at some length, it will substantially strengthen Rio Tinto's balance sheet, addressing simultaneously both the near term liquidity requirements and our overall level of indebtedness.</p>
          <p>Secondly, strategic flexibility will be restored as the company is able to act on compelling investment opportunities through the economic cycle. Thirdly, the transaction will create a unique partnership between Rio Tinto and Chinalco with the ability to capitalize strongly on emerging trends in global resources.</p>
          <p>Specifically, Rio Tinto's traditional strength as a leading diversified miner will be complemented through access to Chinalco's unique insights, relationships, and capabilities. Taken in total, we believe this partnership will deliver an outstanding value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>It's important, I think, to understand that today's announcement is the culmination of a series of engagements between Chinalco and Rio Tinto, since Chinalco's original investment in Rio Tinto back in February 2008. At that time, we said that we would seek value-creating opportunities to work together; and today's announcement is testament to the great potential that exists in exploring areas of mutual cooperation.</p>
          <p>Following extensive consideration of the strategic options available to Rio Tinto, the Boards have unanimously concluded that the opportunity offered by this partnership is superior to other identified options and offers greater medium-term certainty and longer-term value for shareholders. We believe the transaction will secure for Rio Tinto a leadership position in global resources.</p>
          <p>The transaction begins a pioneering strategic partnership that combines the very best of the developed and the developing world. It is no surprise, I think, to anybody listening to this presentation that the developing world is increasingly important to the resources sector.</p>
          <p>A fact we believe the current global financial crisis is only likely to underscore. In that context, we believe this partnership will uniquely position Rio Tinto within the sector by allowing us to benefit from Chinalco's market insight, strong Chinese relationships and capabilities.</p>
          <p>Chinalco, and I am sure, President Xiao will speak to this, will benefit from exposure to Rio Tinto's expertise in managing and operating long life, large, world class resources. As I mentioned earlier, the transaction is value enhancing for Rio Tinto's shareholders on a number of levels. Chinalco's cash investment provides us with balance sheet strength and flexibility to pursue our long-term strategy right through the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>Importantly, this cash has been raised at a substantial premium to current market valuations, and Guy will in his presentation take you through this. I think it is a rare if not unique achievement in today's current financial environment.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto's standards of governance and first-rate operational practice will continue as before. At the corporate level and within the commodity joint ventures, strong governance structures will ensure continued commercial focus and independence in all decision making.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto will run the business according to its established business principles. Current practices will continue at all facilities. And I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment. For these reasons, the Board intends unanimously to recommend this transaction to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me provide some color regarding the two components of the proposed transaction. First, three commodity based joint ventures will be established in aluminium, copper, and iron ore. Each will contain certain Rio Tinto operations, in which Chinalco will take a minority or joint venture interest.</p>
          <p>The specifics of the operations involved and Chinalco's interest are shown in the table. Tom is going to go through each of the ventures in more detail later. But I think, it's important to highlight that in all cases, where Rio Tinto is already the operator, Rio Tinto will maintain operational and management control of the assets within the ventures. The total investment by Chinalco in these ventures will be $12.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The second component is in the investment in subordinated convertible bonds, and Guy will describe the key features of these bonds in more detail later. But several aspects are set out here. Note in particular that the bonds are convertible at substantial premia to today's share price, and that the coupon rate of 9% on the plc bonds and 9.5% on the Limited bonds are very competitive in today's credit environment.</p>
          <p>If they are fully converted, Chinalco's interest in Rio Tinto will total 18%, including the 9.3% which was purchased in February 2008. The two components of the transaction are internally-conditional and complementary, and assist in ensuring that future partnership co-operation is maximized. Accordingly, we will be seeking approval for both components, it is not an either/or proposal.</p>
          <p>Underpinning a proposed partnership is Rio Tinto's long-standing recognition of the crucial role China is playing in the global economy. We all know the headlines, but the implication of the scale of China's contribution to world economic growth should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p>For decades, only a quarter of global GDP was contributed by the developing world; and China, as you can see in the left hand columns, was only a fraction of that.</p>
          <p>By 2025, the developing world will contribute more than half of global GDP, and China alone will contribute around 20%. This is a profound change that will inevitably lead to a transformation in political, economic, and social dynamics.</p>
          <p>The pioneering strategic partnership we announced today is a continuation of Rio Tinto's relationships with China. And it provides us, I think, with an unrivaled competitive position in one of the world's key markets.</p>
          <p>Both Chinalco and Rio Tinto have agreed that this partnership must be built on strong independent governance structures ensuring continuity of strategy and continued commercial focus. At the corporate level, Independent Non-Executive Directors will continue to comprise a majority of the Rio Tinto Boards.</p>
          <p>Chinalco will be entitled to nominate two Non-Executive Directors to complement the existing Boards, one of whom will be independent under recognized corporate governance standards. These appointments will be subject to approval by the Board's current Nominations Committee. These specifics and other principles designed to ensure continuity of independent and commercial decision-making have been included in a comprehensive relationship agreement executed between the companies.</p>
          <p>The commodity joint ventures will also incorporate strong governance mechanisms. Each will have a Strategic Alliance Committee responsible for setting high-level direction. Voting rights on each committee will reflect the economic interest of each party. And given Chinalco's interests are a minority in each case, ultimate control will remain with Rio Tinto, where Rio Tinto is the operator of the relevant asset, existing operational arrangements will be maintained, including a commitment to save sustainable and ethical business practices, which our new colleagues from Chinalco are fully supportive of.</p>
          <p>And I think that is a good moment for me to hand over, and once again to welcome President Xiao of Chinalco to speak to you. President Xiao?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we made an investment into 9% of Rio Tinto last year, and from then long discussions between the two companies started.</p>
          <p>The transaction just outlined by Chairman Skinner, I think, is a very good testimony to our confidence over the longer term in Rio Tinto. We firmly believe this transaction is also going to bring a lot of opportunities for Chinalco, both in China and elsewhere in the world. Also we anticipate a better return on our investment.</p>
          <p>Given that the partnership is established both at a shareholding &#x2013; at a corporate level and at asset level, we believe that this partnership would bring &#x2013; will bring opportunities for additional value creation for both parties.</p>
          <p>Chinalco is a leading diversified resources company in China. We are ranked number three, number four, and number five in terms of the production of alumina, aluminium, and fabricated aluminium products in the world.</p>
          <p>We're expanding our businesses both in terms of commodities and in terms of geography. We've made significant investments in Australia and Peru, for example, recently. Compared to Rio Tinto, Chinalco is a relatively young company. We were formally established only back in 2001, but over the years &#x2013; over the past few years we've managed to grow very fast.</p>
          <p>Expanding on our core competence over aluminium, we have been able to expand into other commodities such as titanium, copper, and other rare metals. We are also very focused on environmental protection and our corporate responsibilities toward the host communities, therefore we enjoy very good relations with all communities we work in.</p>
          <p>We believe this is a major step in developing our international presence in getting the company more familiar with best practices and standards worldwide, and as such to be able to establish cooperation with world leaders in the sector. Despite the fact that we are a state-owned company, I'd like to emphasize that we are run completely independently and commercially. All our decisions related to marketing, production and capital expenditure is made by the management team independently.</p>
          <p>I believe that this investment is going to yield a very attractive financial return over the longer term. As Tom and Guy will elaborate upon the details of the transaction, I will not delve too much on those, but I would just like to say that given the expertise of the management teams involved here, we are fully confident that this transaction is only a start that will lead to many more opportunities in the future. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, President Xiao. We're announcing a transaction with Chinalco today, which is consistent with our long-established corporate strategy. Rio Tinto remains fully focused on maximizing shareholder value by firstly developing and operating a portfolio of long life, low cost, large scale assets, by maintaining and building industry-leading operational capability, and of course by identifying and capturing great opportunities to create value whenever and wherever they may come.</p>
          <p>Our strategic partnership with Chinalco complements this strategy in four different ways. First, it does strongly support shareholder value by raising capital at a substantial premium to current market prices ensuring short-term financial uncertainty is eliminated. It provides us with the flexibility to take advantage &#x2013; full advantage of our unique asset base. This includes reducing the capital constraints that might otherwise limit our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, and being better positioned to respond when the recovery does come.</p>
          <p>We ensure funding remains for new investment opportunities without lowering the high standards we've set as part of our rigorous capital appraisal processes. And finally, it does position the company to benefit from the trends that are continuing to emerge in the resource industry, particularly driven by China.</p>
          <p>President Xiao has just described an independent commercial and successful resources company, possessing qualities which we believe make it the ideal partner for Rio Tinto. Generating an outstanding track record of growth and value creating investments, Chinalco successfully consolidated the Chinese aluminum sector. And now it's extending that footprint outside its core sector and geography.</p>
          <p>Starting with the steep towers of China, the fastest growing market in the world for our commodities, Chinalco has developed a strong position in developing countries. Chinalco's access to strong financial support has been instrumental in its ability to participate in new opportunities for growth. In addition to this impressive business performance and competitive position, Chinalco's values and objectives are closely aligned with our own. Both Chinalco and Rio Tinto operate through governance process designed to foster independent commercial behavior, and we share a commitment for maintaining the appropriate balance between excellent financial returns for our shareholders and sustainable development for the stakeholders and communities we work in.</p>
          <p>Our management teams are both experienced and professional, and we are committed to openness, including our desire to benefit from transparent capital markets. And finally, it's worth reminding ourselves that joint ventures with major Japanese and Chinese companies have been a key part of our business for over 20 years. The 19.5 billion of cash generated for Rio Tinto addresses our liquidity position, provides balance sheet strength, and operational and strategic flexibility.</p>
          <p> A portion of proceeds will be used to meet our commitment made on December 10, 2008 to repay U.S. $10 billion of debt by the end of 2009. Cash will remain after this repayment is made, which could be applied to either further debt repayments or for selective investment. Above all, the critical point is this provides the company with flexibility. And these proceeds provided by Chinalco also underpin our progressive dividend policy and the maintenance of the 2008 full year dividend at the 2007 level.</p>
          <p>At this point, I want to talk in more detail about how this partnership will assist Rio Tinto to the greatest extent possible from important trends in the resources sector. Every aspect of the resources sector is being &#x2013; becoming increasingly influenced by the developing world, and China in particular. Demand growth for commodity market will be driven by rapidly growing economies, such as China.</p>
          <p>New Tier 1 resources will increasingly be found in emerging geographies, and the resources sector require the geological and geopolitical expertise to secure access to them. In addition, most activity in emerging markets will require a broader range of project execution skills. And finally rapid economic development, together with traditional and continued high savings rates means the developing world is now an important new source of capital for all companies, not simply in the resources sector.</p>
          <p>Over the next decade, access to developing world markets and resources, execution skills and finance will be the difference between the winners and the losers in our sector. There should be little doubt that irrespective of the current economic crisis, we're probably facing a long-term rebalancing of the global economy, with the developing world and China playing an ever greater role based upon fundamental trends of demographics and industrialization. This is not new for Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>It should be recalled that when we established our first iron ore joint venture with China back in 1987, we were the first to export iron ore to China in 1973. We were also the first to recognize and respond to the structural upturn in the Chinese economic growth by our early expansion in 2003 of our iron ore production in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>So Rio Tinto was early to recognize and welcome the growing participation of China in the global economy and the opportunities this presents. We do believe that China's role in driving global commodity demand will continue to grow into the future.</p>
          <p>The forecast on this chart show China's share of total demand, and the demand growth in key commodities. Of course, this is based upon December and January data that include an assessment of the impact of the unfolding global economic downturn. And it clearly shows the underlying economic forces at work in China means this trend will not be derailed by the current economic conditions.</p>
          <p>The benefits to Rio Tinto of increasing our expertise in and access to Chinese markets is obvious. For us volume growth must come from reaching new customers. Our new customers will overwhelmingly be located in China. A partnership with Chinalco positions Rio Tinto to benefit from these industry trends. Rio Tinto's knowledge of Chinese markets will be increased through access to Chinalco's insights regarding supply and demand dynamics, and the power of potential market impact of government policies, stimulation and actions.</p>
          <p>This is particularly useful at a time when the Chinese government's stimulus package will be a key driver of global economic performance. Chinalco's assistance will be invaluable as we work to secure new resources in China, a country that's never been fully explored using modern exploration techniques. In addition, Chinalco's expertise, experience and connections in developing nations will assist Rio Tinto to access and develop new resources around the world. Chinalco's skills will add to Rio Tinto's own in developing new Tier 1 assets.</p>
          <p>Maybe let's give a few examples. First, Chinalco will share its deep experience and knowledge of logistics in emerging countries. Second, Rio Tinto plans to leverage Chinalco's access to Chinese project development and execution capabilities. And third, Rio Tinto will have the benefit of new technologies to be developed in partnership with Chinalco on a commercial basis only. And finally, Chinalco will assist Rio Tinto to secure capital for major projects or acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Both Rio Tinto and Chinalco are very confident that we can work together to turn these potential benefits into value for Rio Tinto shareholders. In fact, we're quickly taking specific actions to realize this value. Rio Tinto and Chinalco today have announced joint initiatives with some immediate benefits. And they include an agreement to access the potential for joint exploration in China; a memorandum of understanding regarding possible joint development at Simandou iron ore province in Guinea; and the development protocols to share and jointly develop human resources, especially Rio Tinto's operational expertise and Chinalco's sales and marketing personnel.</p>
          <p>And finally meetings have already been held by senior Rio Tinto's executives and Chinese banking officials to discuss potential opportunities for project-based finance. These have been constructive. We are very confident that real access to capital will be achieved.</p>
          <p>We firmly believe these are initial examples of how the relationship between Rio Tinto and Chinalco can yield benefits to both parties, providing an indication of things to come. Chinalco's asset stakes purchase of course means they will receive portion of earnings from the relevant assets going forward.</p>
          <p>On an attributable EBITDA basis and using second half 2008 data to capture the impact of the steep falls in traded commodity prices in the second half of last year, the attributable EBITDA acquired by Chinalco in the transaction represents about 8% of Rio Tinto's total attributable EBITDA. And this is consistent with our view of the NPV contribution made by the stakes transferred.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the details of the commodity joint ventures. In aluminum, as you both &#x2013; as you already know companies have existing interest &#x2013; both companies have existing interests in aluminum in Queensland. And through this transaction, Chinalco's investments will be at Weipa, 30% of the total economic interest with Rio Tinto at 70; at Yarwun, 50% for both parties; and just under 50% of Rio's existing interest in Boyne and Gladstone Power Station.</p>
          <p>Taken together, Chinalco's proposed interest in these four facilities had they been applicable from 1st of July 2008 would represent about 4% of Rio Tinto Alcan's second half 2008 EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Apart from these investments in current operating businesses, Chinalco and Rio Tinto anticipate pursuing a number of further opportunities through the join venture, including the potential to link more closely with the adjacent Arukun lease, and Weipa and nearby resources as appropriate.</p>
          <p>The joint venture with Chinese refining opportunities subject to Rio Tinto's usual commercial assessment procedures. The development of our human resources through secundments and exchanges, and finally the use of technology developed by the join venture at every locations operated by Rio Tinto and Chinalco.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto and Chinalco have agreed to a number of specific marketing arrangements for the joint venture's bauxite resources. Once Rio Tinto's system requirements are satisfied and those of existing customers, a portion of the existing production at Weipa will be marketed by a new joint venture marketing company, including the Chinese customers.</p>
          <p>Marketing of this other bauxite will be managed by Rio Tinto on behalf of the joint venture. The joint venture will also negotiate at arm's length a multi-year commitment to supply Chinalco's allocation to Yarwun.</p>
          <p>The potential value with the combination of Rio Tinto's assets and skills with Chinalco's acknowledged aluminium expertise is outstanding. For copper, Chinalco's investment will secure economic interest in Escondida with just over 15% of the total Escondida economic interest; at Kennecott Utah Copper with 25, with Rio, 75%; and at Grasberg, with 12% of the total economic interest, as you know through the metal strip which is imbedded within the Grasberg venture.</p>
          <p>Taken together and assuming their application had been from the 1st of July 2008 by way of example, these interests would have represented 36% of the copper croup's EBITDA for the second half of 2008. And of course, these shares are after the economic interests of our joint venture partners are taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>The joint venture also envisions Chinalco's joint participation in future projects, and these include Chinalco's investment has also secured an economic interest in 30% of La Granja in Peru. And Rio Tinto and Chinalco will also discuss the potential to bring Chinalco's Peru projects interest other joint venture. While current market arrangements remain unaffected, we would anticipate the parties using Chinalco's skills to market La Granja production into China.</p>
          <p>Let's now talk about iron ore. In iron ore, Chinalco's investment will secure a 15% share in the wholly owned businesses within Hamersley Iron. And had this joint venture been in effect from the 1st of July 2008, this share would represent about 10% of the iron group &#x2013; iron ore group, product group EBITDA for the second half of 2008. Chinalco and Rio Tinto have agreed to consider a number of future opportunities including the potential for joint participation and future expansions of Hamersley Iron's production and consideration of how best to jointly participate in the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.</p>
          <p>In addition, Rio Tinto and Chinalco will form a jointly owned sales company, managed by Rio Tinto iron ore to market 30% of Hamersley Iron output in China. Rio Tinto will be the ultimate marketer of this product on behalf of this company similar and consistent with the approach used in our other joint ventures in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>Chinalco's assistance to market Hamersley Iron ore product into China strengthens Rio Tinto's already strong iron ore position enormously. Chinalco is investing in 100%-owned assets of Hamersley Iron, which include in addition to the mines, our two ports and associated rail infrastructure. These are core elements at the Hamersley operations in WA, and will create a completely new joint venture. It is important to recognize this joint venture sits outside of the other Rio Tinto iron ore joint ventures in the Pilbara, such as Hope Downs, Channar, and Robe River.</p>
          <p>We know how to manage joint ventures and have decades of experience in running joint ventures with competitors, as well as our Japanese and Chinese customers. This is an established part of the mining industry and has always been a source of funds for future mineral development.</p>
          <p>Now let's close by recapping the core benefits of the proposed transaction. First, it raises capital at a substantial premium to current market valuations. Guy will go into this in more detail in a minute, but I'd note at this point that there are several aspects at the Board for asset level investments and the convertible bonds that are demonstrably favorable. Particularly when considered in light of current economic conditions and the avenue being used by almost all others to raise capital. I believe, this demonstrates the optionality, the suite of Tier 1 assets can give a company both in good times and in bad.</p>
          <p>Second, Chinalco's cash investments eliminates near-term uncertainty regarding Rio Tinto's financial position by greatly strengthening our balance sheet. We are proceeding with our previously announced non-core asset divestment program at a pace which provides best value for Rio Tinto's shareholders.</p>
          <p>Third, the transaction provides Rio Tinto with the flexibility to undertake investments throughout the cycle. And as far as today's announcement, we can confirm that the Yarwun, Kestrel and Clermont expansions will proceed, and work will commence to facilitate an expansion in Hail Creek. In addition, we are continuing preparatory activities in respect to Pilbara 320, but we do need to wait for some meaningful and credible signs of economic recovery. Above and beyond these specific announcements, we have restored our ability to pursue opportunities as they arise. This transaction will alleviate about 2,000 job reductions, including project &#x2013; contractors and projects in Australia, which would otherwise have been difficult to advance.</p>
          <p>Finally, as I have explained this transaction creates a strategic partnership with an unparalleled ability to benefit from emerging industry trends. This is about long-term strategy. We were also able to point to several tangible examples today. We have agreed to jointly pursue possible exploration opportunities in China, and jointly consider how Simandou might be best developed. Further China's &#x2013; Chinalco's relationship within China have already facilitated the introduction of key Rio Tinto executives to Chinese policy banks, which may lead to further access to Chinese funding.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to now turn over to Guy in Australia, who'll run through some of the metrics for the transaction.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. When entering a transaction like this, the Board has to weigh out all comparable alternatives, and this we've done in considerable detail. A large number of options have been reviewed and value has always remained the paramount consideration for the Board in reaching its conclusions.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've concluded that this package from Chinalco, given its scale, valuation premium and strategic benefits, represents the most value creating means for the Group to meet its financial commitments. We've talked a lot today about the generation of US$19.5 billion in cash for Rio Tinto's shareholders through this transaction. But I'd like to explore with you some of the quantitative metrics which demonstrate why we concluded this transaction was in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I should highlight at the outset that quantitative comparisons during a time of severely dislocated debt and equity markets needs to be made with due caution. With this in mind, the overall transaction can best be broken down into three components, which can be compared quite readily to objective external data. The prices achieved in relation to asset investments, the price premium at which the convertible bonds convert, and the coupon rate payable on the convertible bonds.</p>
          <p>In each case, we believe that the outcome achieved is a favorable result, particularly given the context in which this transaction takes place. This reflects both Chinalco's recognition of the quality of Rio Tinto's assets and its confidence in the Group's prospects.</p>
          <p>The parties negotiated an agreement for Chinalco to invest in a number of assets for proceeds totaling $12.3 billion. In order to provide transparency on the value inherent in this transaction, we are providing an asset-by-asset breakdown of the value as shown here. This will enable you to undertake a rigorous analysis of the transaction fundamentals. We believe that these valuations speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>This transaction is the best overall package for shareholders for three key reasons. Firstly, the commercial terms of the transaction, both in the asset sales and the convertible bonds represent premium value.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the proceeds of the $19.5 billion completely meet Rio Tinto's financial obligations over the next two years. While the sum may appear large, it definitely removes &#x2013; it definitively removes any financial concerns that may arise should the downturn turn out to be more protracted.</p>
          <p>Finally, the transaction restores flexibility to the Group, by allowing us to invest through the cycle and it provides strategic benefits in the form of a deep relationship with a key player in our largest market.</p>
          <p>Chinalco's investments in the commodity joint ventures are at a premium to current implied asset values as measured by Rio Tinto's enterprise value. Simply put, Chinalco has paid 18% of Rio Tinto's current market enterprise value for an 8% share of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>These numbers are based on second half 2008 earnings and market enterprise value is calculated using share prices on the 30th of January, 2009, prior to our release disclosing that we are in discussion with Chinalco. This represents a premium of 124% to our current market enterprise value.</p>
          <p>On the same basis of calculation, the premium to market capitalization is 287%. The equivalent share price implied by the investments in the assets is &#xA3;58 or A$163 per share.</p>
          <p>Now the next slide presents a number of details regarding the convertible bonds. Rio Tinto plans to issue two tranches of subordinated convertible bonds totaling $7.2 billion. The first tranche convertible at $45 per share will contribute $3.1 billion in funds, while the second tranche convertible at $60 per share will contribute $4.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The coupon is 9% for bonds issued out of PLC and 9.5% for bonds issued out of limited. The bonds are subordinated to other Rio Tinto debt and carry no voting rights until conversion. The bonds have been structured with the aim of achieving 50% equity credit from the rating agencies.</p>
          <p>Standard &amp; Poor's has indicated, subject to satisfactory final documents and the amount to be issued relative to the capital of the Group, that the bonds would be eligible for intermediate or 50% equity credit. The amount of equity credit is, of course, subject to final conformation by the agencies.</p>
          <p>The bonds mature after six years with an option after seven years for Rio Tinto to redeem the bond. After this time, Rio Tinto has the flexibility to refinance the bond to take advantage of credit market conditions. Chinalco has the right to convert the bonds at any time. If fully converted, Chinalco's interest in Rio Tinto will increase from the current 9.3% to 18%. Chinalco's interest in Rio Tinto Limited will be 14.9% and in Rio Tinto Plc 19%.</p>
          <p>Now regardless of whether you are considering Plc or Limited, the conversion premium secured in respect of the convertible bonds that Rio Tinto proposes to issue in respect to this transaction are very high. Based on Rio Tinto's share prices on the 30th of January, as I said in the last trading day prior to our announcement that we were in discussions with Chinalco, that conversion premium secured range from a low of 68% to a high of 176% above the share price. Based on the historical records that we've been able to find, this is very favorable. As a result, this premium can be seen as a strong signal regarding Chinalco's confidence in the valuation potential of Rio Tinto's assets and prospects.</p>
          <p>Given the size of the convertible note proposed to be issued to Chinalco, the fact that it's subordinated to all other Group debt and the attractive terms of the issue, one could quite reasonably expect the coupon to be priced very substantially higher than the current BBB senior corporate bond deal of around 8.5%.</p>
          <p>Comparable securities issued recently have had higher coupons coupled with much lower conversion prices relative to market. Of course, those of you who are familiar with the state of the corporate bond markets at the moment would be aware that an issue of this size would be unlikely, if not impossible, to perform. The convertible bonds represent very competitive financing terms for Rio Tinto, particularly in current markets and given their subordination.</p>
          <p>As it's customary in this type of transaction, we've agreed a break fee of 1%, which will become payable if the Board changed its recommendation that shareholders should approve this transaction.</p>
          <p>There's also an exclusivity arrangement in which both parties have agreed not to solicit competing third-party proposals prior to completion. These are inline with market practice and sound fiduciary principles.</p>
          <p>There are a number of preconditions before the proposed transaction can close. These are the following. First of all, Rio Tinto's shareholders must approve the transaction. This is through a joint electorate vote of Rio Tinto Plc and Limited shareholders at which a simple majority vote in favor must be achieved.</p>
          <p>Secondly, government approvals must be secured including foreign investment reviews as appropriate. Rio Tinto has already begun a cooperative process to ensure that these reviews occur in an open, efficient, and timely basis.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, Chinalco must finalize their own financing arrangements, which they must have committed to do by the 31st of March 2009. We would anticipate closing the transaction late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand you back to Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much indeed. Before I just finally recap the benefits of this proposed transaction, I want to speak very briefly about the benefits of the partnership for those countries in which we currently operate and those which we will operate in future.</p>
          <p>The proposed alliance sets the platform for relationships with China for the both broader and deeper than today. We feel this partnership will provide examples for others who seek investment and trade relationships with Chinese firms, not only in the resources sector, but in the commercial world more generally.</p>
          <p>The partnership also represents a very strong link to potential resource sector funding. It introduces a new source of capital at a time when investment capital from traditional partners is scarce. In this way, our stakeholder countries will be able to benefit from continued reinvestment throughout the cycle, and in turn, from greater economic growth in the next upswing.</p>
          <p>We believe access and insight to the Chinese market will assist our stakeholder countries to retain their global market share of resource production. Every new customer Rio Tinto supplies, generates wealth not only for our shareholders, but for the countries in which we operate. Similarly, it increases the potential for firms to work more closely with Chinese firms on joint initiatives of common interest, clean coal, for example, would be something to think of in those terms.</p>
          <p>In summary then, you have seen the proposed transaction delivers a comprehensive package of benefits reaffirming Rio Tinto's strength and potential. It strengthens our balance sheet. It gives us the flexibility to understand high value strategic growth at all points of the cycle. And it positions us at the forefront of industry trends involving China and the developing world.</p>
          <p>President Xiao said to you that in Chinalco we found an excellent partner, and your investment is a clear vote of confidence in our company's strength, growth prospects and outlook. We expect to be able to execute the transaction within the timeframe that is reasonable for all stakeholders. We will, of course, be asking for the approval of both our Plc and Limited shareholders, who will receive the Board's strong and unanimous recommendation.</p>
          <p>So at this point, thank you. And we'll start some question and answers. Nigel Jones, who is head of Investor Relations is going to coordinate this given that we have people coming from different places, and Nigel, we'll ask you to manage the flow of questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start off with people in this auditorium. I can see questions at back. If you just gave your name and institution please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks, Nigel. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Two questions; one is quite simple, would you be doing this transaction if you weren't so &#x2013; if your balance sheet wasn't so distressed? And the second question probably for Guy, can &#x2013; for the assets under consideration, can he just articulate which ones will be that Chinalco will take an equity stake in, and which ones will have a strategic alliance note associated with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the why-now, clearly this proposition does a number of things. It deals with the financing challenges the company has had, but it is I think on a look forward basis a great source of economic opportunity and value creation.</p>
          <p>We have been engaged over quite a lot long period in discussion with our friends from Chinalco, and we are attracted to this opportunity as much by what it will do to create future value as it's doing to deal with financing challenges. So, it's something which in its aggregate deals I think very well with all the issues.</p>
          <p>So I think even if we were not in a position of having to address balance sheet issues, the fact that we are moving through a period, which could not quite a long time of major economic challenge in the world, the idea of striking such a partnership at this time is very appealing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second part of the question is -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was referred back to Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to go through the whole list, and maybe I could come back to you on it, but I mean substantially we're looking at let us talk type transactions in the Hamersley and the Escondida case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Andrew Keen from Sanford Bernstein. Just two questions; basically, why this size, I mean, you're going to take out a couple of these old debt tranches in addition to capital cash flow that will probably take out another year. So you're going to take out three quarters of your debt load.</p>
          <p>Is this your view of the cycle or was it this size or nothing in terms of the offer by Chinalco. And just in terms of the iron ore sales company, they've taken 15% of the asset, your 30% is going into a JV sales company. Why the difference there? And if it's commercially separate, what bother doing a sales company at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Maybe, Andrew, I'll tackle both those questions. We recognized in our commitment in December 10, that a $10 billion debt payment would address the financial challenges in 2009. I think we've had quite active engagement with economists and also our shareholders recognizing that there is considerable economic uncertainty out there in the world and we could be in for two years of rough water in these markets.</p>
          <p>We'd hope that things will improve before that, but it's &#x2013; it is very realistic in the uncertainty in the market, and the fact that there could be other shocks coming, hopefully there won't be in the financial sector, that we still have some rough water. This transaction provides us with the flexibility and provides us with the ability to see through roughly two years of any reasonable person's downside scenario.</p>
          <p>On the iron ore sales, again this is consistent with the joint ventures that we've had, and we've worked with for a long period of time, literally decades. The 30% number means that 30% of the Hamersley material will be going into &#x2013; roughly into the Chinese steel sector. That compares with the current statistic, which is 56% of the Hamersley business going into that Chinese sales sector. So I think, this is &#x2013; it is more than adequate headroom in terms of the amount of iron ore produced within the Hamersley business &#x2013; the Hamersley iron ore business for the Chinese sales sector. Again we would hope that over time the relationship with Chinalco will bring new customers into the Hamersley fold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question here. Yes, Tobias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Three questions if I may, please. Firstly, I should know, but what is the threshold for the vote for your shareholders to approve of this deal. Secondly, within the minority disposals, will there be once the deal is closed any preemption rights by Chinalco to actually when Rio Tinto was to be approached in the future to take advantage of that situation? And then just lastly, with regard to your disposal targets, you mentioned before and the non-core assets you still have from Alcan, where do we stand there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think, first of all &#x2013; I think, Guy said this. Correct me if I'm wrong, Guy, that the threshold for the vote would have been a majority, 50% plus one.</p>
          <p>The second within the minority interest, what are the preemptive rights? The only case, where Chinalco has preemptive rights would be in Yarwun; for everything else, there are no preemptive rights.</p>
          <p>And then finally with respect to disposals, and maybe, Guy, if you want to say anything more about this, I will say that the businesses we've talked about particularly the downstream aluminium businesses, they're not strategic within the Rio Tinto suit of assets. We would see ourselves continuing with those and possibly some others, but maybe Guy, if you want to say anything more on disposals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are continuing with the preexisting, pre-announced disposals that we made &#x2013; we listed back at the end of 2007. In December of last year, we said that we were looking at other disposals. Of course, we are making some today, although they are disposals of interest rather than disposals of businesses.</p>
          <p>I think, the Chinalco transaction gives us the flexibility to be much more demanding, and maybe not to sell any other businesses. Although the process of examining whether we should sell a core asset is something that we do constantly. So I think, the key point to make is, we have finished the disposal of the downstream aluminium businesses and probably some others, but we don't have to do that in such a rush.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy. Maybe, I'd just close, Tobias, with just a point that two months ago, we announced that we were expanding a list of disposal opportunities, and it's fair to say, we had very active discussions with all of the major players in the sector. The Vale transaction we announced two weeks ago would have emanated from that active interest. So, we've now been two months into that expanded list. I think we've got a pretty good flavor for interest out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Nick Hatch from ING. And I've three questions if I may. I hear what you say about the valuation on the assets, but can I ask why you don't think it's suitable to invite all of your shareholders to participate for helping to bring the debt down?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I should've done the math, but I haven't, I am sure Guy has. Your gearing at the end of '08 was 63% following the write-downs. If you treat the bond as 100% debt or as a debt equity hybrid, what happens to that gearing? And what is your current feeling on the optimum level of gearing? And thirdly in terms of the assets being sold, you're selling a higher proportion in terms of earnings of copper; does that imply anything about any shift in your view of the strategic benefits of various portions of your group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, let Guy take the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the third one though on copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. Guy, do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the first question, I mean, as I've said, we looked at all the options that we had worked on and created in recent times. And one of them included a rights issue, where we would appeal to our &#x2013; all our shareholders to contribute to the company. And when we evaluated all those options, we did conclude that the Chinalco transaction stood head and shoulders above the others.</p>
          <p>And the reason for that mainly was its comprehensive nature. The premium values that we attained for the assets that we were selling. The premium values that we retained &#x2013; we attained through the convertible. And we contrasted that with the big discount that would apply in the event that we did a rights issue. So I think that when we look at the scale and the value attributes, it was very clear, when you then also combine the strategic attributes that Chinalco offered the best option to us.</p>
          <p>On your second question, I haven't done the numbers, and I probably should have done on what it will do to gearing. Clearly, it will substantially reduce it in respect of the asset sales. I think that it is important to understand that this bond does have many equity characteristics, and it is at the very least a substantial terming out of our obligations. As to what our long-term gearing rate should be, there was a time three or four years ago when people said that the company was &#x2013; had too strong a balance sheet. Now that certainly wouldn't be said today. I think that what we are looking for and have obtained through the Chinalco transaction is flexibility, and that's something that which we do attribute some value to. And it is for that reason that the Board's target of attaining a single A debt rating remains in place. Now we've got a bit of work to do to get to that point, but what it tells you is that we will still be working on reducing the level of debt.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally on the copper question, just due to the importance of KUC and our interest in Escondida in the overall &#x2013; our overall copper portfolio, I think, it just by its &#x2013; the math will lead it to a higher EBITDA percentage. But that &#x2013; no way does that diminish my appetite for copper. I think, we will continue to pursue a number of copper development opportunities, including brownfields, expansions within the businesses that are within the relationship with Chinalco, including moving ahead with La Granja, hopefully bringing the other Peruvian assets, La Granja into that. But I'd say from my perspective, I have an appetite for additional copper opportunities elsewhere from a global perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Warren Edney, ABN AMRO. Can you give us some idea of whether there is any tax impact or stamp duty issues with the asset sales? And also in terms of the strategic alliances, are they across all assets within those particular groups or only just the ones related to the transaction itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, shall I take those questions. I mean, there is &#x2013; there are relatively low to very small tax attributes to this transaction as it happens. We've structured it carefully, of course, and appropriately so that that is the case. On the strategic alliances, it's very important to understand that the governance of these joint ventures has been most carefully constructed so that control does not pass, but that appropriate minority protections are given. And those minority protections apply solely to the assets in which Chinalco is investing, and they do not apply more widely. Next question please. You are very quiet today. There is one in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can I ask a question to Chinalco, please? Peter Harris from JF Capital Partners. Part of the rationale for BHP's bid for Rio was the cost synergies in the iron ore businesses. If the iron ore was marketed separately, would you contemplate a merger of the two businesses to try and capture some of those cost synergies?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think that's a fair question &#x2013; a fair comment. First of all, let me say we are very impressed by the low cost nature of the assets that we are involved in, we're investing in in Rio Tinto. And secondly, let me say that I have a very optimistic view in terms of the long-term prospects of the sector, including the potential to further reduce cost in the current portfolio. Thank you.</p>

          <p>It's Peter Wetherall from Wallara Asset Management. I noticed this $500 million going into a joint development fund and saw a bit of commentary in the release. So could you give a little bit more detail as to how that will work in particular. What's the process for deciding which projects will go into that development fund, which &#x2013; is it a geographical base, just whatever the framework that's going to govern how that fund works in future?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Guy, I will start off, but if you've any comments, feel free to supplement. Again we've recognized the importance was to look at the aggregate of the transaction, the full size, the 19.5 recognized, and the bulk of the value would have been in the existing operating assets. But there is a longer-term intent to create synergistic opportunities on development. So what we wanted to do was to again get to our shareholders, get to the market as soon as we could with the full details and the full transparency of the transaction. And that gives both sets of teams time to work out what are those development opportunities and certainly they would be of more than fair value from a Rio Tinto shareholder perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Nigel, and we have a question over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Glyn Lawcock with UBS. I've just got two questions. Firstly, I understand your rationale. I don't quite understand the rationale for using EBIT, EBITDA to say it was a high premium sale. I mean, your EBITDA multiple is severely depressed because of your debt. You've always used NPV. If I look at previous sales of your last five transactions, they have been done at probably against market NPVs twice times &#x2013; two times. This one looks like against what most people have in the market, maybe a 20% premium. I would have thought why not just if you're prepared to sell what I would consider Tier 1 assets, why didn't you just do an auction for 15% of Hamersley, your half share in Escondida? I'm sure you would have got a much better price than perhaps what you would have got now you're showing us today. The second question is, and no one has asked it and I guess I will, is obviously the Board is unanimous now, but there was an issue literally a week ago. I'd wonder if you could make any comment on that as well, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I deal with Glyn's second question. I mean look, these are very big issues, and very big choices. It would not be at all surprising to expect in a Board like ours, we would have a very full discussion before reaching a landing point. We reached a landing point and it was one of clear unanimity. There was only one person who started that journey, who felt he couldn't come to the point of alignment with the rest of the Board, which created, of course, an untenable situation. So he tendered his resignation, which was unanimously accepted by the Board.</p>
          <p>It was a surprise. It was a disappointment, but we are very much in Rio Tinto, a consensual Board, in the &#x2013; certainly in the 5.5 years that I've been chairing that Board through Alcan, through the various BHP issues, we have never been other than unanimous. That is our position today. For somebody to arrive, express a view, which is completely discordant with others is inevitably going to produce that result. But we move on, and I'm personally committed to ensure that the process that we are describing to you today reaches a point of positive conclusion and that we plan properly for the next succession.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glyn, maybe I will start off with your EBITDA versus cash, and maybe Guy if you want to supplement that. But, yeah, I think that whether you look at it on an EBITDA basis or a cash basis, and again recognizing there are &#x2013; so we've got so much price volatility over the past six months, there are quite a few views on prices. I think under virtually any view of prices that I have seen this is a strong premium including a forward view of long-term prices.</p>
          <p>And I will also say that again we've been &#x2013; we've &#x2013; since the 10th of December had no shortage of expressions of interest, and in some cases some serious discussions with the major players about what would be seen as their idea of value in individual assets. And I can very clearly say with the ones you are referring to that the broad economics, the broad package of the Chinalco proposal is vastly superior to what we've seen.</p>
          <p>But Guy, if you want to talk about EBITDA versus cash flow multiples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Glyn, of course you are right that NPV is the primary metric, which we use when we look at assets and investments and for that matter divestments. As you know, we also look at the metrics, which we described to the investment community a few months ago, which encompasses different outlooks for price and different views of resource conversion into reserves.</p>
          <p>I'm not saying that when we look at the prices that we have been offered by Chinalco for these assets, they compare well when we look at that metrics with our own internal net present values for most of these assets. In addition to that, you need to consider a couple of other factors. This is a package, it's not just the asset sales. It's also the convertible. The whole thing comes together. And we think that taken together, this is a compelling combination.</p>
          <p>The other factor, I'd just leave with you to think about it is that these are minority stakes, no control premium has been paid for these minority stakes and the NPVs may &#x2013; you might think the NPVs that are calculated by the market do contain a control premium, because they are valued for 100% of each of the assets. So I think when you come to consider all those factors, the package, the position in the metrics, and the fact the control hasn't passed, you can see that actually this is a compelling value proposition.</p>

          <p>Next question in Sydney.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Brendan Harris from Macquarie Bank. Sort of ties in with Glyn's questions, I guess, is Escondida for instance an area I am particularly interested in EBITDA or one of those metrics is being completely squeezed by provisional pricing and loss on copper contracts in the period, so it's probably not a good guide to the future. But I'm more interested in what you view is on the exploration outside of that asset, particularly in the context of the recent drilling results, and how do you actually value that over and above the existing operation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brendan, I'll tackle that. Of course in the second half of last year, Escondida was negatively impacted by operating problems, particularly the mill problems. It was impacted by provisional pricing just because the market pricing took the concentrating process, and also some severe hedge losses and that all brought those numbers down.</p>
          <p>So we do have to look also at that matter on an NPV basis in addition to on an EBITDA basis, and certainly there is a lot of value in Escondida. It's one of the premier copper assets. And I think the valuations and what Chinalco has provided recognizes that and certainly from my perspective, I do think that that is more than a fair price on Escondida looking at it either on an EBITDA or an NPV basis, including the exploration potential of Pampa Escondida.</p>
          <p>I can remember four years ago, with Marius being there, and I think, both Marius and I agreed we need to do some more drilling on Escondida. There was more potential there. And I'm very pleased to see the exploration results that they have generated over the past two years. The good exploration effort out there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason Fairclough from Merrill Lynch. I have a question for President Xiao, if I may. Could you discuss the current economics of aluminum production in China, and did you consider an investment into Rio Tinto's Alcan assets, and if not, why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the first question, total size of the aluminum sector in China is still growing pretty fast. We have some oversupply right now. That's why we are seeing pretty low prices last December. But the good thing is actually prices are coming back this year. We are seeing somewhere between 15 to 20% rise from the bottom.</p>
          <p>There is a unique nature in the power sector in China, which is cost of power comes down when we move from the eastern coastal region to the inward western regions &#x2013; to the inland western regions. So we are seeing a migration of supply of aluminium. Also away from the coastal regions and into the inland regions.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I am very optimistic about the demand for aluminium products, especially when the economy comes back in the near future. We had an excellent year actually in 2007 with 39% growth in production and 43% growth in sales. We don't expect to see something as spectacular as that any time soon, but I am confident that this sector as a whole will maintain a growth rate twice as much as the GDP growth rate.</p>
          <p>Answer to the second question is very simple. Rio Tinto doesn't want to sell. Otherwise we would very much like to invest. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Production of primary aluminium is still loss making now. The average cost per tonne is RMB13,000, whereas the price is slightly below 12,000 right now.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason I may as well add one point based on our analysis of the Chinese smelting situation. With the downturn in China, we have seen power generating capacity move surprisingly quickly from being in deficit before the Olympics to being in surplus now, so I think that you've seen that having some effect on power rates, and that's probably had some effect on bringing down the cost of smelting capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're going to just take one more question in this session. Sam?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam Catalano from Macquarie. Two questions; first given your newfound flexibility assuming the deal is approved, and if you do like further asset sales, will Rio Tinto become acquisitive with that flexibility? And secondly, has your view of the long-term pricing changed in the last six months and particularly since the BHP Billiton bid was rescinded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I may comment on both of those. I'll put this into personal context. My first call of the day today was with our senior managers in Australia, and I'll finish it off with call with our senior managers in Western Hemisphere this evening. I'd say to everyone just because we've announced this deal today doesn't mean that the checkbooks are open.</p>
          <p>They've got to keep the capital down. They've got to keep the operating cost reductions in place. We are in two years at very difficult economic times and we have to be very tight in all capital spending and all operating spending in this period of time. I think in terms of the long-term view of prices and how that may have evolved over the past six months, in many ways that is still a work in progress, because what we are seeing is a change in many of the input costs and as you know our long term &#x2013; our fundamental approach to long-term price formation is based upon margins over long-term costs.</p>
          <p>So what we've got to do is we got to see how this economic period of difficulty has an effect on long-term costs. Clearly oil price is an example; everyone had a view that the long-term price of oil was much higher than it would be today and that would flow through long-term cost structures and long-term price formation. So I think we just have to see how the volatility in the market plays out over the next year or two, and I suspect that the longer we see a downturn, the more it will drive down long-term cost inputs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Tom. I think, if we may, we're going to pause this session now. You'd be aware that we obviously have our annual results coming up in a few minutes.

    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome back to the second part of our presentation today, which covers our 2008 results.</p>
          <p>2008 was, I think we all appreciate, a year of two very different parts; starting with a continuation of strong demand and prices, but finishing with &#x2013; particularly in the last quarter, with a rapid slide in prices, given by the collapse in global economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the results we announced today reflect strong operational performance underpinned by strong demand and pricing until the third quarter of the year. Underlying earnings set another record, an uplift of 38% to $10.3 billion. The percentage increase in EBITDA was 60%.</p>
          <p>However, net earnings declined 50% reflecting an impairment charge, the great majority of which related to Alcan goodwill and the downstream assets in the Alcan package.</p>
          <p>But notwithstanding current aluminium market weakness, we remain convinced that the addition of the Alcan assets to our portfolio and their integration into Rio Tinto will be a source of long-term value for the company.</p>
          <p>The combined assets of Rio Tinto Alcan provide aluminium industry leadership based on bauxite reserves and resources, a competitive refining capability and low cost smelting supported, of course, by hydropower, which will be increasingly valuable in a carbon constrained world.</p>
          <p>Synergies are ahead of target and our expectation remains to deliver $1.1 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>Last year, we invested a record of $8.5 billion in capital projects, which will position us well when the recovery comes. While our growth options are a valuable long-term asset, we are acting decisively in response to weak market conditions to reduce capital expenditures in 2009, and to drive operating cost reductions across our business.</p>
          <p>Finally, as part of our commitment to reduce net debt by $10 billion in this year, 2009, we've decided to maintain the full 2008 dividend &#x2013; the 2008 full year dividend at the 2007 level at $1.36 per share and our progressive dividend policy remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>After strong market conditions for most of 2008, the fourth quarter saw a rapid decline in the demand for and the prices of most of our principal products. And metal markets have entered 2009 at their lowest pricing level for several years with poor near-term demand prospects and high inventories.</p>
          <p>A number of governments, as we know, are using a range of fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate activity, but our view is that there's likely to be a delay, which perhaps could be extended, before these measures have any impact on stabilizing the demand for commodities.</p>
          <p>The slowdown in OECD economies is likely to endure due to the consumer and government debt burdens and constrained credit market conditions. But we do believe that the recovery in Chinese economic activity will come through in response to the substantial stimulus package of RMB4 trillion announced by the government.</p>
          <p>Opinions vary on the underlying risks and the likely success of government support measures, and there is clearly uncertainty over the pattern of economic activity over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>Commodity producers, we included, have responded quickly to weak demand and pricing conditions, and constrained access to credit. Many mining projects have been abandoned or delayed, and this may provide support for prices in the longer term.</p>
          <p>We expect China's long-term growth to continue as a major driver of demand. Per capita metals consumption in China and other emerging economies remains materially below the level in developed economies, suggesting scope for significant incremental demand over an extended period once the current period of severe cyclical adjustment comes to an end.</p>
          <p>We believe that the fundamentals of the Chinese market and other fast-growing markets like India remain intact, and that the industry's long-term prospects remain positive. We are focused on the future to ensure we are best positioned for the upturn when it comes.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we put important building blocks in place with major development projects, testing technology for automated mines and renewing our organizational structure to maximize the benefits of standardized and shared management approaches.</p>
          <p>And with that introduction, Tom, I'd like to turn it over to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Safety is a core as you've heard in the past of Rio Tinto's businesses as a value and a key indicator of management performance. In 2008, we integrated the Alcan safety data with those of Rio Tinto and this led to an overall lost time injury frequency rate and all injury frequency rate to be rebased at a slightly higher level.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to say in 2008, since integrating the safety data, the downward trajectory for our safety rate has continued for the Group as a whole and our safety record, as measured by both all injury frequency rate and lost time injury frequency rate, is improving. We resolve to continue this improvement trend that Rio Tinto has established over many, many years.</p>
          <p>These are industry leading safety data. However, we cannot be complacent. We had 18 fatalities this year, including 10 at a terrible helicopter tragedy in Peru earlier in the year. Most of these fatalities were contractors and we're working hard to drive improvement in our contractor management systems. Overall, we are committed to working toward a working environment with zero harm.</p>
          <p>In the second half of this year, we've seen an unprecedented global economic downturn resulting in a rapid decline in the price environment for our products. We do not know when these conditions will improve and we need to be prepared for two years of economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p>In this context, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to reduce our net debt by $10 billion by the end of 2009. Of course, the announcement today of our transaction with Chinalco will over-deliver against our $10 billion debt reduction target. This transaction is the best financial solution for the Group with additional long-term business benefits.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, we have been taking active measures since the 10th of December to address our financial position. We're reducing operating expenditures by 2.5 billion in 2010, reducing global head count by 14,000, deferring and canceling projects, thereby reducing capital expenditure in 2009 to approximately $4 billion. These decisions were difficult and the actions even more difficult, but necessary in the current economic climate.</p>
          <p>We've made good progress since December on these fronts in a short period of time. We've already achieved over 40% of our global head count reduction target with more on the way, and we've completed a full review of our capital projects. And just in January, we were successful in divesting $1.7 billion of assets, including the Corumb&#xE1; iron ore project in Brazil, our potash assets in Argentina and Canada, and the Ningxia aluminium smelter in China.</p>
          <p>We have acted early, we have acted decisively and swiftly to ensure that we are well placed to operate in the challenging markets that we currently face. The actions, together with the Chinalco deal, will strengthen our balance sheet, maximize cash generation and give us greater flexibility, enabling us to be well positioned to resume growth programs when we see improvements in underlying demand trends.</p>
          <p>Since our announcement on the 10th of December, we've completed a thorough review of our projects and either slowed or deferred most of them down. Projects that are currently expected to continue include projects that will be completed in the fourth quarter &#x2013; in the first quarter of 2009, such as Hope Down Stage 2 and QMM, who are necessary to sustain production levels such as Mesa A and Brockman 4, both in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>The transaction with Chinalco will allow us to pursue the development of some of the projects that were at the margin, including Clermont, Kestrel and Yarwun 2. We would not have been able to fund these attractive projects without the Chinalco solution.</p>
          <p>The Argyle and Diavik underground expansions will continue, albeit at a much slower rate, which will delay production startup when they are ready to go.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that for all of our projects, we will continue to retain maximum flexibility to bring them back on stream. Of course, we'll use this time to see if we can optimize project design, revisit the costs and reduce further CapEx requirements.</p>
          <p>Turning now to individual businesses; in our Iron Ore group in 2008, we set records across the board. Underlying earnings for the year was 126% supported by higher prices and higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Early in 2008, we committed to selling 15 million tonnes on a spot-pricing basis. And we are happy to say that we met that commitment with much of this material, most of this material being sold in the first three quarters when the differential between spot and contract prices was at its highest levels.</p>
          <p>Production did ramp up during the first three quarters of the year, but was impacted during the latter months by reduced customer demand and reduced shipments as the global economic shutdown and slowdown impacted global demand, and certainly impacted steel production. As a result, we reduced production run rates in November, as announced, to align with current customer delivery requirements.</p>
          <p>With the completion of the Cape Lambert expansion to 80 million tonnes, the Pilbara infrastructure has reached an important milestone with a total shipping capacity of 220 million tonnes. These projects were completed on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we were able to rebuild iron ore stockpiles to appropriate levels. Current stockpiles and the availability of additional capacity has created a position of flexibility to respond to improvements in market conditions.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our Group-wide guidance for capital expenditure in 2009, several iron ore projects have been deferred pending market improvement. Projects that currently plan to continue to include Hope Down Stage 2, which is expected to be completed later this quarter; the development of Mesa A and Brockman 4, which are required to sustain production near 220 million tonnes per year and the power station in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>Expenditures at Simandou have been scaled back. We remain in dialog with the Government of Guinea to resolve outstanding matters related to the concession area.</p>
          <p>Overall, iron ore is a core element of Rio Tinto's value proposition. Low cost operations with a structural infrastructure and location advantage, existing assets which are capable of expansion, global growth opportunities and a robust long-term demand outlook, these are ideally positioned to deliver substantial value to Rio Tinto shareholders.</p>
          <p>We've recently seen some improvement in the market as Chinese port iron ore inventories have declined more than 15 million tonnes since their peak in October and currently stand at just under 60 million tonnes. It is too early to claim though that the market or anything has turned, but this has provided some support to the spot price.</p>
          <p>With spare infrastructure capacity in our system given our recent investment program, we are well placed to restart our production growth when conditions resume.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to aluminum. Although certainly less than the first half, as one of the lowest cost producers in the sector, Rio Tinto Alcan had a positive contribution to EBITDA and underlying earnings in the second half of 2008, even if they're in the face of very challenging pricing conditions.</p>
          <p>Comparing the period on a period change in EBITDA margins, Rio Tinto Alcan outperformed its peers given the quality of our assets. And this is an example of the uniqueness and quality of the Rio Tinto Alcan assets.</p>
          <p>For the full year, earnings rose 87 million to $1.2 billion. Higher volumes from the inclusion of Alcan were partially offset by higher costs for caustic, coke and pitch and alloys. Our 185 million write-down of inventories to reflect realizable values at the end of the year and a write-off of evaluation costs, primarily related to Coega and at Ma'aden.</p>
          <p>Not included in underlying earnings were 7.9 billion of impairment charges related to the assets of Rio Tinto Alcan, and Guy will further provide details later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>The investment basis for the Alcan acquisition remains sound. Rio Tinto has a valuable set of assets in the aluminum industry and sources of competitive advantage in the form of massive Weipa bauxite resources and competitive refining in Australia matched with low cost, hydropower positions available to us in Canada, and, of course, supported by a proprietary and industry leading AP smelting technology. These assets will provide shareholder value over time.</p>
          <p>We continue to make substantial progress integrating the Alcan businesses. Following the first full year, we realized $585 million of in-period, after tax synergies, which is 39% ahead of target. As we've previously highlighted, the majorities of these are corporate in nature and appear outside the Rio Tinto Alcan earnings figure.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out we remain on track to deliver $1.1 billion of annual synergies after tax in 2010, well above our original estimate of $600 million.</p>
          <p>The Sohar smelter in Oman started up on time and on budget in June and proceeded on schedule with over 49,000 tonnes produced in 2008 on a 100% basis, and I was just told by Jacynthe on Monday of this week that the last part has come into production.</p>
          <p>We've taken rapid and decisive action against the current economic backdrop to reduce production by 11% from our highest cost operations. We've also begun to optimize and further streamline the organizational structure under the new leadership of Jacynthe Cote.</p>
          <p>Jacynthe is taking the necessary and difficult steps to reduce costs further to improve our relative cost position in very difficult markets. And these changes, while difficult, will position Rio Tinto Alcan to weather the current economic crisis and set it up to emerge stronger when conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Copper and Diamonds group; lower copper grades at Grasberg and Escondida and lower moly grades at Kennecott Utah Copper reduced earnings during the year with gold production being impacted as well as copper. Earnings were also impacted by operational and other difficulties at Escondida and scheduled shutdowns at the refinery and smelter at Kennecott Utah Copper.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter of 2008, the sector operated in an environment of rapidly declining copper and moly prices. And the impact of earnings and declining prices was compounded at Escondida by hedging losses and provisional pricing adjustments.</p>
          <p>We announced significant copper resources at Kennecott, at La Granja in Peru and Resolution in Arizona during the half, and major new nickel resources at Sulawesi in Indonesia. However, as you can imagine in the current environment, we've reduced spending on all non-essential work, but at low level, investment continues to progress local stakeholder engagement and local project studies.</p>
          <p>Negotiations continue with the Mongolian Government to secure an investment agreement for the Oyu Tolgoi copper gold project. A session of Parliament is expected to be held in February where the working group is expected to present its recommendations.</p>
          <p>Turning to diamonds; with the reduction of consumer spending in the latter part of 2008, particularly impacting sales of luxury jewelry, results were lower due to lower returns.</p>
          <p>The underground development projects at Diavik and Argyle are well advanced and progressed well through 2008. However, we've announced that both projects will be substantially slowed resulting in a delay in the startup in production.</p>
          <p>Our Copper group comprises some of the world's very low cost, large-scale assets that have continued to provide good returns through all parts of the cycle.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond the near term, the impact of the credit crunch and lower prices and the financing of new copper projects will play an important role in determining the shape of the copper price recovery. Global production expansion is likely to be delayed and with the strong set of existing assets in the suite of high quality projects, Rio Tinto will be well positioned to take advantage of this recovery.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Energy and Minerals; Energy and Minerals group had a very good year in 2008 with record earnings including a 600% increase in earnings in Rio Tinto Coal Australia. Substantially higher thermal and coking coal prices were the result of strong Asian demand coinciding with constrained supply for the eastern seaboard of Australia.</p>
          <p>We also continue to focus on increasing volumes of coking and semi-soft coal over thermal coal for most of the year to take advantage of higher relative prices. Of course, that's changed over the past few months.</p>
          <p>The uranium business saw the benefit of higher realized prices as old contracts continued to be replaced with newer contracts in this higher priced environment. Our uranium business looks especially attractive due to the increasing uncertainty of our production increases previously scheduled by some of our competitors.</p>
          <p>The Group's Queensland coal operations recovered well from the weather-related disruptions in the first quarter and we were able to take up additional port allocation in both Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
          <p>We were less affected than others by the first quarter rainfall. And this allowed us to see the benefits of higher contract coal prices in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Cutbacks in steel production are expected to reduce demand for metallurgical coals used in the production processes. The demand though for thermal coals remains relatively resilient and price levels have recently stabilized, although the outlook for coking coal is certainly more uncertain.</p>
          <p>The Clermont project remains on schedule to bring production on stream for early 2010 to replace production from Blair Athol, as it nears the end of its scheduled mine life.</p>
          <p>The Group's iron and titanium operations performed well in 2008 from higher volumes and higher prices reflecting strong global demand for these products from developing nations.</p>
          <p>In December, we produced the first ilmenite from our 750,000 tonne per year mineral sands project in Madagascar.</p>
          <p>This has been a landmark project for sustainable development and an excellent example of the delivery of a successful major Greenfield project in an emerging country.</p>
          <p>The Group's Energy and Mineral business is well positioned to benefit from strong markets in the future, as the number-two thermal coal producer in Australia and the U.S., the number-two uranium and borate producer worldwide and the number-one global producer of titanium dioxide feed stocks.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I believe it's now over to you, Guy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, again, Tom. Now let me start with an analysis of how we achieved record earnings in 2008. We have set this out using the usual waterfall chart format. Higher prices benefited earnings by $5 billion, as we experienced strong pricing for traded metals through the first three quarters of the year and, of course, large increases in the price of our bulk products in the first half. We've included a breakdown of the price variance as an appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>We experienced dramatic swings in currencies relative to the dollar during the year, but the effect on average exchange rates was not very significant, resulting in a benefit of $299 million. I'd like to remind you of the natural hedge between currency exchange rates and the movement in traded metal prices.</p>
          <p>The earnings variance attributable to volume increases was $233 million, reflecting, in particular, strong growth in iron ore and coal volumes, in addition to the impact of volumes from the inclusion of Alcan for the full year. This was partly offset by a grade-related decline in copper and molybdenum with gold volumes also being affected. Again, a breakdown of the volume variance is included as an appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs, inflation and energy prices reduced earnings by 336 million and 219 million respectively. Cash cost increases reduced earnings by $882 million. The increase in costs includes the impact of lower volumes on unit costs for copper, as we highlighted in the fourth quarter operations review, and rising input costs for supplies used in running our business. We're now starting to see a decline in input costs, albeit with a lag, with further benefits expected to come through in 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, there was some individual tax and other charges which reduced earnings collectively by $1.2 billion. The most significant item was a negative net interest cost variance of $765 million related to the Alcan acquisition debt. As well, there was a higher effective tax rate from the absence of the 2007 Canadian tax rate benefit. So this brings us eventually to the excellent annual earnings figure of $10.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our cash flow, the Group's cash flow from operations increased 64% to a record $28.7 billion. This reflects the strong cash generative capabilities of our assets, even under challenging economic conditions during the last quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flows were supported by record bulk prices and good markets for copper and aluminium for the first three quarters. These cash flows supported substantial net debt repayments and a significant capital expenditure program.</p>
          <p>As Tom has already mentioned, the changed economic environment has required us to reflect on each of our projects and we're committed to reducing capital expenditures to approximately $4 billion in 2009. We'll also be maintaining dividends for 2008 at $1.36 per share, consistent with our longstanding progressive dividend policy which has either held dividends flat, or increased them through all points through the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>These actions, along with the reduction in annual operating costs of $2.5 billion in 2010 and the continuation of an expanded divestment process, will enable us to continue generating strong cash flows to meet our commitments.</p>
          <p>The excellent cash flow from operations and divestments resulted in reducing net debt by 14% or $6.5 billion. Our commitment to reduce net debt by $10 billion by the end of 2009 remains fully in place.</p>
          <p>The sole covenant under the Alcan facilities is a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA of 4.5 times. In 2008, we comfortably met this covenant with a ratio of only 1.7 times. Although the use of our available facilities of $9.4 billion would not assist us with reducing our net debt by $10 billion, it nevertheless provides additional flexibility in meeting our commitments.</p>
          <p>We are not complacent regarding our debt position. With the recently announced operating costs and capital cost cuts, this year's divestments and, of course, the announcement today of the strategic partnership with Chinalco, we are over-delivering on our commitment to reduce net debt by $10 billion during 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to impairment charges; net earnings of $3.7 billion include an impairment charge of $8.4 billion, of which $7.9 billion relates to the Group's aluminium business. The acquisition price of Alcan anticipated significant growth in smelter and refinery capacity. But following the recent weakening in economic and market circumstances, many of these growth projects have been deferred.</p>
          <p>These deferrals, together with the weak economic environment and increases in input costs, have resulted in this impairment charge. Even though growth options contribute limited value in assessing the level of impairment under accounting standards, let me reassure you that our view remains that Rio Tinto will extract significant value from these options in the longer term.</p>
          <p>The weakening economic circumstances also resulted in impairments of other assets and the majority of those related to high smelter and Diavik.</p>
          <p>On divestments, during 2008, we achieved divestments of $3 billion with the sales of our interests in Cortez, Greens Creek and the Kintyre uranium asset.</p>
          <p>In December 2008, we announced our intention to expand the scope of assets targeted for divestment. And in just two months, we've made good progress with divestments totaling $1.7 billion from the sale of Corumb&#xE1;, our potash assets, and Ningxia aluminium smelter in China.</p>
          <p>The prices achieved for these assets definitely represent full value, and they demonstrate the depth and quality of our asset portfolio. They also illustrate our ability to unlock value for shareholders, despite tough credit markets and economic conditions.</p>
          <p>We believe that the Chinalco transaction announced today continues this longstanding commitment to value. The asset values we're realizing in today's conditions are outstanding, and they would have been strong even before the downturn.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to our asset divestment program, but the Chinalco transaction allows us to be selective as we continue with the divestment of our non-core assets. As we've said previously, in all our divestments, we're determined that we will only enter into a transaction at the right price. Value remains our primary consideration.</p>
          <p>Now back to you, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy. So in conclusion, while the year has certainly ended on a different note from the beginning, overall the Group put in a strong performance. Underlying earnings were up 38% to a record 10.3 billion, underpinned by strong market conditions at least in the first nine months of 2008.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, the markets that we and everyone else operate in changed dramatically. We have adapted quickly to the rapid decline in our markets and our price, preserving value for shareholders by conserving cash flow and reducing levels of debt. We will not be complacent, and we will continue to diligently review our operations and take those necessary and appropriate actions where necessary.</p>
          <p>At no time have large-scale low-cost assets been more important. <mark type="inaudible" /> Tier 1 assets, product diversity and broad geographic spread of operations will continue to provide strong cash flows throughout the cycle.</p>
          <p>We will not limit our growth options. These options are being maintained by maintaining flexibility, enabling a quick response when there are positive signs of underlying demand for our products.</p>
          <p>The world economy has slowed much more rapidly than anyone would have expected in the middle of last year, and a sustained recovery is not expected in the near term. However, we do believe the fundamentals in the Chinese and other fast-growing markets, like India, remain intact and industry's long-term prospects remain positive.</p>
          <p>Despite these current challenging circumstances and conditions, the Group's strategy remains the same: to maximize shareholder value through excellence in mining and operating large-scale low-cost assets with an emphasis on quality. And this strategy will continue to be value generative for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you, and I'll take some questions. Nigel, if you want to step up here, that would be great.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's kick off here in the auditorium. And then &#x2013; first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Sam Catalano from Macquarie, again. Perhaps a question for Vivek. Just with regards to cost curves, clearly there we mentioned them coming down earlier. I guess which commodities would you see the sharpest decline in the cost curve and particularly the shape of that curve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Your question is which long run prices do I think will come down fastest. I'm not going to &#x2013; look I think what we'll probably find is that you'll see reductions in average costs across a whole range of sectors. And we're seeing those all the time across, for example, explosives, fuel costs, and then they just bring down the average for everyone.</p>
          <p>We will probably also see very big changes in costs which &#x2013; costs in industries which are very challenged at the moment. So, for example, with aluminium, we would expect to see the low cost &#x2013; the high cost smelters shut progressively over time, and therefore bring up the price so that we get something that's more consistent with a sustainable outcome. So there, the relationship between costs and prices might differ a bit. But every sector is a bit different; every cost curve is a bit different.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Charles Kernot from Evolution. Actually I had some questions perhaps a little bit more for Chinalco, but perhaps you can help to answer them. First relates just to the packaging business. Clearly packaging or downstream aluminium fabrication is an area in which they are interested. However, it's an area where the Chinese development is lagging behind where we are or where Alcan is. Was there any interest expressed in the packaging business by Chinalco? And what sort of discussions did you have on that?</p>
          <p>The second question relates, and I've had some experience on this in the past, to the difficulty in getting NDRC approval from the Chinese authorities, which I think is required to externalize finance. And, associated with that, why does the break fee only work one way? Wouldn't it be normal in this type of transaction for it to work both ways if Chinalco can't come up with the money on time? And I'll leave it at that time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll start with the NDRC point. I thought Guy, why don't you comment on the packaging, downstream and the break fee point?</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> both Paul and I within the past few weeks have met with senior officials of NDRC, and certainly I think there has been a constructive engagement between Chinalco and the NDRC, in terms of recognizing the importance NDRC has in the approval of any investment, foreign investment within China, and certainly Chinalco has expressed to us, and we've reaffirmed for ourselves, the NDRC is strongly in support of this. Guy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About packaging, in point of fact, Chinalco did not express much interest in that asset sale. So unfortunately, they didn't participate in the process which we've been running.</p>
          <p>And on the question of the break fee, I mean you understand that this is a package deal. There are all sorts of elements in which we've had to give here and take there. And one of the things that we did agree to give up was an attempt to secure a break fee in the other direction. But as Tom has said, while one can never be fully confident of these things, we do &#x2013; we have had some very reassuring statements made by a very senior Chinese official. So let's hope that that eventuality doesn't arise.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Nick Moore of RBS. Exploration is very much the future of a company, that's how it grows. We've heard earlier about this exploration initiative and you made a very good point that many of these new mineral resources are in emerging countries. With regard to that, and obviously we went from a situation where we had a fear of running out of resources to now a surplus, but for the longer term, this actually could be a very exciting initiative.</p>
          <p>If you do make an exciting discovery within China, do you get first footing on these? Or is there any requirement to allow Chinalco to run these? How is that going to work, because this, potentially, could be a real mineral box for Rios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nick. The exploration in China has not escaped my attention. As you know, I've had a long experience &#x2013; a lot of my career, including my first job was in the area of exploration. We have been exploring &#x2013; or trying to explore in China since 1994, and frankly it's been very difficult for us to get the access to the ground that we wanted to have.</p>
          <p>And within China, it's not only getting the exploration permits, but also getting the continuation of those exploration permits with what would be assurances to moving to mining permits. And I think that we've had now 10 years of slow experience with that, we know what we would need to do to have competitive advantage and I certainly, from my perspective and my exploration background &#x2013; and again my &#x2013; I've been following exploration very closely there since the mid-1990s, I do believe this provides us with a competitive edge for exploration.</p>
          <p>And I do believe that China is underexplored and we could provide opportunities. The fact that the Oyu Tolgoi deposit, which we all know is probably the best undeveloped copper deposit in the world, sits 80 kilometers away from the Chinese border, is evidence of the fact that there is prospective terrain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make a brief comment and perhaps Guy can come on to that. I think we &#x2013; and it's deep in the Rio Tinto culture, attach enormous importance to the long-term dividend promise that the company has had of a progressive dividend policy, which means not going backwards. I think had we moved towards one or two other options, we might have looked at that, but in terms of the option, we've decided to go with, we felt to hold the dividend was the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>Guy, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is much to add. I think the integrity of that record is something that we felt was very important. It was something just short of a promise to our shareholders that we would maintain a progressive dividend. Of course, we debated which assets should be in and which assets should be out of the package with Chinalco. And I think the eventual outcome was one which both sides felt comfortable with. So, while I understand your question, I think it has to be in that context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Guy, while you're on &#x2013; perhaps you might like to take some questions in Melbourne?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Neil, do you want to kick off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Neil Goodwill from Goldman Sachs JBWere. Just on aluminium, you'd set an average price last year, I think you said of $1.18. And given the sensitivities you've given us and given where spot prices are, your earnings this year at spot price is going to be very low indeed. Can you just give us some idea what measures you can take in aluminium? What you will do?</p>
          <p>And also could you just give us some feel for how costs are going to come down in the aluminium business? Is there a significant lag? And so what percentage of the price fall that we've seen in aluminium will come through in costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Neil. Maybe I'll tackle that, and Guy, if you want to add anything to this. What we saw during the course of 2008 would have been a lagging increase in some of the cost inputs, particularly elements around coke, pitch, caustic that drove up the overall cost structure. And, again, I would anticipate them coming down. But there is a time lag on them coming up and I think we'll see that time lag. We're still seeing it coming down in 2009.</p>
          <p>We recognize in this $0.60 aluminium price environment that all but those first and second quartile operations, even with rigorous cost containment will be very, very challenged and marginal. We have certainly gone through already two phases of smelter shutdown. We certainly have planning in place for further shutdowns. And that's all part of the overall sequencing of what any smelting company would be doing in this particular market, and we recognize that this involves not only the aluminium business, but also the impact on stakeholders and local communities who are quite sensitive to those areas.</p>
          <p>Jacynthe Cote has come in, in a very challenging time in the business and &#x2013; but I am absolutely confident she's focused entirely on rigorous cost reduction. We've already &#x2013; within her first two weeks in the role, she has already put in place very significant overhead and organizational cost reductions and we are pushing for further cost reductions and efficiency improvements at each of the smelters.</p>
          <p>We cannot rely on the fact that we've low cost operations. For that in itself, just to coast through the storm, we've got to tackle our lowest cost operations as aggressively as our higher cost operations. And, again, at these prices, we will have some of our higher cost operations which will be marginal and which will be tested, some in the fairly near term as the conditions dictate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I could just add a couple of comments. I mean difficult as the situation is for us, I think we're faring better than the competition, thanks to the quality of the assets that we have in bauxite, alumina, and smelting.</p>
          <p>I'd just add a couple of points. One is that in addition to the factors that Tom mentioned, there are some other exogenous factors that favor us. One is the fall in the oil price, and the other is the fall in the currencies in most of the countries that we produce either bauxite alumina or aluminium in. And those effects were not very much until late in 2008. So the costs on average during the year were affected by higher input prices and stronger currencies.</p>
          <p>The other thing that perhaps ought to be mentioned is that the synergies, which we're still delivering and delivering more than expected, are going to kick in increasingly as 2009 continues. So I'm not saying it's easy, it certainly isn't easy, but I think we're doing everything that we can.</p>
          <p>So next question here in Melbourne? Craig, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig Campbell, Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions; firstly, with the announcement late last year, early this year regarding redundancies, that sort of thing, in preparing the asset base for the current economic conditions, are you able to give us some guidance on what the cost impact of making those decisions might be for this half or calendar '09.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you had made some substantial iron ore spot sales through the course of 2008. With spot prices holding up relatively well at the moment, would you consider selling into spot market if there is still some push back on your contracted customers?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just in terms of some guidance around the net interest bill for '09, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, would you want to talk about the cost impact of the redundancies and the last question? And I'll talk about the spot iron ore business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, again, I think --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have to &#x2013; do you want to &#x2013; go ahead, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Yes, Craig, I mean we &#x2013; as you know, we said early in 2008 that we would be selling into the spot market and certainly it was a lot nicer time to be selling in the spot market at $180 per tonne than in the 60 to $70 per tonne range. I'm very, very pleased that we got them out early in the cycle. I think it's fair to say, as we said back in November of 2007, that we will always look at a mix of marketing activities, long-term contracts, hybrids, spots, et cetera. We will continue to explore that mix in this particular market, recognizing first and foremost, we want to look after those long-term contracted customers and that's what we've been doing.</p>
          <p>There have been some lower levels of spot business in these markets, and certainly we recognize that we have seen somewhat of an uplift. We've increased some of our shipments in the past few weeks. I think to some extent the Baltic Index has gone up, because we've probably put on more chartered vessels than would have been the case in November and December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, I can't put my hands I'm afraid right now on the cost of the redundancies. It was given, if I remember, in the release that we did on the 10th of December. I will give it to analysts when I brief them tomorrow and make sure that you have it. I'm not sure we will break it down though by half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was just over $1 billion actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the net interest number, you will see that we have &#x2013; you'll see what the debt <mark type="inaudible" /> for the receipt of the 850 million for the potash sale, which we reported a few days ago. On that, we are paying 3% approximately. That is to say we are paying between 32 and 42 basis points over LIBOR on the Alcan debt. That will change when it is repaid and it will be substituted in part by no interest, because we'll be using the proceeds of the asset sales. And then it will be substituted by a 9.2% on average coupon under the new convertible bond.</p>
          <p>So I think that I can't give you a projected average, because I can't tell you the exact date at which this will close, but I think those are the building blocks for that calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, I'll just clarify, the redundancy number, the cost was 400 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was a bit worried. I thought 100 billion was a bit --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, quite right. I think billion was the saving actually. Anyway, I think we should move to Sydney actually. Stephen, are you still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question here, Warren, if that's all right, Nigel? Sorry, I cut Warren off. I'm feeling a bit guilty about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy. A question &#x2013; actually two questions. One on QMM; there's been some recent political and social unrest there. And I just wondered whether that's impacted the startup of the operations? And also the train derailment that you had a couple of weeks ago, what impact is that likely to have on shipping in the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Warren. I'll cover both of these questions. At QMM, there have been some social unrest within Madagascar. Most of it's been in the capital city, Tana. It has stabilized since a few weeks ago. It has been unfortunate and we've seen limited effects within the Fort-Dauphin locations, which, as you know, is on the other side of the country from Tana.</p>
          <p>I would say, overall, it had no real effect on our startup timing, although &#x2013; and on some days we've had local residents standing in front of the road going to the site and we've managed that very closely with local Fort-Dauphin authorities.</p>
          <p>On the train derailment, it occurred on a double track part of a line. I think it took us about four days to recover one of the tracks on the line and a few days after that to recover the second. I would not say that it will have a material effect on first half shipments. Of course, as you know, probably what causes the most material effect in the first half would be the cyclone season and unfortunately we're still in the middle of that. But we've been, knock on wood, not too affected by it so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have some questions here Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Tim Gerrard from Austock in Sydney. Two questions, the first on iron ore and the second on aluminium. With regard to the possible expansion, the 100 million tonne expansion, you're obviously very, very circumspect about that and we can understand on a global basis. But given China's reliance to some extent on the high-cost domestic ore, BHP pushing ahead aggressively with its expansions and Australia's market share in China only about 40% despite the freight advantage. Could you just comment please on why you're not pushing ahead more aggressively with that, especially considering you're probably going to be getting $5 billion in from Chinalco sooner rather than later. So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question, just with regard to the aluminium smelters; for some reason both Anglesey and <mark type="inaudible" /> had a disastrous year because of problems with transformers. I guess it doesn't sound like a big deal, but what kind of risk is there to other smelters in the Group from under planning your transformer maintenance programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim, maybe I can tackle both of those. First of all on iron ore, if anyone had clairvoyance as to how we will come out of this global recovery, whether it gets worse, how it gets better, when it gets better, I think we all have more certainty and more confidence in expanding through a downturn. The sheer unprecedented nature of what we've been seeing in the contributing causes of this downturn I think poses considerable challenge for when we'll see that global uptake in the global steel markets.</p>
          <p>And at this point in time I don't see what I would call the credible and a meaningful signs of an economic recovery that would cause us to begin to make those significant capital investments. So I think that is prudent and realistic in this current capital horizon.</p>
          <p>Certainly, Tim, in my discussion with other chief executives in other industries and seeing the global nature of what we're all experiencing, that view would probably be more commonly held than an anomaly.</p>
          <p>The fact that we have the ability to expand at our election, at our convenience, the fact that the Chinalco transaction gives us the financial flexibility to expand at our election, at our convenience is terribly powerful, because I do hope to see signs of an economic recovery. We do hope to be in a position to make those types of decisions. But we first need to see some credible signs of global economic resurgence and we all know we have some difficult waters ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Second on aluminium, you've pointed out, not without a bit of irony that the two smelters which have had transformer and rectifier problems have been ex-Rio Tinto smelters and I think it's &#x2013; to say that for many years we had constrained sustaining capital which probably has caught up with us. We do need to recognize that, in Anglesey in particular which we knew had a fairly short shelf life as a consequence of the uncertainty around local nuclear capacity and local power contracts that by their nature would have been good business to not necessarily keep those transformers ready to run for the next 15 years, because we do &#x2013; we did not have 15 years of power contracts. So that was treated accordingly.</p>
          <p>In both the case of the Anglesey and the <mark type="inaudible" /> power failures, we have taken those lessons learned and applied them through the rest of the Group. And this would be an area I think where the superior technical position and the leading technical position that came into the Group through the Alcan transaction is probably helping the total global set of smelters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stephen, probably one more question, then we're going to have to wrap up actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks Nigel. Pick up the mic please?</p>

      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Paul McTaggart from Credit Suisse. Happy to be lucky last. Hopefully it's an easy question. Just looking at the provisional pricing allocations that were made around the Alcan acquisition, I note in, I think it's page 33 of the release, that in fact goodwill was written up from 14.5 billion to &#x2013; or was allocated from 14.5 to 20.1 billion. So my question was, the subsequent &#x2013; the impairment charge that we saw through for goodwill which is about 6.6 billion, is that after that impact? So we actually increased it 5.5 and then wrote it back for 6.5. Am I reading that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I'd better take that one, Paul. In a way, you're right. I mean we &#x2013; as a result of the Duff &amp; Phelps' activity that took place over the year following acquisition, we were able to examine in depth what the value of each asset was. And that caused us to reallocate as you can see, mainly in the area of tangible assets but also intangible assets, the fair value of Alcan. The difference was put predominantly into goodwill. And you can see that number rose up to $20 billion. And with the impairment, it will obviously reduce again down to a bit less than 14.</p>
          <p>And the causes of the goodwill adjustment, though, were the ones I explained; namely, recognition of different economic circumstances, higher input costs and the removal from our assessment of value of those projects which we had deferred or chosen to defer. So I think that &#x2013; but nevertheless your observation has a quite a lot of merit to it. It is backwards then forwards, or forwards then backwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>I think probably we have to draw the line there unfortunately to keep on a schedule which is rather tight. But just to say thank you all again for being here, and sitting through what this time has been rather extended presentations, but I hope the content was helpful to you. Thank you for coming.</p>
