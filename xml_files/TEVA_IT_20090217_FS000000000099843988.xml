        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elana, welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008 and provide our outlook for 2009.</p>
          <p>2008 was an extraordinary and exciting year for Teva. It was a record-breaking year across the board for sales, adjusted net income, and of course cash flow. I believe that especially against the background of a troubled world economy, our results this year emphasize the fundamental strength of stability of Teva's balanced business. Our balance of geographies and product lines provides us a natural hedge against which and enabled us to deliver continuous profitable growth, even under challenging market conditions. Our strong results under these conditions also I believe highlights the many advantages that Teva enjoys as the global generics leader. Our expertise in leveraging economies of scale and our ability to provide a quick and agile response to changing market conditions.</p>
          <p>Before I describe the year in greater detail, I would like to briefly review our results for the fourth quarter. Teva's net sales in Q4 reached a record breaking of $2.8 billion with gross margin of 56%. Our operating profit was $704 million with adjusted net profit of $634 million. And all of this ultimately brought us to adjusted diluted EPS of $0.76. All in all, this was an excellent quarter, which provided a strong end to the year.</p>
          <p>Now let us turn to the full year 2008, a year in which we had record sales of over $11 billion, which reflects 18% growth year over year, record operational profit of $2.7 billion, record adjusted net income of $2.4 billion, and record adjusted EPS of 2.86, exceeding our most recently updated EPS guidance of 2.79 to 2.85.</p>
          <p>We also had record cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion and record free cash flow of $2.2 billion. I would also like to mention that even after we spent approximately $3 billion of our own cash for the acquisition of Barr, we ended the year in a very strong cash position with over $2 billion of cash on hand ready to be deployed for good financial and growth purposes.</p>
          <p>Our record-breaking results in 2008 were driven by contributions from across our company. In the US, we had a record number of Paragraph IV product launches in 2008, including those of lamotrigine, budesonide, and risperidone.  These products, like many of our launches last year, were based on Teva's own API [Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients] and were brought to market in a very timely way thanks to the nearly seamless coordination between API, legal, R&amp;D, supply chain, operations, and many other divisions of our company.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we expanded our leading market share in the US among all pharmaceutical companies, both generic and brand, to 16.4% of total prescriptions. Among generic companies, Teva leads with 24% of total prescriptions.</p>
          <p>2008 was also a good year for our European business where sales grew by 13%, backed by a strong euro throughout most of the year. Eyal will give more details on the precise effect of currencies.</p>
          <p>As you know, 2008 was a turbulent year in the European market, and we found in each of the countries we are operating in different challenges and opportunities. In France for example, we are outperforming the market and nicely increased our market share during 2008. In Spain, one of our high priority countries, we launched 30 new products and significantly increased our market share through the successful integration of Bentley Pharmaceuticals. We also saw some unfavorable effects of the changes in Europe, especially the nature of the tenders in Germany and the Netherlands. But I am pleased to say that we were able to a large extent to overcome these hazards, winning 20% of the value of the AOK tender in Germany; and in the Netherlands, managing to increase our leading market share to 34%.</p>
          <p>Our business in Europe is already substantial and our presence and leadership in this critical region continued to grow during 2008. We launched over 125 new products in the top five European markets, including 30 products in the UK, our leading European market.</p>
          <p>We are also very excited about the way in which Barr, or actually PLIVA business, will enable us to grow in Europe, especially in Poland and Germany. In Poland, the combined company will become the number three player in the generics market. In Germany, the combined portfolio of the two companies will allow us to become a top-five player.</p>
          <p>I would also just like to mention that as part of our long-term strategy, we increased our R&amp;D efforts in the EU in 2008, enabling us to more than double our number of submissions. This will of course be a major growth engine for us in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Overall, we remain very optimistic about the future of generics in Europe, a market with a population of nearly 0.5 billion with relatively low generics penetration and with government and other payors coming under increasing pressure to lower the cost of healthcare.</p>
          <p>2008 was also an excellent year for our international business where sales were up by 28% over 2007, driven by especially strong results in Latin America, where sales were up 20%; and in Russia, where sales grew by 75%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our respiratory business, 2008 was a record year for sales of our inhalers. As the US conversion from CFC to HFA based inhalers accelerated and reached completion during Q4, ProAir ended the year with a market share of 59% of the total albuterol market in the US.</p>
          <p>2008 was an outstanding and exciting year for Teva's innovative business. Let me begin with Copaxone. In 2008, Copaxone became the world's number one therapy in terms of net sales for the treatment of MS and it remains the leader. Copaxone enjoyed record-breaking global in-market sales up $2.3 billion, with growth of 32%. In the US, in-market sales increased by 26%. Outside the US, in-market sales increased by an extraordinary 43%. Copaxone also led the market in the US both new and total prescriptions. In the US, it grew by 10.5% year over year in terms of total prescriptions. Copaxone continues to outpace the market's growth and we expect it to remain the leading therapy for MS and continue to grow.</p>
          <p>And as we look forward to the future of our MS franchise, I am also very pleased to announce that the FDA has granted our request for fast-track designation of oral laquinimod for the treatment of MS, which may mean that this product's time to market may be significantly shortened.</p>
          <p>This was also an excellent year for our second innovative product, Azilect, sales of which rose 46% during 2008. The promising results of several studies of Azilect during the year have also made us very optimistic about Azilect's future. As you will recall, the result of the ADAGIO and Tyramine studies may lead to Azilect's label being modified and allow it to be more broadly prescribed. We have submitted the results of the Tyramine study to the FDA and expect to finalize the submission of the ADAGIO study in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>To conclude my review of our performance during the year, I would like to mention that we made a major effort during 2008 to increase efficiency, helping us to improve our performance when it comes to expenses, despite our increased R&amp;D spend. Our ability to respond quickly and with agility is a great advantage for us as we work to adapt ourselves to current market conditions and further improve our competitiveness.</p>
          <p>2008 was also a year of major strategic achievements for Teva and I'd like to share with you just some highlights of the progress we have made recently towards realizing our long-term strategic goals. As I have said on numerous occasions, we believe biogenerics is both the next wave of technology and the next wave of generics, and we intend to become a leading player in this field. Leadership in biogenerics is indeed one of the pillars of our long-term strategic goals, and we achieved a milestone in 2008 with the launch in Europe of our first biogenerics product, TevaGrastim.</p>
          <p>We also made significant strides in building our biogenerics knowledge base, capabilities, and infrastructure. One of our important strategic acquisitions during the year was CoGenesys, a leader in cutting-edge technologies in biotechnology. And less than a month ago, we took a huge strategic step in accelerating the pace of our biogenerics activity by entering into a joint venture with Lonza, a Swiss company that is best in class in the development and manufacturing of biologics. We believe that Lonza's expertise combined with Teva's global scale and experience in bringing drugs to market puts us in the best position of any company in the pharma industry to capture the opportunities and attain the leading position in biogenerics.</p>
          <p>This joint venture will provide us with outstanding infrastructure, infrastructure that would otherwise require great investment of both cash and time to build. This JV will focus on the largest and most important biologics products, which represent most of the current biopharmaceutical market value of $30 billion. We expect to begin to reap the fruits of the joint venture with Lonza in 2014. We anticipate seeing the first fruits of our other investments in biogenerics at the beginning of 2013.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we also made excellent progress on expanding our geographical footprint and accelerating our leadership in key markets. As you will recall, we entered into strategic partnership with the Kowa Company to create a leading generic pharmaceutical company in Japan. The company has begun operations and we expect that it will reach sales of $1 billion by 2015. We have been receiving extremely positive responses from both the government and the market to our new Japanese initiative, and we are very excited about Teva's opportunities in this important market.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned earlier, our acquisition of Bentley provides us with a strong platform for establishing leadership in Spain, an important market with relatively low generic integration.</p>
          <p>And of course, the most important strategic development of this past year was the acquisition of Barr. We are very pleased to have closed this deal at the end of 2008 as originally planned, despite the massive changes that occurred in the market between the time we signed the definitive agreement and the closing.</p>
          <p>And now I am pleased to report that we are making excellent progress on the integration. The more we learn about Barr's business, the more excited we are about the synergies and the strategic advantages that this combination will create. As you will recall when we announced the acquisition, we told you that we had expected to see cost synergies at the end of the third year totaling $300 million. We are now targeting over $400 million in the third year. Furthermore, we now expect the acquisition to become accretive to GAAP earnings in the third quarter of this year, three quarters after closing rather than during the fourth quarter as we originally announced.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to provide guidance for 2009. We expect our sales in 2009 to be between $14.1 billion and $14.6 billion. It is important to bear in mind that in this uncertain economic and foreign exchange environment, exchange rates have a strong impact on our revenues. The numbers I just provided are of course based on current exchange rates. Just for the sake of comparison, if we were to project our 2009 sales according to 2008 exchange rates, they would be in the range of $15.15 billion to $15.65 billion. And as for earnings per share, we expect EPS in the range of 2.85 to 3.05.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we expect 2009 to be a great year. I would like to mention that because we are speeding up our integration of Barr, we expect to see most of the integration expenses in the first and to a lesser extent the second quarter, a period when we will of course not yet be realizing synergies on the acquisition. In addition, we expect this to be a back-end loaded year in terms of product launches. The combination of these two factors creates a somewhat unbalanced year and we expect to see sequential improvement over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>2009 is also building momentum towards a great 2010. We are not going to provide guidance for 2010, but our initial projection indicates that EPS will increase by 30 to 35% over our 2009 projected EPS.</p>
          <p>And now just one more note about the guidance, in order to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's past financial performance and prospects for the future, we have decided to make an additional adjustment to our non-GAAP earnings to reflect the exclusion of amortization of the intangible assets, what is commonly referred to as cash EPS. In a few moments, Eyal will give you a detailed explanation of the new non-GAAP presentation, which we will be using going forward, and he will also provide you with necessary details to reconcile between the two presentations.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn the call over to Eyal. Eyal?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today. This was another strong quarter for Teva ending an exceptional year. I would like to take the next few minutes to review with you the results in detail.</p>
          <p>Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to note briefly that we are once again presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter and full year of 2008, in line with the format we used in the past. So Q4 2008, we excluded the following items from our GAAP results: $992 million of in-process R&amp;D in connection with the acquisition of Barr; $272 million related to the impairment of financial assets, primarily auction rate securities; $107 million related to the impairment of intangibles and other assets, primarily in connection with product rights acquired through our acquisition of Sicor; and $17 million representing the net expense in connection with a few legal settlements in the quarter, $75 million paid out and $58 million received; in addition, the related tax effects of $66 million. As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we as management and our Board look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>As Shlomo mentioned, we had another quarter of record revenues with more than $2.8 billion in sales, an increase of 11% compared to Q4 last year. Excluding the items detailed above, non-GAAP net incomes grew by 11% to $634 million in Q4, and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 10% to $0.76. On a GAAP basis and as a result of the above-mentioned items, we recorded a net quarterly loss of $688 million and a loss of $0.88 per share on a per share basis.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2008, sales grew by 18% to $11.1 billion. Non-GAAP net income grew 22% to $2.4 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 20% to $2.86. Without excluding all the large charges I just described as well as some other charges we discussed in previous quarters such as the in-process R&amp;D relating to our CoGenesys acquisition, on the full year, GAAP net income was $635 million and full-year GAAP earnings per share were $0.78.</p>
          <p>Before going into some more detail, let me highlight two major elements affecting our results this quarter. Foreign exchange differences in our US distribution of Copaxone, foreign exchange differences played a major role throughout the year and most of this quarter, impacting sales and profit as well as our balance sheet. Unlike to the first three quarters in 2008, in Q4 foreign currency differences adversely affected sales by approximately 5% or $130 million as the dollar strengthened against most foreign currency, primarily the British pound, the euro, the Hungarian forint, the Canadian dollar, and Latin America currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Foreign currencies also had a $28 million adverse impact on operating income, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the US dollar related to the British pound and the euro on one hand, and strengthening of the Israeli shekel relative to the dollar on the other hand.</p>
          <p>For the full year, foreign exchange differences compared to 2007 rates had a positive impact of 227 million on sales but a negative impact of $65 million on operating income. As in the past three quarters, the change we made in the distribution of Copaxone in North America increased sales this quarter compared to Q4 last year by $181 million and was practically neutral to operating income.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our main business units. Pharmaceutical sales in North America, which include sales of generics, Copaxone, and Azilect and our respiratory products, grew by 15% over the fourth quarter of last year, and for the full year grew by 19%. The growth of Copaxone sales and the successful launch of lamotrigine, bupropion 150 mg, risperidone, and budesonide as well as strong sales of pantoprazole and amlodipine and benazepril launched last year contributed to the 2008 results.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical sales in Europe in dollar terms grew by 1% compared to Q4 2007 as these sales were the most negatively affected by the strengthening of the US dollar in recent months. Net of foreign exchange impact, pharmaceutical sales in Europe in the local currencies grew by 14% this quarter. For the full year, pharmaceutical sales in Europe increased by 13%, reaching 2.8 billion. In local currencies, sales in Europe grew by 6% for the year.</p>
          <p>International pharmaceuticals sales grew by 13% over Q4 last year. Our international sales continued to grow mainly due to the strong sales across our main geographies: Latin America, Israel, and Russia. In local currencies, pharmaceutical sales in our international markets grew by 19%. For the full year, international pharmaceutical sales increased by 28% compared with 2007. And in local currencies, sales were up 23%.</p>
          <p>Copaxone, as Shlomo said, had a record quarter and year. Global in-market sales totaled $595 million. This is a 37% increase over the comparable quarter for the world's leading MS treatment. For the full year of 2008, global in-market sales of Copaxone increased by 32% to $2.3 billion, with US in-market sales increasing by 26% to reach $1.4 billion and non-US sales increasing by 43% to $884 million. Two-thirds of the growth in the US Copaxone in-market sales was driven by price increase while one-third of the growth was driven by volume increase. In Europe and the international markets, most of the growth was driven by volume increase.</p>
          <p>Azilect had both a good quarter and year in which it continued to gain market awareness and market penetration. Although starting from a relatively small base, in-market sales grew by 46% for the year and reached a level of $51 million in the fourth quarter and $175 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our global branded respiratory business, which is included in the North America, European, and international sales figures, had sales of $259 million in Q4, up 37%. The main contribution came from the increase in the sales of ProAir in the US. Annual respiratory sales reached $778 million in 2008 compared to $742 million in 2007. These results do not include budesonide, which is included in our generic business.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin was 56.1% in the reported quarter compared with 52.3% in the comparable quarter in 2007. The improvement in gross profit margin is attributable to many parts of our business, higher Copaxone sales partially resulting from the fact that we now record 100% of Copaxone sales in North America; higher respiratory product sales, especially ProAir and a better generic product mix. Gross profit margin for the full year 2008 was 53.9%.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses reached $215 million or 7.5% of sales, up 28% compared to Q4 last year. In 2008, we invested a total of $786 million in R&amp;D, which was 7.1% of sales. This increased investment reflects our strategic goal to double R&amp;D output. Approximately 40% of R&amp;D investments in 2008 were in generics and 40% in our beyond generics initiatives: innovative products, respiratory, and biogenerics.</p>
          <p>As you can see in our earnings release issued this morning, starting this quarter in order to improve data transparency, we will break out our SG&amp;A expenses into their two parts, sales and marketing and G&amp;A. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $498 million in the quarter or 17% of sales compared to 14% of sales in Q4 '07. The higher sales and marketing is in line with our plan and resulted primarily from the termination of our distribution agreement with sanofi-aventis regarding Copaxone in North America as of March 31, 2008. And that impact of the termination of the distribution agreement on sales and marketing totaled $178 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A expenses totaled $182 million or 6% of sales. For the year, G&amp;A expenses grew by 5% and were also 6% of sales as compared to 7% of sales in 2007. This reduction of G&amp;A as a percentage of sales is part with an expense control initiative that we took. This has enabled us to increase R&amp;D spending while maintaining our high operating margins.</p>
          <p>We recorded $296 million of financial expense in our Q4 2008 GAAP results compared with only $3 million of financial expenses in the comparable quarter in 2007. This amount includes a $247 million charge against our portfolio of auction rate securities. This charge was calculated based on our internally developed model as well as work done by an outside valuation expert. The principal amount of our auction rate securities bond portfolio is now $450 million, including $13 million we received through the acquisition of Barr, whereas the net amount at which we now carry this portfolio as of December 31, 2008 stands at $98 million. Approximately half of this amount represents auction rate securities based on municipal bonds and government guaranteed student loans. The December 31 balance is after giving effect to a cumulative total of $343 million of P&amp;L charge and a cumulative total of $9 million provided in our balance sheet under other comprehensive income.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you that last quarter, we recorded income of a $100 million received from a financial institution in connection with an auction rate security portfolio. We also recorded in this quarter a $25 million charge resulting from a decline in the market value of certain equity investments.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for the full year 2008 applicable to our non-GAAP results was 10% compared with a rate of 17% for 2007. Accordingly, the tax rate provided for the fourth quarter reflects just over 6% of non-GAAP pre-tax income. As indicated earlier this year, the reduction in the effective rate from 17% in the prior year to 10% in 2008 mainly reflects product launches in the US during 2008, which to a large extent were developed and produced in Israel as opposed to a different mix in 2007. The tax rate for 2008 GAAP results was 22%, reflecting the $1.4 billion in-process R&amp;D expenses for the year which are not tax deductible.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow. We had a record quarter with cash generated from operations amounting to $969 million compared to $545 million in Q4 last year. Our free cash flow after capital expenses of $179 million net and dividends of approximately $90 million amounted to $700 million, also a record.</p>
          <p>Total SR&amp;A at December 31, 2008 amounted to $2.7 billion, an increase of almost $0.5 billion from September 2008. Approximately 400 million of this increase is coming from Barr. About 96% of the total reserves are from the United States, up $146 million from September 2008, most notably due to the provision for chargebacks for new products.</p>
          <p>Gross capital expenditures reached $181 million this quarter, essentially flat compared to 178 million in the previous quarter. CapEx in 2008 totaled $681 million, mainly reflecting previously discussed plant capacity expansion to support our strategic growth plan. Our financial leverage measured as debt to debt plus equity at December 31, 2008 increased to 34% from 24%, following the additional debt incurred in connection with the Barr acquisition. We expect the financial leverage to return to the pre-Barr acquisition level by the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now about dividends, yesterday Teva's Board approved a fourth quarter dividend amounting to approximately $127 million. On a per-share basis, our dividend which is declared in Israeli shekel was increased by 33% from 0.45 shekel to 0.60 shekel per share. Based on the rate of exchange on February 16, which was yesterday, of the shekel to the US dollar, this translates into approximately $0.15 per share this quarter.</p>
          <p>As Shlomo indicated, we now expect to reach $400 million in cost synergies from the Barr acquisition by the end of 2011, up from $300 million we initially estimated. In our presentation tomorrow, we'll provide additional color on the Barr synergies.</p>
          <p>Before opening the call for questions, I would like to provide additional detail on our guidance for 2009 and on how we intend to report our numbers going forward. As all of you know, until and including today, Teva reported non-GAAP results by adjusting for certain items including acquisition related costs such as inventory step-up and in-process R&amp;D as well as impairment of financial assets and legal settlements. Many of you requested that we consider providing non-GAAP figures in which we also exclude amortization of our acquired intangible assets.</p>
          <p>Given the fact that following the Barr acquisition our amortization of acquired intangible assets had reached a material amount and the fact that these write-offs will fluctuate from one quarter to another, we decided that we would accommodate your request; and in our non-GAAP disclosure going forward, we will exclude amortization of intangible assets from our quarterly and annual results. In addition to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, in presenting its non-GAAP measures, Teva will continue to exclude the same items already mentioned as we did in the past.</p>
          <p>In order to provide you some clarity on reconciling our future non-GAAP data with our GAAP financials and to allow you to see the impact of the exclusion in our guidance for 2009, let me highlight for you the items that we expect to exclude in 2009 in presenting our non-GAAP results: inventory step-up in the amount of approximately $270 million, divided mostly over the first and the second quarter of 2009; amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of approximately $470 million and possible restructuring expenses resulting from the Barr acquisition; and the offsetting tax effect of approximately $250 million.</p>
          <p>I would now like to provide you our guidance for 2009. Shlomo provided EPS guidance of $2.85 to $3.05. These numbers compare with the way we provided our guidance in the past and reported our results in 2008. Commencing 2009, we will also exclude amortization which had been included in our cost of goods sold and sales and marketing expenses. We therefore expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40 excluding these items. After the call, we will issue a detailed press release regarding our guidance.</p>
          <p>2009 is expected to be a back-end loaded year with sequential improvement from one quarter to another. The launch of new generic products and acceleration of cost synergies resulting from the Barr integration which are expected later in the year will influence the development of results.</p>
          <p>Let me share with you a few more data points regarding 2009. Our gross profit margin &#x2013; and this is based on the presentation of our new guidance format, the non-GAAP guidance format. Our gross profit margin is expected to average between 55 to 58%. This number did not include inventory step-up of approximately $270 million and amortization of approximately $350 million. R&amp;D expenses will be between 7 and 7.5% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing will increase as a percentage of sales compared to 2008 due to the fact that we will have four full quarters of payments to Sanofi in the US, and in 2008 we only had three quarters. But keep in mind that starting April 2010, these payments will end altogether. We expect sales and marketing to be between 16 and 18% of sales. This number did not include amortization of approximately $120 million.</p>
          <p>G&amp;A as percentage of sales for the year is expected to be just under 6% in 2009. Finance expenses are expected to be between 200 and $250 million. Tax rate on our non-GAAP numbers is expected to be in the high teens. And we believe that the fully diluted number of shares in 2009 should be approximately 915 million shares. We also have to add back about 50 million for earnings per share calculation resulting from the treatment of convertible debentures. The increase in interest expenses from convertible debentures is included in the final expenses which I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>It is important to mention that these ranges are our current best estimates and actual results could vary based on business conditions, exchange rates, and other elements. Just to be clear, in 2008 non-GAAP results we issued today and discussed on this call do not exclude amortization of intangible assets from our previous acquisitions. However, going forward, we will exclude amortization of intangible assets from all previous acquisitions from our results. In order to facilitate a better comparison between our future and former presentation of non-GAAP results, you will find on our website a reconciliation table covering quarterly and annual results from 2006 to 2008, showing how the excluding of amortization from intangible assets will have affected our results for these periods.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today, and now we will be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks guys for taking the questions, just a couple of brief ones. Eyal, just to clarify, does the 3.20 to 3.40 range, does that exclude all of Teva's amortization or just specific parts of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that includes our amortization including the ones that relates to acquisitions made in the past. You will see we're providing all the detail for comparison on our website a little later after the end of the call. We had about $140 million of amortization in 2008 from prior acquisitions, and Barr of course is adding a significant number, but that includes everything &#x2013; excludes everything.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course and this is not rocket science and the business is going to vary from one quarter to another, both level of expenses and level of revenues. As we said, the year is going to improve from one quarter to another both in terms of margins and in terms of results. The margins that I gave you are average for the year but it's going to vary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, first a US question for Bill. Whether or not you're building it in your model, can you discuss the potential for the pricing environment to improve in '09 versus '08 in terms of the typical shrinkage rate on the base business you've been seeing and perhaps comment on some of those factors? And then I have one for Gerard if he is on the call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Gregg. Right now, we have seen pricing remain stable for &#x2013; I feel like I've been saying this for a long time, and I guess I have for the last two years. We haven't really changed our model at all. I don't anticipate that at this time and we think that taking a cautious approach is the right thing to do.</p>

          <p>In terms of Europe, can you talk about growth on a constant currency excluding Bentley?

Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, can you take this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will; thank you, Gregg. First of all, I think it's a very mixed picture across Europe. If you take UK, UK has still &#x2013; the underlying growth is coming back. If you remember, '08 was the year in which the government took out 400 million sterling out of the system which we were seeking &#x2013; all the companies were seeking compensation for that. We did very well in that circumstance I believe better than many of if not all of our competitors, so that is not going to happen in '09 again, so it means that growth in '09 will be better versus '08; that's one.</p>
          <p>The second good news I think should be coming from Germany if the AOK will play out as we're currently expecting it to play out in terms of its tender. We should be able to reap benefits of our well-performed offering in that tender. In combination of course will be the fact that we should see from bringing together the PLIVA AWD business together, bringing them together with the Teva business in Germany.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, France is looking very hopeful. We've been extremely good and successful in the last year in terms of our competitiveness. We've turned around that business to be one of the most let's say competitive development of our franchise in Europe, and we're doing very well. We catch up on Sandoz. We're number three in the market. I'm sure they will not sit on it, so it will continue to be a very tough market, but we're doing very well and beating the marketplace there.</p>
          <p>Spain, with Bentley we have almost 10% market share now. We have the answer to all the different dynamics in the different parts of the Spanish market. We expect the Spanish market to continue to grow in the next few years in the double digit, low double digit to mid-double digits, so between 10 and 15, and maybe a little bit above that depending on who you ask. It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower, but that's very attractive. And I think with our portfolio of product launches and also with our commercial offerings that are adjusted to the part of the country that you are in, in Spain, we believe we have exactly the right answer to the opportunities in Spain.</p>
          <p>And then finally the one that is a bit uncertain is Italy. Italy is a marketplace in which we did well this year although it was a very tough environment. We've seen a low penetration of generics. We've seen a very competitive atmosphere at the retail level. I believe Teva within the circumstances did very well. We used our strong position in the marketplace with our partners, with our portfolio, but it hasn't been moving as much as we would have hoped for and I think that's true for the whole generics market. I think the government is not clear in its policy towards generics and that means that the market is not growing as much as it could be. So, that's the marketplace that I don't expect too much growth from this year. Therefore I explained.</p>
          <p>Another interesting one I think we should mention here is Poland. With the acquisition of the PLIVA business in Poland, Teva is as Shlomo already said, is number three in the generics market and number six in the total Polish market. We're a serious player there and we've got a wonderful breadth and depth of portfolio of products. We've got a very strong commercial setup there and lineup of people on the ground as well as in the marketing group. We've got OTC business there; we've got the anti-infectives. We've got a very I would say nice range of assets that should allow us to make that business thrive. And I think given the pressure in the economy, there will be a trend towards generics in general in that part of the world. And if we play that right, we should be able to benefit from that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning folks, a couple of them. First regarding the R&amp;D percentage, I think you have mentioned it will stay somewhere between 7 and 7.5% of revenue. Eyal, I was wondering if you think it will remain at that rate or are we looking to raise it over time. I'm thinking with the percentage of revenue you're currently generating from innovative businesses, you should considerably move more towards a branded businesslike investment in R&amp;D. And then I've got a follow-on for Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronny, it's Shlomo. Let me first answer you on the where we're heading with the R&amp;D expenses. As you may recall, when we launched the 20/20 strategy, we said that for a couple of years, we are going to increase the R&amp;D expenses in order to enhance our product portfolio and to capture the advantages that we found in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's not going to stay there for &#x2013; I mean this level of expenditure will not be there forever. It's a part of the 2x initiative, and <mark type="inaudible" /> actually for the coming year and maybe for another year. And then I can say that you probably will see us getting back to the 6.8 to 7% level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just under seven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm actually asking why you're not going the other way, Shlomo. I was wondering why it's not going more towards 10%? If you have a company which has almost derived half of its profit from innovative products, shouldn't you be spending more on branded R&amp;D or maybe this simply does not include acquisitions that you intend to make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's about first of all that most of our &#x2013; the majority of our business is generics. But in the innovative arena, we may exclude some expenditures. It depends on the level of the success or the public success of our R&amp;D there. But as we see it now, and definitely we will have to increase, that means that we are in good shape because it means that we are having some successful achievements. Then we will stay in this level of expenditure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronny, if I can add something, you can very easily calculate it. I'm sure you have done it already that we plan to spend more than $1 billion in R&amp;D next year or this year actually in 2009. And the mix probably I've mentioned before was 60% generics and 40% all the rest. We will probably see more going into the beyond generic arena as part of this $1 billion. So the mix is also going to change internally. And of course this is with Barr and there are plenty of synergies over there. Bill, do you want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes right, the only other thing I would say is again that level of the spend will depend on the opportunity, as we've said, and a lot of that depends on biologics as well. So we will be funding that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. Bill, a couple of quick ones for you, if you can quickly review for us the Imitrex situation and if you care to make a comment about the issue of the 30-month stay for the recently listed antibiotics. I don't know what your thinking is on this matter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take the first one with respect to sumatriptan. Sumatriptan, as you know, we launched last week. We were first to file I believe on two patents and Ranbaxy was first to file one already in the market. We launched already with a full complement of all strengths. We launched with all strengths. Ranbaxy launched with a single strength, the 100 mg. So we're shipping our product, we're gaining share. We feel good. Right now, we're targeting roughly at 40%. We should transition up to about a 40% share and we'll see where it takes us from there. The second piece, the 30-month stay on the antibiotic?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks guys. Question, Shlomo, if you could repeat what your 2010 growth assumption was, and I believe that was off of a GAAP-to-GAAP figure, the 2.85 to 3.05, if you could let us know if that also is applicable to the cash figure. And following on that, can you talk to us about the amortization levels in 2010? Should we assume that they're relatively constant or do they go down in 2010? And then I have a question for Bill as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I gave the numbers of course based on the old methodology that you used, but the percentage are the same percentage. So if you wish to do it the old way or the new way, you should just add 30 to 35% to our 2009 expected results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so roughly at 3.70 to 4.10 without holding you to numbers, are we working the math pretty much right on a GAAP basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you are doing the math the right way, you will be there probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And Bill, just on the US line, without getting into our specific numbers versus yours, it looked like it was a little weaker than we would have thought. Was the full Pulmicort booked? And before you answer that, also I want to get this in to Eyal. If you just take the Teva standalone numbers for 2008 and add roughly a flat Barr in 2008, you get to the low end of that 14.1 billion guidance. Are you modeling this conservative or is the currency really a pretty significant hit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, do you want to take it first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you further. I think you heard Shlomo. I think one of the major impacts here is foreign currency. We have to remember what happened between the 2008 adverse foreign exchange rates and the ones that we expect today. We're not trying to speculate on where foreign currencies are headed. We're taking the current rates, $1.28 per euro for example compared to almost 1.5 in 2008. That has an impact on top line, but as you have seen that the bottom line is not suffering from that impact. If foreign currencies does change their direction, I would be very happy to take the addition to the sales. But this is the major impact. In 2008 foreign exchange rates, our sales forecast would exceed $15 billion, I think from 15.1 to 15.6.</p>

          <p>Ken, this is Bill Marth. With respect to your question on Q4 2008 versus Q4 2007, I would make sure you point out before we talk specifically about Pulmicort that you remember Q4 2007 included Oxycodone, Wellbutrin. And lest you forget, there was that launch of panto that we spent so much time on. So when you look at the two quarters, I think actually the fourth quarter of 2008 was very, very good. That notwithstanding, I believe the majority of Pulmicort was recognized, but I would also remind you that on Pulmicort price, don't be too aggressive because when we launched Pulmicort, of course we did not know that we would be exclusive in that market. We had Barr chasing us and in fact they actually did have some product in the channel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ken, it's Shlomo. Let me just add one more comment on the foreign exchange impact on Teva as we are going into a probably a very volatile or unknown foreign exchange trend. Generally speaking, foreign exchange would impact more the top line rather than the bottom line because there the market is what it is. Having said that when it comes to the bottom line part of the P&amp;L, then it's both our managerial efforts to manage it and to a certain degree to compensate by having our business or better business model; and then of course by other managerial actions that we are taking in order to cope with the current situation. So even though if you can see a fluctuating top line, we believe that we would be able to absorb part of it and to manage the bottom line.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you. On the M&amp;A front, you obviously just completed a deal that involved adding additional leverage. Can you just comment on your interest in continued M&amp;A, especially with several generic assets potentially available, and just maybe update us on your current M&amp;A priorities? And then I have a couple of quick questions for Bill from there.</p>

          <p>M&amp;A by definition is part of Teva's strategy. But right now, we are focusing on digesting Barr. We believe that this is the major effort for Teva for 2009. Having said that, of course we are scrutinizing all opportunities. As we said, we probably are the most equipped company to capture opportunity if we come to the conclusion that this is the right opportunity and the right time.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks, and just a couple quick questions, the HFA albuterol market with ProAir, just expectations for this market heading into 2009. We're past the conversion phase. How do we think about pricing in that environment? And then just finally quickly, Lotrel, does your guidance assume additional generic competitors there in 2009? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, thanks for the question. The HFA market, as we said, we've got about a 59% share right now. We're not necessarily projecting that we're going to continue to hold that amount of share through the totality of 2009. It's a great product and it's converting. Almost all CFC is gone. There are still a few traces out there, but by and large it should be gone, so we see that that's going to smooth out. We did take a price increase, as you remember, in November, and now we have seen the competition has taken another price increase. So, we'll just keep an eye on it. Right now, we feel comfortable where it is, but obviously it's a completely branded market in our eyes and will be subject to price increases from time to time.</p>
          <p>The next question was on Lotrel, and right now you know that there are several players that may enter the 30-month date somewhere around the March &#x2013; April timeframe. One has to anticipate that there is potential for competition, but then of course Sandoz may bring some action. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

          <p>As per your question about Russia, and I would with your permission extend my answer not only for Russia, for all those countries that are facing volatile economic situations, we enhanced our cash management policy and actions in these kind of countries. So if you take Russia, the whole issue of hedging, price increase, increasing collection, credit policies, and these kinds of methods that are using in this uncertain and volatile environment is part of our managerial effort, and we believe that Russia is a major and important country. We will overcome this problematic time, but in the meantime we will do both. We'll try to increase our market share and of course to protect our revenues and profit.</p>

          <p>Hi, Rich, it's Eyal. Regarding 400, we upped the number from an initial preliminary estimate of 300, and this is by the end of 2011. Of course it has to build up of course on the cost of sales and production, streamlining of production facilities. That takes the longest and it will take time. So yes, we do see some expenses leaving the system a little earlier and the number to be bigger than what we initially thought. It clearly didn't improve as we go along. With regards to some more detail, I think I mentioned this in my part before. Everybody on the line is invited of course to join us tomorrow in New York and we will provide some more detail as to in what areas this is happening.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, I appreciate your clarification on the growth rate for 2010, but I guess that begs the question. For a company of your size, that's a pretty incredible growth rate on the bottom line. So where is the majority of that coming from? Is it mostly cost synergies or is there a big component of revenue growth that you anticipate in 2010 as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's Eyal. Again without going into the detail, we're focusing on '09. We talked that we feel comfortable with 2010, we thought we already gave it. It's based on basically three major factors. One, remember our agreement to pay royalties to sanofi-aventis on Copaxone ends on March 31, 2010. And from April 1, we're no longer paying that. That's one component. The other one is that we anticipate 2010 to be a pretty rich year in Paragraph IV and new generic product launches in the US, but also outside of the US. And in 2010, cost synergies on the Barr acquisition are expected of course to be higher than they are in 2009.</p>

And down the line, what percent of your biogeneric, biosimilar products will you have to split with Lonza versus 100% economics to Teva?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first of all, Lonza is a 50:50 joint venture. We share the investment and we share of course the revenues and the profits. We see it as a very exciting joint venture as I said in my previous &#x2013; biogenerics future part in the conference. I believe that this is a very compelling joint venture and we are targeting the majority of the big deal products in the industry for the timeframe of 2014 &#x2013; 2016. The potential value of these products in branded sales right now is about $30 billion, and this is actually where we are heading in this compelling JV.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. First one I have is with respect to quarterly progressions that you've talked about for '09 in terms of being back-end loaded. If we backed out the inventory step-up that's going to hit you heavy in Q1 and Q2, are there going to be improvements in the rest of the business in the back half the year to account for that, or it's just the removable of inventory step-up/</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll take the beginning and Bill can add to that. First of all, I mean this is based on backing out inventory step-up or backing out amortization. So it's net of the &#x2013; this is one of the reasons why we're doing this, to not to confuse everybody. This is net of that. Basically, there are more generic launches in the second half of the year and Q2 than in Q1. And of course the expenses, the expense synergy with the Barr will start to be meaningful only in the second half of the year. It takes time to reduce cost. It takes time to reduce the number of people, and we do this as you have seen already in a good fashion. And so the second half of the year is going to benefit both from stronger business and new launches and lower expense run rates. Bill, do you want add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael, just to add to some color to what Eyal said, I think he's absolutely right that we have more launches on the back end. In 2008, we launched 28 products with approximately $12.5 billion of innovator value. In 2009, we anticipate launching a similar number, but the market value is about 19.5 billion. However, if you look at the total potential launches that you have in 2009, you have as many at 38 with total value of 32 &#x2013; it's about $32 billion or almost 30% of our entire pipeline becomes available to us. So there is a huge potential for the back half of 2009. And as we've spoken so many times before, we risk adjust for this model, but that gives you some clarity of what we're looking at in our risk adjusted model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and the second one is actually for Shlomo. About a year ago when you talked about your five-year strategy, I recall that in your view, the European &#x2013; growth in the European business is going to be higher than in the US or North America. Given that you have Barr now, given what you saw in 2008, is that something that you're still seeing now or should we see a more balanced growth going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that if you net out the foreign exchange, that projection is still intact and still valid. I believe that the potential for growing generics in Europe is there. Actually the higher the pressure of the payors on reducing the healthcare cost, we will see a more friendly environment for generics. And all in all, it is case by case within a region, my projection for our perspective for the long run is still there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for answering the questions. Firstly a macro question, given the tough global economic environment and governments becoming increasingly interested in pro-generic measures, do you see governments in France and Japan pursuing more aggressive initiatives in 2009 &#x2013; 2010 to increase generic penetration? And then secondly, Bill, how do you see the fentanyl patch market playing out given the safety concerns of reservoir patches? Has the FDA communicated at all if they're ultimately going to remove the reservoir patches from market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me first take the first part of your question. I do believe that from a strategic point of view, the current world crisis is favorable in generics. Again, the pressure on governments that are struggling with budgets and cost reductions than any other; in many areas, one of the most compelling ideas there is to go more for generics. Generics is actually about affordable drugs and it's about having the same quality for less price. So what I am saying is that either it will take a little bit time here and there. And you can see some differences between the reaction of governments. I do believe that all in all, the current crisis will accelerate the generic penetration, and just let me give you a simple number regarding the US generics. Every percentage point in the US market for generics means less $7 billion for the patients there. So you can see how big the potential is to balance budgets and to reduce the cost of healthcare in our current form. Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Good morning, Caias, and thanks for the question. With respect to fentanyl, I think if you've been following the prescription gain &#x2013; people have been asking us where the share was, and you see quite a bit of gain in the last few weeks. And in fact every week of the last four weeks you've seen at least 1,000 prescriptions growth. So it's coming along quite well. We gained the share we thought we were going to gain and we're doing very well. That said, I have not heard that the FDA is necessarily going to be taking reservoir patches off, although I've got to say that there is a certain amount of customer, there is a certain amount of customer fatigue around the constant recalls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just a couple of follow-up questions on the amortization expense for Eyal. Specifically, what effective tax rate should we be thinking about in terms of looking at the after-tax impact of the amortization? Using your high teens rates, we seem to come up with a higher number than what you're adding back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think I gave it in the set of &#x2013; the long set of data points that I gave you includes that as well, but I would say that the tax effect on the inventory step-up and the amortization is $250 million. We calculate it's about 33%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then I wanted to ask you a follow-up question as well, and make sure I'm perfectly clear on this point. With respect to the implied rate of growth in 2010, the 30 &#x2013; 35% off of the GAAP numbers in '09, in the merger document, there was a fairly significant step down in the Barr related amortization in 2010, roughly 200 million. So I guess in thinking about applying that same rate of growth to the new cash EPS basis, it didn't seem like that would be appropriate to do so given that big step down in amortization, which works in your favor on a GAAP EPS basis but works against you on a cash EPS basis. I just want to make sure that impact...</p>

          <p>Okay. I want to clarify; we tried to make it a lot simpler here. This growth rate is based on the non-GAAP or what you call cash EPS basis. It's not on the GAAP. It doesn't take into account the fluctuation in amortization at all, so it's purely business with backing out the amortization and the inventory step-ups.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, is it still &#x2013; should we still be thinking about that large step down in amortization expense in 2010 as was outlined in the merger document then?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but the growth is not resulting from that. It's eliminating the amortization altogether.</p>

          <p>The amortization in 2010, this is on the GAAP part. Amortization in 2010 will be lower than it is in 2009 as was said in the preliminary report on the filing. We now have the detailed schedule and the amortization is stepping down, not dramatically. It's not going to be half but it is going to go down.</p>
