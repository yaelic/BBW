          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2008 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Shaquanna and I'll be your coordinator for today.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.  We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I will now like to turn your presentation over to your host for today's call Mr. John Colglazier.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you Shaquanna.  Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Anadarko's first quarter conference call.  Joining me on the call today are Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, and other executives who will be available to answer your questions later in the call.  As a remainder, we have posted additional information in our first quarter operations report available on our website.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Jim, I need to remind you of certain aspects in our forward-looking statement.  This presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information.  However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we've discussed.  You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated in our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll reference a non-GAAP cash flow measure. So be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release.  We also encourage you to read the Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors contained in the presentation slides for this call.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John and good morning everybody.  At our recent investor conference in New York we detailed our asset portfolio in order to provide insight into the Company's value creation potential.  So we're pleased to report 2008 first quarter results, which build upon 2007's performance and which demonstrate the company's ability to deliver significant organic growth and excellent financial metrics.</p>
          <p>This morning I would highlight some of the achievements during the first quarter and talk about our expectations for the remainder of 2008.  For the fifth quarter in a row, our operational performance has met or exceeded projections.  We produced 53 million barrels of oil equivalent for the quarter, more than 1 million barrels above the high-end of our guidance.  This equates to an 8% increase in production from our retained properties versus the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Crude, natural gas, and NGL production volumes all contributed to this performance.  Our offshore and Rockies properties delivered great results.  For example, Independence Hub produced more than 30 million cubic feet per day net above our anticipated run rate during the quarter.  And in the Rockies we achieved record production.  In the Powder River Basin where total gross sales volumes topped 700 million cubic feet per day during March and where we have ongoing midstream expansion projects, which will facilitate further volume growth over the next several months, and in Greater Natural Buttes area where we set a new gross operated production record of 280 cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>Total recorded sales volumes from Greater Natural Buttes increased about 20% from the fourth quarter of 2007.  As was announced recently, production in Independence Hub was shut in on April 8th because of a leak in the facility's export pipeline.  Enterprise, which owns the export pipeline, has stated that it expects to have the line repaired by mid May and we anticipate quickly ramping up production shortly thereafter.  Assuming we can resume production on schedule, the momentum and performance of our asset portfolio gives us the confidence to reaffirm our full year production guidance of 207 million to 212 million barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>We had a successfully active quarter in regards to our deepwater Gulf of Mexico development program, the details of which appear in our first quarter ops report. However, I'd like to highlight several significant developments for you today.  At the offshore Gulf of Mexico K2 complex, we reached total depth on the Green Canyon 561 #2 development well in early April.  The well helped define the extent of the oil-bearing reservoirs that are present in the six producing wells.  It also encountered new off-structure oil-bearing sands. To further evaluate the extent of the sands, the well is currently being sidetracked down dip.  We continue to analyze our options for enhanced oil recovery of K2, and now anticipate making recommendation to the partners on the optimum technique for the field development by year-end.  We have one additional development well to drill in the southern portion of field in 2008, which will provide additional insight on these future recovery plans.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere offshore we have two sanctioned projects scheduled for startup in 2008, Power Play and Blind Faith.  Our expectations for first production for both remain intact with Power Play commencing production in the second quarter and Blind Faith in the second half of 2008. Chevron announced last week an issue with one of the more in-lines of Blind Faith, however we do not expect this issue to have any volume impact as we have always projected a second half 2008 startup.  We are also working with Chevron to expand the facility's capacity by 30% to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
          <p>In other Gulf of Mexico activity we continue to make drilling progress in the Sturgis North prospect in the Atwater Valley area.  Anadarko holds a 25% working interest in the well, which has a Miocene objective at just over 26,000 feet.  We have three to four additional wells currently scheduled for 2008 in the Gulf of Mexico with one being a Lower Tertiary test.</p>
          <p>Internationally we've also had some encouraging results in our exploration program.  In the first quarter our partnership announced the discovery at the Odum-1 well offshore Ghana.  The well confirmed a separate and potentially significant oil accumulation in the area.</p>
          <p>We plan to shoot some additional 3D seismic to give us a clearer view of the size and expected impact of this project. At the deepwater Mahogany-2 appraisal well located in the West Cape Three Points Block offshore Ghana, we announced yesterday, that we encountered high-quality stacked reservoir sandstones with approximately 165 feet of net oil-bearing pay.</p>
          <p>The Mahogany-2 well is located approximately seven miles to the Northeast and up dip from the successful Hyedua well on the Deepwater Tano license, indicating a gross oil column of nearly 1,955 feet. We will perform a drillstem test of the Mahogany-2 well to gain a better understanding of fluid and flow characteristics, and we anticipate the results will lead us to update our estimated resource range for the area.</p>
          <p>Anadarko holds approximately a 31% interest in West Cape Three Points Block where the recent successful wells have been drilled. We will also continue with other components of our appraisal and exploration program in offshore Ghana, which includes the anticipated drilling of another five to eight wells. We are working toward project sanctioning later this year.</p>
          <p>Turing to offshore Brazil, drilling has been suspended short of the primary objective on the deepwater subsalt Serpa prospect on Block 24 in the Espirito Santo Basin. While the main pre-drill objective was not reached, an active petroleum system was proven in the shallow or subsalt secondary objective. Anadarko and its partners are evaluating the potential to bringing a different rig to the Block to complete drilling operations. We hold a 30% working interest in this prospect.</p>
          <p>We are also mobilizing the Deepwater Millennium drillship from the Gulf of Mexico to execute upon our deepwater subsalt exploration program in Brazil, and are currently targeting up to three additional wildcat wells in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turing to our U.S. onshore operations, we anticipate drilling our first exploration well in the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian Basin of Pennsylvania in the second quarter. As we move forward with the program, it includes drawing five to ten wells in the play this year. This will help us to better define the potential of our 600,000 gross acre position in this emerging play.</p>
          <p>Those are some of the company's operational highlights and as John said, there's some detail available in the operations report that's posted in our website that may give more clarity.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to walk you through some of the financial results for the quarter. Discretionary cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was nearly $1.9 billion compared to our capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, a good reflection of the capital efficiency of our program. Our strong free cash flow was the primary driver for the retirement of our acquisition facility during the quarter. Through assets sales and substantial additional free cash flow, we anticipate further improvement to the balance sheet throughout the year.</p>
          <p>As detailed in the tables attached to earnings release, there were some items affecting comparability, including the non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses that in total impacted our net income in the quarter by $0.94 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>In addition to our strong production volume performance for the quarter, we benefited from excellent price utilizations excluding the effects of hedging. We also continue to hold the line in our controllable costs, even though G&amp;A was higher than guidance in the first quarter due primarily to $14 million of additional compensation payments from an outstanding performance in 2007.</p>
          <p>But our full year expectations for both LOE and G&amp;A remain unchanged from our initial full year guidance. This is reflecting the supplemental information attached to our earnings release. We are increasing 2008 guidance for DD&amp;A, which is driven by greater offshore volumes, and for oil and gas cost of product, which is a direct result of stronger commodity prices.</p>
          <p>As we stated in our last conference call, we've secured basis hedges throughout our producing regions. These protect about a billion cubic feet per day of our Rockies production, both within the Rockies and for Mid-Continent shipment, with basis swaps and firm transportation through 2010 at attractive rates versus today's differential. The supplemental information attached to the earnings release includes additional detail regarding our hedge and basis position.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are very pleased with the results from the first quarter. We've built upon the substantial momentum established in 2007. Given the confidence we have in our production volume growth and our ability to continue to reduce leverage, we expect to deliver 15% or higher annual growth for debt adjusted share in production for several years forward. We believe this performance will place us in the upper quartile of our peer group and provide differentiating value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Before I open it up for questions, I want to remind to you that we are not permitted to speak about the IPO of Western Gas Partners, so please review the amended S1 or the news release if you have any questions.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, we will open the lines.</p>

          <p>[Operators Instructions].  Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gardner with Simmons &amp; Company.  Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I had a question on Jubilee field, just thinking through possible development scenarios. I believe current discussions are at peak rates in the 200,000 barrel range.  If this new information from the Mahogany-2 takes resource estimates closer to the high side of your estimate, what would that likely mean with regard to peak rate development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chuck, you want to answer that.  Thanks, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Tom. This is Chuck Meloy. Right now, we're in the throes of evaluating the different development options for the field and of course we're taking all the new information into account.  We're really excited about the fact the oil is way up  dip, that opens up the field substantially larger, which will require more infrastructure, and so we're taking all that into our RPT team and evaluating that.  We've mentioned previously the most likely development is an FPSO.  Peak rates and that type of thing are still being evaluated and we'll size it properly to match the EOR of the field and of course, the bigger it gets, the higher the rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just speaking of FPSOs, can you discuss the level of difficulty in procuring one or several in today's market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're out to tender now.  We're doing the original evaluations and that type of thing.  It appears we do have a pretty open market to work with. A number of different organizations and opportunities have come to us, so we feel pretty good about it.  And we're anticipating production in the 2010 time-frame and that will get us -- so that tells you that &#x2013; we feel the market is pretty good for us right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, since I have you on the line, can we talk about K2 for a second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I believe in the past, you've have bracketed the in-place volumes in the 2 to 4 billion barrel range. What is the impact to this 561 #2 appraisal well on that range and can you give us a range of recoveries as you talk about water and/or gas injection as an the EOR process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This well is really exciting for us.  We just completed the drilling course.  And based upon the results of the well in the main horizons, it looks like we'll be in the mid-to- upper range of 2 to 4 billion.  Now still, Tom, a lot of that depends on the next well, as Jim mentioned earlier in his presentation.  So we still have some uncertainty around it, but we're feeling very excited that this thing is big. What we didn't have in that range was the new sands we found and we found those full of oil, off structure, and so we're currently drilling a down dip sidetrack to that well to evaluate how big they are, which could add to our oil-in-place estimates.  And then we'll ultimately sidetrack back up dip for a producing position.</p>
          <p>Concerning the recovery factors we're still in the technical evaluation of those looking at the alternatives of water and gas injection, mostly nitrogen injection.  As Jim mentioned, we hope to come to that conclusion toward the end of the year and make a recommendation to the partners and given the sensitivity around that, I prefer not to suggest what the recovery factors would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can appreciate that.  Well, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You haven't been shy in the past of indicating interest in potentially selling long lead time developments as you do with Kaskida and Peregrino. How should we think about your priorities when it comes to Ghana or any future deep-water discoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think those fit, Brian, within the category of being much nearer-term in nature and we still &#x2013; I might just for the record, state that we still like the Lower Tertiary play, which has been one of the assets that we have sold, as you mentioned. And, we have a lot of acreage that has potential there.  We found that in the process of trying to restructure the balance sheet that it made some sense to take off the table some of the longer-dated assets at that time and that was actually what Kaskida was driven towards.  So we hope that that's a win-win for the seller and the buyer.</p>
          <p>In the case of Peregrino, it was simply a matter that we had had two other discoveries that came out at the same time, and we thought that again, because of some other places that we could put that money that we might be better served than that unsolicited offer to sell the existing development project in Brazil and keep the exploration acreage.  So I think we'll be much more selective going forward on what we end up divesting of. But I think periodically, it makes some sense to validate the inventory to do some of that.  And we'll continue to look at opportunities related to that as well as small acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And you brought up the balance sheet, higher oil and gas prices seemed to have allowed you to de-lever much more quickly than many have expected.  How should we think about use of free cash flow going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this industry, of course, when you have free cash flow, you've got to intelligently assess what your staff and your acreage position allows you to do in a quick period or a longer dated period.  As long as we refurbish the balance sheet, we still get good debt adjusted production per share growth, which we think is the primary metric that drives the evaluations and it builds up dry powder. And what we do is incrementally, as we've announced this year, put that towards additional opportunities that we have in the drilling portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, we're putting money into the Southern region; we're putting money into the Rockies Midstream; we're putting money into plays like the Marcellus to get additional acreage and to drill some additional wells, and we took a bigger position in the offshore Gulf of Mexico lease sale because of that refurbishment of the balance sheet.  So, we view the efficiency that was created in the first quarter as a way to prepare us not only for the near term, but also prepare us for executing on the portfolio long-term.  So, it's a mix of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And one last numbers question, CBM production ticked up pretty nicely in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.  Any seasonality on how we should expect further growth over the course of the next few quarters or do you see similar levels of increases in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, the tick-up in the first quarter was associated with the expansion of the Fort Union gas gathering system and getting it online.  As we go forward, we're still expecting double-digit growth out there.  All signs look very, very positive.  We've seen the wells de-watering faster than we anticipated.  We've seen the peak rates on the wells to be higher than we anticipated here recently, and the whole thing is just working for us.  We also see &#x2013; and we also have planned an additional expansion of the Fort Union gathering system around the middle of the year second quarter and that will help pick up our rates and free up some space for the gas production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Gil Yang with Citi.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Following along Brian's question there, did we see the full benefit of Fort Union in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the expansion was roughly 200 million feet and we filled it up essentially during the course of the first quarter.  So, Gil, I guess the answer is probably partially and not completely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, in the second quarter we'll have sort of &#x2013; we should have sequential growth, because we'll have the full quarter of the Fort Union benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then at the end of the quarter, you have the other expansion coming online that would do the same thing again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll see it &#x2013; we'll see production continue to ramp-up and then, because you know out there, it's a real tight gas evacuation.  And so, we'll start seeing the bottlenecks move further downstream, but the production is certainly moving up, and we're going to try to keep ahead of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second expansion that you plan, putting in line &#x2013; on line, is that another $200 million expansion or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Gil. It's a 400 million a day expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>400 million, okay.  All right. And can you also quantify, of the expansion &#x2013; of the growth and production you saw in the quarter, how much of it was sort of de-bottlenecking from the infrastructure versus drilling activity driven? And then the other performance things that you cited?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me take the first part, and Chuck can take the drilling part. We had about 50 million a day in the Powder River behind pipe, prior to the initial expansion put in place. And we also had about $70 million a day behind pipe in Natural Buttes before we got the Chapita plant in as well as the Kanda Lateral in operation &#x2013; gross &#x2013; those are gross numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Gil, on the Powder, when we drill wells, we typically don't see the benefit of those for about a year or two years as we de-water.  So most of what you're seeing right now is just associated with gas that has &#x2013; in wells that have already de-watered and are looking for an opportunity to evacuate.  So, that expansion built the gas ramp-up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great. And if I can go back to K2 for a second, Chuck, I think you mentioned that you were going to drill down dip to test the &#x2013; those new sands. With the down dip wells, is there any intention of penetrating the K2 reservoir itself as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We will see the whole section, the Miocene section in the down dip.  So, we'll get an additional look at all the sands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will that penetration of K2 itself be useful to you or is that important &#x2013; is that not important?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's just additional information that we can use to size up the size of the aquifer and the drive mechanism. I mean it's all good information and &#x2013; but the primary purpose of it is to get a good evaluation down to potentially these new sands, which could add new reserves to our program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Are these new sands above or below the K2 reservoir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're in the Miocene section, which is the same as the K2 section.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally, if you were to put those on production, to tie them back presumably to Marco Polo, would you tie them &#x2013; do you need to bring them all the way back to the Hub or can you tie them onto a line that is another producing line sort of midstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this well will actually connect to one of the existing flow lines that are out in the field and tie it back in to Marco Polo.  We expect first production early next year.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, everybody.  Hey Chuck, could you talk about the cost to develop Jubilee? I know it's early and you haven't figured out the development program yet, but could you give us kind of a range of what are you thinking about in terms of development cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Joe it is pretty early and we haven't really decided what we need given the expansion of the field recently.  This well has really gotten us excited, it opens up a great deal of territory, so we're going through and making plans on how to develop that back to an FPSO and I'm sorry its just a little early in the game to really pin down the cost, it's a great looking, great looking development with super economics, and a little early in the game.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.  And for the Hyedua-2 well, how far are you stepping out to sort of figure out how wide this reservoir is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe this is Bob Daniels. I think it's not as far as this one was from Hyedua-1, it would off on to the west and north a little bit, but I don't have the exact distance that I can give you right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay got it, okay.  In terms of fiscal terms, I know that the governments &#x2013; the company had the 10% carried working interest, what are some of the other terms of the &#x2013; what's the royalty, do they back in to a higher interest, after a certain point and how would you characterize the fiscal terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Joe, this is actually a tax royalty regime and being the first mover into the country it's fairly attractive terms and I think we are under a confidentiality agreement on there right now, but it's very attractive terms compared to some of the other areas in the world.  So it's not just &#x2013; it's not a PSC where it's going to fluctuate the price, it's a fixed royalty, fixed tax regime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha, and then from a technical perspective do you believe, what would you characterize as the biggest risk going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Joe these, the reservoirs are very high quality, sandstone really good permeability, it's a large reservoir, so we'll have to keep energy in the system, but there doesn't, it's a high quality oil, and at very shallow depths, less than 10,000, around 10,000 feet.  So, we'll, we should get additional information as we do the DST on this Mahogany-2 well, but it doesn't have a substantial technical risk that's is insurmountable able at this point, we feel really good about what we got goin here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe this is Karl Kurz, the biggest unknown on the Jubilee fields still remains the aerial extent, how do we size this right and finding out just how big this thing is and Chuck said technically the reservoir looks fantastic, good quality oil, we've gotten good pressure data, it's a very exciting project.  Now it's just to figure out how big it is and get the facilities sized right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.  And Hyedua-2 is that's going to help you figure out the air extent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at the three wells to date that's been drilled in the field, they basically make a line that runs from the Southwest to the Northeast.  So, we basically have gone on strike with the structure, and now we want to go perpendicular to that, and start getting some aerial extent to these stratigraphic plot and the next two wells will be very exciting to see how far this thing goes out to the sites.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Mahogany-2, and, sorry, Mahogany-3 and 4 will go in the other direction or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay got it.  And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically get these first &#x2013; these first five wells, the two more will have a big X out there, and then be able to struck with some real math to the sizes it could be.  We have Odum out to the, I think it sits to the North, Northeast, which gives us more confidence in the area of being a good area to play in with the hydrocarbon success we've seen there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful.  And then just a general question on the overall portfolio, especially in the US, I mean, what are you seeing in the terms of drilling and completion cost, what's the latest trend, a lot of operators talking about cost kind of leveling off here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess we haven't seen cost level off in the industry.  We've been pretty much contained in our cost to a lot of long-term service agreements, where we've already seen a lot of pressure on tubulars right now.  We've seen some steel price increases come across pretty consistently last couple of months.  And I think you are starting to see onshore rig rates also start moving to the upside, but I think we have 75% of our onshore rig termed up, you know our situation with deepwater rigs. Our service agreements like for tubulars, we've got five year type arrangements partnerships with some of the mills that give us some differential protection on prices there.  We are still holding at that 5%, 6% cost increase for us.  I think the industry may start to see a little bit higher costs.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi congrats on a nice quarter.  A couple of questions for you, Jim if I look at 2008 production targets and assuming that Independence Hub is off, anticipated in mid May.  What type of projects do you have to have in the second half of the year in order to hit your numbers for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Do you want to check them out and I'll deal... David, the expectation of mid May for our hub, the other projects we need to have happen is, Power Play needs to come on when expected, <mark type="inaudible" /> needs to come on in the second half and the performance that we've seen in the Rockies needs to continue and that performance has been exceptional, it's been right, right on and above the curve as you saw in our first quarter.  We are very excited about how it's progressed.  The guys out in the field are just doing a fantastic job getting the gas to the market and so, the primary driver from here on is getting our Hub back and the Rockies continuing to perform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and do you have flexibility in the back, and if Independence Hub ends up being off till June, and you lose another essentially 1% of your full year production.  Do you have enough flexibility of program to ramp us to hit that, is that how or do you guys look at that if Independence Hub were to stay off longer-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you define longer term as being end of June and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think if it's June &#x2013; I think there is enough &#x2013; there is some flexibility in the program to be able to hit some of that targets, I'd say if it goes beyond June then we'll have to address that again.  I think earlier somebody asked me how long would it take to ramp Independence Hub backup and we really think it should be a couple of days, it should be backup to the capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess the hedge funds are beating me down on the longer-term definition these days. Can you talk it all about acquisitions, do you feel that you guys need to have any bolt-ons, are you looking for bolt-ons, are you looking for something bigger, I mean are you looking at just fixed package in the Woodford, can you talk a little about given how much cash it looks like you will generate over the next couple of years, kind of what your thoughts are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way that we've restructured the portfolio with the resource base we have it's some 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent, we feel like we can do this organically from here and it does not mean we'll nor as I mentioned earlier selective bolt-on acquisitions it just help us get to this to even a better place for our investors.  So we will look at that, but it's not a primary driver for any of our plans strategically or tactically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if I look at the model, obviously generating a kind of free cash flow, right now that's still our air mark for bigger projects, expenditures and some additional pay down of debt that kind of where the cash flow would be applied today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning just a few follow up questions on some things, in terms of Jubilee you mentioned, Northwest and a Southeast of Preeceville plant, is there anything planned to the Northeast, it sound like there is a quite bit of up drip structural closure that is yet to be sort of interpreted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Joe, Bob Daniels here.  I think there will be one up to the Northeast based on the Mahogany-2, but it wasn't part of the original planning.  This was the Northeast test, but certainly given what we've seen here, does open up more room off to the Northeast, and will require wells at some point in the future, but that is not one of the presently planned wells. One of the very encouraging things here that we found at the well of course that it was all oil and that there wasn't a gas cap on it.  So, that means perhaps somewhere up if we might find that, but we need to get out and look for it.</p>
          <p>Remember, we got another rig coming . The Songa Saturn is going to be leaving after the test on the Mahogany-2, the Blackford Dolphin would be coming in June, July, timeframe.  We've got five slots on that, to drill these appraisal wells, and a few development wells right in the gulf of it.  And then at the end of the year, we got the Eric Road coming in and that will be there  for three years to drill development wells and then further appraisal if needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I &#x2013; Karl mentioned that the aerial extent is one of the biggest unknowns, what was the sort of assumption on aerial extent in the initial resource range, where do you think it's gone to now, and what's the upper end or is there any sort of range identified with the appraisal program that is lined out right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we came out previously and said the resource range, recoverable resource was 200 million to a billion barrels that is prior to the Mahogany-2 well.  We're going to have to incorporate that into our analysis and we'll probably be coming out with the new range about the time we announce the DST results, which is within a month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  And moving on to Rockies, strong growth in the first quarter, expected growth out of all the regions there for the next two to three years, can you provide some additional thoughts around the existing takeaway issues, the impact of current projects that are delayed and then thoughts around any additional pipelines that have been proposed in your position, in terms of supporting those...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, this is Clay Bretches. To address the, the current situation as you know Rex is coming to service and we have somewhere between 750 to 800 million a day of a spare capacity.  With the existing growth in the Rockies, we expect that spare capacity to last for a couple of years, I think it may get a little dicey 2010, 2011.  So as you, correctly mentioned there are several projects that are being proposed right now and we are looking at taking from transportation on a couple of those looking at some proposals that are out there and we will be evaluating those and making some decisions sooner.</p>

          <p>Just off structure, we picked up additional sands, which is not unusual &#x2013; it's a great neighborhood, as you know on that part of the world.  And so, as we've gone off structure, the sand is &#x2013; the sand content has increased, and we picked up a couple of these other sands that are essentially pinched out before they get up on to the high of the K2 structure.  And so, we don't know how far they can go off structure, we still have some closure, remaining on the structure.  So, we're really excited about the potential.</p>

We've not made any decisions on any of those at this point, but we are doing the technical evaluation to see whether or not it's something we want to do.  So, we're seeing the opportunities, we think the rig will leverage us into those opportunities.  And right now we're planning on the rig being there about 24 months, but that will be contingent on getting into those opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Coming to this Marcellus Shale, 5 to 10 wells this year, how many would be horizontal, how many would be vertical and just a general dispersion of your exploratory plan of these wells, miles and miles apart or in a tightened area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob Daniels again.  Right now we've got what we call pilot areas and we are planning on drilling five of those pilot areas. They are spread out, four of those will operate, one of them will operated by our partner, and I think of those only one will be a horizontal test initially and part of that is based on the desire to get the data that we need to make the call on that and part also on rig capabilities.  Based on success in those five then we'll decide how many more wells we want to drill around those pilot areas and those would probably be &#x2013; some of those will be focused toward the horizontals then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you the operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are the operator of about of it.  We've got about 600,000 acres gross out there, we've got a 50% interest in all of it and we operate a portion of it and we've got a partner that operates the other portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess the final question, I may have missed it, did you ever mention North Louisiana and Haynesville exposure, I know that's the other hot play everyone's running with, and I can't remember if you ever commented on that?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, this is Colglazier.  We haven't commented on it per se expect to point out that we do have the two anchor-ins that have been out in the industry with a, on a gross basis about 90,000 acres in the Carthage area, and a little over 20,000 acres as a non-operator in the Elm Grove area.  So from the anchor positions on the Haynesville area that's been defined, we do have a significant position, but we haven't moved forward with anything yet. We're going to sit back and watch what others do before we evaluate it ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess the final exploratory on the lower Tertiary well that you will drill, would you be operator on that or you just participating with somebody else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we will be operator on that, and we should spout here in the next month, I think.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just couple of follow up questions, the pressure data for the new discovery, does that suggest that the, all three reservoirs are connected? Or, all three wells are connected in Ghana?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Gil, in Ghana, yeah, there's a good information on the static pressure that we've got communication all the way between the three wells.  We are very confident about that. That gives us that 2000 foot column that we had in the press release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the flow data, would that give you, dynamic pressure data, would that give you the quality of that connection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The dynamic data is going to give us the quality of the reservoir and potentially some more information about compartmentalization, but this going to be a, this test is going to be a fairly short-term test.  I think its 24 hour flow test.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to get just the tremendous amount other than near well bore deliverability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you also made a comment about preserving the reservoir energy because of the large reservoir.  Can you talk, and you said, could there be gas gap, you just haven't touched it yet and how do you, is this water drive or is it, is it depletion drive, what you think the mechanism is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gil, that's part of the delineation program, we're undertaking right now to define all that.  The flow data that we received to-date certainly indicates the possibility of gas gap, so an additional up dip test might be in the offing as we as we finish our delineation program to define that.  These sands seem to be very continuous as evidenced by the pressure data that Bob mentioned earlier, which will give you a support for a water ground, but we will likely supplement that water ground, because it's so large, and we anticipate some fairly high rates coming from the field.  And that combination would almost require you to inject water.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then moving on to Independence Hub again, Cheyenne number 3 was going to come online, could you just talk about, you know, is that to replace any declining wells at Cheyenne or other wells, or does it increase volumes there, give you a greater share of the production at the Independence Hub?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we drilled the well, it came in its very successful.  We've now completed it and are in the process of hooking it up to the Cheyenne flow line system.  It essentially gives us additional capacity.  We have plans for that for the next two or three years to maintain our production position in the Hub.  Our Hub volumes, we have roughly 60% of the nameplate capacity and so, you know, we're just planning to continue to keep it, keep it filled for as long as possible, and we have a schedule of wells through time to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, just to increase the longevity of your production there?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>You have a follow-up question from the line of David Tameron with Wachovia.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, one more question. You mentioned in response to the question, talking about Rockies and pipeline dig rate capacity.  And realizing you're hedge, primarily for, basis hedge for 2008, if you look at summer differentials or the weather differentials and they are 250 for next winter, what's your take on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Karl Kurz.  David, I mean we watch differential. As you know have basically 100% of our equity covered through firm transportation hedges.  Some very good numbers we've hedged out in the Mid-Continent and those range all the way out to 2010.  So when we see why now from a short term perspective with growth of our hedges make them look very good in the money, we are monitoring it, we do see additional capacity being brought into the equation out there like Clay mentioned earlier with three potential projects.  The timing of those is going to be critical, but they can get in there by late 2010 or 2011, what is help narrow that differential back down.</p>
          <p>But right now we feel &#x2013; in fact we've managed our base exposure very well, with regards to the Rockies for at least the next two to three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Karl, but if you look at winter I guess 2008 going into 2009, does 250 look like a right number, does that feel like a number to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, yeah, I'm hesitant to tell you our call on the basis market because we are active in managing those markets.  And so for us to state our position with regards to what we think is the right number, wrong number, when we have one of the largest producers, I think would, would not be a wise for us to this point, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Enterprise is the operators, you're aware, the leak that was detected is actually a leak in the bonnet in the riser system and so what's physically happening is we are isolating that bonnet, taking it off and repairing a gasket that's inside that flange in the mine.  And then putting it all back together, removing the isolation and, and place it back on, online.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a description of what's going to happen in general, but what's happening right now? Is, I'm being a little more direct with you, because it's pretty influential with gas markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are just in the process of doing that, that very operation that I've have talked about and, and Enterprise has given a clear indication of when they anticipate to be completed through that process.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>And Bob let me add I know there is a, we get a lot of questions on, moment-by-moment activities Independence Hub, but its very sensitive with regards to the gas market, so we shy away from providing those moment-by-moment updates, once again because of the significant impact it could have on price.</p>
