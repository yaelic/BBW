      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our 82nd quarterly conference call. This is Laura Graves of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by John Chambers, our Chairman and CEO; Frank Calderoni, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Lloyd, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations; Ned Hooper, Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of our Consumer Business; and Padmasree Warrior, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President; and Blair Christie, Senior Vice President of Global Corporate Communications.</p>
          <p>The Q4 fiscal year 2010 press release is on the U.S. High Tech Marketwire and on the Cisco web at newsroom.cisco.com. I would like to remind you that we have a corresponding webcast with slides, and in those slides you will find the financial information that we cover during this call, as well as additional financial metrics and analysis that you may find helpful. Additionally, downloadable Q4 financial statements will also be made available following the call, including revenue by product and geography, income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information. Balance sheets and cash flow statements can be found on our website also in the Investor Relations section. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access the webcast slides and these documents.</p>
          <p>A replay of this call will be made available via telephone from August 11 through August 18 at 866-357-4205 or 203-369-0122 for international callers. A replay will also be available from August 11 through October 22 on Cisco's Investor Relations website at investor.cisco.com.</p>
          <p>Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Our commentary today will be providing information on both our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2010 financial results, and the financial results in the press release are unaudited.</p>
          <p>The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in our detailed documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Laura. Based in part on the feedback from a number of you, we are going to try a new format for this quarter's conference call, the objective being to share more information in a tighter format while leaving more time for Q&amp;A at the end of the call. Please do not hesitate to give us your feedback in terms of the effectiveness of this new format.</p>
          <p>We will break the call into four sections. In the first section, I will provide a high level financial review of the quarter, followed by a discussion, primarily in financial terms, on geographies, customer segments, and products. I will then briefly describe our progress on our long-term strategy, first in terms of progress on that strategy from a technology and a business architectural perspective, and then on how our new business models and dynamic organization structures are enabling speed, scale, flexibility, and growth in new markets. And finally, we will provide our guidance for Q1 FY '11 with all the appropriate caveats.</p>
          <p>During the second section, Frank will provide a review of fiscal year 2010 and provide additional details on Q4 as well as expand on our Q1 fiscal year '11 guidance and resource investments.</p>
          <p>In the third section of the call we will focus on business momentum in terms of what we can control and influence, our expanding business and partnership position with our customers, with focus on key issues on their mind, including what they are saying in terms of the economy, job creation, and momentum, and the relationship with Cisco. In this section each quarter, we will cover our progress in several new market adjacencies. Some of the adjacencies' growth opportunities may be tied to economy, and others may be new markets for us and at times new for the entire industry.</p>
          <p>In the fourth section, we will wrap up with Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Now beginning with the opening section, from a high level perspective, there are a number of key takeaways from the results in Q1 FY '10 and our momentum going into Q1 FY '11. First, this was a very strong quarter for Cisco, and we closed FY '10 in a tremendous position of strength. We have a compelling financial position, a well tuned innovation engine, and have shown solid execution on our growth strategy. It is a real pleasure to return to our desired operating position in the markets to once again announce a number of record financial results achieved this quarter.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we had record revenue of 10.8 billion, a 27% year-over-year increase, which was at the higher end of our guidance provided last quarter of 25 to 28%. Record non-GAAP operating income of 3.1 billion was a year-over-year increase of 39%. Non-GAAP net income was 2.5 billion, a 36% year-over-year increase, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.43, a year-over-year increase of 39%. All of these were also records. Other Q4 financials that were also very strong included GAAP earnings per share of $0.33, an increase of 74% year over year.</p>
          <p>Expense management continued to be very tight, with operating expenses at 35.4% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year over year versus a 27% increase for revenues. Therefore, as you would expect, productivity remained very strong at 622,000 per person in Q4, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 20% from Q4 fiscal year '09's 517,000 per employee.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, these results are extremely positive proof in terms of the effectiveness of our organization structure, business models, innovation, and execution capabilities, while focusing on over 30 major new market adjacencies at the same time.</p>
          <p>Product book-to-bill was slightly above one. Cash generated from operations was a very strong 3.2 billion, bringing our total cash including investments to 39.9 billion. We repurchased 2.3 billion of stock during the quarter or 99 million shares at an average price of $23.33 per share. The remaining authorized repurchase amount under the stock repurchase program was approximately 7 billion at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We also delivered on our hiring projections, with an incremental increase of approximately 2,000 additions to the Cisco team in Q4 FY '10, not including acquisitions. This follows on our last quarter's new hires, again not including acquisitions, of over 1,000 people in Q3 fiscal year '10. It is our intent to continue to hire in proportion to our global business assuming support from government decisions on private job creation in the U.S. This quarter, we added over 70% of the additions in the U.S. and over 600 of those in California.</p>
          <p>In summary, from a financial perspective, we exit Q4 FY '10 in a tremendous position of strength from a financial, execution, innovation, and a growth strategy perspective.</p>
          <p>The second area I would like to now cover is a high level geographic overview, which is the primary way we run our business, and one which we felt would be a key area of interest given some of the uncertainties from a global perspective. The discussion for this section will be on product orders in terms of year-over-year growth. From a global perspective, Q4 product orders grew 23% from a year-over-year perspective.</p>
          <p>Now on to the individual geographies; in Q4 FY '10, our four largest theaters had extremely good balanced order growth between 20% and 35% from a year-over-year perspective. Emerging markets led the way with 35% growth year over year. Europe was second, with very solid growth in the mid-20s year over year, while Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and Canada theaters came in with growth of approximately 20% year over year. Japan, which accounts for only 3.5% of our product orders, was flat in Q4 from a year-over-year perspective.</p>
          <p>The key takeaway from a country perspective was once again the balance across our top 15 countries. In Q4 in 13 of the top 15 countries, orders grew in double digits year over year. Two of our top 15 countries, India and Switzerland, grew over 50% in Q4 from a year-over-year perspective. Three countries grew in the 40s, including Canada, Brazil and Mexico. Three others, including Australia, France, and Russia, grew approximately 30% or better, while China, the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands grew approximately 20% or better. Italy and Germany grew in high single digits year over year.</p>
          <p>Now on to the customer segments; again in Q4, total product orders grew about 23% year over year. The balance across our customer segments from an order perspective was very solid, ranging from growth in the high teens in service providers to high 20s in the commercial marketplace. The public sector and enterprise segments grew approximately 23 to 25% year over year, while the consumer was flat year over year. Across our four major theaters, balance was fairly similar by customer segment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to products, which we traditionally discuss in terms of revenue, our Advanced Technologies grew in Q4 year over year at approximately 27%. Switching also grew at 27%. And routing, after a very strong Q3, grew at 15% year over year. Of particular interest within key product families, the CRS product family grew revenue approximately 20% year over year, and is now at an annualized run rate of approximately 1.2 billion. The ASR family grew 150% year over year, and is now at an annualized run rate of approximately 1 billion. The Nexus family, with an annualized run rate of over 2 billion, grew approximately 325% year over year.</p>
          <p>The UCS product family continued with an awesome performance, with the number of new customers growing approximately 90% from Q3 to Q4 to now over 1,700 total customers. From an advanced technology perspective, security revenues grew over 50% in Q4. Unified communication revenues grew over 20%. Wireless grew over 30%, and storage grew approximately 20%. The network home was down a little over 10%. Our video systems grew in the high 30s year over year. Again, as we said in last quarter's conference call, we are gaining market share in many of these categories.</p>
          <p>As we all are aware, the industry has experienced supply chain constraints over the past year. While the situation is improving, as expected, we continue to see challenging procurement of components this quarter. I mentioned on the Q3 conference call that we'd be aggressive to help meet customer expectations. It was the right thing to do for our customers and our business.</p>
          <p>Supplier lead times now appear to have stabilized, but are still longer than we would like. However, we made significant progress, and product lead times to customers are now within the normal range for the vast majority of our products, and we expect to continue to make improvements.</p>
          <p>As we also discussed in a fair amount of detail on the last conference call, we could not be more pleased with how our new organization structure built around dynamic network organization combined with new business models around vision, differentiated strategy, and execution are enabling an extremely competitive structure in terms of speed, scale, flexibility, and replication. We will periodically expand on these very strategic differentiation capabilities for Cisco in future conference calls.</p>
          <p>Our success in both the individual market adjacencies and the interdependency between adjacencies has been even stronger than we anticipated. These large opportunities include key emerging countries, data center virtualization, cloud, video, consumer, and collaboration, all of which have been an extension of current area focus. At the same time, there are a number of other areas that are almost completely new markets for us such as Smart Grid, virtual healthcare, media solutions, sports and entertainment, Smart+Connected communities, where we have a very limited install base, and therefore growth will be entirely new to Cisco.</p>
          <p>Our business in Q4 continued to grow at a very strong rate and mathematically would indicate very solid growth over the upcoming quarter. We feel very good about those areas that we can control or influence. However, balancing this strong optimism, there are some challenges that are contributing to an unusual amount of conservatism and even caution.</p>
          <p>In short, we see the same opportunities and challenges that you are reading about in regards to the market, those challenges ranging from GDP growth and future GDP projections continuing to slow in the U.S., job creation challenges, and concerns coming out of Europe, just to mention a few. We are seeing a large number of mixed signals in both the market and from our customers' expectations. And we think the words "unusual uncertainty" are an accurate description of what is occurring.</p>
          <p>The Federal Reserve's comments yesterday that the pace and output of the recovery have slowed in recent months and that the recovery is likely to be more modest in the near term than has been anticipated just a few months ago are comments that most of our large customers that I talked with recently would agree with. Also, the same customers would agree with few exceptions that they still expect a very gradual return to more normal economic conditions.</p>
          <p>In summary, on those areas that we can control or influence from an innovation point of view or an operational execution point of view, we feel we are extremely well positioned. Almost all of our product families are in the early stages of their life cycle and gaining solid momentum, as we discussed earlier. Balance across geographies and customer segments remains very good. Even after four sequential quarters of growth, our Q4 results versus Q4 a year ago were above our long-term goals of 12 to 17%. And given reasonable economic growth and execution, that continues to be an appropriate long-term goal for Cisco's trajectory.</p>
          <p>So as many of you would expect, we are going to focus on what we can control and influence, as we have done in each of the periods of uncertainty, and we're going to be very aggressive in terms of investing resources in the new market adjacencies, where we are also gaining very good momentum both from an innovation thought leadership perspective as well as a business perspective. This is where the strength of our financial model and our ability to generate cash and profits comes into play. You will see us continue to invest aggressively in R&amp;D, sales and marketing, and our talent.</p>
          <p>As we have said in conference calls over many years, Cisco will always be affected by major economic changes, capital spending patterns, new and existing competitors, potential issues affecting our suppliers, and our ability to execute or not on our strategy, and other factors such as discussed in our SEC filings. For purpose of our long-range goals as well as our quarterly guidance, we are also assuming that our vision of how the industry and the market will evolve will be accurate, and we will effectively execute on that vision. We are confident in our strategy.</p>
          <p>With this discussion in mind, our revenue guidance for Q1 FY '11, including our usual caveats as discussed earlier and in our financial reports, is for revenue growth to increase 18 to 20% year over year.</p>
          <p>Frank will continue with detailed guidance in the next section. Now I'd like to turn it over to you, Frank.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. For today's call, I will first comment on first our full fiscal year 2010 results and then provide some additional detail on our fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>From a financial perspective, this was an outstanding fiscal 2010 and a very strong quarter for Cisco. With an extremely robust financial model, we continue to grow non-GAAP operating and net income faster than revenue, even with increased investment and an expanding portfolio of products and services.</p>
          <p>Let me start with our full fiscal year performance. Total revenue for fiscal year 2010 was a record $40 billion, an increase over FY '09 revenue of $36.1 billion. Switching revenue ended the year at 13.6 billion, up 12% year over year. Routing revenue was 6.6 billion, an increase of 4% over last fiscal year. And Advanced Technologies revenue was up 6% year over year to $9.6 billion. Total services revenue was approximately $7.6 billion, growth of 9% in fiscal year 2010.</p>
          <p>Total non-GAAP gross margin for fiscal year 2010 was 65.2%, up 0.2 percentage point year over year. For products only, non-GAAP gross margin of 65.1% was up 0.2 percentage point compared with FY '09, primarily due to cost savings and volume, partially offset by pricing and discounts. Non-GAAP services gross margins were unchanged year over year.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses were $14.4 billion in FY '10, up from 13.7 billion in FY '09. As a percentage of revenue, our non-GAAP operating expenses were consistent with our stated goals to invest in FY '10 as well as the changing mix in our business.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2010 was $9.4 billion, up approximately 19% from fiscal year 2009's non-GAAP net income of $8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal year 2010 were $1.61, up from $1.35 in fiscal year 2009, representing a 19% increase year over year.</p>
          <p>GAAP net income for fiscal year 2010 was 7.8 billion or $1.33 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to 6.1 billion or $1.05 per share on a fully diluted basis in fiscal 2009, and this represents year-over-year increases of 27% for both measures.</p>
          <p>Now with a review of our Q4 results, total revenue for the quarter was $10.8 billion, and our total product revenue of 8.8 billion was up 31% year over year. Switching revenue was 3.6 billion, an increase of 27% year over year. Our modular switching revenue was up approximately 36% year over year, and our fixed switching revenue increased 20% year over year. Routing revenue was 1.7 billion, up 15% year over year. And we saw increases of 22% in high end, 11% in low end, and a decrease of 6% in midrange year over year. Advanced Technologies had revenue totaling 2.6 billion, representing an increase of 27% year over year.</p>
          <p>Other product revenue totaled $924 million, an increase of approximately 139% year over year. The year-over-year growth was due to the inclusion of sales from Tandberg, acquired in April of 2010, which performed during the quarter as expected; a full quarter of revenue from Flip Video as compared to Q4 FY '09, and strong growth in Unified Computing Systems.</p>
          <p>Total services revenue was approximately $2 billion, up approximately 12% year over year, driven by strength in both advanced and technical support services.</p>
          <p>Total revenue across all geographic segments increased on a year-over-year basis, ranging from an increase of approximately 7% in Japan to 57% in the emerging markets theater.</p>
          <p>Q4 FY '10 total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.1%, down 1.1 points quarter over quarter and down 1.2 points year over year. For product only, non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 63.6%, down 1.7 points quarter over quarter. We saw an approximate one percentage point impact on margin as a result of higher manufacturing related costs, due primarily to the constraints in our supply chain and its impact on our linearity, which was incremental to our typical variances.</p>
          <p>We also saw an unfavorable mix impact driven by numerous recent product introductions. Consistent with historical experience, we expect to see positive benefit from ongoing cost savings from component costs and value engineering over time. The remainder of the decrease in product margins was driven by pricing and higher discounts, partially offset by cost savings and higher volumes.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP product gross margin was down 1.1 percentage points. This was primarily driven by higher manufacturing related costs associated with supply chain constraints, unfavorable mix, pricing and higher discounts, partially offset by the cost savings and higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 65.9%, up 1.1 percentage points over last quarter and down 1.6 points year over year. Services margin typically experiences variability over time due to various factors such as the changes in mix between technical support and advanced services, as well as the timing of contract initiations and our renewals.</p>
          <p>Total gross margin by theater ranged from approximately 59% for Asia-Pacific to approximately 72% in Japan. Total gross margin for Asia-Pacific decreased quarter over quarter due to a product mix as well as a pre-acquisition adjustment related to Tandberg. The emerging markets increase was driven by higher volume and improved services gross margin, partially offset by product mix.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately 3.8 billion in Q4, up approximately 2% quarter over quarter, driven primarily by the inclusion of expenses from Tandberg and increased investments. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up approximately 15% year over year, driven by investments in sales, marketing, and R&amp;D, as well as the inclusion of Tandberg and Starent expenses.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax charge to GAAP operating expenses of 120 million due to real estate impairments and charges related to excess facilities.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP interest and other income was $91 million for Q4, while GAAP interest and other income was 93 million for the fourth quarter of FY '10.</p>
          <p>Our Q4 FY '10 non-GAAP tax provision rate was 21.5%.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, representing an increase of 36% year over year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 23.1%, up 1.6 percentage points from Q4 FY '09.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter were $0.43 per share versus $0.31 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, a 39% increase year over year. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was 1.9 billion as compared to 1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter were $0.33 versus $0.19 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2009.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to be very strong, providing us with significant financial flexibility. The total of cash, cash equivalents, and investments for the quarter was $39.9 billion, up 755 million from last quarter.</p>
          <p>On to AR, accounts receivable, our receivables balance was $4.9 billion at the end of Q4, up from 4.1 billion at the end of Q3 FY '10. Days sales outstanding or DSO was 41 days, up from 39 days at the end of Q3, and up from 34 days at the end of Q4 FY '09. As compared to Q3, DSO reflects an increase of two days as a result of timing of shipments, partially offset by very strong collections.</p>
          <p>Total inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.3 billion, up approximately 6% quarter over quarter. Non-GAAP inventory turns were 12.1 this quarter, up one point from last quarter and up 0.8 point from Q4 of last year. As mentioned last quarter, we have been aggressive in ensuring we could procure components to meet customers' delivery dates. Inventory purchase commitments at the end of Q4 were $4.3 billion, an increase of approximately 7% from the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>While we are pleased that the product lead times to our customers have improved, challenges at some of our component suppliers continue. Our best estimate is that these challenges could continue throughout the remainder of calendar 2010.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue was $11.1 billion at the end of Q4, up approximately 8% quarter over quarter and an increase of approximately 18% compared with Q4 FY '09. Deferred product revenue was $3.7 billion, and deferred services revenue was approximately $7.4 billion, increases of approximately 26% and 14% year over year respectively.</p>
          <p>Product backlog at the end of fiscal year 2010 was $4.1 billion as compared to 3.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q4, our head count totaled 70,714, a net increase of approximately 2,100 from last quarter.</p>
          <p>As we move to the portion of the call that includes detailed guidance, let me remind you again that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In light of Regulation FD, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As has been our standing practice for some time, we are continuing provide detailed quarterly guidance one quarter at a time.</p>
          <p>In light of the unusual uncertainty in the macro environment, including the comments we heard from the Federal Reserve yesterday, we encourage you to continue to model conservatively, especially in the short term. It is important that expectations do not get ahead of where the market is today. We do intend to budget in two halves for our fiscal year and we'll obviously be conservative, and we would suggest you do the same. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP.</p>
          <p>For Q1 FY '11, we anticipate total revenue to be up approximately 18 to 20% year over year.</p>
          <p>As we have said in the past, forecasting gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as volume, product mix, variable component cost, customer and channel mix, as well as competitive pricing pressures. That being said, we believe total gross margin in Q1 will be approximately 64%, reflecting the revenue guidance I just shared with you. We expect to see a margin profile in Q1 similar to what we saw in Q4, especially in light of the supply environment. As we continue to see improvement in the supply chain, we expect total gross margins to be in the 64 to 65% range.</p>
          <p>We believe Q1 operating expenses will be approximately 37 to 38% of revenue. We also expect interest and other income to be approximately $10 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our tax provision rate for Q1 is expected to be approximately 22%.</p>
          <p>We are modeling share count to be down approximately 40 million shares quarter over quarter in weighted average shares outstanding for EPS purposes. In this estimate of share count, we are not taking into consideration any further change in stock price that could occur in the first quarter of fiscal year '11. While we expect to continue our share repurchase program, it is difficult to predict the exact weighted average shares outstanding. As a point of reference, a $1 movement in our average stock price would change the calculated shares outstanding for purposes of determining earnings per share by approximately 17 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash flow from operations, we expect to generate 1.2 to 1.5 billion during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>For our Q1 FY '11 GAAP earnings, we anticipate that GAAP EPS will be $0.08 to $0.10 per share lower than non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to stock compensation expense and acquisition related charges. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for further detail.</p>
          <p>Other than those items noted above, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring, and tax or other events which may or may not be significant.</p>
          <p>In summary, the quality of our earnings is exceptional as demonstrated by the strong operating cash flow generated during the quarter and our almost 40 billion in cash and investments. During the fiscal year 2010, we generated over $10 billion in operating cash and saw growth in our deferred revenue, working capital, backlog, and cash and investments. We intend to continue to use this strong financial position to expand our portfolio and deliver a compelling value proposition for our investors, partners, customers, and our employees.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call back to you, John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Frank. Now moving on to the third chapter, which is really focused on positioning Cisco for the next fiscal year and beyond just Q1 FY '11, we try to make all of our major decisions not on the next quarter or even the next year but where we want to be three to five years from now. This is where we start internal discussions, whether the topic is on direction of the industry, the company, new product opportunities, or other specific issues. Our business models focus on a vision of how the topic plays out thinking five years plus, the potential for a differentiated strategy in two to four years, and only then a discussion of where we're going to do and what we're going to do for the next year, that is our execution plan.</p>
          <p>While there are many factors that we cannot control or influence such as the economy, compensation, some of the supply chain challenges, impact of government regulations, et cetera, the majority of the future is under our own control, and we have an unusually strong balance in our business and customer deliverables, which becomes even stronger in times of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>In many of our customers' opinions, they view us as not only being safe and secure during periods of rapid change, but also a very innovative technology and business partner that can help them achieve their goals. And in increasing numbers, they recognize the value of our ability not just to move into new market adjacencies with the network driving innovation and with our dynamic organization structure, but also architecturally combine these adjacencies in a way that we believe will be the future for the entire industry. We obviously have a large head start on many of our peers, and we fully tend to apply additional resources to expand this lead.</p>
          <p>In many of these new market adjacencies, Cisco has very little install base to protect and are often new markets themselves such as cloud, Smart Grid, sports and entertainment, media solutions, virtual healthcare, virtual education, and key new emerging countries. The common underlying theme here is that the network is transforming each of these industries.</p>
          <p>Over the years, we have continuously demonstrated a track record to lead in product, market share, as well as innovation. And in my opinion, our innovation engine is accelerating even faster driven by new business models, the organization structure, and the power of a dynamic network organization. As we discussed earlier, we believe that we have the ability to lead in almost every one of our established product categories in terms of product innovation leadership, market share gain, and share of total customer IT communication spend as a core Cisco strength. While market share may fluctuate based on shipments, supply chain challenges, and our unique quarter end dates, our year-over-year growth numbers for routing, switching, and Advanced Technology are very strong.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to provide a brief update in terms of our new market opportunities; first, virtualization. As the power of the network, server, storage, and software comes together, we have uniquely positioned Cisco with our new Nexus product family, UCS, and our partnership with EMC, VMware and Intel. We are leading this architectural approach and gaining rapid customer acceptance.</p>
          <p>Barring a major surprise, with all the appropriate caveats, we expect you to see some key large wins in this area during the next year. This has put an expanding pressure on our industry peers to make similar architectural moves. As you would expect, these wins often play out in terms of revenue over three to five years.</p>
          <p>As you see a number of our peers adjust to our successes, we believe that you will see them form similar partnerships and move in acquisitions. My view on acquisitions has not changed. Even though Cisco is usually very successful in this area, the vast majority of acquisitions have been and will continue to be unsuccessful.</p>
          <p>Innovation as defined through internal development, internal startups, acquisitions, and partnerships remains one of Cisco's strongest sustainable differentiations versus our industry peers. For example, the Tandberg acquisition combined with our TelePresence had a very strong quarter with year-over-year Q4 growth of approximately 40%, with total products and service orders of approximately 370 million.</p>
          <p>Another example of moving into new markets or rapidly expanding existing markets would be the Starent acquisition. The Starent acquisition is continuing to have very strong momentum, with growth of approximately 20% in terms of year-over-year from a quarter perspective. As we said in last quarter's conference call, with all of our normal caveats, both of these areas have markets that could support growth with good execution in the mid-20s this next year.</p>
          <p>Our continued expansion into new emerging technologies through internal startups, acquisitions, and partnerships is being led by Marthin De Beer, and his team continues to execute extremely well in this very challenging area.</p>
          <p>While TelePresence as part of the Emerging Technologies group had a very strong quarter, so did many other areas of the Emerging Technology group such as digital media systems and business security, with year-over-year orders growth of approximately 50% or higher. Again, these are relatively small numbers and it will be several years before they will be as material as we hope, but it is this philosophy of continuously doing new startups and then managing the portfolio to become material in the five-year range and therefore fueling our future growth just as we've done in the past.</p>
          <p>Our investments in what we call targeted emerging countries, of which there are four today, have been very successful as well. These countries are achieving both our growth and business partnership objectives. These investments are way beyond just a sales force or a sales focus. They usually include business development, manufacturing, engineering, services, strategic partnerships, corporate social responsibility, government affairs, and other key functions of Cisco to deliver on our strategy in these countries. Two of the four are recent additions, Mexico and Russia, and have gotten off to a great start with year-over-year order growth of over 40% and 30% respectively in Q4, and very strong partnerships with key enterprise and public sector customers.</p>
          <p>There are a number of other market adjacencies that are in internal development; that is, if successful, are several years away from being material from a financial perspective. But due to the potential to develop into very strong markets for us, these include Smart Grid, Smart+Connected communities, virtual healthcare, media solutions, and sports and entertainment.</p>
          <p>Using Smart Grid as an example, we built an internal team of over 100 people, and have attracted some of the top industry experts to the leadership team. Many potential customers view us as a top thought leader and innovation leader in this area. And at the end of Q4, with the launch of our new Smart Grid products, we began receiving our first orders.</p>
          <p>I could go on and talk about another 10 to 12 areas and probably will over the course of future calls. However, the key takeaway is our ability to be an innovation and an execution engine is truly unique across our industry.</p>
          <p>We are just starting to see the benefits as customers begin to understand there are not 30-plus separate areas, but are tied together architecturally and very applicable in combination in the organization. As you would expect, each of these requires resources well in advance of revenues becoming material to the bottom line. Again, we believe this will be very difficult for our peers to implement without an organization structure and business models that we talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>From a customer's perspective, we continue to gain momentum with both the CIOs and CEOs. In today's environment, Cisco's ability to make in a difference in achieving the top priorities of the CEO and the CIO has never been greater. Most CEOs' top priorities are remarkably simple. First, cut costs and drive productivity in a rapidly changing and uncertain environment. And at the same time, they understand they can't cut costs away through cutting expenses to achieve the long-term profits. They must also innovate and begin to grow. And that's their second objective, which is developing new and expanding and existing revenue opportunities.</p>
          <p>The CIO's top priorities are relatively simple as well: First, to have IT really be relevant to the top priorities of their company; and second, to enable the business goals of their CEOs. We have had more of these high level relationships with CEOs and CIOs develop at a very detailed level in the last year and a half than we have in the prior decade in terms of their relationships with Cisco. Again, this speaks to the rapidly changing role of Cisco in our customer accounts.</p>
          <p>Each quarter many of you ask me in different ways the following question. Your results indicate your strategy is working. What are the areas that you have the most concern about? The answer for me this quarter is I'm concerned about what my customers are concerned about. And most of these customer concerns are centered on what they view as mixed signals in their business environment; therefore, their strategy in the short term in terms of investments and projections for their businesses.</p>
          <p>As an example, the economy continues to be on the wild card in many customers' minds. We are all aware of GDP growth in the U.S. slowing from 5% from 3.7 to 2.4% over the last three quarters. Many of the customers we talk with are anticipating growth of only 2% or so in the second half of the calendar year. Yet at the same time, many of these same customers are seeing steadily improving results in their own companies. But when you press them on their comfort level to predict either of these trends over the next year, candidly, many of them are not comfortable at all. This is just one of the many examples of today's uncertainty and environment that is sending such mixed signals to us and others about the customers' capital spending and job creation intentions over the next year.</p>
          <p>Another example of mixed signals would be our own product order pattern for Q4. On first review, the 23% year-over-year growth in product orders was obviously very strong. And the monthly results, which we tend to follow in terms of linearity, were well within our normal expectations in each of the three months in Q4; in fact, actually almost exactly on as a percentage of what we would have expected in each month. However, several of our customers shared with me that they saw a softening in their business in the second half of June and early July.</p>
          <p>Upon review, we saw a similar pattern of approximately four to five weeks from mid-June to mid-July where the normal order growth rates were off over 10 points versus our quarterly 23% average. Normally, I would not have paid much attention to this except this is the exact time period where we saw the challenges in Europe and the corresponding challenges in global stock markets. Then just as the quarter had started in May, the end of July was very strong, well above average for the quarter in terms of year-over-year growth rates from an order perspective.</p>
          <p>Operating in an uncertain environment can obviously be difficult, but if you watch our track record over the last two decades, I believe this is one of Cisco's core strengths. And we have always used these periods of uncertainty to move into new markets and to expand our share of existing markets.</p>
          <p>We are the best positioned we have ever been in terms of timing, new organization structures, new business models, and 30-plus market adjacencies, all enabled by the expanding role of the network as a platform for all forms of communications and IT, which is at the heart of our core competency at Cisco. So while we are very much aware of the challenges and hopefully we have done a reasonable job of sharing those challenges that we are seeing with you today, I don't think there are any big surprises here.</p>
          <p>Our opportunities and successes in so many of these new markets are almost unprecedented in our industry. We feel very good about our ability to rapidly move into these markets and lead in many of them. Will we make some mistakes along the way? Of course we will. Otherwise, we are not taking enough good business risk. In simple terms, we believe that this is an opportunity of a lifetime for us, and candidly we're going to go for it.</p>
          <p>We are planning on adding over 3,000 people in the next several quarters. Again, this is a very direct message about our comfort level and our strategy and our ability to move into new market adjacencies.</p>
          <p>As we say that, we will follow Cisco's normal conservatism in terms of our business decisions, financial models, with a healthy paranoia. We are attempting to be conservative on our guidance in terms of revenue growth, as you would expect given the mixed signals in the market. We will at the same time make the investments at this crucial juncture in many of our market adjacencies and opportunities.</p>
          <p>In summary, in terms of what we can control and influence, we feel really good.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to thank the entire Cisco family for their dedication, loyalty, and sacrifices during these challenging economic times. I cannot be more pleased with how we are positioned for the future. As always, I also want to thank our shareholders, customers, and partners for their support and continued confidence in our ability to execute during rapid industry consolidation, market transition, and challenging economic times.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. If I look through your numbers, your routers and switches, where you have new products, are down this quarter. And then gross margin disappointed. The operating margin declined second quarter in a row, and the guidance was weak, below our expectations. So the question is, if we combine all these data points, the question is, what we are seeing, is it something which is specific to Cisco, timing or mix, or is it more the economy and signs that we're entering into another dip in IT spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me break it into several pieces, Tal, because the questions that are on many people's minds, I disagree with some of your statements on the facts, but let me cover the generalities.</p>
          <p>We are very comfortable with our growth for a $40 billion company over the longer term with the goals of 12 to 17%. And I've said many times that is in my opinion a B job. I do believe we started into this economic upturn probably several quarters earlier than our peers. And including this most recent quarter's, it's five quarters in a row where we've had very solid sequential order growth versus what you normally see sequentially, which is a nice way of saying we're now moving into normal comparisons. We are comfortable that with normal comparisons being up 18 to 20% year over year is again above the guidance or the goals that we've set for the long term and something that we do believe will position us very well within the industry.</p>
          <p>In terms of routing and switching, I respectfully disagree on the switching numbers. You've watched us both in modular and fixed both this quarter and last quarter. You're talking about growth last quarter of 40% and I think 27% this quarter. Those numbers are really good, and you add up total switching, that's hard for anybody to keep up with, and yet we had the largest position in the market.</p>
          <p>In terms of routing, our product line is really solid, really good. You might categorize some of the products differently based upon the IGS and the new categories within the IGS. But in terms of high end routing, last quarter the CRS being up 75%, this quarter 28%, you add those numbers together, we're doing very well.</p>
          <p>We don't lose much at the edge anymore, which is where, Tal, you might have been critical of us a year ago at the edge with the ASR, the growth on the ASR numbers I shared with you, which I think were 150% year over year. Those products are hot, and we're winning the majority of new edge jump balls, very well positioned.</p>
          <p>And again at the access level, we have by far and away the largest position. We're doing some category changes within that. So I feel very, very good on that. So if you look at where we're going, I hope I'm here in front of many times apologizing for growth only being 27%, growth next quarter 18 to 20, above our long-term goals of 12 to 17%.</p>
          <p>In terms of the caution that you're hearing, so in summary, in terms of Cisco specific, we feel really good. We're competing, we're winning. We're moving into new market adjacencies, organization structure is working. My confidence has never been higher. And candidly when you talk to customers, you hear the exact same thing, be they service providers, enterprise, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In terms of the economy, it's mixed signals. And Tal, what I've always done is been very candid with you all. We share with you the way we see it. We tend to be a cautious company. Hopefully, we are again being cautious this quarter, but cautious growth next quarter of 18 to 20% is not bad at all. So that would be how I'd answer your question, and not that we're making a call on the economy. The majority of my customers believe the economy is just going to continue slowly going up, but very slow, and not what they would have said even three or four months ago in terms of their expectations. And if I were to poll them, I'd say that probably the average comes in at about a 2% growth for the second half of the year. It doesn't mean those customers are right, but it does mean that's what on their mind in terms of their spending pattern.</p>
          <p>To answer your questions, we're not making a call on the economy going down. I think the probabilities on double-dip or whatever you want to call it are relatively low. We are not making a call on Cisco other than we think we're very bullish on Cisco and very comfortable with where we're positioned. We are calling it like we see it, Tal, and we've always done that for the last 20 years, and we'll do it for the future as well.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, John.</p>

          <p>Hey, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question around a comment you made earlier around seeing softening in your business mid-June to mid-July and then seeing an improvement late in July; were those across the same customers? And specifically, can you discuss what you're seeing in trends with enterprise spending domestically and with carriers in Europe, operators in Europe and their CapEx spending? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, Brian, if you look at it, this is again the mixed signals. As I said in the script, if you look at this purely mathematically, the trends feel really good. And our long-term growth expectation assuming a reasonable economy is 12 to 17%, and you'd have to put the mathematical odds on that happening at much higher than you would just a year ago. In terms of the mathematical trends, one of the most consistent has been U.S. enterprise, the U.S. commercial marketplace, U.S. service providers. They've been remarkably solid, Rob, literally across the board on that, and forecasts are good going into next quarter in these areas.</p>
          <p>Europe was perhaps the biggest surprise. We expected emerging markets to come back, and that's another positive. You are seeing them at 35% growth year over year. Within the European operations, it did not have as tough a quarter as we thought that it might. And remember in last quarter's conference call when everybody was very concerned, we thought that Europe had a reasonable shot of growing close to 20% give or take a couple points, and they actually grew at 25. Balance across Europe was pretty good. Even in southern Europe, I think, Rob, southern Europe was probably an example of really good execution by our leadership team. We had Italy actually grow at 9 or 10% and Spain grow at 20. But for Europe to grow at 25% overall, that was probably the strongest piece.</p>
          <p>In terms of the mix on it, Europe from a commercial perspective was very solid. Enterprise perspective was solid. Public sector was good. Service providers started to come up a little bit better, Rob, but probably in the 12% range, if I remember the numbers right. So while I don't think Europe will continue to be our number two out of the top four theaters, it is executing remarkably well, and things in the U.S., feel good from a numbers perspective.</p>
          <p>So this is where you get mixed signals. Our numbers feel good. You look at the mathematical trends, you say we're on our way up and out of this at a faster pace. You listen to the customers, you watch mixed signals, Fed's comments, et cetera, you say this feels a little bit tougher, and I'm having probably more trouble reading it than I ever have before. I usually have really strong opinions which way something is going to go, and this time it is mixed signals, and hopefully in another quarter we'll be able to give you a better feel for that, Brian. And that's why we'll budget in two sections during the year, the first half and then the second half. I hope that answered the question, okay, Brian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So, John, if we look at the components of your conservative guidance, what part of it is related to changes in order patterns or is the larger adjustment related to your closure rates due to the macro environment? Are you in essence giving Cisco some more breathing room? And in analyzing the mixed signals, does it feel as if we're at the beginning stages of another down cycle? Should we think about a possible down sequential January quarter following a possible down sequential October quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, we're not making a call on the economy. We're just sharing with you where we see it. And I know you're asking me a leading question in order to get more detail out. I feel very comfortable with our ability to compete in every product category. We have the best product lineup we've ever had. I think it's real important that the market &#x2013; all of us agree. You look at the stock price and you've got to say the market isn't buying that we can grow 12 to 17% consistently. And yet we're defending growing above that range when you're comparing true year-over-year comparisons in a tough economic time, which I think is pretty darn good performance.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the direction on things we can control or influence, I'll really comfortable. We'll get our market share gains. We've got good balance. We aren't seeing any unusual pricing issues. Our gross margin issues were due almost entirely to the problems we had on supply chain and a mix issue. And I do want to repeat. If I'm here for the next several years each of these quarter calls apologizing that we were at the high end of the 12 to 17 or over 17% growth, then I will do so.</p>
          <p>So what we're signaling is again we aren't calling the economy. You often call that and make your assumptions within it. We are certainly being conservative on it. But in terms of our own numbers, the mathematics, they feel very good. Are we conservative? Absolutely. Do we see mixed signals in the economy? Absolutely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. To what extent did do you guys use marketing programs or other incentives to drive the recovery and order rate that you saw in mid-July? And do you expect to continue those, if any, into the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think most of the market incentives and things of that type have an effect over a much longer time period. In fact, my marketing team would probably say I squeezed their budget pretty hard in the July time period and the direction. This is just normal orders. I wouldn't have even looked at this hard if I hadn't heard from customers they saw things in the latter half of June, early July, because you had to look at five weeks. You had to readjust for the July 4th weekend. You put the balance into that. And then at the end, I mean, Rob, your forecasting accuracy for the quarter was remarkably &#x2013; I think right on the money in terms of the approach. Started real strong first five or six weeks, we saw the middle bumps, and then very strong at the end. In fact, our last two weeks were strong, and they were off of a very strong Q4 of last year.</p>
          <p>I think those of you who follow us probably remember Q4 last year from Q3, we grew sequentially in terms of orders 17%. So by Q4 of last year, we were already well into the turnaround. We signaled that to you all almost a quarter before that, and so now this Q1 of next year is our sixth consecutive quarter in a row, and that's why it's real important when we talk about 18 to 20% growth, that in my opinion is really good. Perhaps did we let market expectations get ahead because we only talk a quarter at a time? Perhaps, but in terms of the growth rate, I couldn't be more pleased with where we are and our ability to gain market share in each category, Jeff. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you so much. John and Frank, I just wanted to ask you for a little bit more color on the gross margin. In particular, I heard you say that most of that was due to the component shortages. But that's something that you've been dealing with for a couple quarters now. And if anything with your purchase commitments going up significantly for a few quarters and your inventory going up, I would have thought that this would have become less of an issue this quarter, not more of an issue.</p>
          <p>And just related to that on the mix, I just wanted to clarify if you're referring to some of your new switching product introductions in the 2000 and 3000 family. And then lastly on mix, considering that consumers seem to have lagged some of the more infrastructural oriented products, I would have thought that would have been a positive from a mix perspective, not a negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in the sequence that you raise them, Simona, if you watch when you enter markets, let me do it at the thousand-foot level first. If you look at the decrease in product gross margins, approximately one point of that was due purely to expedites in terms of chasing parts. We chased, if you could imagine at the beginning of the quarter, 550 parts that were on critical components. We ended the quarter at 300. That normally runs below 100. Of those, those that I call revenue impacting or customer satisfactory impacting in the quarter, began the quarter at 150, ended the quarter at 50 on that. That's a lot of moving parts, and absolutely that is costly and very expensive, and air freighting stuff to customers and customer satisfaction, sales cycles, everything along that line.</p>
          <p>And no, that will continue a little bit into next quarter, but I do not want to have our radar out on lead times at this time, and I don't want to have any customer satisfaction issues. So for the first time in a year, we're getting very close to having most all of our products back with normal lead times within that, and it makes it much easier in terms of Rob's teams focusing on growth as opposed to responding to customer elements in it.</p>
          <p>Mix, when you introduce new products, every time we've done this, there are always some exceptions, especially when it's software. But in terms of hardware, we always start with lower gross margins on the new products. And to take you back a little bit in history, when we started on the switching originally, the team said, John, you're never going to get better than low 50% gross margins out of switching. It was at high 40s when we started on it, and we all know today it's way, way above average.</p>
          <p>When you introduce new products, and by definition Moore's Law is in effect, your price for it and your early component costs, et cetera, are not at the same gross margins normally as you see with an established product that you've really been fine tuning over the years et cetera, and that's normal. You almost get penalized for rapid take-ups because then they have more of an impact on gross margins to go with that. So when you have price performance improvements, which we do; when you gain market share, which we are gaining market share, and they are up to the billion and $2 billion run rates remarkably quick, with year-over-year growth that are off the charts, this is the fastest layer and most well balanced I can remember us being in terms of new product introductions, and that does have an impact as well.</p>
          <p>But no, that's going to be with us for a little while until you do your typical Texas Two-Step in terms of price performance improvements, costing on components, et cetera. So, Simona, this has been fairly normal in terms of the direction. Thank you. Frank, do you want to add anything to that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. John, I had a follow-on question on the customer concern mixed signals you're seeing. Specifically, did you see any large deal delays in June or July, or is your sense that large deals will face increasing CFO scrutiny in the second half of the year? I'm really trying to justify how much of the cautious outlook is tied to your own healthy paranoia versus what you're actually hearing from customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we're hearing from customers, it surprised us just for a short time period there how quickly people took their foot off the gas pedal and then put it right back down. The second thing we're hearing is the large orders are getting a second and third look periodically. Pipeline looks really good, Rob, in terms of direction, and maybe I'll ask you to comment here in terms of talking in generality about your feel across the theaters and pipeline as a whole on it.</p>
          <p>I don't think we're seeing a huge amount of checks and double-checks yet from the financial officers. A lot depends on candidly how the next several months go in terms of people beginning to check or not. Again, I think our most likely next several months is just good solid improvement, but not at the level that many people would have built into their business plans just three or four months ago. Rob, your thoughts overall in terms of what you're seeing on deals and the overall theater confidence and their view about the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think, John, the pipeline trends have been very, very strong, especially in collaboration, where the Tandberg acquisition coming together with TelePresence, the progress we've made in market share gains in Unified Communications, and the pipeline going forward with very relevant technology for today, we feel very strong about the pipeline. I think we've talked today about our data center portfolio, and Padma I agree. We're very well positioned with this portfolio to handle some of the trends that are occurring to deliver cloud-like infrastructure, private clouds to begin with. And obviously the relationship we've built with VMware and EMC and Intel has helped accelerate our differentiation there. So going forward, we feel very good about the pipeline. The forecasts are consistent as we enter into Q1, and I think we're just going to have to deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at it, and let me answer the question a little bit differently when Rob commented there. If you really want to see what's going on in technology, you want to look to the areas that are hot. And areas such as data center virtualization, the cloud, it's on fire. We're doing very well there. You saw it in our Nexus numbers, and you also saw it in UCS. And you saw me do something unusual, which is I signaled you're going to see some large wins, barring a surprise and the appropriate caveats, that you wouldn't traditionally think of Cisco winning over this next year in those areas. But they usually start small and then become very big; collaboration back on top, and 20% growth on that. The balance was good around the world on collaboration, better than we've seen in quite a while. And that is potentially a $30 billion market.</p>
          <p>Video was back in good shape again. Now video is comparing to a tough number in Q1 of this next year where set-top boxes et cetera had a slow fiscal year before that, and then we had a good Q1, but video this quarter was up in the high 30s in terms of direction. That's an area again that is a 30 billion-plus market opportunity. And our Advanced Technologies, which I got constructively beat up on a little bit last quarter, which is fair, only growing at 15%. And people say does that mean you're losing share, you aren't being effective there? I want to remind everybody, market shares bump up and down in a quarter, and our order rates will as well. But the Advanced Technologies grew at 27% this quarter, and remarkably good balance in terms of the direction. So that's how we see it on a global basis. The deals are bigger. The pipeline is probably the best I've seen in terms of big deals, Rob, in quite a while.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Same thing with Smart+Connected communities. That's going to cross the chasm very quickly here. It will go from being something we're putting a lot of resources in with very little return, which is always the case when you start investing at the beginning of these and do so for several years. Then as it crosses the chasm, you're suddenly dealing with 200 &#x2013; 500 million type of deals, but it takes you probably two years to land most of these in terms of direction. So, Brent, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ehud.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cool. So first a clarification quickly on something you said about Tandberg and TelePresence together, that they did 370 million. Is there any way, Frank, that you can parse that out for us and give us a sense &#x2013; last quarter I think that TelePresence alone did 44 million, to just give a sense as to what that did versus how Tandberg did?</p>
          <p>But then, John, when you look at how you're describing both Europe and how that's impacting what you're seeing going forward, as well as the pattern that you saw during the quarter of weakness in late June, early July, and then a pickup again in late July, which of those characteristics are coloring your guidance? Is it the slowdown in late June that's coloring the guidance and making it conservative, or is it the pickup in late July that's actually bringing it to where it is? Which of those are the hop-off points? And again, if you can put Europe in a box in a sense that was it weak, was it strong? Because you said 25%, but you mentioned it was weak; just trying to understand how that really fits and what you're looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the clarification or the follow-up, we said that in this quarter, the two combined Tandberg and TelePresence had products and service orders of approximately 370 million. I want my team to check this number. That was a 40% growth in total. I think TelePresence this quarter had a 50% year-over-year growth, so it actually grew faster than Tandberg. Again, this is an area that we didn't talk about next generation, not video conferencing, but virtual communications. It is clearly a growth area, and with all the appropriate caveats, one that would not surprise me seeing us growing in the 20% next year even in a moderate economy in terms of direction.</p>
          <p>In terms of what is coloring the guidance, it's customers. My customers began to share views of 2% GDP growth in the U.S., the concern about Europe when the stock markets hit some bumps, and then all of a sudden people take their foot off the gas pedal. It shows you a very unusual pattern or mixed signal pattern that we haven't seen before. And when the customers get nervous, I get nervous. So I wouldn't have even noticed that pattern late June, early July normally, except my customers saw it. And the end of July was obviously a number run rate that was well above our long-term guidance, and you can do it mathematically. It was in the high 20s.</p>
          <p>So what's coloring it is purely what we are hearing from customers and what people are seeing in the economies and what they think are the most likely outcome of that. Again, very few people projecting doom and gloom or a double-dip, but just saying it's very sluggish growth and it's very mixed signals in terms of what they're seeing in their own business. Many of them are saying exactly what I did. Their own business feels good, but they're very cautious on the others and they're hesitant therefore about hiring. They're hesitant about capital spending. So that's what's really coloring our customers' views, Ehud.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, John. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the government public sector? There are big fiscal austerity programs around the world, and I'm curious what you're seeing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's interesting. Rob and I had a chance to corner Bruce Klein, who is our head of the Public Sector on a global basis. And when we nudged him today a little bit, his answers were pretty solid. Public sector is about the same size as enterprise for us. Public sector in the U.S. is very solid for us both in the federal and the state and local, although which states ordered bounced around. And public sector in Europe actually held up pretty well. But again, it bounced around by country. In emerging countries, it did pretty well. So I think again when you look at what Bruce is expecting or seeing, he was pretty optimistic about next year. There will be some deals that all of a sudden will be taken off the opportunity list and others put on. Rob, additional color?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, John, I think the U.S. federal business was very strong for us as part of that overall public sector. We go into Q1 with our big sequential quarter and we feel very confident, very strong about the forecast and the pipeline of opportunities.</p>
          <p>Across the world, I think public sector customers are looking for change, and I think we have a number of technologies that are helping them become more efficient and meet some of their transformation requirements. So I think we're going to benefit in many ways as public sectors tighten their belts, and we've got a lot of technologies and a lot of solutions to help them do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Brian, the real takeaway on the confidence issue and our position on things we can control or influence, we feel really good. That's why you see us increasing our investments. That's why you see us adding 3,000 people over the next several quarters. That's why you see us moving in each of these category areas, and that's why you see us being pretty candid that while there might be a quarter or two versus one competitor or another we lose a little bit of market share, most of the time we're gaining versus everyone.</p>
          <p>And the architecture is winning. It's winning in the cloud, it's winning in the data center, it's winning in collaboration. Our products tying together routing and switching and security and wired and wireless, enterprise and service provider down to the consumer, that's winning. So again, I don't want to send any mixed messages. Things we control and influence, we feel very good and we're making the appropriate commitments in head count and everything else that goes with that good feeling.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's almost impossible to quantify, Paul. In two-tier and in small business, you've either got the product on the shelf or you don't. They probably have as much impact in enterprise and service provider just on straining relationships and burning up sales cycles as they do. But it's an almost impossible one to quantify. I figured one of you all would ask that question, and we don't know of any way to get our arm it. I'd say it's more lost productivity that chews the cycles. But at the low end, you either have the product on the shelf or you don't, or your lead times are so long your competitor takes advantage of that and gets into an account that you wouldn't normally let them into, but almost impossible to qualify, Paul.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much. I wanted to talk a little bit about the staffing. You mentioned adding 2,100 heads in the quarter; maybe a little bit of color as to how many of those were above and beyond the Tandberg acquisition and what those folks are doing.</p>
          <p>And then you also talked about hiring 3,000 people. I want to make sure I've got that correct. Is that 3,000 in addition, or is this part of the plan you talked about at the beginning of this year, getting this 2,100 up to 3,000? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure thing, Simon. So in clarification and thank you for asking that, I might have been a little bit confusing on the numbers. So at the beginning of this calendar year, which is going into Q3 and Q4, we said our intent was to hire 3,000 people incrementally over the next several quarters. That would be above the acquisitions, so not including acquisitions. One quarter ago, we added 1,000. This last quarter, we added 2,000. Our projection on hiring for the next several quarters is once again 3,000. In terms of the approach, it would be balanced in terms of our business on a global basis.</p>
          <p>Of the 2,000 people that were hired this last quarter, more than half, actually in excess of 70% were in the U.S. in terms of the direction in terms of the additions. So if you look at the balance, that's how it's playing out.</p>
          <p>In terms of a little bit of color, it will be divided across new market adjacencies. It will be focused on the new architectures, which Rob is driving across his theaters. We did add almost 500 sales reps incrementally above what our head count was during the last quarter. And I think, Rob, we've got to the end of August to fulfill that commitment. Is that in good shape?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have 500 new account teams balanced across the world on board by the end of August.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a classic approach, you add your sales people first. Then you add your new market adjacencies, et cetera. Many of these areas we're putting resources, you won't see revenue from for two to three years. Having said that, some of those that we made investments in two to three years ago, Smart+Connected communities, the data center, the cloud, you are seeing major rapid ramp-ups, and again this is a portfolio play we've got to continue to fund the engine. So think of us almost like a venture capital company in certain areas starting new startups, investing in some medium size businesses getting bigger, and then large businesses doing well. The balance at the present time looks good, and we will be adding 3,000 people to that balance over the next several quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, just as a clarification, I think the question that Simon was asking also about Tandberg, Simon, Tandberg the acquisition closed in Q3, so that incremental head count was in last quarter. And separate from that, the 1,000 in Q3 that John mentioned were over and above Tandberg. That was actually growth. And in Q4, the 2,000 that John mentioned was fully growth. It had nothing to do with the acquisition of Tandberg.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Great, thank you. John, a question; we get a lot on Cisco versus HP. I guess broadly, do you see yourself long term competing with HP on price, technology, or vision? And how much of a risk is HP to Cisco's gross margin long term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. HP is a wonderful company and so, so important to I think the strengths of the Valley, and they are a very good competitor and a tough competitor. Having said that, it's nice taking on one of the biggest players in the industry, which hopefully we'll do with class. In terms of when a large company focuses on you that is much larger than you, we have a healthy paranoia. In terms of our ability to compete on an architectural play, products tied together, innovation, acquisition, being a great place to work, culture, we do very well.</p>
          <p>And so HP will be a good competitor. They are very large, and we are doing extremely well versus HP whether it's data center strategy, our relationships with our customers, and the direction. So good competitor, hopefully we can take a lot of market share from them and we're off to a good start, but we'll do it with class. Thanks, Jayson.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about India and how you guys have been working through the whole security issue there with the public networks; and if so, your position with enterprise in that part of the world has enabled you to grow significantly better than some of your larger peers on the public side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. I just got an update from our government affairs group, and this is how we use government affairs in emerging countries as well as corporate social responsibility very aggressively. We're pretty good on regulation, pretty good on security issues, pretty good about developing trust with governments around the world, and the give and take on it. Our growth in India this quarter I think was over 40%, if I remember right &#x2013; over 50%, thank you, Rob, and very solid. I don't have the breakout by sectors within India, but if Rob and I were discussing it, we would probably say we do very well in enterprise, very well in commercial, very well in public sector. We could do a little bit better in service providers, and I think that's an architecture price point that we need to think of more in the 1.4 billion people and how do you get to the average consumer, of which 800 or 900 million make less than $3 a day in terms of direction. So that would be the way that I would look at it in terms of India, in terms of our progress there on the security side.</p>
          <p>I think we're okay in terms of positioning long term, but this is one that the government very often in any country, that we move beyond India, when they start talking about security, it sounds like a simple way to approach problems, when in fact it becomes very complex. And so we tend to say how do we exchange and how do we keep in mind with what you would expect from an American company, and at the same time be able to say how do you accomplish your goals in terms of build-out, accessibility, open standards, directions, not developing different standards in different areas, and not passing out security source code to a country to where if you pass out your security source code, you're not going to have secure systems anymore.</p>
          <p>And so it is a good give and take. We get along extremely well with the government of India, and I think this is just one where all sides involved are educating each other, but I think you'll see the American companies as a whole pretty united in terms of striking a balance and compromising in that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our last question comes from John Slack with Citigroup. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, maybe a point of clarification and then a question. Frank, on your inventory purchase commitments, you said 4.3 billion this quarter, and you said up 6% sequentially. My notes and I think the Q had it as 4.3 last quarter, so if you could provide a little clarification around that.</p>
          <p>And then as you go to the customer concern, and everyone is talking about the order deceleration then reacceleration, can you talk about maybe what segments you're hearing that most from? Is it the enterprise? Is it service? It sounded like the government was doing okay. Is it commercial? Any more color you could give on that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Laura. I'm going to jump in, and then we'll turn it over to Frank. For a discussion of purchase commitments in prior periods including any potential adjustments, I'm going to refer you to the slides on the webcast that accompany this call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and so, John, as I mentioned during the script, so we did 4.3 billion, and that was up slightly, 7%. As we talked about on the last call, we saw the significant increase going from Q2 to Q3. These are commitments that our suppliers and our contract manufacturers make on our behalf. And just being more proactive with a very tight industry from a supply perspective, we made the decision several months ago to make sure that we extend those purchase commitments. And we're so far in this quarter and as we go forward, this is an indication of having the ability to continue to expand because these purchase commitments are not necessarily for one quarter. They're for multiple quarters and actually the purchase commits of 4.3 actually spread about four or five quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the balance during that time period, it was pretty uniform around the world. And the same thing was true of the pickup the last two to three weeks was very remarkably good balance around the world with the last couple weeks, everybody beating their forecasts and with growth, as I said, in the high 20s.</p>
          <p>But if there's one key takeaway from this call that I'd like for you all to think about, our strategy and vision is absolutely working. We are gaining market share. We are gaining product leadership. We are gaining architecture. Our relationships with our customers is moving from being a box player, a router, a switcher, switching, to really a key business partner, a trusted technical advisor. We will win more than our fair share of jump balls in all areas. And it's unusual a company can say that with that type of confidence. We are clearly applying in terms of our growth projections for the future very comfortable and becoming more comfortable with our long range 12 to 17%.</p>
          <p>So I think it's important when you think out in several years out, 12 to 17%, most of the shareholders would be very comfortable with. We're saying when you start comparing quarters where we've had very good growth, the quarters where we have very good growth, we're very pleased that we're at the high end of that or above that. So that's perhaps my one key takeaway. Things we control or influence are in great shape. Our growth in terms of our long-term aspirations looks very good and we're playing actually at the high end or above on that, and our concerns are normal cautious concerns, which you would expect us to share with you, which Cisco always has.</p>
          <p>So with that, Laura, let me turn it back over to you. And again key takeaway message, 3,000 people, we're optimistic about the future. And that's our ability in terms of what we can control and influence.</p>
