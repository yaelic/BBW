      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>As we normally do on these conference calls, we have our CFO here and we also have our different business area leaders to speak to you respectively over their different business areas.</p>
          <p>We have a number of slides to speak to and let me start with page 1 there that says Group Highlights.  We are looking at a fourth quarter where Europe and international markets remain strong and actually growing order intake across the Group's different business areas. At the same time, we are looking at a North America, which was very weak and which is flat in demand.  And most of the downturn, especially on the truck side we think has already happened but we have a flat order intake in North America as we progress into 2008.</p>
          <p>We have a Japanese market that is more and more impacted by pre-buy comparison because of comparison to last year, but where Nissan Diesel have actually had a reasonable quarter both in terms of market share and development, and obviously if we look at deliveries in the fourth quarter, they were very much up in Europe and international markets while they were very much down across different business areas, to some extent also in Japan in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we signed a letter of intent with Eicher Motors to break into in a broader scale into the Indian market on trucks.  We expect to be able to finalize that agreement in &#x2013; come quarter two in 2008.  And all in all then, if we combine organic growth and growth from acquisition, we were up by 25% in operating income there beating last year in earnings per share by almost 10%.</p>
          <p>So, a good &#x2013; especially on the sales side; we'll come in some discussion with you on operating income results as we progress through the presentation here.  That meant that we ended the year on a positive note with net sales of 285 billion, operating income of 22.2, return on equity over 18%, very good operating cash flow for the year but also for us in the fourth quarter such that we added up 15.2 billion operating cash flow for the year.  Then earnings in the quarter of 2 crowns combining up to 7.37 and all in all that together with the outlook it gave the Board a reason to suggest to the general assembly that the dividend should be increased by 10% to 5.50 per share ordinary dividend for general assembly to decide in April.</p>
          <p>If we look at the page 2, there you see the breakdown of sales and you can actually see here strong organic growth by 13% and then as you can see, that actually balances, more than balances, the real downturn in North America that we've had and we'll come into more specifics on the delivery downturn in North America, but organic growth up by 13%. We actually saw that on the Group side, the combined net sales in North America for the quarter was 16% of turnover and that's the reason that we were able to compensate with good growth in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>Then most notably, if you go up to the net sales growth, they are up 25%.  You see Western Europe doing very well.  We were able to get capacities up by 20% there.  Obviously in some cases, perhaps more specifically on the CE side we would have liked to see a little better operating leverage from that growth, but still growth was there.  Eastern Europe up an amazing 72%, which actually means that if North America was 16% of turnover in the quarter, Eastern Europe was 12% of turnover in the quarter.  So interesting comparisons there if you look at how the world economy is progressing and our footprints.  Asia, we had a doubling of sales there, combined good growth and the integration of Nissan Diesel on the Group and South America, most notably Brazil at 56% growth also and all in all then, for the year 286 in sales.</p>
          <p>We look at operating income on page 3.  There we have a product and market mix and what's happening there is that we have very good margins in our European and International business.  We have also, and that's across the Group, including to a high degree, also the U.S. market on the truck side, a price realization.  And let me break that down a little.  We have price realization in our ability to get costs for the U.S. '07 across to the marketplace, we think relatively well in place.  At the same time, of course, we have a very low demand for trucks. I will come into the specifics of that.</p>
          <p>Price realization, in general across the Group is on the positive side and doing well.  To some extent, as you can see, in some of our operating leverage and some of our different businesses, price realization have not covered completely the types of extraordinary costs that we've had to meet that demand, but still price in absolute terms is really on the positive side here for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We had also a very good aftermarket and retail business growth adding to our margins, and I'm very happy to say that that's also true of Nissan Diesel.  As you know that was one of the programs that we have put into Nissan Diesel to make sure that we could get good aftermarket business developing there.</p>
          <p>And truck operations, in general in Europe, both with Volvo and with Renault doing very well, good quarter and good also order intake, I will take that apart slightly later on.  On the negative side, U.S. trucks and especially the U.S. market has not come back to the extent that we could have hoped for in the beginning of 2007, and we now see a more flattish U.S. market at historically very low levels.</p>
          <p>We also had in the quarter a warranty provision of 370 million for old Mack engines that are still under some types of warranty spread on different types of engines there.  And about one-third of the 370 also as it comes to going back and reworking and to some extent recalling U.S. '07 engines.  We think that's a one-off for North America that we frankly would have liked to not have but we took that in the fourth quarter though.</p>
          <p>Then I think a lot of discussion about R&amp;D, and let me just here note that the net R&amp;D amortization is negative by 583, and we'll ask our CFO to comment on that more in detail. That's a bookkeeping effect of the fact that we took in, in the third and the fourth quarter we took in the whole of the new engine range and to some extent the new product range, especially in North America.</p>
          <p>Then we have integration costs for acquired operations.  We are giving you some detail and visibility there in this quarter.  And obviously had we done that acquisition &#x2013; a couple of those acquisitions a couple of years ago, they would have been instead as part of the acquisition balance, which as you know is not allowed or not proper accounting nowadays.  So, instead we will be highlighting them for you there.</p>
          <p>Then currency impact, and a somewhat fragmented picture there, the currency impact on the VCE side was large negative, much bigger than the 200 that you had for the Group.  And we also had a negative impact on the bus side.  But, that also means that we had some positive impact to make it a net minus 200, and that positive impact in general you can see in European trucks, has to do with the euro, and the flat, and the Swedish krona effect there.</p>
          <p>And with that, we ended up at 6.8 margin, or 600 million better than last year's relevant quarter or sixth relevant quarter.  And we have then on page four, a Volvo Group financial summary there and P&#xE4;r &#xD6;stberg, our CFO should cover that with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif.  And let me then make a few additional comments on the operating income for the Industrial Operations first of all.  As we mentioned throughout the morning, we had warranty provision of 370 million that impacted the operating income in the fourth quarter.  Warranty costs in general remained flat compared to sales despite these warranty provisions.  The foreign exchange effect of 200 is basically a result of a lower dollar and a slightly stronger euro against the Swedish krona.  The net effect of the two throughout the business areas adds up to 200 million Swedish krona negative effecting in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me also point out that we have booked amortizations or depreciations of intangibles linked to the acquisitions we've made through the year to the extent of minus 139 million in the quarter, also then booked in the Industrial Operations.  We will continue to see amortizations of intangibles over the next few years, and as a guidance for next year you should look at somewhere around 600 million for depreciation and amortization of Nissan Diesel intangibles and roughly 100 million for the Ingersoll Rand acquisition there.</p>
          <p>Our gross income margin was stronger in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year.  We saw a gross income margin of 22.4% compared to 22.1.  We had a negative effect from the net of capitalized R&amp;D and amortization of R&amp;D of roughly or almost 600 million in the quarter.  But let me spend 30 seconds on the full year R&amp;D spending.  We saw an increase for the full year of 2.7 billion of R&amp;D spending compared to the same period last year, compared to 2006.  I think it's important to keep in mind that half of this increase, roughly 1.5 billion out of the 2.7, were net effect of more depreciation than capitalization.  So in reality the real increases in R&amp;D spending, gross, was only 1.2, and R&amp;D in relation to sales were actually flat year-over-year basis, so no real increase there in terms of &#x2013; in relation to sales.</p>
          <p>We're seeing slightly higher selling and admin expenses.  It's mainly due to the fact that we've integrated new companies, Nissan Diesel, Ingersoll Rand, Lingong, but it's also due to the fact that we have acquired a number of dealers where the ratio of selling and admin expenses to sales is slightly higher than what we typically see throughout the Group.</p>
          <p>All in all, and with the 378 million of operating income from customer finance, we ended up at 5.8 as we pointed out.  Taxes came in at a slightly lower rate than what we've seen so far this year, at 27%.  We ended up the year with a tax rate of roughly 30%.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow finally then was strong at 12.4 and we continued to do well on most of the working capital areas there, notably receivables, but there has also been some progress on the inventory side there. So 12.4 of cash flow generated in the quarter and around 15 billion of cash flow generated for the full year and I'll stop there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Let's go to page five and talk little more specifically about trucks there. You see very good growth as we offset the downturn in North America. We had in the orders of magnitude on the truck side down in North America between 30 and 40%, and obviously that was offset by increases in Europe of about 20, 25%, Asia about 20%, even South America at 44% and on top of that, of course, for comparative reasons, we added Nissan Diesel to that.</p>
          <p>Now, with the downturn in North America then, we had on the margin side, we had a slight drop in margins and that's based on the adjustments to much lower pays in North America, likewise the warranty expenses that we spoke about in the beginning of the presentation in North America, and then of course, Nissan Diesel, the combination there of integration cost and everything else makes that diluted in the fourth quarter.  We still think that good progress is being made with Nissan Diesel.  An all time high sales and operating income then for the quarter as consequence of all of that put together.</p>
          <p>We've had quite a lot of discussion about order intake in Europe, and we tried to highlight that in the presentation, in the press conference, I think we have missed a few beats there perhaps.  What we're really saying is that the order intake in Europe is around between 5 and 10% up. That's the best picture that we can give you.</p>
          <p>Volvo Trucks actually, the slide that we presented at the press conference, was up 8%, but we had a down number on the Renault Trucks side.  And let me just remind you there that we had exceptionally strong orders in Q4 '06.  We were up 100% as orders were released after some internal battling with a leader network in Europe around pricing increases.  And also that in Renault, and that was also on the slide that we had at the press conference, we are actually now fully booked for the whole of 2008 and we have not opened books for 2009 yet, and that combined into an order intake that was down.  But, the best picture that we can give you is that we have order intake in Europe well up about 5 to 10% and, frankly, in line with the forecast that we are making for the European truck market.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have a slow demand in North America and it's slow in absolute numbers at the levels where we are traveling now with the well-below history trend lines. And if anything we would call a flat market on the trucks side in North America and towards the end of the year, an improving market and that's of course barring any real negative economic scenarios that you can see on the trucks side. But the downturn in trucks as you know has been there all the way through 2007 already.</p>
          <p>If we look at operating income then and then focus coming for the next couple of quarters here, we are still in a meet high demand outside of U.S. and Japan in really capacity investment mode.  We are looking at deliveries that were up in the fourth quarter by 27%, for example, on Volvo Trucks strong also deliveries on Renault.  Those high levels of capacity utilization is up there. The trick is going to be to make sure that we have a reasonable operating leverage at those high levels of capacity &#x2013; meeting capacity demand.  We have experienced, as we have reported to you before, but now at 25% higher level, we have experienced some disturbances on different suppliers and difference in our value-added chain here that we are meeting then with flying components around in the world or in some cases, putting in extra time, Saturdays, Sundays and extra shifts and what have you.  All-in-all, on the trucks side, I think that has paid off well.  And we will continue with that, but hopefully at a higher level in quarter one and two as we progress through the year in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the Nissan Diesel side, we had a reasonable development with Nissan Diesel.  They were market leaders in the fourth quarter.  They are market leader in fuel efficiency already improving market shares.  And we, of course, have the integration projects that are going with Nissan Diesel.  You remember the program, we have to get 200 million euro of synergies to that and we're well in line with that, but we have upfront costs.</p>
          <p>And then you know that we have UAW negotiations in the Mack factory and actually a strike in the Volvo factory there.  And obviously, we don't like strikes or disturbances of that kind.  It's difficult now to assess how that will end up.  We think that what we are asking the unions to do there is in line with making that a really competitive factory over time in New River Valley and we'll be seeing how that plays out over the next couple of weeks perhaps here.</p>
          <p>We have also a very good development from the profitability side over Renault trucks.  We are actually seeing good industrial productivity and actually further improved financial performance, and we have Volvo Trucks and Renault Trucks now operating very well in Europe.</p>
          <p>Just to finalize the demand slide here, if you look at page six, there you see the heavy-duty truck market in Europe, which is EU members plus Switzerland and Norway, and our goal for that is &#x2013; for that to increase by 5 to 10% and most of that is in the order books already or absolutely greater part of that is in the order books already. We also have Eastern Europe continuing growth and we have international markets continuing, so good progress being made there.</p>
          <p>Heavy-duty truck market in North America. We now forecast flat which is more negative scenario than what we thought in the beginning of 2007 here, and that's really as the economic concerns and the financial crisis in the U.S. have come to impact the overall market. But see actually there that the present levels of around 200,000 for North America, we are well, well below the trend line while at the same time transport is developing much in line with the economy. So over time, we expect that market to come to be more historic.</p>
          <p>With that, let me conclude on the heavy-duty &#x2013; or on the truck side and handover to Tony Helsham, who should be with us on the phone here and discuss Volvo Construction Equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay good. Yeah let's start with the highlights in the sales, first I'd like to say that 2007 was a interesting year for CE. On the sales side, of course we reached a milestone where we achieved more than 50 billion SEK in sales and the operating income although still not at the level we would like was for the first time ever 4 billion SEK.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the market now, demand overall for both heavy and compact construction equipment is positive.  Global demand is up around 12%, however of course there's big differences between North America and more or less the rest of the world. In the heavy equipment, North America is down 20% for the same period compared to the same period last year. Europe is up 6% and the rest of the world is also up some 10 to 12%.</p>
          <p>On the sales side, as I mentioned, including the contribution from the recent acquisitions, sales is up 39%, excluding the acquisitions organically sales is up 23%. However, the results have been negatively affected by a number of events. Foreign exchanges, as Leif mentioned, is hitting us rather hard at the moment. We have had experienced &#x2013; we've experienced a number of production disturbances, particularly in our Swedish operations and that is in focus of course to remove those bottlenecks and we have ongoing integration costs related to Lingong and Ingersoll Rand.</p>
          <p>Moving over to the &#x2013; in focus of course I think we could all agree that the top line growth of the Volvo CE businesses has been, has progressed nicely and is going to progress nicely in 2008 and beyond, and the clear focus now is to get leverage out of this strong growth and improve the profitability of the business. At the same time, we have to continue with the integration of both Lingong and Ingersoll Rand. So in focus also I would say is the elimination of the bottlenecks to improve the industrial productivity and continuing focus on cost reductions and together with active price management.</p>
          <p>With that, I think we'll stop with construction equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Tony. We have then Volvo Buses page 9 and what's on the Internet there. We have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson in the room here together with me. H&#xE5;kan, are you there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. On the market side, we can see soft market in North America, and Europe has been flat even if you count the mix picture there down in the Nordic and the U.K. but up in the rest. And Asia continued to grow, I would say.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, sales was up 16% and the production system did a great job, I will say, on the deliveries on a very high level. The order intake is slightly down compared to last year, but the tender activity in many markets is on a high level. So, we have a focus now to capture some of these big tenders. There is a big interest for hybrids both in U.S. and Canada, but also coming on in Europe, and we got the big order in Nova Bus for the transit authority in TransLink, and we start our field test on the Volvo hybrid in London midyear this year, a promising project from our point of view.</p>
          <p>The result was negatively affected from a loss situation in Mexico, some extra campaign costs to perform our engine campaigns there, and then we had a significant negative currency effect in the fourth quarter. The cash flow in the fourth quarter was strong.</p>
          <p>In focus now, going on naturally reducing costs is the focus for us. That means product cost, that means to optimize our industrial structure, and also utilize and deliver more synergies with the truck group.</p>
          <p>The currency development during quarter four has offset some of the reductions and the result we had, but we continue them with our cost programs in all regions. We have also started our plant in India, a big bus market, as big as Europe, 25,000 heavy buses, with a clear ambition to take a big part of the Indian market but also utilize that plant for exports to other markets.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I will say the market for 2008 seems fairly good, I will say. We have our product problem behind us but still, we have a challenge to contract the negative currency trends in a couple of our markets.</p>
          <p>So that's all from buses. Leif?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So that takes us to Volvo Penta, G&#xF6;ran Gummeson, and page 10 in the package.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Leif. If you look at our markets, you can say that Europe was pretty strong during 2007, both on the marine and industrial side. And then greater markets outside Europe, you can say Middle East, Asia, India for us is a strong market, and also Latin America is growing. So, these markets are doing quite fine in both marine and industrial sales for us. In North America, we saw a downturn mainly then on the marine side, and we talk about double-digits downturn actually. And the good thing is that our volumes held up and we were actually selling more than in 2006 indicating that we are gaining market share in the North American marketplace.</p>
          <p>Overall, our sales increased by 10% during the fourth quarter and also for the year, as such. We had a very strong order intake of the new IPS system, the transmission system and that was actually 80% ahead of the same period of 2006.</p>
          <p>Now, focus moving forward, we decided that during the fourth quarter last year to take investments in our infrastructures in order to build a solid growth for our future growth here. And that is the investment in different IT solutions and also in logistic processes, and on top of that also in production capacities in order to meet the demand that we foresee now both on the industrial side and also in order to build capacity for meeting the demand on the IPS system. So, moving forward, we are quite positive about the marketplace and the outlook for the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>G&#xF6;ran, thank you. We have page 11, we have Olof Persson, the President of Volvo Aero to speak to us about Volvo Aero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. We continue to see a very high activity level in the aerospace market and we have seen record levels of aircraft order bookings in 2007. And of course, as a consequence, we see a record order book for large commercial engines which in turn then translates into a 19% increase in our order books. The aircraft deliveries increased with 7% in 2007, and since we actually deliver one or more components to over 90% of all large engines that was produced in 2007, we believe we are well positioned for the future in terms of component deliveries to new engines.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we did acquisition of Applied Composites and with that acquisition we have taken another important step to position ourselves as the light-weight producer of structure components. In total, we see a weight reduction potential of at least 20% by introducing composites into the cold section of the engine.</p>
          <p>And in addition, Applied Composites will contribute composite knowledge, not only to Volvo Aero but also to the rest of the Volvo Group. From a sales point of view, we had a strong quarter with good volumes in particular within the component business. However, also the military sales to the Swedish Air Force contributed also with good volumes. That order is now coming to an end. And the last engine for that project will be delivered in Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>On the results side of the house, we are pleased to see that the component business continued to deliver good margins so do also the military business in this quarter. And despite that we see an improvement in the after-market business on the result side, we will definitely continue to execute our profitability program within after-market business during 2008.</p>
          <p>So, to wrap-up, I will say a good quarter four in 2007 for Volvo Aero.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can and you are most welcome to talk about Volvo Financial Services and page 12 in the package.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Leif. Volvo Financial Services had a very good quarter and the fourth quarter of 2007. I'm proud to say that we hit another record in volume at 12.2 billion SEK. Europe was up 33% at 6 billion; International 47% up at 3.6 billion, most notably in Russia, Romania, and Brazil. North America was down 14% at 2.8 billion, but on a positive note, our penetration has increased from 17% to 25% to put the BAs in North America, which is going to set us up nicely when the market does come back.</p>
          <p>Looking at operating income at 378 for the quarter, we had a negative FX effect of about 11 million and a negative leverage effect. If you remember, we took the leverage from 10% down to 8%, which would increase our interest costs and that was a negative leverage of about 21 million SEK. Adding those back, we had about a 10% improvement.</p>
          <p>After-tax return on equity, very strong for the year at 15.9, a more normalized number would be between about 13 and 14%. We had some lower credit provisions during 2007. We had the effect of the lower equity which increases our returns and we had some one-off favorable tax adjustments that also affected that number. So again, a more normalized return would be probably between about 13 to 14% well within our target of 12 to 15% after-tax return on equity.</p>
          <p>Asset growth for the year, with some good volume coming in, actually grew on a currency adjusted basis at about 12.6%, so pretty strong year in 2007 for asset growth which is good news for ongoing profitability.</p>
          <p>We commenced Lingong Financial Services, it's a private label. We're doing both wholesale and retail financing in China for our partner there. We're using the synergies of our VFS back office in China in Beijing to assist that Financial Services business for Lingong, and we're hoping for good things there with Tony and his team.</p>
          <p>We see that the U.S. economy is softening, especially of course in North America. Retail volume is lower based on the lower BA sales, as you've been seeing. Our collectors are working harder, repos are up a bit but again from historically low levels. So it's looking more likely a normal portfolio but we are seeing some softening. Delinquency is trending just a little bit higher, not really much. We're staying on top of the portfolio and we're working with our customers very diligently.  For those that we feel have the capacity to make it through the downturn, we'll be working with them. For those that aren't, we're making sure we get our units back and liquidate them as fast as possible in order to keep our inventory in check and to keep the portfolio healthy. So we are seeing some softening but no great alarms right now. I think we're poised to really handle this going into what maybe a downturn in North America.</p>
          <p>In focus, we have some more opportunities in Latin America. We've decided to open up an office in Chile to support the growth of the Volvo Group in Chile. We should be active by the second part of 2008 and we're looking forward to that. And we're also looking at our opportunities in Asia really to mirror and support the Volvo Group recent acquisitions there. So we're working hard in that part of the world as well.</p>
          <p>We're starting to see some good organic growth in Europe. We restructured the business in September of 2007. We're working hard on doing that and completing it and we see that we have some great opportunities for growth in Europe from an organic basis. We do have heightened risk management and of course looking at the downturn in North America. We have, however, a pretty diverse portfolio when it comes to our equipment whether it be buses or construction equipment or different types of trucks. So we have good diversification which helps our risk management. We also have very good geographic mix.</p>
          <p>Right now, 40% of the portfolio is in Europe and it's historically a very consistent low level of loss, international represents 23% and North America represents 17%. And I think this split and geographic and equipment diversity is going to help us in the coming months.</p>
          <p>In all, a very good year in Financial Services and I'll turn it back to you, Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And that takes me to Group summary on page 13. And best way I think to characterize 2007 is that it was a very intense year. On the one hand, we had a very strong downturn in North America, first emission driven and after that subprime or financial crisis economically driven where North America has come down across the different business areas quite dramatically. We were &#x2013; on the other hand &#x2013; on the other side of that intense year, we were coping with getting production rates up in Europe and we actually ended up in Europe with capacities higher than what we actually thought from the beginning of the year and doing reasonably well. Even though we could have wished some of our different business areas slightly better operating leverage of those high levels. But be that as it may, it turned out to be all-in-all quite a good year with actually significant sales growth there, and that's now with the different acquisitions including for parts of the year &#x2013; relevant parts of year at 27 billion.</p>
          <p>And then also, we had a year that was characterized by making very big acquisitions. We took on board in 2007 Nissan Diesel, Lingong, Ingersoll Rand and we signed the agreement then with Eicher Motors. And obviously, much focus has been on making sure that we can deliver the promises that come with those acquisitions in terms of profit coming from the growth rate there. And as you know, nowadays with the acquisition accounting being what it is, most of the effects in the beginning of taking on large acquisitions like Nissan Diesel and Ingersoll Rand, and Lingong for that matter, are actually dilutive, and has been that especially in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at focus for 2008, we have a little of the same situation. We frankly don't think that the U.S. market will go down much more. We think most of that has happened, but it's staying at a very &#x2013; historically very low level, especially on the truck side. You might see some downfall further on the construction equipment side, but less here, so slow U.S. market, but not necessarily a declining U.S. market any longer.</p>
          <p>And then, we are actually looking at a continuing strong order intake across the Group's different product lines in Europe and in international. And we have been asked many times now whether we see any clouds on the horizon in Europe and international, and we cannot say that we have any visibility that gives us any negative views. You can speculate in whether a down &#x2013; real downturn in the U.S. would have sooner or later and we think, that's probably correct, would have an impact in Europe. But it is quite different across the Group now, if you look at the impact of the U.S. market, so that's speculation. So far, we have good news to report from our European and international markets.</p>
          <p>We are in the midst of integrating acquisitions and obviously again costs are prompt in 2008 in those acquisitions. We are happy with the acquisitions and we are actually doing what we said we would and on good progress is being made there.</p>
          <p>And then, on the side of the Group that has to deliver at even higher levels, we are of course focusing on making sure that we can get better operating leverage out of that growth and that's especially as it relates to productivity and profitability. Some of our different business areas have challenges there.</p>
          <p>That concludes the presentation for Q4 and we would open up to Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is from Fredric Stahl from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I'll give it another try to ask my question about financial services. If you look at what you're saying about the market in the U.S. where you have competition pulling back from the market, you're tightening your risk management and risk standards. Could you maybe give us an idea, if it's &#x2013; well I guess it's reasonable to assume it's become more expensive to finance your trucks and if you could give us an idea, how much more expensive it has become over the last six months and whether you are tightening your risk standards in Europe as well, i.e. if you are following suit in Europe currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Fredric, thank you. We will ask Sal, I think to answer that specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no problem. I'll start with Europe first, because that's the positive note. We &#x2013; for the last seven, eight years, we've been very, very consistent in Europe and it's pretty much steady as you go. We're keeping a bit of an eye on the UK right now where we're seeing some softness. But for Europe, proper and all, we've experienced very low levels of losses and I think our credit standards are going to stick.</p>
          <p>Our cost of funds have increased, as everyone else's have increased, I would say between about 30 and 40 basis points. We are passing most of that on to our customers, so yes, it is a bit more expensive to finance the products. But however, overall, rates are coming down with the Fed decreasing rates in the United States, so that's offsetting the total cost to really our customers. So while our spreads are increasing, overall rates are coming down in the U.S., so it pretty much neutralizes it.</p>
          <p>I would say, we know a lot of our customers and the customers that we've been working with for many years and we're still providing good credit lines to them. You have to break the U.S. market into two areas, one is the wholesale financing for the dealers and the other is retail. We're seeing that generally in the market, there is some tightening on the retail side. However, the wholesale side is still rather competitive and the competition is still in there pretty strong. And hopefully, Fredric, that's answered your question.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, my first question is on R&amp;D expenses. I was wondering if you could give us some guidance on what you expect the net impact of depreciation and capitalization to be in 2008 and 2009. My second question relates to the strike in North America. How long could this take to resolve, in your view what's the worst case scenario and how much does it cost you for example for each week of the strike?  And my final question is &#x2013; could you quantify the impact on margin in trucks from the increased reliance on shifts and very tight capacity at present in outsourcing?  And by when do you expect the capacity to come on stream that you're working on expanding at the moment to resolve this issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think P&#xE4;r, our CFO, would you talk a little about R&amp;D expenses P&#xE4;r?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And as I said a few moments ago, the net negative impact of depreciation, amortization of capitalized R&amp;D was 1.5 billion in 2007. And looking into 2008 then we expect this negative effect to be at somewhere around 500 to SEK 600 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk little bit about the strike in North America then. We have a strike since about a week. We were right in the process of reducing line rates in that factory anyway because of the situation in the low market, slow market in North America. And obviously that sort of solved itself right now, for the short-term period. It's therefore difficult to assess what the real cost is, it's going to be an issue of how long does it stay on, and how will we be able to work back any, if so lost volume depending on how long it will be there. The unions left we felt somewhat abruptly there. We were in the process of negotiating what we feel are fairly obvious competitive measures to get that plant even more competitive as it relates to language and how we do bumping procedures and how we can work with our value chain in terms of what suppliers can do for us and what should be done in the factory. It was not really a tough negotiation on salaries or things like that yet. So we will see how that sorts itself out. It's difficult at this point in time to give any assessment on how long or how costly it might be.</p>
          <p>On the operating leverage side, which is mainly an issue in Powertrain and Powertrain components for the truck group in Europe, less so on the assembly factories in Volvo and Renault in Europe. There we have had major costs in Powertrain, so much so that we can probably say that we have had very little operating leverage if any at Powertrain. Now obviously from a group point of view that's still good because if we can get those engines into trucks and earn money on the trucks that's still a good equation to do. That will probably continue for some time because we are looking at industrial systems like gearboxes, we have had a runaway success with our automatic gearbox. There we are clearly in capacity strain mode and we are working every hour of the week that we can find. To some extent that's also true in Skoevde which is the center for engine production.</p>
          <p>Let me just remind you in the midst of all that that we are actually producing in Europe almost at 20% higher levels than we were a year ago. So, so far so good but with some extra cost here. If we are to get another 5 to 10% up which we feel is doable, then most likely we will have, continue to have some problems on the Powertrain side. Less so I think on the capacity on the truck assembly factories there.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Mr. Patric Lindqvist from HQ Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there. I had a question firstly on the truck side. Nissan Diesel, if I look at the sales development sequentially, you basically had the same kind of sales in Q4 as you had in Q3, whereas earnings, excluding this acquisition balance sheet adjustment, was down 50%. And I was just trying to understand why, since mix as you say and service is doing well in the region. That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have a combination there of mix on, between export and domestic Japan, but I think perhaps more notable we have from an integration cost point of view, we have, as you know, the program to get Volvo engines into the new emission standards which will come in '10. So, I think we can say we have acquisition and integration and synergy-related costs upfront there that would probably be the best explanation in the difference between the quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so very much high in the fourth quarter, okay. Second question, on the truck side, I know you don't like to talk about it, Leif, but some of your colleagues at least said that you had an ambition to break even, even if volumes were down 60%; it so happened to be they were down 60% in North America. And I am just wondering whether you were successful in that ambition that you had coming into the year or whether additional things occurred?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we can say, frankly 2007 developed very much along the lines that we had expected. I mean, it was the most well announced downturn that we have ever seen. We knew that the market was going to come down as an effect of emission standards. We had big programs for cost reductions to get costs down to reasonable levels. And obviously, it was painful also from an operating margin point of view. But, perhaps with the exception of having to increase warranty provision or things like that, that I would have liked to not see, then I think basically we had a 2007 in North American truck operations that went along with what we expected. And the good news, of course, was that we were able to compensate for it in other places.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. And final question to Sal, I guess, you mentioned you've seen some uptick in delinquencies. What are you seeing on the used truck side, are you starting to see significant falls in prices there, and any risk that that might have on your &#x2013; on the values that you have in your book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pat, it's a good question. We look at two things, the frequency, how many units are coming back that we need to sell at auction through repossession. And also the severity which is how much we lose per truck. We are seeing a little bit of a decrease in the truck values, I would say, between 10 and 15%. But, it's well within the guidelines and the estimates that we've come up with. So we're still doing pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would have to be, at what level do you start to feel a bit more uncomfortable when you're talking about the value decrease, is that 25, 30 or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd tell you the truth, the severity at 25 or 30 or 40 obviously that's going to cause us a problem, but it's really the, we have a combination of the frequency and the severity. When two of those are going in the wrong direction then we start to experience some issues. But, we're on top of the portfolio. We have more collectors actively working the accounts. We've structured deals in the past in a much better way I feel. Our mix of A and B and C and D credits is much better than it was the last time we went into a downturn. So we've done everything we can to really watch after the portfolio, and we're continuing to really keep a close eye on it to make sure that we're on top of any of the issues that do come up.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions. The first one is, are you currently seeing any signs in the European truck markets like higher used truck inventories or customers tending to be a little bit more reluctant to place 2009 truck orders, or just any kind of sign that could lead you to be more cautious on the possible order intake expectations towards the end of 2008? And if you could please quantify the European truck order intake that you have seen in January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer to your question is, no that we don't see any such signs. We actually have, historically, very low levels of used inventories. And what is happening there is that the used trucks are going eastward for use in the Eastern countries and also Russia and the countries around Russia there, so very low used inventories. We don't see any problems. We have actually had the other problem that I commented a little on the Renault side. We had to close books, to not take orders for 2009, just to make sure that we had our costs right and the inflation area and everything else right. And also, so for that the customers would know exactly which products they are placing an order for. So &#x2013; but we don't see any of &#x2013; any signs of a turndown in the European market. You can always speculate and, I mean, speculation is for everyone to do that the downturn in North America would have an impact sooner or later in Europe. But so far that's not happened.</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Order intake in the fourth quarter I commented a little on here and the fourth, and we said that Volvo Trucks were up then and between the different difficult comparisons on the Renault side between quarter four in 2006 and quarter four 2007, the best guidance we can give you is that the combined truck operations in the fourth quarter were up in, by between 5 and 10% compared to last year's relevant quarter. And we have nothing so far in the first quarter that would give us guidance elsewhere.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Just a quick question on your sort of margins and we've seen some extraordinary costs et cetera, looking at the integration can you give us a schedule for when you expect things like the selling and admin to come down and where you expect them to come down to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we can say that we have defined with the external world synergy targets that typically will be coming down by definition or defined point between '07 and '10. And let me remind you that when we, for example, put the new product or engine ranges into products like in Nissan Diesel that have &#x2013; that is actually happening in '10, while we have the upfront cost for that rollout in '07 and '08 and to some extent in '09. So, I think guidance here would be that given the new ways to do acquisition accounting you would see the upfront costs happening also in '08. And then come '09 and towards '10, an improvement with the benefits coming also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have just two quick questions. The first one is regarding the operating margin at Volvo Aero. You got very strong operating margin during the Q4 and if you look at the slide on page 11 we can see that the Q1 and Q2 were weak. So, I was just wondering, how sustainable is the margin you got in the Q4?  And if you can help us understanding what we are going to get in the next quarter?  And next question is regarding VCE, and the margin was pretty weak this quarter. So, are you going to &#x2013; do you expect the margin to recover pretty fast or do you expect the margin to take some time to recover?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, I know you don't give any guidance. I was just wondering if there is a kind of seasonality.</p>

          <p>No, I think the best way is &#x2013; to guide you there is to say that if you go back over quarter one and quarter two last year, then we had the closure of a major facility in Sweden impacting the numbers there, that's not a sign of seasonality.</p>

          <p>And let's see, the other question was for VCE margins there.</p>

          <p>Okay, like Olof, we don't give too much forward-looking guidance here on the margins, but I can say that the elements that caused the deterioration in the fourth quarter are a combination of foreign exchange effects, production disturbances and integration costs. Clearly, the &#x2013; and there is, I would say, some seasonality in the margins as well. In Construction Equipment, typically, the second quarter is the most positive quarter. Clearly, the easiest and the area that's in focus most of all is in the production disturbances, that's got a big focus. And hopefully, we will be able to remove those bottlenecks in the months to come. Not as much we can do on the foreign exchange effects. And I believe we will, under the current accounting rules, have to take the costs for integrating Lingong and Ingersoll Rand as they hit the P&amp;L.</p>

          <p>Very good. I think we have crossed the hour there, and would want to say thank you for following with us over this quarterly conference call then. We have Investor Relations open for you if there are any specific questions. And I'm looking forward to seeing many of you as we come around on the different road shows here. Thanks greatly for the conference call ending fourth quarter 2007.</p>
