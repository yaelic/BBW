          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Suncor Energy, Inc., Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, January 20, 2009 at 7:30 am Mountain Time.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the conference over to John Rogers, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Josie, and good morning everyone, and thank you for listening in to our Q4 2008 conference call. We have with us this morning, Rick George, our President and CEO; Ken Alley, our CFO; Maureen Cormier, our Vice President and Controller; and Tim for the Controller's Department also.</p>
          <p>We're going to follow pretty much our usual format. Rick will give you a bit of an overview of the quarter and a few thoughts on 2009. I'll give you some brief comments in terms of some modeling questions. Hopefully those are the only ones we'll deal with on the call. And then we'll throw it open to your questions. So Rick, why don't you start it off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, John, and welcome everyone. I'm delighted to be here with you this morning on Inauguration morning for our American friends. And so listen; let's hope this is a start of a much better period for all of us.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the tail end of 2008 was a very tumultuous time in the financial and the commodity markets and in lots of ways, we're more than glad to see 2008 in the rearview mirror. It was also a year that was challenging for us on an operational basis. On one hand we know we did disappoint the market, particularly in our Oil Sands operation, but rest assured, we did get a lot of the things done through the year that we needed to get done.</p>
          <p>Things like mine and truck reliability, which has moved up; things like fixing up for a very long-term basis, the talings line grows and  issues that we've had for the last couple of issues. Our reliability in our extraction plant is up. We took a major turnaround in the year, both 2007 and 2008 were major turnaround years for. And we've done a significant amount of retubing of furnaces, which has also been a big exercise in 2008.</p>
          <p>And even though you haven't necessarily seen the results yet, I can just tell you that we do see a steadier operation where we do think we're heading down the right track. Never as fast as you want, but we think that. And one indication that really is, it was extremely cold here in Alberta from about the second week of December until, really, this past weekend. And I can tell you that with that, we had very little cold weather problems. We had a couple of other challenges through that period, but what I would say, that's a good indication that you're getting a lot steadier as you go through that.</p>
          <p>When you get those really cold bursts, especially early in the winter, and they last for five or six weeks, that's always a tough operating condition. You got to remember come February here which won't be that far away, at least we start getting longer days and we get a lot of that behind us.</p>
          <p>So moving to 2009 we are &#x2013; have our guidance at the Oil Sands plant at 300,000 barrels per day. That is a slight bit of a stretch target and massive improvement over where we were in 2008. And the reason that you should expect better operations from us in 2009 at our Oil Sands plant is first of all the issues that I talked about before, many of which have been holding us back, have been dealt with. We have no major turnarounds in 2009, although we do have a planned take down of the U-1 vacuum tower later in the year that will take some volumes off, but we don't think that is material at all.</p>
          <p>And then I guess the other thing I should talk about is Firebag and I know there's been some concern out there about the slow ramp up of Firebag. Just know that we have a lot more wells coming on. We have four that have been brought on this month. We have four more wells coming on in February. We will have ten more in the May/June time period and so this is the period which you're going to see ramp up of these wells. Now we probably should have had this work done two or three months earlier, but it is coming along.</p>
          <p>We continue to see very good performance from our reservoir and we continue to see improvements in the base operations at Firebag. So slower than any of us want, but I'm absolutely convinced that we're on the right track and these wells are big wells. I mean you get an average of about 2,000 barrels a day of bitumen per well, which is significantly up from any other industry experience. It's just a great reservoir and we're going to get this to work well over time here. So we're looking for a very good solid run out of Oil Sands in 2009.</p>
          <p>The Natural Gas division and our downstream business, our refining and marketing business all &#x2013; both were solid in 2008. In fact our volumes were up in Natural Gas over our projection. And both of those divisions look very set for a very solid 2009.</p>
          <p>Now I know one of the things that will surprise people a little bit. Not the fact that we reduced capital again, but maybe the magnitude that we reduced capital for 2009. So the press release outlines that we're planning on a $3 billion capital program. It's kind of basically split about two billion for kind of base operations through the whole business and about one billion on growth. And really the reason that we took the step to go to $3 billion was because, listen, we just don't know, and I don't think anyone else is any more clairvoyant on this phone call than I am, about how long this trough lasts, when we'll see the commodity cycle start moving back in and when we'll see oil prices, for example, move back up. So not knowing exactly when that will occur, we do know it will occur, just don't know when, then for prudence we decided to cut to a $3 billion budget. And there's some other reasons I'll talk about more in a minute about why I actually think that that can be to our advantage as we go forward.</p>
          <p>It's very important as you think about Suncor in 2008, remember about 20% of our production has a floor of $60, so we have 55,000 barrels a day at $60 puts for the entire year and that'll obviously help us in terms of weathering this storm.</p>
          <p>Now under this trimmed down capital program we're obviously slowing down spending on the Voyageur project. We will continue to spend on our core businesses, really around reliability and safety, our two big issues. And we will also be completing the Steepbank extraction plant and the Firebag Sulphur plant. That in total is about $325 million of money to go in 2009 on those two individual projects. What we're kind of slowing way down and putting into safe mode is the Voyageur Upgrader, our Upgrader number 3 and then Firebag Stages 3 through 6. And although we haven't right now, I don't have any firm plans about when we'll restart these. What you can expect of us is we'll no longer be talking about Voyageur as a big $20 billion project. What we're going to &#x2013; when we restart these, we'll restart them one project at a time and we'll be doing that determined on two things. First of all the individual economic evaluation of those. A good example of that is the I can tell you the economics on Firebag Stage 3 look very, very solid, very good numbers on a go-forward basis but we're going to do that and trigger that at a time when first of all we feel like we have better control of our costs and secondly when we can fund it without doing any stress at all to our balance sheet. So that's the kind of criteria on a go-forward basis. We'll keep you posted but we're not in a position today to kind of announce when we're going to start that.</p>
          <p>So listen, 2009 is actually a time of opportunity and so this is okay. Listen, you can kind of bemoan the fact that we're in a low crude oil price environment or you can use it to our advantage. For us 2009 is going to be a focus on two things. First of all operational excellence and that is getting the most out of the assets that we have on the ground and there's a lot that we can do with that. In fact you'll see us increase production significantly this year and an opportunity to do some more in 2010. And the second focus beyond operational excellence is cutting costs.</p>
          <p>So if you think about it, this is a time of great uncertainty. There's no question about that and I know that you as investors understand and see that risk. It's also the time of opportunity. For us it's a time to focus on cutting costs and we will have all of our employees engaged in this. It's not just senior management. We'll get our entire workforce engaged which will be very helpful. We will face a period here where we have less competition for human resources both internally and externally in Suncor. I think there will be a much increased value to the jobs that we do provide in our operations across the board, and I think the industry in general, the growth on a go-forward basis will be much better to manage and much easier to manage with much more predictability.</p>
          <p>So my view in short form is that for the first time in almost a half a dozen years we have the opportunity to go out and gain significant control over our costs, and that's costs both on an operating basis and on construction projects on a go-forward basis. So, one of the reasons that slowing down capital spending right now is not a bad thing is that it will enable us to get better control over these projects on a go-forward basis. And listen, we have not had that opportunity in the last, as I mentioned, half a dozen years. This is an opportunity that should not be lost.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to turn it back to John but just say, listen, I'm not a pessimist about this. I actually think this is the opportunity we've kind of waited for. We didn't need it this dramatic, I will tell you that, but the job is quite clear about what we've got to do on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>John, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Rick. What I was going to do is just very quickly do a couple of things, hopefully on the detail side, to just give you the information you're looking for. Clearly on the outlook, it's outlined in the quarterly release, 300,000 barrels a day is our estimate for the year. We continue to drive towards capacity and are looking at the end of the year to begin to look at those kind of numbers. The sales mix is as it's set out for you so you could use that for your modeling, realization 4.50 to 5.50 off of crude. And of course that gets adjusted through the year as the market unfolds. Cash operating costs certainly with the higher volumes we should look at better operating cost this year, 33 to 38. The good news story I think, as Rick was saying, is the natural gas side, 210, which is basically where we exited the year so I think we're pretty happy with that kind of performance there.</p>
          <p>The one piece we didn't put in the quarterly release and I'll give you numbers so I'll go over them slowly, is the FIFO/LIFO adjustment. So for in the quarter for Oil Sands it was plus 20, it would have been plus 20. For R&amp;M it would have been minus 328 and for corporate it was plus 46, so overall minus 262. Year-to-date for Oil Sands negative 19, for R&amp;M negative 203 and for corporate minus 19, so minus 203 for the year. One thing we should mention is the planning assumption we're currently working on for 2009 is about $40 WTI.</p>
          <p>So that's all I was going to or give you in terms of detail of things. Certainly Tim and Maureen will be and I will be around after the call to answer any of your detailed modeling questions so, Josie, why don't we open it up for any strategic questions that the financial community may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on the cost side, with cash cost guidance 33 to 38 not that different but still lower than where things were trending before the fourth quarter in 2008 can you talk more about the benefits of lower crude prices on cash cost and some of the, maybe more specifics on what you mentioned in your opening comments and where that could ultimately take cash costs. Does that lead to downside versus the current range or lower costs versus the current range? Or is some of your endeavors already included in your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, this is John. I'll take that one. Certainly the cash costs 33, 38 if you look at the spot price today it is kind of interesting. The one thing we do have to remember, and I know you know it as well, but the Canadian dollar does help in terms of the realized price. Certainly the biggest driver in terms of reducing those costs and we are seeing it in 2008 is volume and that's our biggest thing is to try get the volumes as high as we can to try to get those unit costs down given the fixed cost nature of the business.</p>
          <p>I can assure you one of our initiatives we are undertaking at the moment is to look at every expense that is being incurred up at Oil Sands. It is hard to predict exactly how low those costs could get but I can tell you we are looking at everything. Certainly we are finding the suppliers through the Oil Sands are a little more agreeable in terms of looking at some opportunities to help us in terms of those costs. We're trying to drive harder bargains, fair bargains, with our suppliers but harder bargains and certainly as Rick has said this is the first time in about six years we actually have that opportunity to drive some harder bargains. So we're taking advantage of doing that.</p>
          <p>We'll update you through the year and as the year unfolds but right now we kind of have to stick with that 33 to 38 but I can assure you we are looking at increasing volumes to try to decrease those costs and also looking at every bit of cost that we do have in the organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And secondly can you talk about the M&amp;A environment and whether you see the low evaluation as an opportunity to buy instead of build to whether it be from a refining or an upstream perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Rick here. I think on the M&amp;A side first of all I do think there will be some bargains around. I don't think we've seen it yet. I think there is still high expectations out there and people hanging on to kind of the history of it rather than a go-forward basis. I've always said that we're interested in downstream but I would say not with our current state. I mean we're going to be very focused and I think our opportunities for us are going to be on these internal projects that we have that are growth and I think the value in this business obviously over the next four or five years is going to be on upstream production i.e. oil production not on refining and marketing which looks very over supplied even as we see gasoline demand start to move back up in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So if you look at it, certainly the valuations on refining assets that are coming way off you've still got to be very, very cautious about that I think in terms of what you'd make money and whether that refinery is survivable. I still think, and I've said this before, is I still think you should see several refinery closures in the U.S. in particular as we go through the next couple of years so you've got to be cautious.</p>
          <p>There should be some &#x2013; also some interest on the natural gas side although I think we may be in for relatively low gas prices for awhile here just because we've got such good supply conditions and so that's &#x2013; it's not necessarily bad news for Suncor because we're large gas consumer as well as a producer. So I would say you won't see us very active on the M&amp;A side but I do think you'll see a lot of M&amp;A action over the next 18 months.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from William Lacey from FirstEnergy Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a few quick questions for you. On the capital you outlined for the base business, about $2 billion, you did point out about a little over $300 million, what that was being used for, but the other 1.7 billion still seemed a little bit high. Is there any other projects that you're undertaking as far as reliability, what have you, that is sort of extraordinary in 2009 versus what we call more of a sustaining budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is a couple of items in there. I'll give you an example is the net slurry at base. There's some capital in that number for that and it's not an insignificant amount of capital. I can't give you the exact number at this moment. And we still have a few tailings lines that we're putting in the new urethane-lined tailings lines, so we have some that kind of tailing work of that reliability stuff that's in there. Our expectation for 2010 is that we can get our sustaining capital, the base business, below $2 million. I can't give an exact number now. And again we'll be squeezing these issues as we go through 2009, but we do have a number of kind of I would say one-off items that need to be cleared out as we go into this.</p>
          <p>One of the things you'll notice about Suncor is that this capital spending in '09 will be heavily leveraged to the front end of the year partly because if you think about the sulphur plant in Firebag it will be done by April and the Steepback extraction plant will be done right at the tail end of the second quarter, and so a lot of this stuff is going to be front-end loaded. We will spend very much less capital starting in about June and July of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Firebag 3 is concerned, I know John that there wasn't a detailed breakdown of where everything was standing and obviously that's probably reflecting the current state of what you're doing on the growth initiatives but can you give a bit of an update as to where you stood at the end of the year as far as sort of percentage of capital spent on the engineering and construction of Firebag 3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So this is Rick here. Well so, yes, we would've been virtually complete on engineering on Stage 3 or pretty close to it and we would've been about 50% done on construction. We would've had a to-go capital base right at the end of the year of about 1.3 to $1.4 billion. Now we will still spend some of that money because we're going to take delivery of the equipment. These projects will be built. It's just a matter of when, okay? So this is not &#x2013; we're not stopping. What I will say is that as we restart that we feel like we'll have much better control of our costs on a go-forward basis and so downing tools right now I think will also help send a message to all of our contractors and staff that we're very serious about a much lower price environment going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about where the exit production was for Oil Sands in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the December numbers were put out. So we had 235. Now that included the issue that we had in November. So that was what we produced in December. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well we did Bill, we had a little bit of a slower ramp up to answer your question specifically, we had a little bit of a slower ramp up after the fire. We didn't quite hit the 300 that we were anticipating and sort of the early part of January it has been a bit tough as Rick mentioned with the cold weather. Production is improving. We are beginning to move up. We have seen a few days that we've been approaching the 300,000 but it has been a little bit of a slower ramp up. We're not concerned at all right now in terms of the guidance and in terms of the overall 300. One of the reasons we're at 300 is usually the first quarter is a little tough...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're probably reasonably comfortable I think where we are in terms of production even though we did not hit the 300 number which we had hoped that we would hit by the end of the year. And that was primarily because of the fire that we had early in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John it's really important to remember these temperatures always make operations a little more difficult and the first quarter can normally be your worst or slowest quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Last question and I'll turn it over to others who I'm sure have lots. I'll bring up your pet peeve here, hedges. You did mention sort of the benefit of the hedges right now, that you do have some of the volumes hedged at around $60. As you move forward and look to potentially reinitiate the process on Firebag 3 and beyond, do you see the value of putting in some sort of hedging policy to protect the capital moving forward versus what you had to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Will, it's Ken Alley here, and good morning everyone. You know, that's something we will look at. As you know, in the past we have looked at hedging to support the balance sheet and to sustain growth &#x2013; profitable growth programs when we feel we need to buy some insurance for the balance sheet. So we will continue to evaluate hedge opportunities as we move forward here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Josie, before you go to the next call, I just wanted to remind everybody, in the fourth quarter, we don't, and I think most companies don't put an MD&amp;A into their quarterly release. And that's where that capital table is, is in the MD&amp;A, so that's why it didn't show up in the fourth quarter. I think, Will, you had mentioned that right at the front-end of your question. So just to give you a specific answer, we're not excluding it; it just is included in the MD&amp;A, which is not included in the fourth quarter release. Go ahead</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I just was curious to get your thoughts on kind of the limits of your capital structure under your new $40 a barrel price tag. You used to reference kind of a two times cash flow as a debt limit. Obviously, that looked quite different under a lower &#x2013; on the lower side of the commodity price spectrum. Certainly, if you annualize the fourth quarter you're already well above that amount. I know there's some reasons why we shouldn't necessarily do that, but just how are you thinking about how far you could stretch the balance sheet if we did see 40 bucks a barrel for the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Robert, it's Ken Alley here. So let me take everyone through that so they've got the picture. First of all, I would say on the two times debt-to-cash flow target, that is a mid-cycle target. So that's through the commodity price cycle, so it's not intended to be a hard limit at the bottom of the cycle, which we believe we're in today.</p>
          <p>I guess I would just say generally in terms of financial flexibility here, Rick said it very well, and clearly, the focus of the company here is to be prudent in a period of significant uncertainty. The capital plan, the operating plan that Rick outlined, puts us in a very good position to weather this stage of the commodity price cycle and the uncertainty we see over the next year. We are preparing ourselves to deal with a commodity price that's in the $40 range and potentially downside from that; we feel that that's the prudent thing to do right now. That may not be where commodity prices end up, and in fact, we don't expect they will end up there by the end of the year. But, as Rick said, we don't have any clarity or transparency as to when that improvement comes about. So we are prepared to work through a period of lower prices here at this stage of the cycle.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet has been positioned to support those operating and capital plans. We have significant financial flexibility. All of our long-term &#x2013; our term debt is long-term, so we have no refinancing requirements over the next couple of years. Most of it is out in the 2020 and beyond period. Our only refinancing is in 2011, that's a small piece of $500 million. So no refinancing during this period. We do have our major source of liquidity going into this year is our syndicated bank facility. You'll recall it's $3.75 billion committed through to 2013. So it's a long-term program. Going into this year, into December, coming into January, we have about $3.5 billion between cash on hand and available capacity on that line to get us through this period. So we feel the operating plan, the capital plan and the financial capacity will get us through whatever we need to deal with over the next six to 12 months.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ken, just a real quick follow-up. Where would you expect that unused facility to be by the end of the year at $40 a barrel? How much would you churn through?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know it's going to depend on a lot of other factors, but I mean we are prepared to deal with a debt increase in the kind of the 2 to $3 billion range if necessary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Had a question on Voyageur. I was curious if you all looked at potentially bringing in a partner, setting aside a discrete set of the Voyageur assets for that instead of delaying the project? I know it's not historically your style, but if you looked at it would it be possible that the cost savings of sort of building through this very weak period and accelerating the cash flow sort of offset the value that you would give away? Or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a great question and I think the answer is listen, we're open for business. We'd look at &#x2013; I would look at maybe a piece of the upgrader in terms of doing something on a joint venture basis or other basis, there's no problem about that. What we're not in the mood for I guess is at all giving up on reserves. So I would not do a Husky DP or EnCana-Conoco type deal just because I think there's so much more value in owning reserves as opposed to any kind of downstream asset. And so absolutely we're open for business. We are talking to other people in terms of either a long-term processing deal or even ownership of upgrading type assets, but not reserves. That's the core of why Suncor exists today and we're not giving up on that.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. I was just wondering with the reduced capital spending whether that would affect your cash taxability this year in 2009, if you could comment on that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. We've seen lots of gyrations on the WTI near-term price, and so, Rick, I was wondering if you could give us some insight as to what the SCO market is doing and how you're priced on your product?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, maybe I'll let John answer that. We certainly have not had any problems moving the volumes and I think that partly deals with some of the other operators in the area have issues or have not gotten started. And so I think this stuff has been easy to clear through the market. John, I don't know if you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms of specific pricing, Brian, certainly we have seen SCO priced at a bit of a premium over WTI. And it really goes back to the production issues that the entire industry has been having over the last little while and the shortage of synthetic going into the market. So that is the biggest bear, particularly on Edmonton pricing, for synthetic and where that goes so it's not just the posted price that one has to look at. You also have to look at the availability of supply as always in this particular market, and that's what's been driving the synthetic pricing.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the past you've talked about some marketing initiatives about taking space on some of the new pipelines. Have those plans comes forward at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, we continue look at all of those and we are a supporter and a shipper on Keystone. We keep looking at these pipelines in terms of which ones we should take. One of our actually challenges now in this environment is, Brian, is that we actually are now concerned that we're going to be pipe long not pipe short, which is complete flip flop from 18 months ago. And so what you've got to do here is be careful that we don't overbuild pipe at such a rate that we end up with higher charges than &#x2013; and I'm talking about as an industry than we need, especially in this environment. So we continue to review, I don't want to get too specific just because we're one of the larger producers of oil in Canada we can kind of &#x2013; if you will make a significant move. I would just say we are on it and continue to take our looks at that. If anything right now I'd be a little bit concerned about being pipe long and not pipe short.</p>
