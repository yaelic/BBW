        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome. I'm Oleg Maximov from Troika Dialog and this is Novatek first quarter 2012 financial results conference call. With us today, as usual, is Mark Gyetvay, Novatek's Chief Financial Officer and Member of the Board of Directors.</p>
          <p>Mark, please start with your presentation. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Oleg. Ladies and gentlemen, shareholders and colleagues, good evening and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this evening and again extend our sincere gratitude to Troika Dialog and Oleg Maximov for organizing and hosting our earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with the specific conference call details, I would like to refer you to our disclaimer statement as is our normal practice. During this conference call, we may make references to forward-looking statements by using words such as plans, objectives, goals, strategies and other similar words, which are other than statements of historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from those implied by such forward-looking statements due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and reflect our views as at the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to revise our publicly released results and any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Please refer to our regulatory files including our Annual Review for the year ended the 31st of December 2011, as well as any of our earnings press release and documents throughout the past year for more descriptions of the risk that may influence our results.</p>
          <p>For tonight's conference call, I want to focus on a few crucial points that emerged recently regarding the Ministry of Finance's proposed changes to the Mineral Extraction Tax or MET, as well as what is our position regarding this important topic. However, I will not go into depth or engage in a debate that is purely speculative because we are presently formulating our position in this important area.</p>
          <p>As you can appreciate, the proposed changes in the MET of this magnitude obviously raises concerns about the government's intention on increasing the economic rent for oil and gas producers in Russia, that the proposed changes were considered significant especially towards the independent gas producers with a different revenue and commodity pricing model.</p>
          <p>It is also important to frame this discussion in terms of facts, not market speculation, because as of today, the Min Fin's proposition is just that, a position that is subject to further review and discussion prior to final decision.</p>
          <p>We completely understand everyone's concerns regarding these proposed punitive tax changes, and equally important, we understand investors' sentiment toward Russia country risk and the negative impact these types of changes imply for further investment opportunities in Russia.</p>
          <p>Everyone wants some measure of predictability rather than irrational behavior. And you can also appreciate this point from our perspective, as we invest significant capital and field development, infrastructure and processing complexes. We have never avoided discussing these types of issues in any of our investor meetings or conference calls. And we don't plan to shy away from addressing these types of topics today.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, everyone must understand that this particular topic, MET, or for that matter, tariff changes to gas prices and transport charges are considered non-controllable by the company and we purposely separate and disclose this fact in our analysis of operating expenses. What we can do and what we will continue to do is to lobby our position on these matters and I can assure everyone tonight, we have not lost this ability as some analysts have speculated in their write-ups to this topic.</p>
          <p>Conversely, we are actively involved in the discussions and will attempt to position our arguments accordingly to minimize any significant impact to our operating cash flows. We strongly disagree with the Min Fin's position regarding the principle way of calculating and assessing the MET rate and we believe a different position will be adopted once it becomes law.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it is too premature for us to speculate at this point what the impact on our EBITDA will be in 2015, so we'll let the analysts make these particular assumptions. Increasing the net rate only in relation to the domestic gas market is not a correct position and we believe a different methodology will be adopted, which would at least take into account inflation and transport tariff increases.</p>
          <p>While on this important topic, I would like to remind everyone this evening, as I have done in my investor meetings, that when we deal with the topic of taxation, we do not view this issue as one-dimensional, but rather, we assess the impact as three-dimensional, pricing, transport and tax, and try to frame our analysis and arguments along these lines. Our aim is to minimize the negative impact on our netback realizations. And we believe we have done a good job to date, achieving our aims.</p>
          <p>Another important dimension that seem to be overlooked in a speculative frenzy is our goal of moving closer to the end consumer, implying that the transport tariff is also key in these discussions on preserving our netback margins.</p>
          <p>In fact, if you analyze our operating expense categories, you will note that transportation in general represents 78% of our non-controllable expenses and approximately 51% of our total operating expenses. Or within the specific transportation category for natural gas, representing about 80% of our transport expenses, which shows you why this single category is important in managing our netback margins.</p>
          <p>Without question, we were surprised by the significance of the many analysts' negative write-downs of EBITDA for 2015, which implies to us that our comments regarding domestic gas price tariffs is not being heard or worse yet, ignored. I've made it absolutely clear on many investor meetings as well as our strategy presentation in London that our position vis-&#xE0;-vis domestic gas prices is contrary to what I believe many analysts use in their models.</p>
          <p>Moreover, I mentioned that on our full year 2011 earnings conference call and we do not anticipate significant changes to gas MET paid by the independent producers, since these percentage increases were already approved in the Russian budget and that we should get some indication on the range of MET discussions as we approach the next three-year budget period.</p>
          <p>It is also quite frustrating to read many ill-advised commentary on questioning the fundamental assumptions and forecast for our business model. We have a clear and enviable track record of delivering quality results and negating these facts with purely speculative conjecture is beyond comprehension.</p>
          <p>We should not confuse matters that are controllable from those that are non-controllable. The government's imposition of additional tax burden on an industry sector is a troublesome issue to all of us, but it's an issue that is not controllable from a single entity but rather requires a collective and insightful lobbying effort by many, and we will continue to take an active role in these efforts.</p>
          <p>Another recent topic that has emerged on these MET discussions is the possibility of eventual export rights according to independent gas producers. The correlation of topics is reasonable to assume, but again, quite premature to speculate.</p>
          <p>While on this topic, I would like to clarify a point that was unfortunately disclosed in an analytical report in one of my private group meetings without my permission but was purely framed as a question from an investor to me where I provided some theoretical export options. My response to this question was not implying that we already had some insights into potential or imminent export rights, but merely trying to explain that there are some theoretical options to consider, and we will explore all possible avenues to increase our operating cash flows and improve and/or enhance our netback margins.</p>
          <p>I can state that we have been dealing with the possible resolutions in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (09:34) export question, and if the proposed MET rate increase is put into effect for deliveries to the Russian domestic market, based on domestic pricing and supplies, we will act more insistently on obtaining a positive decision allowing us to export natural gas with the aim of resolving this question in 2013.</p>
          <p>In the event that the principle of calculating the MET rate increase will be implemented as proposed by the Min Fin, we may revise our long-term strategy towards increasing our equity stake in LNG projects on the Yamal Peninsula and accordingly, adjust our equity stake in the Yamal LNG Project, despite the fact that we are currently negotiating with several companies and we have moved forward significantly in the negotiation process.</p>
          <p>We will also consider increasing the output of LNG on the Yamal Peninsula at the expense of developing assets on Gydan Peninsula in order to minimize the negative impact on Novatek's operating cash flows due to an increase in our net tax obligations. Therefore, this is not a simple and straightforward discussion and we will continue to present our position that addresses all of the relevant points.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we began purchasing and reselling natural gas in the Russian domestic market from natural gas purchase from Sibur Holdings, a related party, as part of a long-term purchase contract that we previously disclosed.</p>
          <p>In addition, we also completed our first quarter of marketing natural gas through our wholly-owned marketing subsidiary, Novatek-Chelyabinsk, post the acquisition of Gazprom Mezhregiongas Chelyabinsk which was completed in December 2010, will significantly increase our sales to this important consuming region.</p>
          <p>We sold approximately 40% of our total sales volume to end consumers to this region in the reporting period as compared to 17% and 30% in the first and fourth quarters 2011 respectively or by approximately 5.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas.</p>
          <p>We will continue to penetrate and expand our gas sales to regional markets as part of our overall commercial marketing plan and we will utilize our existing infrastructure and marketing subsidiaries to facilitate these goals as outlined in our Strategy Day Presentation.</p>
          <p>The first phase of SeverEnergia's Samburgskoye field was launched recently towards the end of April which essentially fast tracked the field's production by utilizing our existing infrastructure at the Yurkharov to Purovsky Unstable Gas Pipeline and our processing capacity at the Purovsky Plant. We will provide additional update on the field's performance during subsequent conference calls but presently, we are producing approximately 6 million cubic meters of natural gas and roughly 800 tons of gas condensate per day.</p>
          <p>We plan to launch the second train or line during the fourth quarter, thus increasing the field's overall productive capacity by another 6 million cubic meters per day and approximately 800 tons of gas condensate according to schedule.</p>
          <p>The increase in SeverEnergia's total production will also correspond with our plans to expand our overall processing capacity at the Purovsky Plant by 6 million tons done in two stages of 3 million-ton upgrades in 2013 and 2014. We are also planning to expand the Yurkharov to Purovsky Unstable Gas Pipeline to accommodate the additional volumes of expected gas condensate from these fields.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the first quarter, we began developing the oil layers at both the East-Tarkosalinskoye and the Khancheyskoye fields which increased our crude oil production by 44,000 tons year-on-year and by 15,000 tons quarter-on-quarter. Although the overall volumes of 99,000 tons represent less than 1% of our total production on a barrel of oil equivalent during the quarter, it is still accretive to our earnings because of the field's location, north of the 65 parallel and the correspondent zero MET exemption which became effective on the 1st of January 2010 &#x2013; 2012, excuse me.</p>
          <p>We continued works on a number of different projects during the first quarter and spent approximately RUB 7.5 billion on capital projects, representing an increase of 18.6% year-on-year and a decrease quarter-on-quarter of 22.2%. Specifically, we increased our capital spending at Ust-Luga Transshipment and Gas Fractionation Plant, an ongoing drilling activity at the East-Tarkosalinskoye field, particularly relating to our crude oil development activities.</p>
          <p>Of particular note during the quarter was the significant decrease of 29% in the Yurkharovskoye field's capital spending program, which is consistent with our previous comments that this important field is moving closer towards maintenance capital unless a decision is made to expand the field's productive capacity beyond the approximately 4 billion cubic meters we plan to add by yearend 2012.</p>
          <p>These three capital projects aggregated 69% of our total capital spend during the period and we are still forecasting a total capital expenditure program for 2012 at roughly RUB 50 billion. If there are any revisions in this capital program, we will update everyone on subsequent conference call, but as of today, there are no changes to our forecasted capital expenditure program.</p>
          <p>One particular capital project of interest to investors is our Yamal LNG, and I can confirm we are working according to the project time schedule outlined in December at our Strategy Day Presentation. We received the initial FEED study on the engineering consortium led by CB&amp;I Lummus and are currently preparing tenders for long lead items this summer.</p>
          <p>There are some additional works needed to finalize this FEED study, which we plan to finish over the next couple of months. The procurement of long lead items is one of the critical paths to ensure a timely conclusion of the project, and in April, a team of specialists held a series of meetings in London with potential LNG contractors to explain the project, go over some of the requirements in the FEED study and discuss the tender process for long lead items.</p>
          <p>We expect to finalize some of the EPC tender contracts this month, and the remainder in the third and fourth quarter 2012 for long lead items. And once the FEED study is completed around June, we will submit the report to the relative bodies of the Russian government for expert review with the aim of making the final investment decision by year-end. There is a defined process that needs to be adhered to and we are proceeding accordingly.</p>
          <p>We continue to hold discussions with potential partners on farm-out of an additional interest in Yamal LNG, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the farm-out is not crucial and we will continue to study our options. We have the main strategic investor, Total, already in the project and we are moving ahead according to the timetable we have outlined for the project. And as I have already stated, we will consider this whole process in light of the MET discussions and make a decision which we feel is in the best interest of the company.</p>
          <p>We are proceeding forward with works at the port facility during the winter construction season this year and next to ensure that the facilities are available to accept materials for delivery when required. Ongoing works continue at the airport facilities, housing complex and fuel depots to name a few, and we have already delivered the first new rig built by Euromast to the field site and another custom drilling rig is currently being fabricated. We project the drilling of initial production wells to commence sometime in the third quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Another important announcement we made during the quarter was a Memorandum of Understanding we've signed with Gazprom, whereby we will endeavor to work together to develop resources on the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas. Specifically, we agreed to form a joint venture owned 75% by Gazprom, 25% by Novatek, whereby Gazprom will contribute its Tambey fields and we will develop these fields and potentially expand the overall production of LNG, utilizing the port facilities at Sabetta by another 20 million tons per annum.</p>
          <p>Although discussions are quite early at this point, we raised the possibility at our recent Strategy Day Presentation by indicating the potential to raise the overall level of LNG produced on the Yamal Peninsula to 25 million to 30 million tons per annum.</p>
          <p>The second part of this announcement was the formation of another joint venture equally owned at 50% each, whereby we, Novatek, will contribute our recently acquired licenses at the Utrenny license area to the joint venture located on the Gydan Peninsula, and we would jointly develop this important field, with the aim of connecting this area to the Yamburg Pipeline infrastructure owned and operated by Gazprom. The gas produced from this field will be delivered to the Russian domestic market.</p>
          <p>We have established working groups between our respective companies and have begun working on implementing these projects. But the ultimate decision regarding the pace of work and the timing of project will rest on the outcome of the MET discussions. Depending on the outcome of the MET discussions, one option would be move forward with the projects that have export potential rather than projects delivering natural gas to the Russian domestic market. We will keep our various options open while these discussions are underway.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, I would like to briefly discuss the operational and financial results achieved in the first quarter 2012 before opening the session to questions and answers. Our natural gas and liquids production, excluding purchases and inventory movements, increased by 9.3% and 5.5% respectively during the first quarter 2012 as compared to the prior year, which is trending slightly higher than our full year forecast on a percentage basis.</p>
          <p>We have maintained this strong production trend for natural gas in April 2012 and early May during the traditional trough periods. In fact, our natural gas production for the month of May &#x2013; for the month of April, was approximately 20% higher year-on-year and relatively consistent with the prior month's production runs, although, this fact was missed or overlooked during the MET frenzy.</p>
          <p>For natural gas, we have strong production growth from our three core fields led by an 11.5% growth in production from Yurkharovskoye field of by approximately 900 million cubic meters. We also increased our purchase of natural gas from our joint ventures amounting to 1.4 billion cubic meters, representing an increase of 2.8%, as well as commencing purchases from third parties, totaling 900 million cubic meters as compared to no volumes purchased in the first quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>As to natural gas sales, we increased our volumes sold year-on-year by approximately 2.1 billion cubic meters or by 14.7%, and quarter-on-quarter by 471 million cubic meters or by 3%. The biggest change in our natural gas sales was the distribution of the volumes sold between end consumers and wholesale traders. In the first quarter, we significantly increased our percentage of natural gas sold to end consumers from 51% in the first quarter of 2011 to 76% in the current reporting period, an increase of roughly 25%.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the fourth quarter 2011, we increased our proportion of sales to end consumers from roughly 57% to the current 76%. The change in our natural gas sales mix is important for a number of reasons, but essentially meant that we achieved a higher realized average price, stronger netback realization excluding residential sales of approximately RUB 79 per thousand cubic meters or $2.61 per mcm based on current exchange and was able to effectively control our production profile by maintaining the customer relationship.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we significantly increased our sales volumes to the Chelyabinsk region, representing 40% of our end customers' volumes sold which also contributed with the higher average realized price and improved netback margins.</p>
          <p>The more we transport gas to end consumers, the higher our overall cost incurred to transport natural gas and this was clearly demonstrated in the higher transport cost year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter as reported in our operating expenses. But it is important to note that some of our best netback margins are achieved closer to the point of reduction.</p>
          <p>Our average realized prices for end consumer sales during the first quarter 2012 decreased slightly by two-tenths of 1% in comparison to year-on-year and is slightly higher than those realized quarter-on-quarter. For ex-field or wholesale trader sales, our average realized price increased year-on-year by approximately RUB 11 per mcm or by eight-tenths of 1% and was slightly higher by 1.1% with the price that we received for this category of sales quarter-on-quarter .</p>
          <p>As a reminder, we have no tariff increase for our natural gas pricing during the first quarter 2012 and the effective date of raising tariffs by 15% is scheduled to be the first of July, representing essentially a 7.5% year-on-year increase when implemented.</p>
          <p>We continue to achieve a higher margin differential between end consumers and ex-field netbacks excluding trading activities and sales to residential customers, as compared to the prior year which continues these pricing dynamics achieved prior to the economic crisis although we cannot be certain that these trends will remain consistent or continue to fluctuate period-on-period.</p>
          <p>Our overall netback margins for natural gas sold during the current reporting period increased by RUB 99 per thousand cubic meters or by 7% as compared to the prior year, an increase slightly by eight-tenths of 1% quarter-on-quarter. The increase in our netback margins was primarily due to our sales mix and our geographical regions.</p>
          <p>We also decreased our overall distance to transporting natural gas to end consumers by approximately 2% and 6% year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter respectively, averaging approximately 1,800 kilometers during the first quarter 2012.</p>
          <p>The geographical markets representing at least 10% of our sales volume was the Chelyabinsk and Perm regions which were different from the comparable reporting periods, which generally have four regions of at least 10% sales including Moscow, Orenburg, Perm, and Chelyabinsk.</p>
          <p>We ended the first quarter 2012 with an inventory balance of 32 million cubic meters versus 760 million cubic meters of natural gas in underground storage facilities at yearend, representing a reduction of approximately 728 million cubic meters as compared to the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>For liquids, we managed to increase our liquid production year-on-year by 5.5% and quarter-on-quarter by 2.1%, led by the production growth at our Yurkharovskoye field and our East-Tarkosalinskoye field. With the Yurkharovskoye field accounting for about two-thirds of our liquids production, which has been relatively consistent over the past few periods.</p>
          <p>Although we managed to increase our production in liquids for the reporting period, our overall sales of stable gas condensate was lower year-on-year by 4.7% and quarter-on-quarter by 10.4% due primarily to a build-up of inventory movements between reporting periods. We do not recognize revenues until such time that the product reached its intended destination and our inventory movements fluctuate period-on-period depending on loading schedules and ports of destination.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we have four tankers in transit at the Asian-Pacific region representing approximately 240,000 tons in waterborne transit which are generally recognized in the following period. This is purely a revenue timing issue.</p>
          <p>Stable gas condensate continue to represent the largest portion of our liquid sales, although volumes sold during the first quarter were down relative volumes sold year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, with a decrease in volumes sold principally due to inventory in transit. During the first quarter, we sold 624,000 tons versus 724,000 tons in the corresponding period and 847,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We increased the volumes of LPG sold in the first quarter by 3.9% year-on-year and 5.3% quarter-on-quarter. Crude oil sales during the reporting period was also up by 66% and 12.2% relative to the first and fourth quarters 2011, but as I previously mentioned, represented less than 1% of our total sales volumes for the period.</p>
          <p>Our overall liquids hydrocarbon volumes in inventory aggregated 449,000 tons at period end versus 371,000 tons year-on-year and 325,000 at yearend. Almost 352,000 tons represented stable gas condensate in inventory.</p>
          <p>Commodity prices remained robust in the first quarter 2011 and were primarily driven by double-digit growth in Ural and Brent benchmark prices.</p>
          <p>Our average export netbacks on a U.S. dollar basis per stable gas condensate and LPG volumes sold during the period increased by approximately 7.1% and decreased by 2.7% respectively, despite increases in both export duties during both periods and a slight decrease in other transportation expenses.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the fourth quarter, our average export netbacks for stable gas condensate increased by 29.4% largely due to an increase in our average contractual price by 12.7% and a slight decrease in the export duties which was offset by increases in both our rail and transport tariff costs.</p>
          <p>For stable gas condensate, we sold 624,000 tons, realized in an average netback price per ton of $513 per ton in the first quarter as compared to $479 per ton in the corresponding period and $397 per ton in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we dispatched 15 tankers of stable gas condensate in the Port of Vitino, of which six tankers were destined to the European markets, two tankers were destined to the United States, and the remaining seven tankers destined to the Asia Pacific region.</p>
          <p>Our Purovsky Plant operated at 79% of its weighted capacity with a total plant output reaching 986,000 tons, comprised of 749,000 of stable gas condensate, 232,000 tons of LPG, and 5,000 tons of methanol products. On a total barrel of oil equivalent basis, we increased our first quarter production to 104 million barrels of oil equivalent versus 96 million barrels of oil equivalent in the prior reporting period, representing an average total hydrocarbon per day of 1,139,000 barrels per day, an increase of 7.3% year-on-year. We had no major surprises to our operating cost during the first quarter relative to the continued growth of our revenues. Our total operating expenses increased in absolute terms from RUB 23.4 billion to RUB 31.9 billion, an increase as a percent of revenues from 52% to 59%, largely due to the significant increase in transportation expenses and third-party purchases.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses in the fourth quarter amounted to RUB 28.9 billion and was relatively consistent as the percentage of revenues as compared to the current reporting period. As expected, the most significant changes in our operating expenses for the comparative period was a relative increase in our transportation expenses which is explainable by the overall growth in our end customer sales, combined with the annual tariff increase as compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we significantly increased our sales to end consumer on a volume basis by 72% and 38% as compared to the first and fourth quarters, respectively. During the first quarter, we managed to reduce our transport cost on a per unit basis of delivery for natural gas with an average transport rate per thousand cubic meters declining by a RUB 135 per mcm or by 11.2%, despite a significantly higher proportion of end customer sales in the period. For liquids, we had a reduction in our transport cost by tanker, which is largely driven by the increase in goods in transit and to a lesser extent, the geographical mix of our sales volumes.</p>
          <p>We continue to effectively manage and control our G&amp;A expenses at the normal course of business, although these expenses continue to fluctuate period-on-period in this controllable expense category, due primarily to semi-annual and annual bonus payments and our accruals, charitable contributions, consultant services and business travel expenses among other line items.</p>
          <p>The main increase in our G&amp;A expenses was attributable to employee bonus accruals in the amount of RUB 188 million, an increase in our overall employee head count from the acquisition of the Chelyabinsk gas trader and the salary indexation of 9.6% effective on July 1, 2011.</p>
          <p>After the end of the first quarter, the company had a total head count of approximately 4,645 employees, of which 1,338 employees or 29% represent employees classified under the general and administrative category. Although our total head count increased year-on-year by approximately 890 employees which was representing additional employees acquired from the regional gas trader and an increase in employees hired to work at our retail distribution subsidiary.</p>
          <p>We had a significant increase in our exploration expenses quarter-on-quarter of approximately RUB 717 million which was largely attributable to the expense in the geophysical works, primarily seismic activities during the reporting period. The primary change year-on-year was also due to the expense in the seismic expenses that incurred which is required by the successful efforts accounting policy. In the previous year, we also wrote off unsuccessful exploration wells at our El Arish and Raduzhny licensed areas.</p>
          <p>As a result of the factors enumerated above, our EBITDA and net profit margins continue to remain robust in the respective reporting periods, achieving levels of approximately 45% and 39%, respectively for the first quarter of 2012, which is consistent with our overall financial guidance.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and liquidity position continue to remain strong throughout the reporting period as we reduced our overall net debt position from RUB 69.4 billion in the first quarter of 2011 to RUB 48.1 billion in the current period. Our net debt position stood at RUB 71.7 billion at year end.</p>
          <p>All of our liquidity and credit ratios strengthened throughout the period and we ended the first quarter with a cash and cash equivalent position of RUB 27.7 billion or approximately $940 million. We remained cash flow positive during the reporting period and in the first quarter, with a record level of free cash flow for the company based on the quarterly results at RUB 16.4 billion or 28% higher than the prior year. We will continue to fund our capital expenditure program through internally-generated cash flows and have the ability to meet all of our debt obligations and liabilities that may mature or become due for payment.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we ended the current reporting period where we left off full year, with record financial and operational results and a strong platform for growth. As we harness the energy of the far north, we will no doubt encounter new challenges, yet the opportunities are enormous for us to continue expanding our resource base, our production profile and our global reach.</p>
          <p>Despite the uncertainties concerning the ongoing discussions relating to MET for natural gas, we remain steadfast in our investment program and our commitment to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns and we strongly believe the decision advocated by the Min Fin is not a correct position to support ongoing development activities and foster an attractive investment environment for Russia.</p>
          <p>Investors want predictability in the markets where they invest. And we also want the same level of certainty as we embark on new challenging capital projects to ensure our future production growth and supply sources of energy. We will continue on our lobbying efforts to ensure that our position is heard.</p>
          <p>I would like to sincerely thank all our valued shareholders for the positive support they have provided to us, despite the recent periods of market volatility and speculative commentary. We will continue to keep everyone apprised of these important matters as has been our market practice. And we look forward to meeting you directly on investor meetings and conferences in the upcoming months.</p>
          <p>I would like to end this portion of the conference call and now open the session to questions and answers. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Hello, Mark. This is Geydar Mamedov from Goldman Sachs. I have two questions, if I may. The first one is in relation to Yamal LNG. If I understood correctly from your comments, you have mentioned that if the Ministry of Finance proposal to raise the mineral extraction tax on independent gas producers is adopted, then you might reconsider the strategy in relation to the Yamal LNG and might decide to keep the higher stakes than before &#x2013; than you planned before, i.e., higher than 51%. Is this understanding correct?</p>
          <p>And the second question is in relation to the export access &#x2013; or pipeline export access. Are there negotiations currently going on between Novatek and the government in relation to the potential pipeline export access at all or this is just something that Novatek will consider if the Ministry of Finance goes ahead and the government and the current minister goes ahead with the approval of the increase in the MET?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. Thank you very much for the presentation. I also have two question. My first question, we are &#x2013; as we see the data coming out from Europe and also domestically in Russia, we might admit that we are actually pretty stagnant gas markets right now. And given that the economic projections are not as high as they were in 2007-2008 for both markets, we might be facing a pretty slow growth environment in the gas consumption for the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>My question is, as we see from several monthly data, Gazprom's production is declining, your production is increasing at the same time. Do you think the situation is sustainable? And do you see any threats to your gas production goals that you stated during your strategy presentation? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question I just wanted to clarify. You said that you disagreed with the pricing projections that, if I understood you correctly, that the analysts have in their models for Novatek. Could you clarify are we basically too bullish, too bearish or what have we missed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, when you look at the &#x2013; as you said, in the next couple of years, it's a relatively short-term view, and you're absolutely correct. I mean, EU is still going through its problems, and overall demand is stagnant as you rightly pointed out. But they also, converse side of that particular argument, is that EU production, indigenous production is still declining rapidly. So we believe that there is opportunity for continued expansion of natural gas sales in the European market. And as you know, the Asia Pacific, particularly China, et cetera, and the imports of LNG to Japan are booming at this particular point.</p>
          <p>In terms of our Strategy Presentation, yes, we have not &#x2013; we stick by those numbers of doubling our gas production by 2020. We have now revised &#x2013; there's no need to revise them at this particular juncture. And since we don't invest in short-term projects, it's important for us to continue looking at making these capital investments over a long period of time. So we're sticking to the strategy that we've outlined in December, the new modifications at this particular point, unless we have the MET issue which then will obviously change and we'll come back and revise that accordingly.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pricing, what I said on the second point and part of your second question is that it's obvious, it's obvious to us. I mean &#x2013; when I see the dark of 20% to 25% EBITDA adjustments to people's models for the year 2015, you obviously got a question what pricing assumption people are using in their model. And I'm afraid to say that we still see and I still hear commentary that are being conveyed to investors that the pricing model proposed by some analysts, I'm not saying all of the analysts, but some analysts, are much higher than the ones that we've outlined in our Strategy Presentation. I think I've been absolutely clear in stating that our 125,000 &#x2013; $125 and $150 was a range.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark. thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first point, sorry about that, like I said, that the economic situation in Europe is obviously understood by everybody, the growth of natural gas consumption is slowing, although the other element, the converse element of that is the rapid decline in indigenous production.</p>
          <p>And we know that Asia Pacific market, notably China and LNG to Japan is actually booming in this particular time period. So we believe that there should be no revisions to our long-term forecast outlined in &#x2013; by 2020 whereby we stated in our strategy presentation that we plan to double our natural gas production by that particular time.</p>
          <p>On the second point you raised is the question on pricing, and it becomes obvious to us, as I mentioned, that the write-offs, the EBITDA margin or EBITDA reductions of 20% to 25% by 2015, clearly implies to us that there's obviously a difference in pricing assumptions, and I hear that from time to time from my meetings with investors.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm not accusing or stating that all analysts are evocating a higher price, but obviously some are, and what we clearly stated and I clearly stated in our strategy presentation that the company's position vis-&#xE0;-vis natural gas, we don't believe in this export pricing parity basis and we said that market liberalization will be between $125 per thousand cubic meters and $150 per thousand cubic meters. However, it could spike up from time to time but that's baked into the relative range we believe is acceptable for consumption growth in Russia.</p>
          <p>So, that obviously implies that our pricing model is quite different, is more conservative than those being used by other analysts, because I just don't see any significant write downs to our earnings EBITDA relating to those orders of magnitude of 25%. That's my point.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Mark. I have a question on exports as well. I think it's probably safe to assume that at some point in the future, everyone will be able to export gas independently from Gazprom. But if we're talking about, let's say, one to two years' horizon and I understand it's premature probably to talk about that but maybe you have any thought you could share. Do you think it would rather be an agreement with Gazprom as an export agent, which is obviously what you have done already in the past with respect to offshore projects or you could actually target the European customers and you could actually be able to sign contracts with European customers on your own? Do you think this could be &#x2013; do you think the latter option would be considered as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned previously, on the last earnings conference call, and I confirmed that we were in the process of negotiating contracts with end consumers in Western Europe, but at that particular time, we did not have anything finalized, and we said that's coming from our trading group in Novatek Gas and Power. So that's one option.</p>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; I'm not &#x2013; again, we're not here to speculate. We're not here to talk about something that's not defined yet, so what I would just say as I mentioned in the past, we are in the process, we are looking at this seriously. You've seen my comments. You heard some reports that came out today. We are working very closely on looking at all the options to increase our operating cash flows and enhance our netback margins, and one of those avenues is obviously the export route.</p>
          <p>Now, can we use that agency? That is one of the options that can be proposed, but I would say at this point, it's too premature and I would just wait until we get some more definitive answers coming up and we will definitely disclose that because obviously, as everybody can appreciate, that's a very strong catalyst for our stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, and just a follow-up question, obviously, I'm not talking about big politics but rather the &#x2013; your view on this and company view on this. Do you think you could consider an option whereby you would be &#x2013; you would assume any further obligations, let's say, with respect to some social &#x2013; maybe some social obligations or with respect to upgrading the transport infrastructure if you are given the right to export gas? Or this is something you wouldn't want to deal with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We already have some social obligations. So this is not &#x2013; this is not something that we're not familiar with dealing with. We have social obligations in the Yamal Peninsula that we've undertaken as a result of our development activities in the Yamal Peninsula. We have social obligations we've taken in areas where we operate, because they're remote areas. So we have a history of providing our fair share towards the social elements for the areas in which we operate and we'll continue to do that. So I'm not evocating, I believe that there'll be significant increases in those particular expenses.</p>
          <p>And in the second part of your question, again, this is a question of law because the trunk pipeline system is owned and operated by Gazprom. We make investments into field infrastructure pipeline, and if we need to look at options beyond that, we would probably consider those in light of potential expansion of our sales. But that again is something that's premature and I don't want to speculate at this particular point.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mark, first of all, thank you for the presentation and congratulations on excellent 1Q results. Just one very quick question from me. Are you looking to increase your 2012 full year production guidance from prior 6%, 7%, in light of the, obviously, extremely strong production trend that we've seen from you over the first four months of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's &#x2013; again, it's one of those questions that are a little &#x2013; these are a little more short term, okay. Let us get through the first &#x2013; we got through the first quarter, very strong results as one would expect. The second quarter in our trough period, yes, the first month and a half has been very good.</p>
          <p>Let us get through a little bit more in the second quarter, and then I'll address that point in our second quarter earnings conference call as I usually do in the past. It's just &#x2013; it's just one of those, I just need to see where we are relative to the trough path to determine what we believe will be our full-year production, because when we plan out, we plan that dip and there could be various different movements along that dip. It could be less, it could be equal to what we're doing in the first quarter. And obviously, that implies that there's potential for a stronger production profile than those proposed by us at our planning stage, when we give out this guidance.</p>
          <p>So I will address that question specifically on the second quarter conference call, because it will give me more visibility in discussions with the second half of the year since we've gone through the first trough period, okay, for confirmation on that point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mark. My question is related to the last news about access to European markets which you plan to get. And the question is actually additional supply of gas could bring this balance to European markets and this could bring more harm than benefit for Russian gas industry. So how do you justify the benefits of giving access to exports for independent producers to Europe which could bring this balance to the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. I think that you have a very, very valid point there and that's why I wanted to say, it's premature to discuss because all these factors have to be considered in determining what is additive to Russia rather than cannibalizing Gazprom sales. And I think that's a very, very important issue that has to be dealt with in any discussions about export rights for independents.</p>
          <p>The last thing we want to see is complete chaos in negotiating with various customers in Western Europe. And I don't think that's the intent. So that is a very important point and that will obviously come out when these discussions crystallize a little bit more, but I'm glad you raised that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I hope then, there will be some points that we'll discuss on the benefits that each can give for this to both parties, because now it looks more like cannibalizing sales rather than creating new markets in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I want to go back to the competitive situation in Russia, especially within three to five year horizon, not immediate. I mean, we hear you plan to increase production. We hear LUKOIL, Rosneft, <mark type="ph" /> Raspadskaya (56:42) and Gazprom who is the gas producer in Russia, oil companies, what do you think makes Russia fundamentally different from the U.S., another big gas producer who now has glut with regards to producing too much gas at this moment? Especially in light of the fact that export infrastructure in Russia is extremely, extremely focused on Euro countries, very little could be done in terms of physical diversification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think you have to consider that there's &#x2013; the U.S. it's not a very comparable discussion to talk about the U.S. market and Russia. They're completely different in terms of the industry structure. I mean, the United States, they have many, many companies delivering natural gas on an open market and various intermediaries like third-party pipeline access, master limited partnerships, et cetera, gas traders. So, that's a completely different industry structure.</p>
          <p>However with that said, obviously, what you refer to is the growth in gas in the United States as a result of the shale developments. Now, keep in mind this year was probably more of an anomaly in United States than what was expected due to the warm weather. And the only reason why we have this so called glut, which is obviously driving the price down, is the fact that we have too much gas in underground storage in America which needs to be worked off. Outside of that, the gas markets were relatively balanced, although prices were driving down.</p>
          <p>In Russia, it's completely different. I mean, if the market controlled by one dominant player, there's a series of independents led by Novatek, there's the oil majors that are obviously trying to monetize their gas and everybody has a defined program in place.</p>
          <p>However, what I've been saying to our investors at meetings, et cetera, and I will continue saying this is that Novatek, first and foremost, is a natural gas producer and we focus primarily on the development of natural gas. It's not secondary to our business.</p>
          <p>The second point I want to make is that if you were to assume that everybody completes every project in which they say they would do, we would have a glut in all commodities and that just does not happen from a practical perspective.</p>
          <p>So what we have done, we have assessed in our strategy presentation that we delivered in December in London, we have assessed like we have done in the past, even during the IPO and post the IPO, when we were involved with the Russian government in terms of building and providing input into the gas balance, we look at all these factors. We look at the transport structures. We look at the other producers, and based on those factors, we believe that Novatek is best positioned right now to continue adding on gas to the Russian domestic market.</p>
          <p>And eventually, we'll start seeing other producers start adding production on. But right now, I believe we have up until about 2015, 2016, et cetera, we have a competitive advantage due to the development of our gas fields, the structure of where we're located on the pipeline, to continue growing our market share and that's what we plan to do and that's what was outlined in our strategy presentation to 2020.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry. Mark, profit per thousand cubic meters of gas, 2,000 &#x2013; I mean, cash profit per thousand cubic meters of gas, 2012 first quarter versus 2011 first quarter. And profit per barrel of oil or gas condensate, if you want for lack of better word.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we don't separate that out. We do everything on a barrel of oil equivalent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course, I don't have that data in front of me right now but the way &#x2013; the simple way to do that is just take the cash cost out. So you just have to remove the depreciation and I'm sure some of the analysts have done that in their analysis. But right now, I think we're trading about, as I've said, 40%, 45%, 46% EBITDA margins on our sales and you would just have to move out the, obviously, the depreciation non-cash charges. But I don't have that information, sorry, right in front of me to provide you the details <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:02:29)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The reason I was asking this is to understand, do you have any reason to believe that this number would deteriorate further in this base number in terms of per unit profitability to deteriorate whatsoever for the next three years? Or do you expect that to increase because you're getting a tariff increase and I presume the MET increase is less than the increase in tariff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the aim is to balance all those. That's the big question we're dealing with now and that was the whole point. The aim is to balance these particular items so that the overall impact to us is not a negative or a contraction in the margins. So, if you look at what we did, if you look at what we did for &#x2013; we have an example in on our strategy presentation, whereby we believe, with the tariff program in place today and the shift away from wholesale traders to end consumers, we felt that we should get approximately 10% to 12% margin enhancements given the current structure in place. That's for natural gas.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously with the MET discussions, the transport tariff discussions, et cetera, pricing discussion, then you will have an interrelated connection to this question you're asking. All I was trying to bring out in the presentation is that if you look at the tax side of the question, if you look at the pricing, I mean, we're still &#x2013; if you stripped everything out, prices are still rising higher than the level of taxation and we should still be able to see some netback improvements, although it may be on a slower pace. But transportation &#x2013; the point I was making on the transportation side is that that is a much more significant cost component to us in terms of our natural gas business.</p>
          <p>On the liquids side, the uncontrollable portion for us is the &#x2013; obviously, the benchmark pricing, and as the benchmark pricing stays in a reasonable range of $90 to $100, which I believe will probably be the range for the upcoming year, we should do fine on our netback margins on liquids sales, but it depends on also regions.</p>
          <p>The way I answered it also in the first quarter, more or less on this particular point, is if you look at the benchmark prices over the year, for say, the liquids side, and again, if we don't split it up between gas, liquids, et cetera, we kind of blend it all in, but just what I tried to explain on the first quarter, if you look at the difference in 2010, we had about a $0.50 per barrel difference over the course of the year between Brent and WTI. But in 2011, that was almost $20 difference, right?</p>
          <p>And so when we sell our condensate to customers, to the United States, we want to make sure that we're not selling it at a lower price. So we kind of used it 50-50, 50% Brent price, 50% WTI price. So it all plays into the dynamics of the market with the aim of enhancing rather than contracting the margins.</p>
          <p>So these are discussions that go on with our commercial trading group on a daily basis, so we're dealing with this on an ongoing basis and all we're doing from the reporting side is trying to disclose in. But the aim is that we're hoping that in the next couple of years, we don't see margin contractions, based on the plan that we've put in place. And we believe that the taxes will not materialize as discussed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Last question on this, Mark, is your profitability on &#x2013; I know it's a very difficult question to answer, do you think your gas condensate is a more profitable product than the gas itself. The reason I'm asking this is as you had mentioned that the growth in the volume of liquids will double, more or less, in the next three years, versus the growth of about 40% on gas output, do you think that should have a favorable impact on your margins?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, Mark. Thanks for the presentation. And I have two follow-up questions, if I may. First, when do you expect all the discussions or negotiations on MET, transportation tariff and so on to be finalized? If you have any timeline in mind, you mentioned that it can be probably resolved in one month horizon, if I heard correctly.</p>
          <p>And the second question. I just need your estimates on export netback price in Russia in 2015, did you say that it should be something like for $150 or higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is where we come out unfortunately with all the confusion. What I said before on MET is that discussions are going on, they will be finalized sometime this year. It's not going to be finalized in the next month, but there are discussions, we believe over the course of the summer, when we go up to the next level of the new government being formed, et cetera, we'll revert back again.</p>
          <p>So, it's not going to be done in a month, and we need to make sure that it's done correctly, not expediently and doing something wrong. So we're going to obviously lobby strongly on the MET question and it's not just a timing issue. I think that this will be resolved over the course of the remainder of this year. If we have any news to report, we'll obviously report it in the upcoming conference calls.</p>
          <p>On the second point, what I'm saying is that if you look at the trends &#x2013; again, we had a slide in our strategy presentation that looked at, if we followed a netback export parity model, then our assumptions would be that one, we would have higher tax rates and two, we'd have higher transportation costs. And we said that we do not believe that that would be the model adopted.</p>
          <p>And what we're saying and what I'm saying now, if you take this 15% increases that are being proposed, and you extend them out to 2015-2018, that range or whatever they &#x2013; if they decided to go further than that, the point is, is that we're presently about $90, given an exchange rate on an mcm basis delivered. And we're saying that we believe that an acceptable price in the Russian domestic market, that continues to facilitate demand growth, is reasonable and absorbable in the Russian market is around $125 to $150. That is our own forecast, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:10:24) we believe is the acceptable range in the Russian market. And that's what we think will be the price by the time this liberalized market occurs, whether 2015, 2018, somewhere in that range of pricing models.</p>

          <p>Okay. I'd just like to end the call and thank everybody. And I look forward to seeing and discussing these issues, which obviously are important, in more detail in the upcoming months. I mean, I believe there's a series of investor meetings, conferences that we'll be attending and we'll be glad to discuss this. And once we have some more information, rest assured everybody we will actually go out and state our position in the market.</p>
          <p>But again, I'd like to thank everybody for attending this conference call and look forward to seeing you soon in the upcoming months. So, thank you very much.</p>
