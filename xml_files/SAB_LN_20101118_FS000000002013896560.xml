          <p>Welcome to the SAB First Half 2010 Results Conference Call. I'll now turn the call over to SABMiller, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. I am Gary Leibowitz, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations at SABMiller. Welcome to our first half results presentation for the six months ended September the 30th, 2010.</p>
          <p>With me today here as usual is Malcolm Wyman, our CFO. As usual, our presentation today will contain forward-looking statements which reflect the current best judgment of our management, including risks and uncertainties. The company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's get started without further ado. As far as our overview, amid mix trading and economic conditions, the Group has delivered a strong financial performance during the first half of the financial year as you will see in today from our results announcement. We delivered improved volume trends in some markets. Group organic lager volumes were up 1% driven by consumer spending and our own brand and marketplace initiatives. This growth is despite continuing constraints on beer consumers in many areas, compounded by the impact of excise increases, particularly in Europe and in Latin America, in Colombia in particular.</p>
          <p>Our revenues benefited from selective price increases in the prior year. We also benefited from favorable input cost trends in the first half following forward purchases at the low end of the commodity cycle last year. However there have been some signs of very moderate upward pressure again recently.</p>
          <p>Within our businesses we've continued to generate fixed cost savings. This enabled considerably higher marketplace investment in Africa and South Africa, protection from margin pressure in Europe, and strong margin growth in Latin America and the U.S.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that the net effect of this was a positive movement in Group EBIT margin, which was up 90 basis points. As a result, our organic constant currency EBIT was up 10%, adjusted EPS grew 16% and free cash flow was up 23% to $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>While depressed consumer spending and unemployment continue to affect the U.S. and Europe driving volume declines there, we have seen improving performances across some developing markets. You can see it in this chart, the improved moving annual volume trends for Africa, South Africa, Asia and Latin America. The LatAm improvement would be more pronounced if it were not for the significant VAT increase we've had to pass on to consumers in Colombia.</p>
          <p>These trends follow in part from our investment for growth and capacity and extensions to our business footprint in Africa and China for example and stepped up marketing expenditure across the Group outside the U.S. Local brand portfolios retained strong leadership positions in those markets and have weathered downturns or slowdowns. We are well positioned to gain further momentum as the economic cycle improves in the future.</p>
          <p>And turning briefly now to review of our divisional performances:</p>
          <p>Staring with Latin America: In LatAm, economic improvement in our own commercial initiatives have helped performance, but lager volumes were marginally down overall reflecting the impact of the increased beer taxes in Colombia. Poor weather and dry days linked to elections were also factors in Colombia, and the economic recovery there has thus far mainly favored durable goods.</p>
          <p>However Peru posted robust volume growth, and growth in Ecuador continued although being affected by recent political unrest and government restrictions on the sale of alcohol. We continued to expand our brand and pack portfolios to capture new consumption occasions as you've heard us describe in the recent seminar this year. Examples are the launch of the second light beer in Colombia, Poker Ligera to complement &#xC1;guila Light and the re-launch of Cusque&#xF1;a in Peru in an antique green bottle both at a price premium to mainstream. And these are margin enhancing.</p>
          <p>We are also developing our international premium segment with launches of MGD in Colombia and Peru, and Miller Lite in Panama. In Honduras in El Salvador, via portfolio enhancements and trade management, we've gained share of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks in a difficult operating environment with lower volumes.</p>
          <p>Despite the marginal decline in volume, EBIT for the region grew by 10% in organic constant currency. This was underpinned by selective price increases, lower variable cost, and fixed cost reductions and despite a significant increase in marketing spend. Mix improvement was also a driver as I've just mentioned, as we progress with the development of an upper mainstream segment, offering an affordable consumer trade-up opportunity with higher margins.</p>
          <p>In Colombia we've managed to grow EBITDA and further expand our margins in spite of the volume decline which is an admirable performance. On the cost side there, we've optimized our service model and route-to-market and improved fixed cost productivity. This has been achieved by among other things the closure of the Bogota brewery at the end of June, maintenance cost reductions, savings and operating lease rentals and in head count. All of the above have further enhanced our LatAm margin by 210 basis points to 22.7% for the half year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to North America, as regards to MillerCoors in the U.S., industry trading conditions have remained difficult, affected principally by high unemployment particularly among those demographic groups towards which beer consumption is skewed, all of which as we've recently discussed on our quarterly MillerCoors' call.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the subdued economy there, pricing in the U.S. beer industry has remained firm and continued so. The late-stage integration processes within the JV are progressing with synergy realization on target and dropping fully to the bottom line. MillerCoors has improved its segment share in premium lights led by Coors Light and more recently complemented by a much improved performance by Miller Lite following a range of upgrades to its brand marketing and packaging mix.</p>
          <p>The overall category has been in low to mid-single digit decline recently feeling the pressure from high unemployment in particular.</p>
          <p>In the craft segment MillerCoors has had a great success of Blue Moon and to some extent with Leinenkugel's, extending distribution, developing the craft-in-a-can concept for Blue Moon and adding new seasonal extensions. Earlier this year to capitalize on the growth opportunities in crafts and import, MillerCoors announced the formation of Tenth and Blake Beer Company, a unit of MillerCoors, which will drive growth in the imports and crafts segment.</p>
          <p>And at MillerCoors, the management have been able to realize significant synergies and cost savings during this period. Since the JV's formation MillerCoors has now delivered over $560 million of savings ahead of schedule for a total savings of 750 million by the end of 2012. Brands are now being brewed closer to customers with considerable network savings and MillerCoors is seeing other non-organizational cost savings in procurement, operating efficiency and commercial tactical spend and they expect the remaining benefits to come from these areas.</p>
          <p>Turning to Europe, lager volumes declined 5% as the beer industry continued to experience weak economic conditions across the region. Detractors from profitability particularly in Poland and Czech included reduced volumes and therefore operating de-leverage, consumer down trading and channel shifts to and within the off-trade, some cyclical and some frankly driven by competitive pricing behavior. Lingering excise impacts have also played a part.</p>
          <p>Conversely, we are seeing hopeful signs at an early stage of an improved picture in Russia notwithstanding volume pressures from the steep excise rise, and some abatement of pressure in markets with easier comps such as in Romania.</p>
          <p>Our focus on portfolio profitability and cost management is driving improved performance in our more mature markets such as Italy, Slovakia, and the Netherlands, while the UK has also seen a strong rise in profitability on its growing premium brand sales.</p>
          <p>Overall in the region, margin pressures were largely offset by reduced commodity costs in the half. We continue to seek further cost reduction opportunities including for example our intention to close our brewery in Romania, which we've just announced today.</p>
          <p>On South Africa, the South African economy, helped by a successful FIFA World Cup, has bounced back following a significant downturn last year. Consumer confidence has lagged the GDP turnaround but is nevertheless improving as evidenced by a good recovery in beer and soft drink sales particularly in our financial year second quarter &#x2013; so the calendar third quarter.</p>
          <p>In beer, the benefits of moderate price increases, input cost deflation and productivity savings have been redeployed into marketing and sales spend with more and higher quality investment going into the trade. This has paid off already with evidence that the beer category is regaining share of alcohol and that in key aspects of in trade execution, our lead versus the competition is widening. As a result, our beer market share has stabilized earlier this year with a trailing three month market share figure higher than either the trailing six month or twelve month figures.</p>
          <p>Castle Lite was repositioned a year ago in the local premium segment on an integrated through the line theme of cold refreshment. The consumer response has been strong with steadily improving volumes and segment share very strong growth as you can see in the graph at the bottom of the slide. In addition, our mainstream portfolio of Castle Lager, Hansa and Carling Black Label has also gained momentum as a result of focused marketing campaigns.</p>
          <p>And in soft drinks, volume performance improved to 3% growth for the half with better sales mix and efficiency further boosting profitability. All aspects of market execution are improving and driving profit growth there.</p>
          <p>In the rest of Africa, our African footprint comprising a broad portfolio of markets has continued to deliver growth. Performances were particularly strong in Uganda and Mozambique, driven both by more affordable and more premium brands, and in Zambia where we are seeing the benefits of lower beer excise. Tanzania delivered a notable performance with stepped up sales execution particularly in our growing premium portfolio and despite the loss of licensed brands there.</p>
          <p>Conversely, we faced continuing economic and supply chain constraints in Angola and regulatory headwinds in Botswana. While we expect in Angola to return to growth in both soft drinks and continuing the ramp up in our beer volumes, the outlook in Botswana is still clouded by the prospect of a rising social levy. But across our African businesses, we are focusing consistently on beer brand portfolio enhancement with extended price ladders to grow volume at the lower end and value at the higher end. We are introducing more affordable product lines at lower price points, improving affordability while driving the local premium brands.</p>
          <p>And finally in Asia, volume growth for the half has accelerated with rising operating margins as you will see in this morning. The Chinese beer market benefited from a good summer peak. CR Snow continued to outpace the market with the Snow brand, led by performance in the central and northeast regions. We estimate that the Snow brand itself now constitutes close to 20% of the Chinese beer market on a single brand basis alone, certainly a gain in market share.</p>
          <p>Marketing emphasis on Snow's newer premium variants has been rewarded. Recent efforts have been focused on outdoor promotions for Snow Draft and also the Brave the World variant, which is shown here on the slide on the right, involving endurance events, tracking the route of the long march, a campaign well aligned to the Chinese national sentiment which underpins the brand's positioning. Pricing however has remained stagnant while, marketing spend and trade promotions are up. Despite that, our margins were up and against this backdrop, we continue to lead the long-term industry consolidation in China.</p>
          <p>In India, we are driving increasingly profitable growth in most states, led by successful activation of Haywards 5000 brand in the strong beer segment. However, regulatory constraints do persist in certain key markets such as Andhra Pradesh, impacting our overall volumes and share in the country. And that results in the half of some improvement on the prior year but further regulatory hurdles remain.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in Asia, our toehold in Vietnam is starting to show encouraging signs with growth in our mainstream brand Zorok, and in June a new Greenfield brewery was commissioned in Australia by Pacific Beverages to support the future growth of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now hand over to Malcolm Wyman here to review our financial performance. Malcolm?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. As in the past, my presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis, as this reflects our underlying performance and profitability before foreign exchange translation impacts.</p>
          <p>The group has delivered good adjusted earnings per share growth in terms of all our major currencies in the first six months. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 16%, while strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 23% was achieved in pounds sterling. The interim dividend is U.S.$0.195 per share, which represents an increase of 15% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Despite challenging trading conditions in a number of our key markets, we delivered a strong performance in the first half of the year, with lager volumes up 1.5% on an organic basis.</p>
          <p>Tough trading conditions in Europe and North America, and marginally lower volumes in Latin America were more than offset by good growth in China, Africa and South Africa, particularly during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency revenue grew 4.5%, driven by prior year price increases and organic volume growth. EBITA grew significantly up 10.2% on an organic constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>The group's EBITA margin increased 90 basis points to good revenue growth, lower raw material input costs, and real fixed cost savings. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rates and lower profit attributable to minorities arising from our acquisition of the 28.1% interest in our Polish subsidiary, contributing to the 16% growth in earnings per share in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Group revenue grew 4.5% on an organic constant currency basis and all regions achieved revenue per hectoliter growth over this period. In Latin America, revenue per hectoliter grew 2%, predominantly due to price increases in the second half of the prior year, notably in Columbia, following the 11% sales tax increase on beer. Revenue also benefited from positive lager mix, driven by the growth in the upper mainstream Aguila like brand in Columbia and Miller Genuine Draft in Panama.</p>
          <p>Europe achieved revenue per hectoliter growth 4% despite a decline in lager volumes and continued down trading. This top-line revenue growth was largely driven by the significant excise related price increases, taken in the fourth quarter of last year in Russia and also the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors grew revenue per hectoliter by 3% in North America following firm net price increases taken over the third quarter of last year. In Africa, revenue per hectoliter in our subsidiary businesses increased by 9%, aided by prior year price increases and positive mix benefits from good growth in our premium segment, particularly in Tanzania and Mozambique.</p>
          <p>Revenue per hectoliter grew by 3% in Asia, assisted by both the expansion of the Snow brand premium offerings and geographic mix benefit. And South Africa delivered revenue per hectoliter growth of 5%, following price increases taken in both beer and soft drinks in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We delivered strong organic constant currency growth of 10.2% in the first half of the year, not withstanding double-digit EBITDA growth over the same period last year. Volume and pricing benefits previously mentioned, together with a reduction in raw material input costs and the achievement of real fixed cost savings, all assisted in driving this growth.</p>
          <p>All regions other than Europe increased their EBITDA and contributed to the strong group EBITDA performance, which was aided by significant synergy and cost savings in North America, and good raw material and fixed cost savings in both Europe and Latin America. We continue to increase marketing spend behind our strong brand equities during the half year.</p>
          <p>In the event EBITDA grew 13% on a reported basis as our key operating currency strengthened against the U.S. dollar versus the first half of the prior year, in particular the South African rand, and the Colombian peso, which more than offset weaker currencies in both Africa and also in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Now turning to input costs. Raw material input costs for the half year were down mid-single digits versus the prior year on a constant currency U.S. dollar per hectoliter basis. Most regions benefited from lower brewing raw material costs, primarily due to lower underlying barley and hop prices. In addition, certain key markets benefited from favorable currency moves, as their local currency strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Cost of goods sold were down low single-digits, as higher diesel costs and increased sales activity drove distribution cost higher.</p>
          <p>Total exceptional charges of $285 million have been taken against profit before tax in the first six months of the year. Our business capability program related exceptional costs are $155 million in the first half of the year, as we continued to streamline finance, human resources, IT and procurement activities through the deployment of global systems.</p>
          <p>$126 million of exceptional charges relates to the Black Economic Empowerment program in South Africa for non-cash IFRS 2 share-based payment charges relating to the retailer and employee components of the scheme and associated costs.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs of $4 million primarily relate to the group share of MillerCoors' severance costs and contract termination charges incurred in the integration and restructuring program.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the developments overall in the business capability program. Progress with Trinity, our group buying operation, our European regional manufacturing company and with major sales and distribution systems implementations in Latin America and support systems in South Africa are especially significant. The design effort for many of the front office processes is nearing completion and the rollout of the complete systems platform in Europe and Latin America will start next year.</p>
          <p>However, exceptional charges will be impacted a higher design and implementation costs, a one year extension to the program timeline and some scope enhancements. In combination, over the five years of the program, we expect these factors to add about 160 million to the costs.</p>
          <p>In addition, the impact of currencies in particular the strong rand on South Africa base spend may add around $40 million dependent upon currency moves. Exceptional charges were 342 million last year; and in financial 2011, we expect the charge to be around 15% below this. We then expect charges to decline from this level by some 40% in each of financial 2012 and financial 2013 with a final charge in financial 2014 at a similar level to that of financial 2013. Financial benefits remain encouraging.</p>
          <p>Estimates of annual cost and efficiency benefits remain broadly inline with the original objective, being $100 million in financial 2012, $200 million in financial 2013 and $300 million in financial 2014.</p>
          <p>Although in the near-term, phasing of delivery in the current year means that financial 2011 benefits are expected to be near $30 million to $40 million rather than the original $50 million objective we had set for the current year. The same factors I mentioned earlier that are pushing up operating cost will lead to additional capital expenditure of around $100 million. However, working capital inflows continued to be strong.</p>
          <p>In the first half of this year, aggregate working capital inflows from the program have already exceeded our original objective in aggregates of $350 million, which we only expected to be achieved by financial 2012.</p>
          <p>Normalized EBITDA, which includes dividends from the MillerCoors joint venture, was up 12% on prior year, as a result of increased operating profit and lower cash expenditure on exceptional items, together with an increase in dividends from MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>With the continued focus on improving working capital, we generated a cash inflow of $90 million in the first six months of the year, following the $300 million improvement in working capital cash flow achieved in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of $614 million was $125 million lower than the first six months of the prior year, cycling capacity related capital expenditure in Europe and Africa last year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow improved by $234 million in the first half of the year benefiting from improved working capital, reduced investments and joint ventures, together with increased dividends from MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net finance costs increased in the first half, largely due to adverse foreign exchange movements on non-U.S. dollar denominated debt.</p>
          <p>The group's effective tax rate of 29% is 40 basis points lower than that of the prior year, driven by continued tax efficiencies and changes in the geographic mix of profits.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position at 30, September has decreased from the financial 2010 year-end, as a result of our strong cash flow. That offset to some extent by the appreciation of some of our major currencies against the U.S. dollar, impacting the value of debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Our financial structure continues to strengthen, but gearing falling to 36.8% and interest cover up to 9.1 times.</p>
          <p>Our access to liquidity remained strong, with committed headroom available to the group in excess of US$3 billion as at the 30, of September.</p>
          <p>Our weighted average interest rates at 30, September 2010 has increased slightly to 6.1% from 5.7% as at 31 March, 2010. This has been driven by increases in interest rates in Africa and Latin America, as well as the repayments of low interest rates, short-term floating rate debt from our strong cash flows.</p>
          <p>The pie chart on the slide shows our net debt profile by currency after the impact of derivatives. As you can see, we continue to maintain an appropriate and balanced net debt profile, given the spread of our businesses. As we report in U.S. dollars, we also keep a proportion of debt in that currency.</p>
          <p>Our maturity profile remains conservative, but the majority of our debt maturing after three years. The increase in debt repayable within one year reflects the inclusion of a US$600 million bond which is maturing in July, 2011. We have sufficient headroom available to repay all debt falling due in the next two years, in terms of un-drawn corporate committed bank facilities, cash resources and in-country banking facilities.</p>
          <p>Coming to the financial outlook for the current financial year, although the GDP outlook for our emerging markets in 2010 continues to point to an improvement in economic conditions, consumer spending patterns across our key markets are expected to remain mixed.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that raw material input cost benefits will moderate over the second half with full-year input cost down low single digits. The recent increase in international barley prices will have a limited impact on brewing raw material costs in the current financial year, as our barley requirements are substantially fulfilled to existing supplier contracts.</p>
          <p>Cash generation will continue to be a focus, although given the significant improvements in the prior year the full year working capital inflow will be less than the amount in the prior year. Full year capital expenditure is anticipated to be approximately $1.3 billion as we continue to work towards our objective of reducing capital expenditure to $1.1 billion over the next three years.</p>
          <p>Finance costs for the second half are expected to be slightly lower than those of the first half. Taking into account the current composition of the Group, our effective tax rate is expected to be 29% for the current financial year.</p>
          <p>And now to conclude, I will hand back again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Malcolm. So to conclude for both of us, the medium term outlook for the Group remains strong both on the top and on the bottom line. Although consumer spending remains subdued, the trend of incremental improvement in economic conditions across most of our emerging markets is expected to be maintained. We will continue with our policy of selective price increases and will continue to benefit from lower raw material costs and our productivity and efficiency initiatives, albeit at a slower rate than in the first six months of the year.</p>
          <p>We are selectively increasing investment behind our brands to ensure that we are well placed for any improvement in trading conditions. We are confident that our commercial strategies are the right ones, our brand equities remain strong and our global footprint is an advantage and we are therefore well positioned for future growth.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, Malcolm and I will now be happy to take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, although maybe afternoon for you, I guess. I was wondering if we could dig into China a little bit, because it sounds like further consolidation there and yet in talking to our analysts over there, they're not so sure there is anything that's available for sale. So, I'm just wondering how you see that market developing over the next several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously we are the biggest player in the market at the moment and we have been buying some businesses on and off over the last year or two. There are some major players that are out in that market, but whether they are actually available for sale at the moment obviously is anyone's guess. But we have been buying smaller businesses. We are interested and we have a view as to what would be attractive to us. And we would look at the opportunities as and when they arise. But it is very much one of those, I suppose strategies where we buy the small and medium sized businesses as and when we can, and we watch to see what comes up as far as the larger businesses are concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, do you think you could explain &#x2013; you talked about the premiumization in Snow, how much of your business is in that premium, is it still a tiny percent and what do you think is driving the growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Snow is a very big brand in China and we have a market share in CR Snow of about &#x2013; coming on 22% and of that, our Snow brand and variants would be approximately 20%. So, large, very large part of our portfolio is made up of the Snow brand variants and that has been a specific strategy in order for us to drive a sort of upper mainstream local premium aspect to the business. And what it tends to do is that the brand, the Snow brand itself has become a national-type brand and it allows us to drive distribution and gives us more power in distribution than we would have if we just had a collection of local brands. So it's very much part of our strategy to drive the Snow brand as much as we can as part of our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you probably know Caroline, the price ladder for beer in China extends very long and very high up and down the scale, and so defining the proportion of the market, that is what you would call premium is tricky, there are many different premium segments. But with the expansion of the Snow premium variants, it looks like we are nearly &#x2013; our portfolio skew is nearly at the level of the industry in terms of premiumization which is quite an achievement given that Snow has come from very much a mainstream base consolidating the industry.</p>

          <p>That's great. May I just also ask about the cost outlook, you did say that they could &#x2013; you've had very favorable costs in general, not just China but in general, where do you think there is potential cost pressure in 2011?</p>

          <p>Well, at the moment, as we've said we've had some very favorable cost input factors and we will be down low single digits in COGS as we exit the half year and then for the full year. Pressures in 2011 or calendar 2011 will obviously come from barley and malt. Barley prices have spiked recently as a result of the Russian harvest and the ban on exports from Russia, and that's put pressure on prices around the world. So I think that's the main area that we expect to see some pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>The other one is oil, diesel and I think there, prices are higher than they have been and they look as though they have been moving up above the $80 a barrel. So I think there is some pressure in distribution costs. But, on the other hand we have some contracts going into next year and we have some arrangements around packaging raw materials, which gives us comfort that looking forward over the next financial year, once we think that cost of goods sold will be up, it's unlikely that they will be up more than low single digits.</p>
