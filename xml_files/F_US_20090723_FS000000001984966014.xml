          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ford Motor Company Fixed Income Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. David Dickinson, Fixed Income Investor Relations Manager. Please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. With me this morning are Peter Daniel, Ford Senior Vice President and Controller; K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including David Brandeis, Assistant Treasurer; Mike Sinesky, Assistant Treasurer; and Mark Kosman, Director of Global Accounting .</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I would like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's investor and media websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.  Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis, and in some cases, on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. Additional information about the factors that could affect future results is summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly, and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford's Senior Vice President and Controller, Peter Daniel. Peter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Turning to slide one, I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results. As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales in the second quarter were about 1.2 million units, down 390,000 units from the same period in 2008. Ford's second quarter revenue was 27.2 billion, an 11 billion decrease from a year ago. The decrease is primarily explained by lower volumes and unfavorable exchange, partly offset by favorable net pricing. Our second quarter pre-tax operating loss, excluding special items, was 424 million, a 609 million improvement from a year ago. And automotive decline of 320 million was more than offset by 929 million improvement in financial services.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter net income attributable to Ford was about 2.3 billion, including a pre-tax special items net gain of 2.8 billion, more than explained by the debt reduction gain that I will discuss on the next slide. We ended the second quarter with 21 billion of gross cash. This will be discussed in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Slide two covers special items, a pre-tax net gain of 2.8 billion in the second quarter. In North America, we recorded a charge of 98 million, primarily related to personnel reduction actions in the U.S. We also recorded a charge of 110 million related to the UAW retiree healthcare VEBA agreement. Operations outside of North America recorded a charge of 160 million for personnel reduction actions, largely incurred in Europe.</p>
          <p>We completed our debt reduction actions in early April and recognized a 3.4 billion gain, primarily associated with the conversion of 4.3 billion of our convertible note obligations and a repurchase of 3.4 billion of our unsecured debt. We recorded a 141 million of held for sale accounting related adjustments for Volvo, reflecting the elimination of depreciation and related costs. The liquidation of a foreign subsidiary triggered the recognition of previously deferred foreign currency translation adjustments, resulting in a non-cash charge of 281 million. Finally, we recorded an impairment charge of 92 million, primarily related to the sale of our transmission plant in Bordeaux.</p>
          <p>Slide three shows Automotive cash and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with 21 billion of gross cash, down 300 million from the first quarter of 2009. Our Automotive operating-related cash flow was one billion negative in the second quarter, reflecting an Automotive pre-tax loss of one billion. Capital spending during the quarter was about 100 billion lower than the depreciation and amortization. We expect second half capital spending to be higher, due in part to the normal seasonality of our spending.</p>
          <p>Changes in working capital and other timely differences were 500 million positive. This is explained by one billion of positive working capital due to higher payables and lower inventories, offset by timing differences primarily related to healthcare payments, and payment of 600 million to Ford Credit reflecting our change to upfront payments in subvention. Excluding the impact in the change to upfront subvention payments, our Automotive operating-related cash flow was 400 million negative.</p>
          <p>The operating-related cash outflow of one billion in the second quarter represents a 2.7 billion improvement over the first quarter. This primarily reflects improved cash from earnings, timing differences and lower capital spending. Other changes in gross cash included payments of 200 million for personnel reduction actions, pension contributions of 300 million, and issuance of equity in May of 1.6 billion, partly offset by cash utilized for debt reduction actions. Including all of these impacts, the total decrease in gross cash during the second quarter was 300 million.</p>
          <p>Now onto slide four, which shows the status of our planning assumptions and operational metrics for the first half of 2009. Total industry volume was equal to a sale of 9.8 million units in the U.S. and 15.4 million units in the 19 markets we track in Europe. We expect that the full-year U.S. industry will be in the range of 10.5 to 11 million units. This is consistent with the outlook that we communicated previously and the present economic outlook for the second half of the year. Based on first half European industry volume, we now expect that the full-year European industry will be in the range of 15 to 15.5 million units, higher than our previous outlook of 13.5 to 14.5 million units.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics, the Global Quality Research System study indicates that U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles have made significant progress reducing things gone wrong and improving customer satisfaction. International operations generally show an improvement in the latest GQRS study, with the exception of Europe, where we're working to address some recent issues. Automotive structural costs were reduced by 3.6 billion, which is on track to exceed our full-year plan. Second-half automotive structural cost reductions will be less than the first half as a result of significant cost reductions achieved during the third and fourth quarters of 2008.</p>
          <p>U.S. total market share was 15.2%. Our share of the U.S. retail market was 12.8%, and Europe market share was 9.2% in the first half. Based on our market share gains during the first half, we now expect full year U.S. and Europe market share to improve compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Automotive operating related cash flow was 4.7 billion negative during the first half, on track with our plan. Consistent with our present planning assumptions, we expect automotive operating related cash flows in the second half to improve from first half levels. However, due to the substantial improvement in the second quarter, third quarter levels may not improve sequentially.  Capital expenditures were 2.4 billion, consistent with our plan.</p>
          <p>Overall, we remain on track to achieve or exceed all of our 2009 financial targets and most of our operational metrics. In addition, based on current planning assumptions, we also remain on track to achieve our key 2011 financial guidance. These include overall and North American automotive pre-tax results being breakeven or better, excluding special items, and automotive operating related cash flow being breakeven or better. On that, I'll turn it over to K.R.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Peter. Slide five shows Ford Credit's operating results in key metrics for the second quarter. Excluded from this and the next slide is the second quarter 2008 $2.1 billion impairment charge. As shown in the left box, our second quarter pre-tax profit was $646 million compared with $294 million pre-tax loss in the second quarter of 2008. You can see in the right box, our June 30, 2009, on balance sheet receivables were $99 billion, about $37 billion lower than a year ago. This decline primarily reflected lower receivables in North America and Europe, reflecting lower industry volumes, lower dealer stocks, and the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover, and Mazda financing to other finance providers, and changes in currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Our June 30, 2009, on balance sheet receivables were about $5 billion lower than the first quarter of 2009. Our financing share of U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail installment and lease contracts was 28% in the second quarter of 2009, 11 points lower than the same period a year ago, which primarily reflects our reduction in leasing. Charge-offs for on balance sheet receivables in the second quarter were $285 million and the worldwide loss to receivable ratio was 109 basis points, up 39 basis points from last year, and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>At June 30, the allowance for credit losses for on balance sheet receivables was $1.8 billion or 181 basis points of receivables. The allowance was about $100 million higher than the first quarter 2009, and up about $300 million from a year ago. Further, we did not pay any distributions in the second quarter. However, in the second quarter, we did complete a cash tender offer that was commenced in the first quarter pursuant to which we purchased $3.4 billion principal amount of Ford's unsecured, nonconvertible debt securities for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion, including transaction costs. This transaction settled on April 8, following which we transferred the purchased debt securities to Ford in satisfaction of $1.1 billion of our tax liabilities to Ford. At June 30, our managed leverage was 8.4 to one compared to 10 to one at June 30, 2008. At the end of the second quarter, our equity was about $10.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six, slide six explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax profit for the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2008, excluding the impact of last year's impairment charge. For the second quarter, Ford Credit reported a pre-tax profit of $646 million, a $940 million improvement from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Volume was about $300 million lower compared with a year ago, reflecting the decline in the receivables. Financing margin was essentially flat compared to a year ago. The decrease in the provision for credit losses of about $100 million is more than explained by lower reserve increases.</p>
          <p>Residual losses declined about $800 million in the second quarter compared with last year. This improvement primarily reflects the impact of improving auction value on the portfolio of leases and lower losses on the vehicles returned during the quarter. Last year during the second quarter, we experienced declines in auction values.</p>
          <p>The increase in other primarily reflects net gains of about $250 million related to unhedged currency exposure, primarily from cross-border intercompany lending, lower operating costs of about $60 million and other improvements offset partially by the non-recurrence of a gain of about $100 million related to sale of about half our ownership interest in the Nordic operations during the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our International segment, which is primarily Europe, incurred a small pre-tax loss in the second quarter, a $240 million decline from last year's profit. This decline primarily reflects the non-recurrence of a gain related to our Nordic operations, as I mentioned; lower volume across all regions; a higher provision for credit losses, primarily reflecting losses in Spain; and lower financing margins, primarily in Mexico.</p>
          <p>While our second quarter results were favorable, we expect second half 2009 results to be lower than in the first half. We do not expect the net gains on unhedged currency or improvements in lease residuals in the amounts that we experienced in the second quarter to continue. Furthermore, we expect year-end receivables of between 85 billion and $95 billion. This decline in receivables will lower our second half results.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows quarterly trends of charge-offs and loss to receivable ratios for our on balance sheet portfolio. At this point in time, we have very few, roughly about $100 million of off-balance sheet receivables. The top box shows loss to receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio and loss to receivable ratios for the U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and lease business. Worldwide loss to receivable ratio is up in the second quarter from year ago levels, reflecting higher credit losses in Europe, primarily due to losses in Spain, offset partially by lower losses in U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury. U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury loss to receivable ratios is down in the second quarter from a year ago, primarily reflecting lowest severity and lower other losses, offset partially by higher repossessions and higher commercial losses.</p>
          <p>Worldwide second quarter loss to receivable ratios improved from the first quarter, reflecting lower losses in the U.S., offset partially by higher credit losses in Europe. U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury second quarter loss to receivable ratios improved from the first quarter, reflecting lower severity, lower other losses and lower repossessions. Charge offs in the second quarter were $285 million, which was up $39 million from a year ago, but improved $47 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and lease business. Repossessions in the second quarter were 22,000 units, which was up 4,000 units from the second quarter of 2008, but down 3,000 units from the first quarter of 2009. Severity of $8,400 in the second quarter was $1,600 lower than last year, primarily due to improvements in auction values in the used vehicle market. Offset partially by a higher mix of 72-month contracts for vehicles repossessed in our portfolio and an increase in the amount financed. Severity was $900 lower than the first quarter of 2009, more than explained by improvements in auction values in the used car market.</p>
          <p>Over 60-day delinquencies totaled 23 basis points in the second quarter, which was down six basis points from the first quarter 2009. While still low and within our expectations, delinquencies are up three basis points from last year. Bankruptcy filings totaled 12,000 in the second quarter, up 1,000 compared with the first quarter and up 3,000 compared to the second quarter of 2008. The credit quality of our contract placements remains very good. We continue to closely monitor our key loss metrics for any deterioration related to broader trends in the economy.</p>
          <p>Slide nine shows the lease residual performance for our Ford and Lincoln Mercury U.S. brands.  Lease return volumes totaled 46,000 units in the second quarter, which was up 3,000 from the second quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting higher termination volumes, offset partially by a lower return rate. Lease return rates were down six percentage points in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, primarily reflecting the improvement in auction values.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, auction values for 24 and 36 month lease vehicles at constant mix were up on average about $2,100 per unit and $1,100 per unit respectively from the year ago level. Again, primarily reflecting the overall auction value improvement. Compared with the prior quarter, auction values were up about $1,500 and $1,000 for 24 and 36 month lease vehicles, respectively.</p>
          <p>Lease placements continued to shift toward cars and crossovers, and away from full-sized trucks and SUVs. In the second quarter, cars and crossovers represented 98% of new placements, up from 62% in the second quarter of 2008, and 88% in the first quarter of 2009. Our lease portfolio is presently 57% cars and crossovers, up from 48% one year ago. Our worldwide net investment and operating leases was $18.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, K.R. I'd like to begin on Slide 10 by re-emphasizing that we continue to view Ford Credit as a strategic asset and we are committed to funding the business under the present ownership structure. Consistent with the overall market, we still face challenges of the credit markets.</p>
          <p>However, during the second quarter, we saw improvement in both market access and funding spreads, enabling us to execute our funding plans. We remain dependent on capital market access for public and private securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper, unsecured debt and hedging instruments. Our strategy on committed capacity is to achieve renewals consistent with the overall size of our balance sheet. In the near term, government sponsored programs in the U.S. and around the world will be an important component of our funding plans.</p>
          <p>So far in 2009, we have completed about seven billion of TALF eligible securitizations utilizing U.S. retail and lease auto assets, and we continue to utilize the commercial paper funding facility and the European Central Bank's facilities. We continue to have discussions with the FDIC on gaining approval of our application for an industrial loan corporation, which would provide access to FDIC insured deposit funding.</p>
          <p>We will continue to explore and execute alternative business and funding arrangements in those locations where we lack diverse funding capability, while also insuring that Ford has continued support in these markets. Ford Credit's funding strategy remains focused on maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding obligations, including holding a substantial cash balance.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the trends in our funding for our managed receivables. At the end of the second quarter, managed receivables were 100 billion, down 18 billion from year-end 2008 and six billion from the first quarter. We ended the quarter with about 19 billion in cash, including 5.9 billion to support on balance sheet securitizations. Securitized funding was 58% of managed receivables at the end of the second quarter. We are projecting further receivable declines in 2009, primarily reflecting lower industry volumes and transition of Jaguar, Land Rover and Mazda business to other finance providers. We are projecting 2009 year-end managed receivables in the range of 85 to 95 billion, with securitized funding representing 58 to 62% of managed receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows our term funding plan for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs or asset sales to our on balance sheet asset backed commercial paper program.  Through July 22, we have completed about 14 billion of term funding. About nine billion of this funding was public, including seven billion of TALF eligible U.S. retail and lease auto securitizations; German retail and lease securitizations that we funded through the ECB's open market operations program; and a 500 million retail securitization transaction in Canada. In addition, we completed about five billion of funding through our private channels, including a $2 billion private lease transaction with Canadian assets.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., our funding plan assumes the continued use of the TALF program. Given program rules and rating requirements, our dealer floor plan assets are not presently eligible for issuance under TALF. While we continue to work on gaining TALF eligibility for floor plan assets, we have sufficient private funding capacity to support U.S. wholesale receivables in the near term. During the second quarter, we completed about two billion of wholesale renewals and private securitization transactions.</p>
          <p>For 2009, our public term funding plans are in a range of 15 to 20 billion, consisting of 14 to 17 billion of public transactions -- public securitizations, and up to three billion of unsecured debt. We continue to have private funding sources in addition to the public market. These are largely asset backed securitization programs for retail, wholesale and lease assets in various countries around the world. For 2009, we are forecasting five to ten billion of private funding.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows four credits committed capacity, which includes unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines, a multi-asset facility, and asset-backed conduit capacity. As of June 30, we had over 55 billion of committed capacity and cash. After excluding securitization cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was 42.4 billion, of which 22.7 billion was utilized, leaving about 20 billion available for use give our present level of eligible receivables. Available liquidity as a percent of managed receivables is about 20%, up about four points from our first quarter levels. Our cash that is related to securitization, cash that is not related to securitization, totaled about 13 billion at quarter-end.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, two billion of the FCAR asset-backed commercial paper program was placed with the Federal Reserve's CPFF program compared to the seven billion at March 31. During the second quarter, we renewed about 10.7 billion or about 56% of our committed capacity that came due. Much of the reduction in capacity in the second quarter was related to a reduction in the 364- day FCAR bank lines. During the quarter, our FCAR overall capacity reduced from 15.7 billion to 10.4 billion.</p>
          <p>There were many factors behind our decision to reduce the FCAR capacity, including Ford Credit's smaller balance sheet, lower FCAR asset-backed commercial paper balances, success in the public market, and a desire to reallocate some capacity to other asset classes in the U.S. and rest of world. In addition to our available liquidity, we ended the quarter with seven billion of excess committed capacity.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work toward reallocating excess capacity to other asset classes in the U.S. and rest of world. Of the 36 billion of total committed capacity, about 30% is up for renewal in the second half. We plan to renew committed capacity, consistent with the size of the Ford Credit balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In summary, on Slide 14, Ford had a pre-tax profit of about 424 million, a pre-tax loss of about 424 million, excluding a special items gain of 2.8 billion and a net income of 2.3 billion, including the special items gain. Second quarter and automotive gross cash was 21 billion. Ford gained market share this year in all major regions while achieving further improvements in our transaction prices and margins. We strengthened our balance sheet by raising 1.6 billion in the public stock offering of 345 million Ford shares, and completed actions to reduce our automotive debt by 10.1 billion.</p>
          <p>At Ford Credit, the pre-tax profit was 646 million and a net income of 413 million. Ford Credit continues to provide funding to support its dealers and its customers. We are seeing signs that the credit markets are beginning to improve. Ford Credit has completed 14 billion of term funding year-to-date, including about seven billion of retail and leased TALF eligible funding. Ford Credit's liquidity available for use is about 20 billion, of which 13 billion of it is in cash.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. Don't mean to be cheesey, but that was a very good quarter. I know everybody hates when analysts say that, but it is definitely warranted. Just to start out, looking at the auto side, could you give me some back half guidance on your pension contributions and your cash restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the pension contributions, you won't see much different from what you've already seen in the first half. There's no plan pensions in the U.S. So there's some relatively minor pensions around the rest of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's consistent with the disclosure we put in the 10-K from the standpoint of the full year pension contributions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then cash restructuring, is that going to come down because you're through your attrition program? Or is there something I'm missing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Looking at Ford Credit, you guys have outsourced some of the financing.  Hypothetically, if Volvo is sold, how much of that AR could be lowered going forward? How much of the receivables could be reduced by that sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you a little bit of perspective, we're sitting on 99 billion on our balance sheet. Roughly right now, we have about 5% of that is Jag, Land Rover; 5% is Mazda; and 5% is Volvo. That's kind of a high level perspective of what we have on our balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great. And then, the two just other things is, what is the size of the gain, the intercompany loan to Canada? What was the size of that? And why would you not have backed that out of special items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On currency exposures, because it's more than just Canada. It's also other countries, like Australia, for example. And essentially, it was $250 million during the quarter.  Historically, the Credit Company really doesn't have a lot of items that we call out as special items.  It is part of our underlying business. Typically, we would hedge those, but the markets got a little dicey. We were unable to hedge some of these intercompany loans. And then effectively with the U.S. weakening dollar, we picked up a gain during the second quarter. We are back into the process of late in the quarter and continuing into July, we've resumed some use of derivatives to implement alternative hedging structures. And, for example, as Neil mentioned, we've raised some funds up in Canada with a lease and a public retail transaction, which helped reduce some of that exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that question, we don't treat hedging gains and losses as a special on the Auto side either. And in fact, in this quarter, we had about $250 million bad news on hedging that, on the balance sheet, that we haven't shown as a special either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, I know your year-over-year bridge on the Fin Co., you call out better lease residual experience. That was not a gain. That's just lower depreciation, correct? I mean, you --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, how best to describe this. When auction prices really tanked off last year through the second quarter, we ended up having the impairment, for example. So for example, any vehicle that we had impaired last year that terminated during the second quarter of 2009, we might have actually seen technically a gain on that vehicle. We just kind of put them all together where there's gain or changes in depreciation, and call it all out as least residual related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's not a one time event, that's just, that's a depreciation, you're amortizing that "gain" over future quarters, like you typically do, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we typically do is, this is a depreciation concept, you can only depreciate, you can't add back to it. For example, if a vehicle was impaired last year and we expect the auction value to be higher in the future, we don't add that back as a reduction in depreciation. We will recognize that gain when that vehicle actually terminates and comes back to us. However, for all other vehicles, it's like I said before, a depreciation concept. We draw a straight line from where the vehicle is on our books today to where we expect it to be when it terminates and we depreciate straight line to that point in time.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. I think you also comment on slide 10, that you're looking at alternative business and funding arrangements. Is that anything you can give us maybe more detail on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we typically won't comment what we have under, that we're looking at right now. And when we talk about alternative business arrangements, it includes things like what we did in the Nordic region last year where we did a JV with a bank partner. We have a, in Brazil, we work with Bradesco. So we've, and it's those type of things. We exited, for example, Japan last year, but we made sure as we exited that somebody was going to pick up the ball and run with it to help support our brands. So it's kind of all those different things. But we continue to work on places that are harder to fund.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess with the portfolio is, it looks like the run-off's been pretty material and you've got a kind of a growing cushion of liquidity. Is there any focus maybe on looking at some of the Ford Motor Credit front-end debt that's still trading kind of cheap to buy some of that back, or is that kind of not, off the table right now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Doug, there's no new information on the dividend. As we've stated in the past, our plans have been to pay a dividend of about $2 billion through the end of 2010. And at this point in time, we've paid about 1.1 billion.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, good numbers. I guess, just a kind of continuation on what Doug was asking there, with respect to Ford Motor Credit, I mean it really does sound like the comments you gave earlier, second half profits will be lower, but the word profits were used. I mean, are we at the point now where, barring another major economic downturn here, that, is FMCC now going to be in the black and you're kind of confident that it's going to be a profitable business even as a wind-down? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And then the other question is just around Volvo. You're in talks. You have been in talks for over a year now. I mean, is there a point where perhaps you take it off the table? Or is this something that, again, we're going to hear something presumably by year-end? And I think the last comments on the first quarter call were to that effect, that you would hope to have something wrapped up with Volvo by year's end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, on your first question related to profits, I was okay with everything until you said wind-down, because we're not winding down the Credit Company. We are shrinking it a bit, but we're not winding down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, shrinkage, then. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. But as far as the second half goes, our guidance essentially is that we will not be as good as the first half. Our expectation is that it will be profitable. There were some certain things in the second quarter, in particular, the currency hedges hedging item, which won't repeat. And at the same time, when the auction prices move dramatically, you kind of get a big bump at first because you're depreciating vehicles. You're depreciating them less, as well as getting some gains on vehicles that are terminating. That trails off a bit over time.</p>
          <p>I will tell you, there are always wild cards in this business. The biggest wild card I'm looking at right now I think, it has been in the last year, auction prices. To give you perspective, since the beginning of January to the end of the second quarter, what we have seen for our portfolio of vehicles, the auction prices that we have experienced, we've seen an improvement of 20%. Which you'll see the same thing in the Manheim Index, or generally the same thing in the Manheim Index.</p>
          <p>If you go back to January, I would not have projected that kind of an improvement. Likewise last year when we got into the second quarter and saw that massive decline, I wouldn't have projected that deterioration in that either. So right now, the way we're looking at the second half of the year, we think we'll be okay, and we'll probably be profitable.</p>

          <p>K.R., you mentioned in the slide deck here, on Slide 10, that industrial loan corporation status, you're hoping for approval. The white papers came out and obviously there's, it creates a level of uncertainty with what may happen there. What comment can you guys give or color can you give with respect to that, or I mean obviously, it's difficult to say, but I mean, do you still confident that there's a good chance that you can get that and perhaps get grandfathered, or what's your take there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. Good morning. Could you, in regards to the dividend question, how often is that plan reviewed? When's the next time it's reviewed, and then kind of philosophically how is the organization looking at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as what are our plans as far as dividends go and how often we review it, we review this on a quarterly basis, specifically on the dividend itself. And as we've said in past K's and Q's, it really boils down to the comfort with the funding capability of a smaller balance sheet. And as the balance sheet has reduced, it frees up capital. But it really boils around how well our liquidity is holding up, how well we're getting funding done. And if we're really comfortable with that, we'll be able to pay a dividend out because we do have excess capital in the Credit Company right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Different topic, on the auction market and used car values, it seems like they've been bolstered a little bit by a number of things. But what's the outlook for that over the second half with OEs? Some of your competitors are turning back on the factories, including yourself. And it looks like we got some incentives, Daimler, I'm sorry, Chrysler recently increased incentives. And then it looks like maybe the fleet -- the rental fleet's pulling back on demand. Do you see some easing off in used car values in the second half?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Jeff, I wish I had a crystal ball on the used car market because it's been up and down dramatically in the last year. I hate to give any kind of forecast.  There's a lot of volatility in the market. You mentioned a lot of the pieces that are moving the market around, and new car sales also have an impact on that market as well. So I hate to give any kind of forecast for it.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a quick question for you. If I look at your first quarter versus second quarter slide, your expectation for managed receivables hasn't changed, but your funding, especially in the securitization part, has gone up by about five billion. Just curious, if your liquidity is fine and your potential balance sheet is not any different, why you need more funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what you'll see on that slide is there's a shifting around to the extent that our cash balance is actually higher as well. So we're -- with the positive signs we've seen in the markets from a standpoint of both TALF as well as spread levels, we're going to continue to try to build a stronger liquidity case.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I was wondering if we could talk about the 60-day delinquency rate in the second quarter. It came down. How much of that is seasonal, and can we infer any kind of trend from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as the 60-day delinquencies, it's just one aspect of the entire equation here. It usually comes off a little bit in the second quarter. We saw a rather large reduction in the second quarter. What I'm most pleased with is, as long as it stays kind of in that range, and the repossessions either kind of plateau out or start falling off a bit, I'll be absolutely thrilled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. With respect to maintaining a large cash balance, you made that comment before, a couple questions ago, you mentioned about having a larger cash balance at year-end. Is that the target, the new target anyway, as far as what kind of cash balance you expect, 18 to 20 million, or what did you mean by large cash balance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think what &#x2013; that's what's on the slide, and I think that's what our present forecast would have. I think in overall liquidity discussion, we're going to target enough liquidity to manage through a smaller balance sheet. So as the balance sheet shrinks, the need for a lot of excess liquidity goes along with that. So I think the key measurable is sort of liquidity as a percent of managed receivables, which is up in the second quarter, I think in part, because of some of the transactions we did in late quarter in Canada in particular. So I think you'll see that number, as the balance sheet shrinks, you'll see that number go down as well. Weighing that against what's in the credit markets from the standpoint of comfort and our ability to execute our forward plans and the need to hold cash or not hold cash relative to our outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then longer term, managed leverage, where does that need to be if Ford's ultimate goal is to become investment grade over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as the Credit Company goes, we have an agreement with the parent company that they would maintain our leverage no worse than 11.5 to one. The 11.5 to one is roughly in line with the riskiness of the assets that we have, based on our own internal studies.  And as we mentioned, we ended the quarter at about 8.4 to one, so there's room to take that up over time. Which gets back to what I talked about earlier, about trading off, or balancing dividends with funding capabilities.</p>
