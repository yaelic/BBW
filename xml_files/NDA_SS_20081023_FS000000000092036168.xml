          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Nordea International Conference Call, hosted by Johan Ekwall, Head of Investor Relations. My name is Ena and I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you'll be on listen only. However, at the end of the call, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to Johan to begin today's conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you and welcome to Nordea's telephone conference. In Stockholm, I have here our CEO, Christian Clausen; our CFO Fredrik Rystedt and our Chief Risk Officer, Carl-Johan Granvik. And as the operator has said, we will give some short presentations, each of the three speakers, and then we will enter into question-and-answer mode.</p>
          <p>And please note, that this is a telephone conference but also webcasted under nordea.com website. So, there you can find all slides that are going to be presented here and there you can sort of follow the conference.</p>
          <p>Then I hand over the word to Christian Clausen. Please, Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and welcome, everybody. I have a short presentation. I'll take the starting point with the slides on the net. So the main headline is that despite extreme market conditions Nordea delivers a strong result, and on page five I have the main headlines. We are particularly pleased to see that customer areas are delivering, and delivering according to our plans. And actually we have revenues up in the core customer areas, 10% in Nordic Banking and Institutional &amp; International Banking.</p>
          <p>Risk-adjusted profit is also up 5% of the customer areas, but unchanged for the Group. We have not made any re-classification on the securities out of the trading category. We have managed extreme market conditions. We have some impact in asset management in lower fees, because of the downturn in equity markets. We have some impact in market, some fair value adjustments, and the same goes for treasury.</p>
          <p>Our credit quality remains strong. However, we believe loan losses will gradually increase as we see the economic downturn develop. We have a very strong capital position, approximately 9%, excluding transition rules, after the full approval of our IRB method.</p>
          <p>We had a stable and well diversified funding base. And we have attracted new funding through the period, also long-term funding in Q3, at good prices on a relative basis. And we are maintaining our ambitious long-term financial targets. All growth initiatives are delivering according to plan, customer areas are on track, which means that we still see the potential, we have seen all the time in actually doubling the value of Nordea in seven years. And for the outlook, I will be back to that.</p>
          <p>The income statement, just a few comments to that. It's clear that we have a good diversification on our income streams, so interest rate -- net interest income is up; volume driven, mainly margin driven, where net fee commission income is down, mainly because of the saving fees coming down. And net gains losses are actually also down, but as I said, more or less unchanged on customer areas.</p>
          <p>Equity method down, as our minority holding, the Norwegian Eksportfinans, which are hit by the credit spread widening. Total operating income of 4%. Operating expenses in line with our targets, 6.5% up, which means that we're actually posting a small increase in profit before loan losses, which have had a very strong performance.</p>
          <p>Loan losses are changing sign; recoveries last year, some losses this year, and then operating profit is down 7%. Our ambitious target was to deliver TSR in third quarter out of European peer group. We have done that. Actually for the full period, 1st of January, '07 until today we are number two in our European peer group, only slightly behind BNP Paribas, which is also a fine bank.</p>
          <p>Risk adjusted profits, doubling in seven years. We are not really there. We are a bit below the line as you can see on page eight. It's actually the development we could have foreseen. The reason why we set up the seven year target was actually to indicate this will be through the cycle.</p>
          <p>And we have expected that during this cycle we would see some quarters or years where we were below the line, and others where we were above. As I said, the main reason for maintaining this ambitious target is that we see strong development in customer areas and our growth plans are delivering precisely as we expected.</p>
          <p>And this takes me to the outlook. Clearly, macroeconomic outlook is deteriorating. Uncertainty is increasing. We expect a gradual slowdown of lending growth for the remaining part of the year, and we clearly see lending margins improve, especially on the corporate side. We see increased uncertainty in financial markets. And also therefore, our savings related fees have a larger uncertainty than previous, and the same thing goes for our capital markets business.</p>
          <p>We expect the same level of risk adjusted profit for the full year, as we had last year, excluding the impact on the state guarantee schemes. Cost growth will be in line with the cost growth for the first nine months, and our credit quality remains strong, but we are flagging that the economic downturn will mean that will see a gradual increase in loan losses.</p>
          <p>And I will now hand over to Fredrik Rystedt our CFO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Christian. I'll stay mostly on the third quarter in this presentation, and as you can see from slide 11, we had a very strong quarter, considering the market conditions. The income is largely unchanged, despite pressure on savings fees and of course, negative valuation effects in market.</p>
          <p>Costs are slightly lower, which is showing the firm cost management, as well as cyclical effect with lower activity during the summer. Loan losses, as Christian talked about, are higher, as we have been expecting, when the cycle turns around, and right back or decreasing.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide, we've had a good and robust volume development year-on-year, but clearly decreasing in quarter three, in comparison to the previous quarter. And of course, the slowdown is due to the &#x2013; partly our aim to balance the growth rate in lending and growth in deposits. But it's also reflecting the increased economic uncertainty in many of our customer businesses. Deposits are growing faster than lending in quarter three, which is good from the funding perspective.</p>
          <p>Net interest income on slide 13. You can see that the strong revenue growth is, to a large extent, driven by strong increase in net interest income. We have both strong growth in lending and deposits. The positive trend in corporate margin in 2008, is reflecting normalization of pricing and risk, but we do see better margin. And in Q3 we also see normalizing lending margins in the household segment. And as an example, mortgage margins are up with eight basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide you will see a clear shift in net income driver &#x2013; net interest income driver. Whilst you can see on the year-on-year, a lot of the improvement and the growth is driven by volume. You can clearly see a shift in the Q3 towards a margin driven development.</p>
          <p>Structural interest income risk is lower in Q3, in comparison to Q2, and that is reflecting our intention to reduce risk, given these market circumstances, we have done that partly through better matching of risks and the duration et cetera.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide 16, describes the development of net fees and commissions, and that has been one of the areas where we've actually seen a decline in the quarter. The main reason why it's down, is basically weaker equity markets and lower risk appetites among customers. That is resulting in both outflows from equity funds into lower margin fixed income, for instance. But it's also generally resulting in lower activity from our customers and lower brokers' fees as a consequence.</p>
          <p>If I turn to slide 18, on the net gains and losses, we &#x2013; as you can see the year-on-year decrease of net gains and losses is 21%, mainly explained, of course, by the valuation losses related to market turmoil, and lower contribution from listed and non-listed equities. And that primarily is, of course, OMX; that was resulting in a good gain last year. But we actually have seen also, a strong trend from customer areas, and that you can see on the next slide. Valuation losses was largely compensated by very good customer demand for risk products, mainly FX, but also in other areas.</p>
          <p>If we, then on slide 20, summarize our income, it's clear, and you can see that very well from that slide, it's clear that our customer business continues to perform very well. And, of course, all of the negative impact and the negative result is a consequence of the turmoil. If I then turn to expenses, we are pretty much in line with last year's growth of expenses and according to our guidance. The increase is mainly explained by the investment in growth areas, more than half of it, and staff cost is up 7%, reflecting increased number of employees and of course, the wage inflation that we know of.</p>
          <p>In slide 23, you can see the development of the FTEs, and the main part of the increase is explained by the plus 8%, or 2,400 new employees, year-on-year. And main increase Nordic market, and there you need to remember that there's the purchase of Svensk Kassaservice has added a considerable number of employees and also the intentional growth plan in Sweden, that we are executing on.</p>
          <p>One important factor, when the cycle turns, Nordea has the flexibility from the large gross figures, 3,800 and 1,600 that you can see on the slide. The rest is explained by people coming back from maternity, paternity leave and changing their work hours, et cetera. All in all, net profit on slide 24, of course the shift &#x2013; the decline is mainly explained by the loan losses, 146 million, in comparison to the 54. But we also have a negative &#x2013; or a higher tax rate, both for the year as a whole so far, and also for the quarter, and that is explained by less utilization of loss carry forwards in Finland and to a large extent also, due to one-time effect in Denmark last year, when the Danes lowered the tax rate. Return on equity is 15.7%, which we are pleased with, given the circumstances. And we are also pleased with the risk adjusted profitability, when loan loss is not part of the picture.</p>
          <p>If I then turn to funding on slide 26, as Christian suggested, the funding operation has, despite the market turmoil, continued to function well. We have issued in September alone, 2 billion of long term funding. We have done a low Tier 2 issue and we've had a reasonably good performance in the covered bond market in Denmark and Sweden. Of course lower liquidity, but still functioning.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 27, we &#x2013; I think this is very much known to you, but of course, a significant portion is from the deposits &#x2013; from the public. But we have a very well diversified funding platform, which is a particular advantage in turbulent times, so have been able to tap the market from various places, going forward.</p>
          <p>If we look at slide 28, we have a strong balance sheet, which is, of course, a reflection of the low business profile of a bank with our retail banking focus. And mortgages account for approximately one-third of the lending. And we do finance, as you can see from that slide, largely with covered bonds. If you look at the next slide, the lending to the public is about 185 billion and we are funding that mainly by deposits. And similarly of course, with a mortgage portfolio, we are funding that largely with covered bonds.</p>
          <p>The next slide, slide 30 you can see we have a significant portion of our funding is long term and a very significant portion of that, the long-term funding, is actually long-term. So we're very pleased with the maturity profile of our long-term portfolio or long-term funding.</p>
          <p>If I then end a little bit with risk weighted assets and also the capital position, you can see on slide 31 that we are continuing to grow our risk weighted assets, but at a much slower pace, so just under 2% in the quarter. We are roughly at the same &#x2013; risk weighted assets, including and excluding transition rules, are basically growing at the same pace. So there is no material changes in risk weights in the quarter as such. And is this, of course, also resulting in a strong position.</p>
          <p>So if you look at slide 32, you will see that our  tier one ratio is 7.9%, excluding those transition rules. We are currently in the process of the IRB approval for our household portfolio and with that approved we expect the ratio around 9%. Previously, we have expressed that we will communicate a new capital policy. And as I said, we have an ongoing approval process for the IRB portfolio. And that will reduce our risk weighted assets by approximately 12%.</p>
          <p>Given the financial turmoil that we are experiencing now and, of course the potential new regulations and new benchmark developing in the market, we are currently evaluating our future capital policy.</p>
          <p>I think with those words, Johan I will leave the floor to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Fredrik. I'll be short. If you look at the picture on picture 39, basically illustrating the fact that we have a very diversified and strong credit portfolio, not only in terms of geography, but also in terms of that it incorporates mortgage and other household lending.</p>
          <p>The corporate portfolio on -- it's on page 40, shows the well known fact that real estate is the biggest single exposure. And we have broken it further down in the smaller picture there, indicating the fact that Sweden accounts for the majority of &#x2013; or the biggest part of that, but also the fact that a fair amount is residential exposure rather than commercial exposure, that particular so in Sweden. While Denmark on the other hand, actually has the lowest of the four Nordic countries in terms of real estate exposure.</p>
          <p>Shipping, the big growth in the last quarter should also be seen against the background of a strengthening US dollar actually accounting for roughly half of the increase. Otherwise, the portfolio is well diversified in terms of industries between bankers and tankers (17.18) and other ships. We know that this market is now going down from a period of extreme profitability and it's not something that we feel particularly concerned about, because we are operating with the strongest participants in the market.</p>
          <p>We can then jump to page 43, looking at the loan losses for the quarter. Already mentioned the figure of 89 million for the quarter. I think also when you look at the bar &#x2013; the borderline the blue one, indicating that we actually have more or less the same level of new provisions throughout the last year, while there has been a continuous reduction in recoveries, exactly as we have been forecasting as the economy turns to the worst. And we have in the last quarter also added another 16 million to the general provision for the Baltic exposure.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans have after many quarters or (18.20) more or less flat development increased somewhat. Half of the increase is to be accounted for in the Baltic countries, while the Nordic level is still very low. And you can also see that the bigger part of the impaired loans are actually performing loans where we have chosen to take an early provision because of a weaker outlook.</p>
          <p>I think we can then actually jump to page 48, market risk. Market risk is also up quite a lot. Two reasons; in the last two quarters, first of all, we have changed under our models to reflect the higher volatility in the market. And particularly in the last quarter, we saw further increase in volatility, meaning that without actually increasing our positions, the bar numbers represented here have grown rather significantly. This is, of course, a figure that moves quite a lot from day to day as much of it is coming from the market trading activities.</p>
          <p>Finally a word about the Baltics, also there we have a well-managed portfolio in terms of division between household lending and corporate. And also worth pointing out that roughly 25% of the portfolio is related to Nordic-related customers having subsidiaries and activities in the Baltic countries.</p>
          <p>We have overall a total provision of 107 million for the Baltic exposure, actually covering the net impaired loans in the area 100%, which we consider to be a strength and an early recognition of possible future downturn trends continuing in that market.</p>
          <p>I think that is the main points that I would like to point out in the Credit portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay very good. Then operator we are ready here for the Q&amp;A session</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.<mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have a question from the line of Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken. Please go ahead, Matti.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas here from Handelsbanken Capital Markets. I have three questions if I may. First of all, on the capital policy review that you talk about, this should &#x2013; should we expect that you will revise downwards your dividend policy as well, taking into account the turbulence in the market? The second question is on the life insurance side. It's been quite a turbulent quarter and still you're booking investment return of zero. I was just wondering how was that possible and also is there any impact on the reclassification of the liabilities, did that have a P&amp;L impact? And the third question is on the shipping. How much of the portfolio is exposed to the spot market and the dry bulk market? Thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on the capital part of the review. I think what we are doing is we are planning to get approval for the final IRB and then we will also look into what changes are being contemplated on Basel II. And so, what we have said is that we later this year would come out with a target for capital. So there's no indication that we will change dividend policy or the policies. It's just an indication that we've set up in new Basel II environment new capital targets to reflect the new environment. That is going -- that we will do in due time and we want to put all these things together before we actually announce something. But as we stated, we believe that we are well capitalized to run the business we have. And Carl-Johan, on shipping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On shipping, you can see on the bar not that clearly, but our bulk exposure has been very flat over this period. We are very much into what we call industrial shipping, i.e. financing operators that have a long-term contract with people having the leadership material across the seas. Of course, there is an element of spot as well in the portfolio. The actual size of that I cannot tell, it's not something that I have available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that 50% or any kind of rough estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's less than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Life, it is so that we have a zero return in Q3 and it is, of course, reflecting that the equity positions has been hedged to a very large extent during this quarter. And there is virtually no P&amp;L effect on the changes of the liabilities. They are single digit if any. And so it's mainly the size of the financial bubble that is determined by the changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The equity, I can mention that the equity proportion in our Life proposal is only 17%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's still &#x20AC;3 billion, so it's a lot of money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Per L&#xF6;fgren, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one is on risk weighted assets and capital ratios. As you pointed out here that risk weighted assets, they grow in line with assets. And I was a little bit surprised, remembering the previous quarter here that -- where we had a big jump in risk weighted assets. Why are there not any -- why is there not any pro-cyclical factor in this quarter? And could you guide us a little bit here, how should we think about this going forward? Like you have -- what is it now -- a year or two ago communicated a full risk weight reduction from going to Basel I to Basel II.</p>
          <p>Should we think about that sort of the end number and reduce it with whatever view I have on the temperature on the economic conditions in the market? I hope that makes sense that otherwise. The second question I have relates to the strong deposit growth that you show about grow lending clearly. So the funding gap is shrinking. My question there is should we expect this strength to continue? Is this move deliberate? Is it driven by corporate deposit, retail deposits, and what is the target for the balance sheet structure going forward in this regard? Those are the questions. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can perhaps start with the risk weighted assets. We have seen, as I mentioned before, slightly below 2% increase in risk weighted assets, which is largely reflecting the increased lending growth and hence we don't see any major impact from migration in the quarter results. So that's consistent with our lending growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that the migration thing -- let's say, was the job done in the second quarter, because it has been under enormous turmoil now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But we don't have those -- we don't have that indication for Q3. We have continued with, of course, our rating process, but we don't see any significant change to it in Q3. We saw more of that in Q2. I think you mentioned also the reduction in the Basel II. Of course, we are under the transition rules but excluding those, that's -- we have that capital ratio of 7.9%. And we expect, of course, continued decline in risk weighted assets as a consequence of the IRB approval, as I said, with roughly about 12%. So that's the total -- the impact on the total portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And deposit growth, but it's clear that we have had a view this quarter and that we wanted to find some better balance and we have been active on the deposit side and we have also held back somewhat on lending in various areas. So, in general, we are seeking to find a better balance. But, in general, I would say that I think all banks right now are looking through their balance sheets exactly what structure they want going forward and we have made some changes in contemplating some more, not big things because we are fundamentally quite happy about it.</p>
          <p>We are announcing one thing in the report. We have securitized our mortgage book in Finland, in order to make it repo eligible papers, instead of just sitting on the balance sheet. And in general terms, I think that could easily be a trend we see that more banks will ensure they have a higher liquidity ratio on their assets, which of course is another way of looking at funding and funding liquidity profits in general. We haven't made a new policy on the deposit ratio but we are, in this environment, of course, very conscious of having a high liquidity ratio, and as you can see we have increased our liquidity profits at the same time.</p>

          <p>Yes. All right, thanks. I understand that so that you -- as you say, you have securitized the Finnish part already and I understand that you continue to work in this way with other portfolios, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are looking through now the assets and I think that is a general trend that we will -- I think we'll see quite a few banks looking at their balance sheets, both the funding, the liability side but also on the assets side, how to improve the liquidity ratio in general of the balance sheet and that can easily be done. It's not really been a major issue in previous years, because funding has just been flowing in at very low prices and easily, and now this is something, which is a major issue. But as we already gone through, we actually like our structure quite well. It's not fundamental problem. It's more adjustments we are seeking to do. Maybe Carl-Johan, you have something about the pro-cyclicality and the credit -- and risk weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think Fredrik said most of it. But it's true exactly that we didn't see much of that in Q3 and it's not going to be, in my experience, something that will happen overnight or suddenly. It will follow the macroeconomic development. And we should still remember that we still have a very strong momentum in the major part of our business area, i.e. the Nordic countries. So, there is no reason to believe that it will be a huge shift in ratings and, thereby, grow the risk of our asset, even if the direction is clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But you -- to do this in a very simple way, would you agree with me that the correct thing is to do -- let's say you're saying now that the reduction of risk weighted assets is 12% from implementing this portfolio. And my view, let's say, it's a little bit more pessimistic on the economic outlook than yours. I would say it's 10 rather than 12. Is it that kind of that band that we are talking about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi there. I'd like to return to capital, which you've touched upon. But just my three questions are firstly you're growing quite strongly in new markets, so Poland and the Baltics. Anecdotally, it seems like some of the large players in Poland, in particular, are trying to stop their foreign currency lending. And I wanted to hear your approach there. The zloty has lost some 25% against the Swiss franc or even more, which until recently was some 70, 80% on new lending.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on capital, just to come back to that, you say that you're well capitalized and even under full Basel II, as far as I can tell, you're aiming at something like 9% Tier 1 ratio, you expect to get there. This would put you lower than any of your local peers and lower than most of the European banks that have raised capital. And then finally, I wondered if it was possible to get the price of the lower Tier 2 that you've raised, if that is public and I haven't missed it? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start with Poland. I think our approach in Poland is slightly different from what we have been doing, say, in Russia, i.e. that we have opened a lot of new branches, which means that we are actually targeting private persons, small businesses, private and big borrowers, i.e. the Blue Chip, the few Blue Chips that's in Poland. And that's why this &#x2013; behavior from the big companies is not really something that affects us. We are building up a portfolio from the grass roots, rather than being active in the high segments, even if we have some of the bigger companies, and particularly including the Nordic companies operating in Poland <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But sorry just to clarify, if you look on the retail side, I know the large banks do some 70, 80% of new mortgage lending, for instance, in foreign currency and the zloty has lost 25% against most of those currencies. So I was just thinking what your approach is; what proportion of your lending in Poland, for instance, is done in local currency and what is done in, well hard currency, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The majority is done in local currency. So, it is <mark type="inaudible" /> respect on a sounder basis than in the Baltics, where you know that the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of foreign currency is 75, 80%. It's much lower in Poland.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you had two questions whether we operate with adequate capital ratios. That we believe we are well diversified in our portfolio. And therefore we do believe that 9% that we are looking at in full Basel II implementation is adequate. And then, of course, that is lower than two of our Nordic peers, as you suggest, and roughly similar or slightly better than one other. But we believe it's an adequate level. But again, there is a turmoil ongoing and, of course, a lot of discussions and trends going on in this area, but we believe it's adequate for the time being.</p>
          <p>You asked the third question, which was about debt, the lower Tier 2 and that was LIBOR up 170 basis points.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Derek De Vries, Merrill Lynch. Derek please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I actually have two questions. The first one's pretty high level. But there are some press comments today, I think quotes from Mr. Clausen suggesting that you were in good shape financially and ready to do a significant deal. Given the uncertainty in the current market environment and questions around balance sheet and values on balance sheet, what kind of return on investment would you be looking for if you were to do a deal in these market environments?</p>
          <p>Presumably it's a higher threshold than it was as risk premiums have gone up. If you could just give us some sense there, what kind of return on investment you'd be looking at. And then on the funding costs &#x2013; my second question's on funding cost. Yesterday Handelsbanken gave us some pretty good detail on their covered bond issue and they were suggesting that while they had been able to issue pretty regularly in October, not all competitors were and they were suggesting, if not explicitly saying, that they thought they had a pretty significant competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>I don't think they were referring to you, but I was wondering if you could kind of give us some comments in terms of your volume of issuance in October, maturities on that issue and who the buyers are and maybe the relative spreads versus the non AA rated issuers in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start with the first one. Significantly, you know it's like these journalists, they all like to blow up these comments to an extent, which is we don't believe quite as said. The same thing as we've been saying all of the time. We are looking at smaller acquisitions in our marketplace, if it's attractive, and we are ready to do a major deal, if it becomes possible in this market environment. And the key driver is, of course, value equation.</p>
          <p>That's very much on what we will be looking at and very high our reason for that matter. We haven't set a threshold, but value equation is a real thing and a major deal will be one, which will be focused on that. And, of course, in this environment it's very much a question of the possibility of whether it can be done at all. That's not certain at all. And I think on the covered bond issues...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We issued in Q3 about 3.5 billion, and we have continued roughly with the same pace also in October. I believe we have basically for the long and the covered bonds continued to have similar attractive rates, and I think we compare well with Handelsbanken's comment. So you're right in a sense that I don't think that they are referring to us, when they say they have, in relative terms, more attractive funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say the long end, you've issued on the long end, what is the long end these days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess five years is long. So in this market it is long, but we have done relatively small issues in October, but they have been to that length.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if you did a five year, I mean, presumably you're talking 100 million here or something like that. What kind of pricing versus mid-swaps would you have been doing on those types of deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's difficult to answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think it is. I don't think &#x2013; it's more theoretical. I don't actually &#x2013; I cannot give you that answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair. And maybe just to come back to the ROI question. I mean, I guess probably two, three years ago, you probably would have felt very comfortable, going to your board, presenting a small, mid-sized or even very large acquisition with a, I don't know, 11, 12, 13% ROI. Where does that hurdle rate go today? I mean, presumably you wouldn't feel comfortable pitching to your board an 11% ROI in this uncertain environment. What's kind of a minimum you'd feel comfortable, standing in front of your board, saying this is a good deal, we should do it and use the capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's something which is impossible to answer, because it depends on the risk. The one deal where we discussed something about this was when we bought the branches from Roskilde Bank. And there we had the opportunity to send back all the credits which we didn't like in the six week period after closing. So you can say if the risk gets really low then its one thing, and if it is higher it's another thing. So it is higher than the figures you are mentioning, but I would rather &#x2013; we would actually rather be looking at it in terms of the value creation which is around, because it's not easy to look upon it as a straight investment often.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from the line of Neil Kroner, AKO Capital. Neil please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, and congratulations, first of all, on a really, really good set of results. Three questions, please. And the first one is, you talk about how the margins have gone up quite nicely, and you say they are coming closer to normalized pricing levels of risk. And my question I guess, is this, what do you think are normalized pricing levels? So, how much of the margin expansion is yet to come? Where do you think margins could go?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was just wondering on the guarantee schemes or the support schemes for financials in your home market, could you just give us an idea to what extent they've already had an effect on funding markets. So basically to what extent you're seeing an improvement in maturities, in volumes or prices this week. And then, the last question is specifically on the Danish guarantee scheme. I'm just struggling to understand.</p>
          <p>You were saying that you have decided on a commercial basis to participate in the scheme and have given a cost estimate of 180 to &#x20AC;200 million for that. Just looking at the funding gap, excluding covered bonds in Denmark, that would suggest that you see a very, very substantial funding advantage of 200 basis points or more, which given what you've said about your funding costs, doesn't really look possible. So I'm just wondering if I'm overlooking something, or you're planning, for instance, just to move a lot of the senior unsecured funding of the entire group to Denmark and then issue under the guarantee. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I start with the margins, when we say normalizing margins, we are also -that's actually two things. One is to raise the overall level to also reflect the increased cost of funding, which we have seen, or the whole market has seen in the last six months or so. And secondly, we are looking at having a wider spread between good risks and bad risks, which was again follows the introduction of Basel II risk weighted capital regime, which means that every lending operation that we do needs to have a satisfactory <mark type="inaudible" /> for the transaction.</p>
          <p>And that is what we are working with. There are still the companies that can raise margins at &#x2013; loans at competitive margins, while others have to pay considerably more than they are doing today. And that work is still in progress in order to lift them to the margins that we find satisfactory. And the same goes actually for mortgage margins, where we have had a long, downward spiral for mortgages, where we can clearly see now that they are on the rise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you just give us just a rough estimate of how much substantially it would mean. Are we talking about an additional 10 basis points in mortgage margins you expect or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For new mortgage loans, more than 10%, more than 10 basis points. I talk about &#x2013; what we have said today, that the days of mortgage margins below 0.5% are all where we should rather see them in the, say, 70 area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on corporate loans, could you also give us an idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There we have a much wider spread. Let's say, a spread between 1% and 3% should be the &#x2013; where most of our customers would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your second question was relating to if the Swedish package so far has any impact. I think it's too early to say that, but also before that was launched, we saw a little easing of the marketplace, so easier to obtain funding, and that trend has continued also in this week. So maybe the anticipation of it and maybe the presentation of it has had an impact. But we saw that &#x2013; those better conditions actually evolving prior to this package.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the third question you had, why did we join? Well, clearly, our assumption was that it's not possible to compete against state guarantees. So primarily, the funding advantage was not the triggering or the decisive factor. It was basically deposit alongside with funding, in the sense that you cannot compete against the state guarantee, although we did not request that guarantee. Once it's in place, you cannot compete against it, so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think that the same would then hold for Sweden, because in Sweden we've had some rumors that not all banks might participate in this scheme, which is &#x2013; which looks more voluntary than the Danish scheme. But do you think that likewise in Sweden, it will not be possible for any bank really to stay outside this guarantee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that first of all, the actual conditions remain to be disclosed. They will be disclosed on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. So I think it's too early to actually have a view whether it will be effective or not to participate. The only lead we have there is what has been stated by the Government so far; that it's intended to be attractive to join, at least at the outset, and then of course potentially be able to phase out. So, again, I think that those rumors that we have seen, I think it's difficult to comment on them, because everyone is waiting for the absolute conditions to actually come out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ronit Ghose, Citi. Ronit, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. It's Ronit from Citi; just a couple of questions. First of all, on your margins, your corporate margin improved nicely in Norway and in Sweden. And I was just wondering if you could make some comment as to how you see the pricing trends in the different countries you operate in, because in Denmark and Denmark and Finland corporate margins seem to be stickier. Why has it been easier in Norway and Sweden to raise margins for you?</p>
          <p>On the deposit margin, I'm surprised that you haven't &#x2013; I know you said you're attracting lots or you're competing for deposits. I'm surprised that you haven't also seen a deposit margin increase. Do you think that going forward it's the lending margin side you're going to see improving? Or do you think there's scope here, sort of a flight to safety; you're the biggest bank in the region, that you actually see some deposit margin widening as well?</p>
          <p>And finally, on the capital, we've talked a lot about Basel II and Tier 1. Do you think that, how much do you think that Basel II is going to be relevant, going forward? Do you see the chance is that actually we're going to be moving beyond that to a Basel 2.5 or a BASEL III? Does your regulator, or your bond investors, your rating agencies increasingly focus on other capital metrics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the same the lending margins. It's true that the countries have already listed out of pace here. Regarding Denmark and Finland, their trailing in Q3, but then we should remember that Denmark actually was first out raising margins much earlier. And now in this month, we actually have again taking a new round increasing margins overall to the &#x2013; in the Danish market.</p>
          <p>In Finland again, we did not do any changes to existing margins until September; meaning that we were now out as the first bank in Finland that was to ever &#x2013; to actually touch all margins, one reason being that the illustration is not that easy in Finland, regarding changing margins. So the Finnish margin will go up following this initiative. And in Norway and Sweden, those initiatives we're also taking basically in the spring, so that's why you don't see a big change in the last quarter. But, overall, if you go one year back, we have seen a marked improvement in all the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the deposit margin, the numbers affecting the deposit margin, there has been competition in the market still. It might level off now, with the guarantee schemes. Well, we actually expect that. But then another effect will come in, the lower of interest levels, which will impact our transaction accounts negatively. So what the average deposit margin will be going forward is very difficult to say, but I don't think you should be looking for an increase in that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's transaction accounts who have driven the margins in Q3, since we have seen a couple of rate hikes in Sweden and Norway, primarily. That's likely to change now, going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And capital side, well, it's a very interesting discussion. I think you would have a lot of views on this as well. I think it's &#x2013; this is a moving target these days, what the capital &#x2013; how we should look at capital. And I'm sure you will have views and the bondholders and rating agencies, and so on will have capital views going forward, and that's one of the reasons why we have not yet set our target.</p>
          <p>But I think it's important, as Fredrik also said, to look at the business mix and the risk involved. A balance sheet is not a balance sheet, and at the same time, capital is not capital. You have to remember, we have a strong and tangible capital, and very little goodwill, and also only a limited part of hybrids. So the whole equation comes together in what is real capital, how we will look at various forms of capital going forward, when looking also a lot of hybrids and preferred shares are coming in these days, and how will you look at the real risk on the balance sheet. And there I think Basel will remain &#x2013; the Basel II framework.</p>
          <p>At least, I think it's a valid framework, how to look at the risk weights. So I'm not that sure that will change. But the views on how much capital one need probably have to be refined going forward, so we may also have to look at the previously liquidity ratios in the balance sheet and so on. So there are a number of issues which have to come together and I think the coming weeks and months will show that, still putting it all together, we are well capitalize to run this balance sheet of &#x2013; in this business of Nordea.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I &#x2013; can I just follow-up on scale and M&amp;A? Maybe the comments have been exasturbated by the media, but just reading what's on my screen, I mean, it seems like &#x2013; you seems to be talking quite positively about the benefits of scale and the importance of being big in this market environment. And I just wondered, if you were &#x2013; I don't know 25% bigger in terms of balance sheet or 50% bigger. What do you think the advantages for you would be, vis-&#xE0;-vis where you are today versus your regional peer group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's difficult to say, you can just say that Nordea is the living proof you can put smaller banks together, and really create scale. And by the way, also efficiency, and we have done now that there several times. In the 80s, we were more than 30 banks. In the 90s we became four banks, and now since 2000 we have been one bank.</p>
          <p>And every time we have seen considerable scale effects and with the platform we have today and very much in the business processes &#x2013; processes we are running, we can easily see much more scale coming through those processes. So I think the next step is also a real substantial value creation. A number of other things come also into the play.</p>
          <p>One of the great things of Nordea, which was under estimated in the beginning was the sheer size means that we are gaining considering market shares now on big &#x2013; on the big corporate, for example, which had not been possible at all. And there are a number of other examples. So we are quite convinced there are considerable value creations, but to put a number on it requires we know in more detail of what type of bank, what type of business, what type of balance sheet we're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the synergies or the benefits of scale, does that come from doing consolidation in the region in contiguous areas, or if you were to go outside the region do the synergies still hold based on where we are today on technology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But I think it holds quite well. I mean, that's the proof of Nordea. We are doing banking in nine countries, and especially the four big Nordic ones, of course. And the skepticism was big in the beginning, eight years ago. But now I think everything have realized that it's not that depending on having one IT system. It's much more important to create efficient approaches where you can pull a lot of business through. So I think we have proved that that is possible even if we cross a border.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Per Gr&#xF6;nborg, Danske Market. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Per Gr&#xF6;nborg. Most of my questions have been answered, but still I &#x2013; I have two left. On the Baltic's how comfortable are you &#x2013; are you with the situation? How comfortable are you potentially growing your business significantly in the current market environment in the Baltic's? My second question is we have seen some of your peers announcing that they will look over their cost situation, what are the situation in Nordea. Are you getting excess capacity now on your bonds and will have to look over your cost situation or is that too early to discuss now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I started to Baltic. Of course, we are concerned about the downturn in the economics in all the three countries, but we still see business opportunities in the market. We are not totally withdrawing from that market. This is a long-term home market for us, and we will ride this storm out, no doubt about that. There will be a couple of tough years with zero growth, maybe the negative growth, which means that there will be increased credit losses.</p>
          <p>We are seeing some of them coming through and we have prepared ourselves for more to come through the general provision that we have made for that market. I think we still have a fair chance to make a turn in the economy, but it takes a solution &#x2013; action from the government and also acceptance from the people that they will actually see the problems themselves and take action and, thereby, security that there will not be a crash landing. It might be something between hard and a soft landing, but they can avoid &#x2013; for instance avoid the devaluation, which would of course have a big impact. I think that &#x2013; that is still a possibility if they get their act together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it also a significant risk if we are seeing the currency regimes sliding in the region; that's probably also a fair bond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. As I say it is very precise if they can pull out of this without having to resort to devaluation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on cost I would just say it's too early to say. We are monitoring this, of course, as we go. And the important thing is to note that half of our cost increase are linked to our growth initiatives, which are all delivering. So we are in the situation where we have initiatives &#x2013; investments delivering and at the same time, of course, monitoring closely the development. But we are prepared to take the necessary actions if needed.</p>
          <p>And another thing we have to remember that we are taking our efficiency all the time. We have presented a slide where we have I think it was 2.4% this year and it was the same last year approximately. So we have taken out 2.5% per year over the recent years in cost efficiency and that we are continuing to do. So that's an ongoing effort to actually take out costs in our growth areas.</p>
          <p>We are not too happy about as we are right now, as I said we have a strong business momentum and as long as we have that we have absolutely no free capacity right now. So, of course, we will be monitoring closely our revenue side. With these words I will be leaving the room to catch a plane, but I believe the conference open for Johan Ekwall to conduct. So I will believe leaving. Thank you very much for participating.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A couple of detailed questions, I joined late, so I might have asked them already. First the shipping book, if I look at the Q2 volume it was roughly 5.9 billion and this it's 9 billion. I just &#x2013; question what's going on there, if it's FX effects or what explains the strong growth? And second question is on reserve ratios. I know the group has a reserve ratio of roughly 58%, but could you give maybe some sort of breakdown or view on where you are in each Nordic country? Those were my two questions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I try to answer them. Regarding shipping we have done a reclassification of all our corporate lending. As you can see that, we have broken down in many more industries and we also have reclassified the portfolio from before. So you should not compare the 5.5 to something like 13. You should compare 10.8 to 12.9. And in doing that you should also remember that half of that increase has to do with the &#x2013; actually a little bit more than half, with the dollar strengthening, because the loan portfolio is 100% dollars almost. And the strength in the quarter was rather significant.</p>
          <p>So that is the reason that we saw this big increase. Regarding the coverage ratio it varies somewhat between the countries and the reason for that is basically that it is, of course, dependent on what kind of companies are provided for. I mean, if you have a good security package then you tend to have a lower reserve, because the loss giving the fall is smaller. And you can say that all &#x2013; it's really only Finland that is significantly below the overall &#x2013; just below 50% while the average is 58. That means that the other countries are just above 60%. So that is the rough division between the countries.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot for that.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chintan Joshi, Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Today Riksbank cut their rates by 50 basis points and they're talking about cutting rates further in the next six months. They must see a really pessimistic scenario of Swedish economy. Even in their scenario analysis they think GDP could go down to minus 0.5%. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the Swedish economy, in particular and the Nordic economies in general? And then related to that also wanted to know your opinion on the stress test that the Riksbank where they run a scenario similar to the 2000 slowdown. I mean, in their scenario loan loss provisions go up pretty quickly and pretty high from current levels? Just wanted to get your thoughts on both these things? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, it is of course difficult to have another opinion than the best economists that we have in the &#x2013; both in our bank and in the country, which are forecasting a slowdown in growth now in &#x2013; say from here onwards. They're talking about next year an increase in GDP, which is going to be only 1.5% and we are this year seeing maybe 2.5%. But there's still no forecast indicating that we should actually have a stagnation. i.e. a zero growth.</p>
          <p>So there will be a slowdown. It will also continue into 2010 most likely. But in comparison to the global economy, I think the Nordic countries also in the future will do better based on our very strong global companies, our very good health in the public economies. I mean, all the countries are running big budget surpluses, rather than deficits. And, therefore, we will &#x2013; we have at this moment extreme high employment. We have never had such high employment in Nordic countries as we have today. That will, of course, go down in the downturn, but we will &#x2013; we don't think that we will suffer more than the market in general.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, I think we will come out slightly below that and that would indicate that interest rates will go down further in the &#x2013; in all the kronor countries also, of course, then in euro, which is the Finish currency. And that gives both challenges and opportunities then for the business model that we run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And your comments on the Riksbank's stress test?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's more a run off of the 2000 slowdown than a stress test.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have, this is a &#x2013; and I think they write that as well in their press release. It's a very hypothetical scenario and they have been very, very aggressive on both loan losses last year than before. So it's a very hypothetical scenario that they are describing. And the attention of the test is, of course, is to try the robustness, so to speak, of the capital situation of the major banks.</p>
          <p>Their conclusion was, of course, that the banking system was robust from a stability standpoint. When we do our stress test scenarios we would apply much different &#x2013; other assumptions but, of course, we come to a similar conclusion. So again, it's one way of doing it and we are doing it differently. But what it does prove or not prove, but what it does show is that the banking environment is stable and, of course, not least for Nordea.</p>
