          <p>Good morning. This is Yamma welcoming you to the ING's Second Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Before handing this conference call over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING; Patrick Flynn, Chief Financial Officer; and Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer; let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of variables including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in the securities markets, including equity markets, and underlying economic conditions and changes. The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.</p>
          <p>Good morning, Jan, Patrick and Koos. Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much. Good morning everyone. I am here with Koos and Patrick and we will make a short presentation on the results. And then we will open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>ING returned to profits in the second quarter and we are ahead of schedule over our Back to Basics program. I think those are the main messengers that I would say when you look at slide number two of our presentation. We'll get into the details a little bit later.</p>
          <p>On page three you see the return to profitability in Q2 at 229 million and you see how we have fared compare with the last three quarters. So for first time since three quarters we are making again a profitable result. Underlying result of 229 and after taking charges for cost reductions and net profit, the net profit to our shareholders is 71 million.</p>
          <p>On page number four you see our commercial results and then we do that before taking market and risk cost and you see that we had an significant increase in our commercial results on the pre-tax basis reflecting, I think, much better markets in financial markets but also the success of our Back to Basics program and our cost reductions here. The commercial result is driven by a sharp increase in interest and we also could benefit from re-pricing of loans in our commercial markets and in our savings products. The insurance achieved a commercial result of 500 million and that's significantly higher than it did in the previous quarters. And here also cost containment and higher assets under management have driven the results.</p>
          <p>On slide number five you see a repeat of our Back to Basics strategy and I must say it's progressing well as you will see in the next couple of slides. Slide number six, you see the cost reductions. We have had, so far, cost reductions of 525 million. We are ahead of schedule and we believe, based on the checks that we have done and the update of our program, that we will book a 1.3 billion cost reduction at the end of this year. The insurance is way ahead of their cost reductions. They have really taken a very strong action here mainly in the U.S. and in the bank most of the cost reductions will come in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>When you look at slide number seven, you see that the reductions in employees is also ahead of plan. So it's never nice to have to let go people but it had to be part of our cost reduction program. We are now at 8,200 people; a lot of them were sales-related type people in places like India and Latin America, that were basically agents, but they had a connection with our company here. That is the main reason for the increase.</p>
          <p>The next page, on page number eight, you see that the deleveraging of our balance sheet, that was an important item in our plan to reduce our balance sheet by 110 billion. But we have resulted &#x2013; our actions have resulted in a reduction of 164 billion clearly ahead of schedule. And it has been done partly by some netting but also mainly in the decline in loans and advances in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On page number nine, you see the, what does it mean if you look at the deleveraging on the asset leverage of the balance sheet. It's a number that has become popular during the crisis and you see a significant reduction here. We are now below 30%, and I think that's a good number to be in. If we would calculate on U.S. GAAP then the number would even be lower because then we would have, I think, more like a 26% number here. Our policy has been to be very careful in our management and that's why we had a number of hedges on our investment portfolio and shares, mainly for the insurance company. That has resulted in a significant loss of hedges but at the same time, the share position has increased, the share market has increased. And you see that reflected together with a coming in on spreads on fixed income positions that has driven a significant increase in our equity position of about 2.9 billion. So, that's where the offset is on our hedging cost.</p>
          <p>When you look at our capital ratios on page 11, all well within targets, 7.3 for core Tier 1, 9.4 for Tier 1 I think good ratios and also the others I think are good ratios. The insurance went up a little bit more because we were putting more capital in certain areas than the dividends that was streamed back up to the company. But all in all I think numbers that are solid and are good numbers</p>
          <p>Page number 12, you see divestments. We have sold a few activities so far, you see them listed here; Canada, our pension fund in Russia and Argentina, relatively small but in total they have generated 1.5 billion of our capital increase that came from the sale mainly in Canada. We are very careful with our sales program. Because so far we are seeing markets being very thin and we are not willing to sell at any price and sell assets at fire sale prices. So we have been careful and I think it has been the right strategy because we are beginning to see markets picking up a little bit and prices getting a little bit better.</p>
          <p>And our Back to Basics strategy also an example here of our insurance company in the Netherlands, who is consolidating basically three different businesses in the Netherlands with the benefit of about 100 million that will be reached over time in 2012. Another example of what is happening in our Basic to Basics program.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand it over to Patrick, who will give a detailed presentation on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. As Jan has said ING has returned to profit in the second quarter, booking a 229 million profit as compared to a 305 million loss. And I would like to take you through some of the key movements, particularly the market impact movements that have underpinned that result. The first point I would like to make is -- looking at the top of the slide, is that we've recorded an underlying result before market impacts of 2.3 billion. Now, that's a significant improvement on the preceding quarters, up 16%. So, the underlying result is up, and up strongly.</p>
          <p>Now, going through the market impacts that take that down to the underlying result, the first one we see is impairments. Now, this is primarily impairments on debt securities Alt-A and this has increased, as compared to the first quarter, in line with weakness in the U.S. housing market and a rise in delinquencies. The equity related impact of 580 million is, as Jan referred to, reflects the cost of hedging our capital as we take a prudent and careful view of managing our equity results. Here, this breaks into two key pieces and one is in respect to the U.S., indirect equity hedges of 346 million negative and that's partly offset by DAC and we will come back to that a little later. The other piece direct equity exposure 417 loss reflects the impact of hedging direct equities and is somewhat offset by gains, unrealized gains in our equity account.</p>
          <p>The next slide is real estate. In this line we see the impact of impairments, primarily on commercial real estate in the U.S. The commercial real estate market still is weak, there is limited funding. So, we are reflecting here an increase in the required yields on our commercial real estate portfolio.</p>
          <p>One point to draw out here, which I think is important; one of the key elements here is our Canadian Summit portfolio where we have a significant minority stake. And of the 686 million charge, 100 million of it is taken off in the third-party line beneath.  So, the net exposure is 100 lower at the bottom line.  The loan loss provisions are up to 852 million as compared to 770 in the preceding quarter, and Koos will later give you a more full explanation of the drivers behind that.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next page, we'll see here a breakdown of the results between the various components of the bank, Retail, ING Direct and Commercial.  Retail banking is up strongly, as you can see, there is a profit of 426 million and this is driven by the success in reducing costs, which Jan referred to a little earlier, and also lower loan loss provisions in the retail segment.  ING Direct recorded a loss, notwithstanding significant underlying cost reductions of 15%; the result was dragged down by the Alt-A impairments I referred to a little earlier.</p>
          <p>On Commercial Banking, I'd like to turn to the following slide because I think this more clearly illustrates the store income commercial banking.  Commercial banking is where ING has the majority of its real estate portfolio, and you can see on the right hand column here we have taken significant impairments and write-downs on fair value of our real estate portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we see the underlying commercial banking performance.  So, this has been a success story for ING.  We recorded a profit of 432 million in the second quarter, which is down from the 696 million in the first quarter.  The key point to make is the reason for the reduction is higher loan loss provisions but the revenues have held up very well.  Revenues are only down 6% and this follows a quite spectacular first quarter for ING and I think generally for the market.  So, revenues are holding up which is a positive here.  The other key point I'd like to draw out is the cost income ratio in this business at 37% is somewhere we would aim to continue with; a very strong result.</p>
          <p>Going forward to the next page, interest margins. Interest margins rose to 1.3%, that's up 26 basis points.  That follows a number of management actions, ING Direct and in Commercial to improve our margins and it will also benefit from the balance sheet reduction.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, it's quite a busy slide here. What it shows -- the key points to take out of this are that once the ECB rate has fallen and our particular Netherlands saving rates have not tracked down in line with ECB, they are tracking closer to the two year average swap rate which more closely reflects the value of funds.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to insurance on the following page, the picture here is of profits in all our regions.  The return to profit in Europe, Americas, and Asia Pacific and the driver is &#x2013; the commonality of drivers across this region in that cost reductions, which was referred to earlier, is coming through to the bottom line.  Another key effect that we're seeing is that the equity market up tick, particularly in the U.S., is helping us improve our fees and client balances in the U.S. In Europe we see improvements in our technical margin and in Asia this business is doing well.  And we have not suffered the volatility in our VA business in Japan that dragged down the results in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to VNB and APE, what we see here is that two things, one, there has been an improvement in VNB as compared to the first quarter across all our business lines, albeit is significantly lower than it was a year or so ago.  The impacts that I'd like to draw out here are that, you know, Asia is bearing part of the impact of our decision to exit single premium variable annuities. And the U.S., we have a combination of factors here, we are seeing the impact of a weaker customer demand, particularly for single premium products as the market is still yet to stabilize and also it reflects management actions to de-risk and de-leverage our SPVA business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to head over to Koos now who will take you through the risk presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  Good morning to you all.  Let's first start on page 23 with the loan loss provisions.  If you look at the loan loss provisions, then you see that this quarter, the net loan loss provision as a basis point for credit risk-weighted assets is 118 and the expectation is there for this year that it will stay around these elevated levels.  If we take one step back and we look over a cycle, then we always say over a cycle, we expect loan losses to be around 40, 45 basis points.  Do remember that over the last years we have run with a period of loan losses more around zero, so -- and we are running now at loan losses a little over twice the amount and we expect that to continue for the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>If we move to, where do these loan losses come from? Page 24, then you see that the contributions are from many different industries.  So there is not one thing particularly sticking out and if you have to mention something sticking out, then it would be that the leveraged finance component, the 136, that's a relatively small portfolio where we have taken some provisions on, and the other one is the U.S. own-originated mortgages, which is a relatively small portfolio where we have taken a provision on sizably, but for the rest it's a more even contribution.</p>
          <p>If we then start to move from the components of loan losses to the mortgages and we are on page 25, and on page 25 you see that actually the non-performing loans just only gradually edged up from 1.2% to 1.3%.  Now, where is that? Basically, that increase is in the U.S. where we moved from 3.7% non-performing to 4.1, and again I do like to note that if you compare that with prime ARMs which are moving to 13.7, the portfolio is reasonably holding up, but nevertheless suffering with the U.S. mortgage market.  The other thing to note on this page is, if you actually look at the largest portfolios, that is Netherlands and Germany, there you see that non-performing loans have not moved an inch.</p>
          <p>If we then zoom in on the commercial side, commercial is on page 26, you see the bank's commercial loans.  What you have there is basically the larger-sized corporate, mid-sized and SMEs as well.  What you see on this is that non-performing loans increased during this loan book and that was driven by Structured Finance and Real Estate Finance and at the same time also because the NPLs went up, the stock of provisions on this total portfolio moved up from 1.7 to 2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>If we then move to adequacy of provisioning, then we are on page 27, and on page 27 what you can see is that the cover ratio of non-performing loans is around 33% at the moment.  And in order to understand that, we have given a breakdown on the right-hand side as well, where you see the provision cover ratios.  What you see clearly there is that in the Benelux mortgages you have a relatively low cover, but that has to do with the high value of the collaterals in this portfolio and the same applies in fact to Structured Finance, Real Estate Finance and Leasing, which is a collateralized lending type of business.  So, there your provision covers are lower, and where it is higher you see that in areas for instance as other retail lending, where you have your mid-core financing which is not necessarily done on a collateralized basis and there your provisions are higher.  But all in all, the mix is that you end up with 33% of NPL provisioning and what we see already happening now, a bit, is that the provisions which you took early on in the crisis, you start to see a little bit of the releases back and that was on a few pages before.</p>
          <p>If we move from the provisions to the risk-weighted assets, what you've seen overall is that risk-weighted assets on the bank did not grow a lot and there are plusses and there are minuses.</p>
          <p>If I start with the minuses, then you see that credit risk migration still plays a role.  We had 11 billion of credit risk migration in this portfolio, and at the same time we did take management actions.  And the management actions they were basically trying to keep a balance sheet down, trying not to invest too much in bonds.  Also, the management actions taken were more specific and that is we finalized our treatment on the Alt-A portfolio and in fact there is -the good news there is that we have now come to a resolution that it is more a long treatment which is applicable to this portfolio at the same time that is at a sacrifice, and the sacrifice is that we had to take an RWA hit of 1.8 billion this quarter.  So net-net you could say, if you look at this page, that our risk-weighted assets did not go up tremendously at the same time that were &#x2013; few factors have stabilized.  But at the same time credit migration is still an ongoing issue.</p>
          <p>Then if we move to page 29, and we move to the Alt-A portfolio, let me say a few things about this.  On the one hand what you see in July, you see prices of Alt-A recovering.  So that is the market but what we do with our impairments that is more linked to the real economy.  Now the real economy in Q1 was minus 5% in the U.S. with a significant rise in unemployment.  Unemployed in March 2010 means delinquency in May 2000 and &#x2013; March 2009 means delinquent in May 2009 so your delinquencies, they have gone up from 17% to 20% and that is the driver for our impairment process.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the impairment process, then you see that 51 million of estimated credit losses have resulted, net-net plus re-impairments, in 323 million of impairments and I think we all know what the treatment there is.  Overall, so what you see is basically although market prices tend to improve right now, you still have the lagging effect of the bad quarter one which you had in the U.S.  One thing what is noteworthy is that the portfolio had quite a significant amount of pre-payments so far this year.</p>
          <p>If we then move from the Alt-A portfolio, we move to our total revaluation reserve.  The negative revaluation reserve on page 30 was minus 11.8 billion last quarter and it moved to minus 7.9 this quarter.  Now we already stated that overall pull-to-par effect has a large role in this, but this was not a pull-to-par effect. This basically has to do with credit spreads coming in significantly.  Nevertheless, what you can say is with a minus 7.9 billion reval reserve you do expect overtime that it will crystallize out so that pull-to-par effect of 1.6 billion per year is still in there.  But we benefited overall significantly from credit spreads contracting.</p>
          <p>If we then move to the equity portfolio page 31, we have direct equities and we have more indirect equity exposure.  Let's first move to direct equity so that is more in the European insurance and on the banking side.  What we have there is direct equities and results or gains are basically realized in equity. At the same time the hedges and what are hedges those are index option, the index option, put options, the hedges lost in value over the last quarter.  So you have overall unrealized gain -- an unrealized gain in equity and you have a loss in your P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>When we move to the indirect equity exposure that has more to do with the capital requirements in the U.S., local capital requirements.  There we had put hedges in place which gave us a negative result of 346 million which was partially offset by the DAC.  And if I give an overall outlook then in Europe you could say hedges should play a little bit lesser role in the future because at current market levels those put options are more out of the money so their results to increases, decreases is less at the moment.  And if you look at the U.S., in the U.S. you can see that the statutory capital requirements at a higher S&amp;P level are less volatile so therefore I need less hedges in the U.S. going forward.</p>
          <p>If we move from the equity side to our shareholders' equity at page 32, then on the net basis there you can see that we had a 15% increase in our shareholders' equity in one quarter and the components of where it came from is clearly outlined there.  And there I would like to leave it and hand over back to Jan.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Koos.  That concludes the formal part of the presentation, and I would say let us now open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir.  There will be a short pause while participants register for a question.  First question comes from Duncan Russell. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Duncan Russell from JP Morgan.  First question is on the real estate revaluation and the Summit portfolio. Just on that, my numbers I had the Summit portfolio being worth about 1.7 billion at the end of 2008 and rental income gross of about 147 million.  So the yield on that portfolio last year looked to be about 8.4%, the occupancy rate about 90%.  So just a bit surprised at the extent of the revaluation downwards there and if you'll comment on that any particular, just wondering whether you'll obtain that portfolio up for disposal?</p>
          <p>And second question was on the bank net interest margin, historically a couple of years ago ING stood at about 450 million from the yield curve and obviously over the last couple of years that has been zero.  I'm just wondering what the yield curve result is in the first half of this year and where that's going?</p>
          <p>And the third one is on the comment on the front page about the additional strategic options. That's quite an interesting comment.  And I was just wondering two things there really, why so soon after a major strategic review do you see new additional strategic options and how has that emerged?  And then secondly you've explicitly talked about an ambition to repay the Dutch State, that doesn't really make sense until your share price is above 15, so just wondering why you put that in there as well?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I think real estate, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Duncan, yeah, on some of the Canadian portfolio, as I said earlier, the yield, the market is quite a liquid and hence we're seeing an increase in yields.  We had a full external evaluation done at the end of the quarter and then as the yields are rising, we've taken approximately 200 million of the 600 odd fair value reduction in respect of Summit.  The occupancy rates are still quite strong as you say but this is in a liquid market and as absence significant volume of transactions yields are &#x2013; required yields are ticking higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah just on that obviously in the ING Real Estate Annual Report 2008 the yield was 8.4% so you've just taken the 25% revaluation downwards on that portfolio so just seems slightly strange and I'm just wondering what the motivation was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of motivation we have to value this based on external market valuations. We account for this in a fair value.  And the consequence we are &#x2013; you're driven by what's happening in the market, the market as I say is a liquid and we, and prices are depressed, commercial real estate and hence the required yields are ticking up and that's what we are seeing coming through on the valuation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'll take that one afterwards I mean it's not just ticking up it's gone up quite a lot, but we will go after that if you want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 450 million in yield curve both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I don't have the number for the yield curve result per se, but what I would like to draw out is as I mentioned earlier that the, our commercial banking results is up very strongly it's primarily up in financial markets.  The vast bulk of that is driven by client driven results. We'll come back to you on the element that's pure yield curve play but I think the key message here is that we have a strong customer driven franchise which is what's behind the strong revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The strategic question, Duncan, we as you can see we have been quite successful with ours Back to Basics program. That's basically complete. We have overshot all our targets and we are now I think in a situation that we currently review what additional options do we have which is helping us with the transformation. What we want is ultimately a company that has a strong portfolio, very focused portfolio that has strong business models underlying this portfolio with strong operating performance and with, let's say, durable type of results. And so we continue to look for ways to do so, also in mind that we do have an obligation to pay down the Dutch state. And what we would like to do based also on the invitation we have had from the European commission is put our strategic options that we have and they were going already more forward than the one that has to do with basic &#x2013; Back to Basics lately in our discussion that will follow with the European commission, and so that I think is our plan and that's why we have announced the, this unusual news today.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, good morning. It's Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank, just following on from Duncan's question, I mean you have, as you say, flagged  this in the press release that the negotiations with the, between the Dutch state and the European commission  are about to start. I mean what exactly are you sort of putting to them in terms of restructuring, have you got any concerns about how those negotiations are going to go and are you sort of entering that in a confident mood or a nervous mood?</p>
          <p>And second question, I guess is, if we look at the Tier 1 ratio in the bank which has come down a little bit in the quarter but it's still perfectly fine, but can you maybe come back to the broader question of where you see capital targets for the bank overall because obviously we used to have &#x2013; we used to have a capital target that was substantially lower than probably it needs to be these days. So you could you just sort of highlight what sort of level you want to keep that Tier 1 ratio above? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the, your first question related to the negotiation between the state and the European Commission, we have been, and we will be working closely with them to, in those discussions that will follow and I think they are scheduled to start relatively soon. What we do want to do is we do want to take the strategic analysis we have and the strategy that we have for this company in our restructuring, so that it is consistent with the objectives and the long-term objectives that we have as a company. And I think we have lined up as the Dutch  State's &#x2013; we have had very constructive discussions so that the discussions that will follow this European Commission are basically done between the Dutch State and us, and us supporting them in a significant way.</p>
          <p>They are the responsible party because they have made the state support available and they have to defend themselves to the commission. You can look at the letter that they wrote on July 22, to see a little bit more about what the commission has in mind with respect to what type of program they would like to see from us. But we are going into these discussions I think basically with our own strategy &#x2013; with our strategy going forward maybe a strategy that I think is taking the next phase and the next step, but that's where we were anyhow because of the success we have had in our Back to Basics strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I assume the next phase, as you call it, still envisages ING being a combined banking and insurance group is that fair to assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will see. I think we, I think it's too early to make any comments at this point in time as to what the result will be. I would say this is something that all the financial institutions that have had supports are going through and I think we will have to do exactly the same. And I cannot &#x2013; I cannot be specific at this point because I don't know. The outcome is uncertain what that will be. But from our standpoint, we want to make it consistent with the strategy that we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Chris Hitchings here from KBW. Just really looking again on the strategic issue, are we to assume that the timetable envisaged in the original Dutch State notes plan, i.e., three years is now just hopelessly optimistic and that you're going to need to have sorted this out long before then. And again, when you talk about strategic options, does that involve capital option; does that include capital options as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going into these discussions. I think all we have done is notify you that these discussions are coming up. We need to be very careful because we are not in a position now to preempt any discussions that are going on. But I can tell you this, as far as I'm concerned we will look very carefully in executing our strategy in the sense that we have a very interesting viable company with solid sets of businesses and a portfolio, focused portfolio businesses and strong underlying business models and strong operating performance.  And I think that's the objective that we have to discuss with the commission.</p>

          <p>And next questions come from Farooq Hanif. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. It's Farooq from Morgan Stanley speaking. Slightly different tack, just looking to your loan losses in retail: that just looks much more positive and wholesale obviously has been worse. Can you just talk about whether this is a trend that you're seeing going forward, that really actually your &#x2013; your retail bank might have a slightly more stable outlook now, but in wholesale you still have some clearing up to do. Be good to get a comment on that? And secondly, could you talk about what exactly is the reason for the releases being up, is that just some inherited conservatism back in 4Q and 1Q, which is now &#x2013; which has now proved to be not as bad? That sort of question area number one.</p>
          <p>Question area number two is on your capital position. We used to get this economic capital measure which was one way of us looking at you on a group basis plus or minus the diversification benefit. Can you just talk about either quantitatively or qualitatively what's happened in 2Q on that basis, I mean have you seen the markets improving and yield going up, has that been net positive or I mean, could you talk about on an economic capital basis where you think your surplus is on a group basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Farooq let me start with if I look at the developments on the loan losses, then indeed what you see retail declining and wholesale going up. If you ask me what is it precisely? Actually, we even had the picking up and releases and that comes from the retail from the private banking section. The statement I made with that is that what we have in our loan loss provisioning is a policy to provision. And what you do in terms, or when you see a signal that you have to take a loss, you take a decent provision and normally once a crisis or once a loan is restructured then you end up releasing some of the provisions taken because the restructuring was more positive.</p>
          <p>And this is just not a signal that from now on, that releases are going to dramatically increase, but it is more a signal that, the way how we provision is normally a conservative way of doing it. So files released at the beginning of the crisis starts to give you some benefits at this moment. If you look at retail and wholesale, in the retail side in general you see a decline, and that is in the private banking area happening. If you look at the wholesale side you'll see the pick-up, but the pick-up was in specific cases. It was in the leverage and the structured finance business where we had this. Expectations, although it is difficult to give an expectation because we have such a mixed bag of loan loss provisions it's comes a little bit out of everything and overall we feel, more comfortable, with saying like it will stay at these elevated levels for the next two quarters.</p>
          <p>But if you ask me the detailed components of each of them individually it's a difficult one to make. You do see a bit of a stabilization of your watch list &#x2013; so the problem files &#x2013; going in. So that is a more early positive kind of green shoot in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean would I be right in saying that you just sound a little bit more positive now than you did three months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually, three months ago, we already said like we expect loan losses not one dramatic peak or so, but it's a bit more elevated over the full year and you basically get a confirmation of that this quarter. So in that sense, I am happy with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on economic capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at the economic capital overall what you see happening is that your credit spread component of economic capital, yeah, that will move up, because I mean, the market is a bit more risky. At the same time, if I look at the insurance side with interest rates picking up long-term you see debt component gradually taking &#x2013; debt risk comes down a little bit.  At the same time, also you see that with volatilities going down in the market so you do expect overall that your economic capital numbers, yes, it starts to have a mitigating effect. So net-net credit up, interest rates down implies volatility down and equity risk a little bit down as well. So overall in that sense on a net-net basis, a shift of components.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you care about that number when it comes to making a decision about repaying at that stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; do I care? I do because I mean, if I only look at regulatory capital numbers there are certain deficiencies in there. And the deficiencies on regulatory capital numbers have to do with interest rate risk or does it price options well? So you do need to keep a second eye on your economic capital numbers as well, although I do realize at this moment that the regulatory capital numbers are a more constraining factor at this moment.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Hans Pluijgers. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, this is Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux in Amsterdam. I've got three questions, first of all, on rate migration your Q1 numbers, you indicated that for the remainder of the year you would expected some number in line with Q1 but already in Q2 we've seen quite a significant impact. What's your forecast or your indication for the second half of this year with respect to rate migration, what you see there?</p>
          <p>Looking at the direct equity hedges what's your policy going forward with now improving equity markets, do you &#x2013; will  you change your policies, or will you reduce your hedging, could you say something about that? And on the Alt-A, you've moved it now to the loan book as I understand and does it have impact on the impairment policy of the Alt-A portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start on the migration side, we had in Q1 and Q2 we had 11 billion. We had an offsetting factor in Q1 and we have managed it more down in Q2. Overall, do you expect credit migration to still have an influence, the answer is yes. There is two drivers, one is house prices, and maybe house prices at the moment are a bit more stabilizing, but the second one is the rating of your clients. And the rating of your clients is still once you review files and that is what you do every year, you know rating will still have an impact. So, you do still expect modestly to have some RWA migration. I mean that is the system of Basel II. But at the same time I think what you see in this quarter is that we take compensating measures to make sure that the overall effect is manageable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you expect that to then, because housing prices a little bit stabilizing, unemployment rates in the U.S. not going up as fast any more do you expect some stabilization there or are the numbers coming down somewhat with respect to negative impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think coming down would be a tough one at this moment at the same time you do see that clearly with house prices if it's stabilizing that has a good effect on us so then you expect less increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now if I go to the equity hedges, what is our policy? So if you talk about direct equities, we had last year &#x2013; we had the issue that, the balance sheets were weaker, we had at the same time we had an highly uncertain market so therefore out of conservatism at that time we bought puts underlying the direct equity exposure. What you've seen happening is two improvements, you see our capital situation improving, you see it both in direct equity, you see it back in our leverage ratio coming below 30. So on many occasions you see that the equity position is improving, so that means on one hand a positive factor that you don't need to hedge everything automatically.</p>
          <p>At the same time what you've also seen is in the first quarter you saw those put options they had a value which gave us a positive derivative result and in the second quarter is offset by a negative so you could say that underlying those put options they are now more out of the money. The question is will I continue to have those put options, well, we'll look at that individually but there is some more margin at this moment in the company to take some more equity risk because the capital position has a bit improved. So clearly we will look at that but at the same time local capital sensitivity for us is important.</p>
          <p>Let me turn for the third question, the impairments and the accounting methodology to my colleague, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Alt-A, the balance at the end of &#x2013; the accounting at the end of the second quarter is the same as the first. The Alt-A is still is accounted for as available for sale; that hasn't changed. The risk transaction with the Dutch state was completed in the middle of the first quarter. So in terms of Alt-A accounting, balance sheet classification, and the impairment process, we've not changed that. That's been applied consistently between the end of Q1 and the end of Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Frank Stoffel. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, it's Frank Stoffel from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and just three quick questions please. And, on your core Tier 1 ratio 7.3% and could you please elaborate on this number whether you are happy with it, and particular against the background of your expectation of continued and rising risk weighted assets and your comment that the credit migration will continue in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>Also on loan of provisions, I remember correctly at your recent Investor Day, comments suggested that the loan of provisions might actually peak in 2010 and not in 2009. And from your pervious comments, can we infer that you now expect the peak &#x2013; we actually see the peak this year and we &#x2013; next year could already see a decline in the loan loss provisions? And on a minor point, obviously the press is full of speculation on you selling your private bank operations in Asia and Switzerland. Could you just comment or confirm that your Luxembourg operations are considered core? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last question first, we're not commenting on rumors. I don't think that, that is a practice that is worthwhile. We are not commenting on anything that has been said about us. We have seen it as well, but we have no comment. If we have any comments it is because we have done things and not because people say that we are looking at certain things. Let me now turn to Koos on the core Tier 1. Koos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first question on the loan losses and then hand over to Patrick on that one, because first on the loan losses what we've said during the Investor Day was particularly concerning the retail mortgages portfolio, because let me first refer to that with retail mortgages in the Netherlands. The driver is unemployment and people need to be unemployed for a time before you start to see that back with delinquencies and then it starts to hit provisions.</p>
          <p>So, the illustration is that parts of your loan portfolio have different times when they start to realizing your provisioning. My expectation is more that in 2009, we still have these high level of loan loss provisions. In 2010 you might get more on the retail mortgages, but at the same time your releases from your provisions, which you have taken in 2009 will start to come out there. So if you ask me like, do you go back completely, but this is long-term to normalized levels of 40, 45 basis point, the expectation is no, but at the same time no, I don't expect a clear peak in 2010. It's more elevated levels in '09 and then in '010 you'll get some releases, but you'll get some more out of the retail portfolio potentially.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the core Tier 1, our core Tier 1 ratio at 7.3 is down a little bit from the 7.5 at the end of the first quarter. Yes, of course we are comfortable with that number and what's dragging it down a bit is credit rating migration but one of the key, as we said before, there are things we can do to try and mitigate that and one of the key pieces which have been driving rating migration namely on Alt-A, the regulatory treatment on that means that we will no longer any further credit rating migration in respect to that part of the portfolio and we're looking at other areas where rating migration might occur and then investigating how we can try and address dealing with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>And next question comes from Jaap Meijer. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Jaap Meijer, Evolution.  There is a possibility to reclassify assets that are in AFS category by the end of each year at amortized costs of fair value, which should be actively using this and I think actually already done some calculation on this and could this lead to a strong recovery of AFS reserves relating to your bond investments? There's more questions to follow-up, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the majority of that reclassification we did in the first quarter, the limited amount to further that can be done and I think that's -- we've done as much or the majority of what we will do in that space was done in the first quarter.  So I don't see that will be a &#x2013; this has got a big potential to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But by year end that you could actually abolish completely the AFS category for all bond investments and you could value it at amortized cost after proper impairments or taking it at full fair value? So that could actually be unlocking some of the negative revaluation reserves I guess. Don't agree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're referring to the exposure draft on IAS 39?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I mean we're clearly we're looking at that.  It's quite early days to assess it.  We are trying to study what it does mean for our Alt-A portfolio, and clearly it's an interesting move.  We have to understand this more thoroughly and engage with our peers as well to get a more complete view of what this means for us.  So, it's a bit early to conclude on whether this is going to give a material result for ING, or indeed whether we would adopt it early or not.  But I think the fact that this is coming out as a positive move and as we study it further and get market consensus emerges and what this means for the banking industry, we will update you.  But at this point, it's just too early to be conclusive on what it may mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  What's likely surprised...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>the exposure draft and the full standard actually doesn't come till fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, that's right.  I was slightly surprised to see such high markdowns in real estate portfolio because global markets &#x2013; well the funds have actually recuperated all losses in Q1.  So, is this your take of, this is it, or could we see more negative reevaluations on real estate in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the commercial real estate market is still subdued.  I think there's been some comments that the Fed are concerned about this globally.  So, this is &#x2013; this market is still subdued and equity markets may have risen, but this hasn't filtered through to commercial real estate at this point.  In respect of our Summit portfolio, where we took the majority of the fair value reduction, this is a Canadian portfolio.  It's close to the Detroit region and has suffered somewhat from the auto industry problems.  And, so and I think this is going to be an area where it will take some time before we see a rebound in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And with just some questions about the transaction on the liquid asset protection scheme, you value -- the Dutch State values the Alt-A portfolio at 90%, there're some disputes I think within the E.U. Commission about this and also the management fees being disputed.  Is there any risk that this may be changed, let's say, you have to revalue it from 90 to 80% of par?  And technically how would this affect risk-weighted assets, would you then have to increase the 240% risk-weighted assets waiting for this, or would this not hurt your Tier 1 at all?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>Okay, if you look at the illiquid asset backup facility, indeed we concluded that transaction in the first quarter. It's up for review with the European Community, but what was explicitly mentioned at the time is that the heart of the transaction and that is the swap, so that is the exchange of the bonds for the funding, that part would not be touched.  Still, it is still under review with the European Community.  So, there could be changes on for instance the subsequent cash flows of management fees or guarantee fees, but I don't know that.  I mean that outcome is unclear.  If you look at the treatment of the Alt-A portfolio, the big effect is not so much on this 240%. I think this discussion with the European Community is more on all the review of the individual pricings and they want to look at that rather than the swap itself.  So, I would say we're talking about an unwind of debt or something like that, that does not make any sense at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, that's clear, but I was just wondering that maybe if you would agree upon a lower evaluation of the Alt-A portfolio, which is bit closer to the market value it's around 60% I think.  Of course that would hit your AFS reserves and of course this then technically also hits your Tier 1, I'm wondering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so, because as I said the exchange of the Alt-A versus the funding that was something what was agreed not to disagree on anymore.  So, why would then a lower price have any impact or a higher price, that does not play a big role there. And by the way, I continue to say that the 90 is not a good comparison against the market price.  Because there is a net present value of subsequent cash flows which makes that 90 is not a good price to look at it because we will continue to pay over time.  By the way, what you do see is that our prepayments are increasing significantly and that is something which is favorable for us.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  It's James Garner from HSBC.  Most of my questions have been answered, just one quick question remaining.  Can you provide an update on the adequacy of your standalone U.S. annuity and Japanese life reserves, which I believe were below 50% confidence level at the year-end?  I think the U.S. then was inadequate by about &#x20AC;0.6 billion?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I take that it's &#x2013; James, it'sTom McInerney.  I think overall for the U.S. we are -- or for the Americas, we're adequate at the 50% and 90%.  In the Annuity business itself, there has been an improvement at the 50%. I think in the 90 percentile we're still around where we were, but overall looking at the Americas, which is the ultimate test, we're adequate overall.</p>

          <p>Next question is coming from Nick Holmes.  Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, this is Nick Holmes at Nomura.  First question on U.S. life. Could you tell us from when the 5 billion equity hedge will run off and if you're still intending, Tom, to change your debt accounting from mark-to-market to mean reversion?  And then second question just looking at your bank bad debts, your provisional cover ratio has started to rise. It's up to 33% from 29%.  Do you think this trend will continue, and do you think the level of 40 to 50% which you had a few years ago, is something that you will return to over the medium term?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Nick let me take, this is Tom again, let me take the first two questions.  We put the -- what we call the capital hedge on, and it's &#x20AC;5 billion as of the end of the second quarter.  We put it on to protect RBC Capital or statutory capital. We, at the end of the first quarter given where markets had gone, we're actually below our long-term target of 325 as a result of the improvements in the markets.  We expect we're still finishing up the final calculations.  We expect the RBC ratio to be somewhere between 370 and 380.  So, obviously that takes pressure off the statutory capital and as a result we're still working and working with Koos and Patrick on what should we do to realign, but I think you should expect that it's likely, given where markets are, that we will in the additional room we have on statutory capital, look to take those down somewhat. Although, clearly you never know where the markets are going, we want to be more conservative from a de-risking perspective, so I think we will be cautious on that, but I think you'd expect it to be down.</p>
          <p>We continue to look at the mean reversion.  As you know, most of our competitors do assume a mean reversion, so on average they are probably assuming the equity markets recover, 15% for the next five years and then go to long-term assumptions which is nine.  We look at that, there are pluses and minuses to do that.  I think at this point, it's still under consideration and we haven't made an explicit decision to change it from where we are today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because I think at the last conference call you were thinking more decisively about moving to mean reversion, so it sounds that you're moving away from that, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I would say it's still under consideration and we just haven't decided because there are pluses and minuses to it.  So, at this point, we haven't made a change, it's still under review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the provision coverage ratio, does the trend continue from 29 to 33, I mean again to answer it, you have to look at the components and the components of the provisioning is a mixed bag or something of more collateralized provision.  So, on either real estate or on leasing or on structured finance, or it is a more uncollateralized business and then you talk about SME, that is really driving it.  So 29 to 33 is more coincidental like which part of the portfolio did it.  If you want the big picture and that is, do we go back to the 40 to 50% provision cover ratios, there I have to answer that our loan portfolio has significant changes as compared to previous cycles.</p>
          <p>I mean that what are the significant changes? There is way more mortgages in there.  And if you look at the non-mortgaged part, there the collateralized type of lending is way higher than it was in the past, which is the real estate finance, the lease and the more structured finance business.  So, I think it is difficult to draw that conclusion because of the different components of the portfolio.</p>

          <p>Hello, this is Jackie Ineke in Fixed Income Research at Morgan Stanley.  And I just have a quick question on liability management.  We've seen many groups improving their core Tier 1 by buying back Tier 1 debt securities well below par.  The ING is trading in the 50s.  So buyback of your Tier 1s could make a lot of sense.  I was just wondering if this has been considered yet, or if there's any regulatory objections to such an operation?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Benoit P&#xE9;trarque from Kepler in Amsterdam.  Three short questions, first one on the &#x2013; on one of your core business which is retail in Netherlands, you commented that the saving market was still pretty competitive in Q2.  What do you see, or what do you expect, for the next quarter? <mark type="inaudible" /> we will see improvement but what do you see?</p>
          <p>Second question on the real estate, you had 110 million impairments on the project developments. Can you remember what is your overall exposure on project financing?  And last question on the equity hedge around the U.S. Life.  Predicting that it will make sense to keep this hedge until you have &#x2013; so long you have not repaid the State, but do you have agreement with the Dutch State relating to this equity hedge on the U.S. capital?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me deal with the latter question.  With respect to the Dutch governments, they are not interfering in anyway with our business or with our policies.  They are ours, they are -- we may inform them from time to time how things are going, but we have never had any instructions from them.  Nor, I don't think, are they planning to give us any instructions.  The retail business, Koos, you want to do that or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the real estate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you take the real estate.  Now let me take the retail business.  In the Netherlands, we are seeing that the market is quite competitive and has been because the European market, when you look at the Netherlands and Belgium, it's one of the most competitive markets you can be in. We have seen that savings rates have come down, but only slowly and of course it's very important to us that rates would be coming down because our margins of real estate and our margins of retail basically have not improved in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And on the project development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Koos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  If you look at our project development, there what you see is some impairments have been taken and what you see in our project development is that it's on total, it's a portfolio where we have an exposure of development projects of 2.7 billion and then you will have some properties which we are &#x2013; which we will, at a certain moment, sell so they are finalized.  So 2.7 billion is the total project and 0.5 is things which are finalized and completed projects.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the debt portfolio overall, it is a division between offices, retail, residential and industrial and that has &#x2013; but predominantly it is the retail that's the biggest factor and offices and residential are second.  Also if you look at it in terms of the geographical distribution, then you can say like the biggest one by far is the Netherlands, so taking up 40% of it, so that's in a nutshell what our development exposure is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The impairment is coming from the Netherlands or other countries?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the 110, the piece in the Netherlands is quite small, it's approximately 10% of that total you have in the Netherlands. Spain was a similar number, it's &#x2013; 12, 15% of the overall was in Spain.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Ryan Palacek from Kempen &amp; Co. I have a question concerning the change of treatment on the Alt-A portfolio, where it's now treated as a loan portfolio for solvency purposes. I'm wondering who, whose approval was needed for that step and whose approval might that still be subject to and to what extent is that subject to approval from Brussels?  I'm wondering what the impact would have been on your solvency ratios if that had not been changed.  And finally I'm wondering what the current rating distribution is of the Alt-A portfolio?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the treatment of our Alt-A portfolio, well first is, effectively a large part of the Alt-A portfolio has been sold.  So the part remaining on our balance sheet, that is where we are talking about the treatment. What has been decided there is that we have a look-through treatment.  So it is not a capital relief, because in fact our capital increased over this quarter due to debt, but it is done on a basis that you look at the underlyings rather than at the securitization rules.</p>
          <p>And that is also because the economic ownership of Alt-A, again we have 80% is sold effectively to the State and 20% is ours, but as you remember that is of each individual bond and that is why you have a specific treatment negotiated here.  And that is something which is not subject to the E.U. because the E.U. is not a regulator and the E.U. is something different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible to say who, whose permission was needed for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course, I mean, we talk about regulatory capital.  We talk about that with our own regulator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what was your other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then furthermore I was wondering what would have been the impact on solvency ratios had that treatment not been changed.  I was wondering what the current rating  distribution is of the Alt-A portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact our capital would have gone up &#x2013; or sorry, our risk-weighted assets would have gone up.  So, the treatment in this quarter in that sense is not favorable for us, because it led to 1.8 billion additional risk-weighted assets.  That's how you could say it is a bit higher than what it was as compared to the old treatment, but it is stabilized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And as to the rating distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the rating distribution of our Alt-A portfolio, then it is overall, there is 59% of it is still at AAA level of the U.S. Alt-A portfolio and we have AA 5.5 and then you have different components.  I think the one with the lower rating is BB at 6% and single B at 12%.  So those are the higher ones standing out.  But overall, still 60% around is AAA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  Is there anything you can say about the slew of downgrades on this paper that occurred early July?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that the amount of downgrades in &#x2013; well actually I only know it over the second quarter, because first quarter we saw a massive amount of downgrades and in the second quarter rating migration was a lot less.  But at the same time, because it's 1.2 billion only in the second quarter were downgraded, and at the same time the watch list that still remains high.  And so the watch list is approximately the same.  The amount of downgrades decreased significantly as compared to the first quarter.  So, that's, in a nutshell, the development.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody, it's Marcus Rivaldi here from Morgan Stanley, Fixed Income.  Just a quick question &#x2013; couple of questions actually regarding dividend flows into the insurance operations. You talk about payments out of insurance operations in Europe and Asia and then talk about dividends going back into subsidiary operations during the course of the quarter outweighing those.  Could you talk about whether that's a timing effect? Effectively money is coming out of some subs and going back into the same subs, or is it money coming out of some subsidiary operations and going into other subsidiary operations?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of dividends, we've had the total of upstreaming of 800. Our policy is to maximize alignment, most companies maximize dividends upstreaming to the center, where we manage capital.  And to the extent that there are subsidiaries who do require additional regulatory capital and we will look to meet that.  So, I mean the dividends of 800 is a broad range. It comes from a variety of our subsidiaries, I guess, one being perhaps in the Netherlands and that's supports -- standard practice in supporting our capital management process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I appreciate that. Sorry, it's just that you break it down in broad themes. You talk about Asia and Europe and dividend being up.  But then later on, on the capital management section, you talk about 1.4 billion going back into operating subsidiaries and I was just wondering, is that mainly directed at the U.S. or is it back into some of those...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that 1.4 was primarily in the U.S. at the very beginning of the quarter.  And the dividend upstreams come from a broad range of businesses across ING.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And was that to take that RBC ratio up to that 370, 380% level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think Marcus we, as I said, we were about, we were a little under 280 at the beginning of the first quarter, so we put the dividends in to get back to the standard of 325. And then, of course, the second quarter overall with the equity markets going up, it created more of a cushion, so we are now, at the end of June, at 370 to 380.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody, William Elderkin from Citi.  Three questions please, first of all, can you give us an update of what the commercial results on what you identified as the ongoing operations with your strategic presentation either this year would be over the first half stage, so I'm really looking for the equivalent numbers you gave for the bank ongoing of 4.6 billion, I think, over '08 and for the insurance of 2.1 billion over '08. What were those numbers over the first half? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two is the increase in cost saving reductions to 1.3 billion or by 300 million, how is that distributed, as an increase distributed between the bank and the insurance companies?  And thirdly, on the ING Direct net interest income in the second quarter, inside that number I assume there is a charge for the Alt-A service with the Dutch Government, can you just tell us what that number or that charge was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the first question, I don't think we can answer William at this point in time because we need to go back and recalculate that, it takes a little bit of time, we don't have that here available at this point in time.  But I would think that the number would still stand as we have given that, and certainly with the impact of the Back to Basics program, I would think that the numbers probably would look a little bit better.  But we need to re-calibrate that and if you don't mind we'll do that but not today at the meeting, is that okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a general sense then, as excluding the expense reductions you've achieved this year, are those '08 core commercial numbers still a reasonable reference point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're still reasonable but my impression would be that if I had to make an adjustment, they would be to the upside.  The other question, the 1.3 billion Patrick, you want to give some comments on the cost reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We announced in the first quarter that we were seeking to reduce cost as part of our Back to Basics strategy, and we're pleased to announce that we are going to raise the bar in that from 1 billion to 1.3 billion. That reflects the progress we've made.  We're ahead of target and ahead of plan at this point in reducing head count.  And we see there's a further scope to reduce costs in the administrative expenses and procured costs.  So we're going to push to outperform the 1 billion and try and another 300 million.  We'll add 300 million of cost savings this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, what I was getting at was, I think, of 1 billion, original 1.650 billion was in the bank balance in the insurance company, of the additional 300 where will that fall between the two business areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the split would be more or less the same, probably it was more on the banking side because we are looking at, in particular, purchasing and IT and I think the highest expense opportunity is there on the banking side.  Alt-A, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Alt-A, if you look at the charges the expectation and why do I say expectation? The expectation was that it is $600, approximately &#x20AC;400, on an annual basis in the first year.  Now the charges will realize be a little bit lower because, as I stated in my presentation, prepayments are a bit higher than what we expected.  But -- so you could say it is in Euro terms and it's approximately 100 million per quarter, but leveling off if the portfolio goes down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's just within the ING Direct's net interest income we see in the second quarter, can I assume about &#x20AC;25 million is netted against that in relation to the Alt-A facility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's 100%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">

          <p>Next question comes from Farquhar Murray.  Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, it's <mark type="inaudible" /> from Fox-Pitt here, just two questions if I may.  Just on -- starting with the Alt-A transaction, at the time that that was put on I remember you capitalized the management fees.  And I presume that was taken to Tier 1 capital.  So, I'm just trying to understand if the &#x2013; you ultimately renegotiated those management fees down, would that have a capitalized negative impact on Tier 1 capital?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just turning to the interest margins in the Netherlands, I think earlier in the year the Dutch organization had kind of suggested those should begin to improve towards the end of this year. Just given the suggestions about gradual, continued competition I'm just wondering whether you would repeat those statements now or does it look like competition's actually being tougher for longer? And also what's driving that, is it the competitors or is it kind of term structure of deposits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; maybe talk about the Alt-A facility which we have concluded. What happened with our capital position there, we effectively sold a part of the portfolio in February. The sale concluded in an uplift of our re-valuation reserve that was negative, so that is the part which we have in our -- back in our equity not in our Tier 1 but in our equity. But management fees, there's no capitalization of management fees or anything happening there. Had the transaction was constructed and reflected in our accounts as a sale. And the management fees is more something which we are just paying on an annualized basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, if those got managed downwards it would have deferred impact on Tier 1 capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the end, if you're in interest margin or if your margins improved then you will see that back in your Tier 1 capital. Because then, you know, if everything else stayed the same then you will have more revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of Group interest margins in the Netherlands, there is a declining trend. It is a very competitive market. But rates are being lowered twice in the quarter by a total 50 basis points and I think there was a further reduction in July. So, all banks now have lowered their rates which were unsustainable but in part due to the crisis at the beginning of the year. So, we're seeing rates coming back down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony Silverman, Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. You've given the total exposure to real estate development. I was wondering if you could give us a figure, or maybe I missed this, total exposure to investment property <mark type="inaudible" /> investing in property rather than just development. I'm sort of assuming that the impairments are not just from the development exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if you look at the total portfolio then we have to look at real estate. The investment properties, there we have on a total basis, we have investment properties four billion of basically roughly banking investment properties and that is basically SIP capital in funds and some bridge capitals and it is 4.5 billion on the insurance side. So that is really the investment exposure. And those ones, they don't have any impairments because actually these ones are mark-to-market directly in our P&amp;L. So, Patrick if you want to comment on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of the total number I mentioned in respect of the real estate of 686, the development projects which is impairment is 110 and the real estate portfolio which is fair valued is the remainder 584.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Johnny Vo [Goldman Sachs]. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi it's Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs, just a couple of quick questions.  Just in terms of the margins in banking, obviously, they've improved quite substantially. I mean can you talk about these margins and how sustainable these margins are? And secondly, can you talk about also some of the contribution coming from trading and how much of the contribution is coming from trading? In terms of &#x2013; can you give more color in terms of the leverage portfolio and where these losses are going? And the third thing is just basically for direct real estate exposure, I am just a little bit confused, is there, is there sort of a one-off in some of this in terms of either the Summit Canadian portfolio or indeed the yield move, can you comment on those? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of margins and banking, what we're seeing is that we're seeing a widening of margins, particularly in our commercial banking business where we have a strong market presence in the Benelux and they have widened and at the moment they continue to widen and ING has benefited as being the name to go to in this region. So, this is strong and it's very favorable market conditions. How long will it pertain for, probably not forever, but it's still there. And as I said the revenues have held up well, only dropping 6% as compared to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of trading, your question on trading Johnny, the result is driven 90% plus by client revenues. So, prop trading is a tiny part, is not what we really do. So, 90% of our result was client-driven business and we're not a prop trading house. And in respect of Summit, what I can tell you is that this portfolio was externally valued, it is a commercial real estate portfolio near the U.S. border, near Detroit. This is a depressed market and there's not a lot of liquidity and there's not a lot of transactions and the capitalization rates are going up. And so, this reflects what is a somewhat weak economic environment.</p>
          <p>These properties are &#x2013; we do value them externally, we use professional external valuers to give us a value and but this valuation process is not &#x2013; is difficult because as I say, there aren't that many external valuations to pursue albeit, say we do use external valuers to do it for us. So, that's what the position is in respect of Summit.</p>
          <p>The other point to make, the other points to make on that is whilst 250 is a headline number remember that 100 million of that comes off the bottom line in minority interests and the other, another point in respect to Summit is the majority 88% of the &#x2013; our Summit portfolio is properties that are income earning, they're built, they're out there, they're occupied, occupancy rates are still high, comfortably above 90% and reasonably stable. So, what you're dealing with here is buildings that are in use, earnings rents and yielding, but we have to account for the amount on a fair value basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the thin market the fair values are falling. The underlying economics of the portfolio are still reasonably solid with high occupancy rates and are very high; and a high proportion of the Summit portfolio as I say is the occupied yielding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May be Johnny, on the leverage finance portfolio to give you some flavor. I mean in 2007, we basically stopped being a large underwriter in leverage finances, so we have a total portfolio of something like in the order of 7.7 billion. Now, the biggest part of that portfolio are small tickets of residuals which we had after we basically distributed the large tickets. At the same time there is a small component of the 7.7 billion, where the last underwriting deals, where we didn't sell the major pieces. And it's exactly on those ones where we have taken this quarter, where we have taken some provisions. And so in a nutshell if you want to have the highlights the biggest component of that portfolio is small tickets and that is the final left over which we wanted to own. And the ones where we've taken the provisions are the last ones when we stopped this business where we couldn't distribute anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Next question comes from Michael van Wegen [Societe Generale]. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Mike van Wegen. First, I guess, going back to that leverage finance book. To what extend are you comfortable that in Q1 and Q2 you've now made enough provisions or should we expect more on that book on the big tickets to follow in H2? And then two other questions, going to the U.S. on your RBC ratio to 285 for Q1, I thought that it already included the capital injection of $1.2 billion made in April. So if that is the case, there has hardly been any capital injection on top of that which means that there would be almost a 100% improvement in your RBC ratio in Q2 which I presume to a large extend is the variable annuity guarantees. But could you indicate how much SPA guarantee and what are the other drivers there? And final question on the timing of your disposals, I understand you can't mention names but maybe could you give some sort of feel of given that in April you said it would take three years given that maybe visibility on the market is slightly improving. Do you still think it will take three years or could some of the things happen earlier? And could you maybe talk us through what steps you are in general on the things that you've classified as up for disposal? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the leverage finance part, unfortunately that's a difficult to answer question like will it continue like this because indeed there is only a few larger files in there where we have taken a provision. But then you really have to look individually at these companies, are they holding up their sales or so? Because we are almost there drilled down at an individual issuer level. So there is no overall statistic on a portfolio meaningful for this because as again what I said, there is two or three larger files in that portfolio where we have taken a provision and it depends on this individual company. So there is not a lot more what I can say. I mean the only thing what I know is that what we provision now as always adequate for what we know now and if an economy improves then it will be proven enough and if an economy deteriorates for these companies, you have to take another one. So more I can't say on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the RBC ratio so we were below 280 I believe and we put capital in, at the beginning of the quarter. I think they got us to up to a little over 300. For the quarter again the statutory earnings based on salutatory accounting are a lot different than IFRS and U.S. GAAP. And we had approximately 700 million of statutory earnings most of that was recovery in the equity markets and so most of that would come from the VA business given where the benefits are. There were some of that would also be in the retirement service business. So is really after the capital got us to over 300 and then the recovery in the markets and the positive impact that that had on statutory earnings is 700 million got us to the where we, we're still finishing the numbers but we think we'll end up between 370 and 380. And our target is 325.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to the disposal program, Mike, we continue to have an active program. And we are in a number of discussions but as I've said earlier, we cannot comment on discussions because we can only comment on things we have done and we will do so going forward. I can confirm and reconfirm that it will take some time but within three years I think it's possible to do what we have outlined to do.</p>

          <p>The last questions come from Thomas Nagtegaal. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Thomas Nagtegaal from RBS. I've got a couple of additional questions on your NPL coverage ratio. Could you talk a little bit on your assumptions with regards to developments of your collateral going forward and behind those lines? Do you believe your assumptions are conservative in light of the market developments and outlook? And how sensitive are some of your collateral assumptions? For example, the collateral for structured finance lending in light of the market developments. For me it seems a bit <mark type="inaudible" /> that you showed large write downs on your direct real estate exposure for example while your NPL coverage ratio, on the real estate lending remains stable in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Basically, if you start to what are the assumptions for evaluating collateral and what's driving that, the first thing is well, given by the fact that our loan portfolio comprises for half of mortgages that means like house prices are of course a big driver. I mean all the other components, if I look at structured finance and other things while you are basically financing different asset bases but clearly by the sheer size house prices have the biggest component. If you ask me like what am I assuming there, will it go up or down, I mean I don't know. I mean we are just reevaluating this on a quarterly basis with house price indexes and that has some impact on how that looks like. The question, are we conservative. I mean conservatism is a difficult thing to precisely state. The only think what I do know is that till so far we have an unchanged provisioning policy and the only think what we do is when we take a provision till so far that had always led in a later phase to releases. So, you don't want to be overly conservative because well, apart from the fact that you can't but you don't want to be overly conservative. Because you also want to have the restructuring people work hard to recover a lot. But at the same time if you ask me like, are we aggressive on this, no I mean you know we are just doing it precisely as what we always did.</p>
          <p>If you look at the area of real estate finance, does it mean that a decline in the real estate automatically lead to something in my portfolio. And should lower collateral values on the real estate finance have occurred, the few things which are drivers there is one, the decline if I look at real estate for instance what Patrick already alluded to is for instance Summit. And you know I am not financing Summit nor a lot of Canadian assets, so geographical component plays a role. The second part which plays a big role is that if you do real estate finance. And in general if you look at our portfolio I think it has a loan-to-value of something like 69% or something like it. There is a buffer as well. So you cannot 141 deduct a 1% decline in the real estate value underlying collateral in a 1% more coverage ratio. That doesn't work like that.</p>
