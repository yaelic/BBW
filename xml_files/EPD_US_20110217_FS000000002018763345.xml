          <p>Good morning. My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners Q4 2010 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners joint conference call to discuss fourth quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's general partner; followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and then Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO of the general partner of Enterprise and President and CEO of general partner of Duncan Energy Partners will follow Jim. Also in attendance are other members of our senior management team.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management of both Enterprise and Duncan. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the Securities Exchange Commission for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start off by providing an update on our Mont Belvieu facility since the incident in our west storage facility on February the 8th. Operationally, since last week we have focused on returning our Mont Belvieu facilities to as close to the same capabilities as we had prior to the event. None of our gas processing plants were curtailed as a result of the event, and we have diverted Y-grade to our fractionators and to third-party fractionators. None of our propylene assets were affected, and our butane isomerization plants continue to run.</p>
          <p>Our export facility continues to perform, although we did have to short-load two ships. Our MTBV facility was in a planned turnaround, but it's coming back up now and should be at full rates by Saturday. We've been operating our Mont Belvieu fractionators at reduced rates while making the necessary piping changes to avoid the west storage area. We're changing our storage configuration to enable us to recover our receipt and delivery capabilities by using our north and east storage facilities. Three of our Mont Belvieu fractionators are running now, and we expect to have the fourth fractionator up tonight, and to have the Mont Belvieu fractionators running at full rates by tomorrow.</p>
          <p>We also expect to have full connectivity between our north storage area, where our fractionators and other plants are located, and our east storage area by the middle of next week. And this will enhance our ability to resume service to our customers.</p>
          <p>We've also been working with individual customers to make piping modifications to restore their delivery and receipt capabilities. Our Y-grade receipt capabilities are 100% of the pre-event level, and we believe our delivery capabilities out of our wells will ultimately be at 85% to over 100% of pre-event levels depending on the product.</p>
          <p>West storage represent less than 16% of our storage capacity and our receipt and delivery rates at Mont Belvieu. We're also working on enhancements to our Mont Belvieu system to build in redundancies to ensure that disruptions like those we had this past week will not occur in the future.</p>
          <p>You may have noticed in our press release that net income attributable to partners and diluted earnings per unit looked pretty unusual this quarter. That is due to the recent merger of Enterprise GP Holdings with a wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprise, which was completed last November. Enterprise GP Holdings is considered the surviving consolidated entity for accounting purposes, so Enterprise's consolidated financial and operating results prior to the merger have been presented as if Enterprise were Enterprise GP Holdings from an accounting perspective.</p>
          <p>Enterprise is a surviving consolidated entity for legal and reporting purposes, so reported results going forward should look much more normal. The confusing parts of the income statement are below gross operating margins and do not impact distributable cash flow. Good news is that Randy gets to talk about more of this in his part of the call, and I don't.</p>
          <p>Our integrated system of assets handled record volumes in 2010. The oil and gas production growth in the developing shale regions we serve, combined with continued increased demand for NGLs by the U.S. petrochemical industry and international customers, has led to another year of record financial performance. This enabled us to reach an impressive milestone of generating $10 billion of cumulative distributable cash flow since our IPO in 1998.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $829 million, our second highest quarter ever, compared to the record $880 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, which included $25 million of insurance proceeds. For the full year, Enterprise generated a record $3.3 billion of gross operating margin, a 13% increase over 2009, and we had record net income of $1.4 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>Our NGL Pipelines &amp; Services segment continues to post strong results, totaling $457 million for the quarter versus a record $511 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross operating margin from our NGL marketing activities declined $41 million due to forward sales of NGLs, which were at record levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. Collectively, gross operating margin from the remainder of our Natural Gas Processing and related NGL Marketing business declined $20 million, due in part to 15 days of downtime at our Pioneer facility to improve NGL recovery levels.</p>
          <p>Equity NGL production for the quarter was 3,000 barrels a day less than in the fourth quarter of 2009, as a result of the downtime at Pioneer, so we had a 31% increase in fee-based processing volumes due to volume growth in the Rocky Mountains and in Texas. Gross operating margin from the NGL pipelines and storage business was $180 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, $4 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009, even though that quarter included a benefit of $29 million from a rate case settlement on the Mid-America Pipeline System. Our NGL fractionation business had record gross operating margin of $38 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, a 7% increase over 2009, primarily due to higher volumes and fees associated with a new Mont Belvieu fractionator that began commercial operations late in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported a $26 million or 24% increase in gross operating margin on record transportation volumes of 11.5 trillion Btus per day, 12.5% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement in gross operating margin was due in large part to the $14 million of gross operating margin generated by the State Line and Fairplay systems we acquired in the second quarter of 2010; increased gross operating margin from our Texas Intrastate and San Juan systems; and from natural gas storage. We're continuing to make good progress on our Acadian Extension project in the Haynesville and our Eagle Ford Shale project in Texas and look forward to the contributions they will make to our distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines &amp; Services segment decreased to $26 million this quarter from $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to fewer Contango opportunities, lower sales margins, and a $3 million increase in gross operating margin from the Seaway crude oil pipeline due to lower transportation volumes. Obviously, we're disappointed in the volumes on Seaway, but with the amount of crude in storage at Cushing, and the price differential between Cushing and the Texas Gulf Coast, there's just not much demand for northbound capacity. Total onshore crude oil transportation volumes were 645,000 barrels a day for the fourth quarter, 4% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Offshore Pipelines &amp; Services gross operating margin was $66 million compared with $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily because the fourth quarter of 2009 included $21 million of income related to insurance proceeds, and in the fourth quarter of 2010, there were lower exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico due to permitting and other issues. Our Petrochemical &amp; Refined Product Services segment had gross operating margin of $140 million, a $31 million or 28% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009. The majority of this increase is attributable to our Propylene Fractionation business, which had a $28 million or 134% increase in gross operating margin due to higher volumes and margins.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from our Refined Products business decreased by $6.5 million this quarter, primarily due to downtime on a portion of our Products Pipeline System during the quarter. Somewhat offsetting this was gross operating margin from our new Port Arthur Refined Products Terminal, which began service in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Enterprise generated distributable cash flow of $571 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which provided 1.2 times coverage of the cash distribution paid with respect to that quarter. We retained approximately $92 million of that distributable cash flow for reinvestment in our organic growth projects. We had a record $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow for the full year, providing 1.3 times coverage of the distributions paid with respect to 2010. Of that, we retained a record $480 million of distributable cash flow to help finance our growth initiatives and to limit our need to rely on the capital markets.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, Enterprise has generated over $10 billion in distributable cash flow and has retained approximately $1.6 billion of it since our IPO. Based on our continued strong performance, the board approved an increase in the quarterly cash distribution rate to $0.59 per unit, a 5.4% increase over the rate paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2009. This is our 26th consecutive quarterly increase and our 35th increase since our IPO in 1998.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with another year of strong results as our businesses continue to benefit from strong demand for our products and services. By enhancing our existing asset position in some of the most exciting shale plays in the country, such as the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford, we believe we will continue to see even more opportunities to grow and provide additional services for our customers.</p>
          <p>Organic growth will continue to offer greater returns on capital than most asset acquisitions, and we believe our focus on the organic growth available to us around our integrated system will enable us to provide our partners with sustainable growth and distributable cash flow per unit.</p>
          <p>As always, our employees continue to work tirelessly to meet the needs of our customers and to create values for our investors. We appreciate their strong work ethic and dedication, which is more important now than ever. And I would particularly like to thank the team we have working on repairs at Mont Belvieu under the direction of Graham Bacon, our Vice President of Houston Region Operations, as well as everyone in our operations, engineering, commercial, and distribution groups that are working to get things back together, back to normal, as quickly and safely as possible. They're doing a fantastic job, working around the clock. We just couldn't be more proud of the effort they're doing.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. My comments today will be more abbreviated than typical to leave you guys more time for questions.</p>
          <p>This past quarter, broad energy metrics remained favorable for NGLs and natural gas processing, with the relationship between crude and natural gas averaging about 27% of crude on a Btu basis. In combination with strong petrochemical demand, as well as strong export demand, this is keeping fractionation spreads healthy, and we're seeing producers continue to focus drilling in rich gas plays. The movement toward rich gas plays has pushed production of NGLs from gas processing to record highs in November. It's no secret that we believe that unconventional natural gas production, shale gas production, is a game changer. We continue to make progress on our initiatives in both the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville, and our plants in the Rockies continue to run at capacity, our pipelines are full, our fractionators are full.</p>
          <p>Relative to staying power, we think that most of the major plays we participate in, be it the Piceance, Jonah/Pinedale, Eagle Ford, or Haynesville, have 20-plus years of drilling locations even without considering refracs, recompletions, and/or the potential of accessing other zones. Most of the shale drilling has been driven by must-drill leasehold obligations, and producer economics should improve when they move to in-field drilling, since the roads, drilling pads, gathering and treating equipment infrastructure are already established. What's important to note is that, in addition to our current footprint, we continue to monitor about 20 additional plays, most of which are near our existing assets, which we believe have the potential to add significant amounts of natural gas, NGLs, and oil to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We always have a list of what-next initiatives, and these 20 plays make up that list of what-next initiatives. Just as we see natural gas and preproduction growth in the areas we are actively working in, we see continued growth of the need for NGL transportation and fractionation. This was clearly evident when November production data was released by the EIA. We saw record high NGL extraction of over 2 million barrels a day. Some initially appeared surprised by the growth, and over the past few weeks, some have viewed this data point as negative.</p>
          <p>Ever the contrarians, we believe that this is positive for the entire value chain, including natural gas producers, processors, chemical companies, and, particularly, well-positioned midstream companies. We expect that NGL production will continue to grow, though we believe the growth in the jump in ethane extraction from natural gas processing to 873,000 barrels a day in November from 844,000 barrels a day in October is not necessarily representative of the pace of growth that we calculate. Last quarter, we said ethane production could reach as high as 960,000 barrels a day by 2015, and we still feel that's a reasonable target.</p>
          <p>On the demand side, our export dock is sold out for 2011 and virtually sold out for 2012. We can expand that facility to handle another 1.5 million barrels a month. With our expanded fractionation capacity, we have the high purity propane supply required by the international market to support such an expansion.</p>
          <p>On the ethane side, we saw instantaneous consumption of ethane reach historic levels, and the industry's ability to consume ethane even outpaced the growth in ethane production. Last quarter, I said that we expected ethane consumption to top 1 million barrels a day by 2015. The industry topped that shortly before Christmas. Frankly, that jump in consumption exceeded our optimistic view at that time. However, remember what we said last quarter, never underestimate the U.S. chemical industry's ability to consume more ethane.</p>
          <p>In December, we saw two cracker restarts. Eastman restarted one of their crackers at Longview that had been shutdown since late 2008, and CPC restarted a Sweeny ethane cracker that had been mothballed since about the same time. We see more continued growth in demand for ethane as the cost advantage to light feedstocks is impressive. The ethane advantage relative to other domestic feeds is pronounced. But really, we're even more encouraged when we look at U.S. chemical companies' competitiveness globally, and we continue to see the U.S. slide lower on the international cost curve. That global competitiveness is what will keep the U.S. chemical industry healthy; accelerate capital spending to facilitate increased consumption of domestic NGLs.</p>
          <p>I was going to say that I didn't think the competitive advantage of the U.S. industry is fully appreciated until we got a self-side analyst report this morning on Dow Chemical and, in particular, their joint venture with Kuwait, which they call EQUATE. And I'd like to read one quote from that to finish up my comments. "We visited EQUATE as a part of our Middle Eastern field trip in June 2010, and it was clear that lack of cheap ethane feedstock in Kuwait would mean future capacity expansions would use NAFTA as a feedstock, which would likely position the new capacity above the U.S. Gulf Coast on the cost curve. Similar issues appear to be present in Saudi Arabia."</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Before I discuss additional income items, I'd like to follow up on what Mike said earlier regarding disclosures this quarter that were affected by the merger.</p>
          <p>The income statement items impacted the most were noncontrolling interest and earnings per unit. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly higher than usual due to the fact that third-party investors of EPD, other than investors of Enterprise GP Holdings, were considered a component of noncontrolling interest. This is true for periods prior to the effective merger date of November 22, 2010. Like Mike said, the good news is this will only occur this quarter. Going forward your models will not be impacted by this accounting presentation since EPD will be the reporting entity.</p>
          <p>The other unusual thing about earnings this quarter was the average units outstanding that was used for the earnings per unit calculation. EPD's quarterly earnings for the period prior to the merger is based on the net income attributable to the former owners of Enterprise GP Holdings divided by the applicable weighted average outstanding units of EPE adjusted for the merger exchange ratio of 1.5 EPD units for every EPE unit. So, thankfully, we won't be dealing with this in the future.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the discussion of additional income items, G&amp;A costs were $54 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $41 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. The G&amp;A costs this quarter included about $11 million of merger-related expenses. Interest expense increased $34 million to $213 million this quarter from $179 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2009. Interest expense this quarter includes approximately $31 million for the redesignation and assignment of interest rate swaps that EPE had that, again, were assigned over to EPD as part of the refinancing, as part of the merger and the refinancing of the EPE debt. There was also some unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the EPE debt that were also written off as well.</p>
          <p>The average debt balances were $13.8 billion and $12.8 billion for the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total capital expenditures were $694 million this quarter, which included about $631 million spent for growth projects. Of the $631 million spent for the growth projects, approximately 67% of those expenditures were related to the Haynesville Acadian Extension and the Eagle Ford Shale projects.</p>
          <p>For the year, we had $3.1 billion of growth capital expenditures, which included $1.2 billion spent for the M2 Midstream acquisition in May 2010. Some of the larger growth capital projects in 2010 were, again, the Haynesville Extension pipeline and the Eagle Ford Shale projects, as well as the Mont Belvieu NGL fractionator four and the Trinity River Basin lateral serving the Barnett Shale area. Based on approved projects, we expect to invest approximately $3.4 billion of growth capital expenditures in 2011, again, of which about 85% of those expenditures will be related to the Haynesville and Eagle Ford projects. Sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 and for the year were $63 million and $240 million, respectively. For 2011, we expect the same expenditures will be approximately $250 million to $260 million.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA for 2010 was $3.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less equity earnings plus actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 4 times for the year ended December 31, 2010, and this adjusts the debt for 50% equity treatment for the junior subordinated notes. If you include distributions that Enterprise GP Holdings received from ETE in 2010, on a pro forma basis it would lower the leverage ratio to 3.9 times.</p>
          <p>After our January debt offering in which we swapped $750 million of the 5-year notes back to floating at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus approximately 97 basis points, and taking into consideration the $450 million February debt maturity, our floating interest rate exposure is approximately 11% of the total debt portfolio. The average life &#x2013; the average tenure of the debt outstanding is almost 11 years using the first call date for the hybrids. And our effective average cost of debt is approximately 5.7%.</p>
          <p>At December 31, 2010, we had consolidated liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes the availability under both the EPD and DEP credit facilities, as well as unrestricted cash. In January 2011, we received approximately $1.5 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the 5-year and 30-year notes. A portion of those proceeds were used to retire a $450 million note that matured on February 1, 2011. Adjusting for these proceeds and the retirement of the note, consolidated liquidity was approximately $2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>We do not currently have any estimate with regard to the impact of the Mont Belvieu incident to first quarter earnings. The focus of our operating, engineer, and commercial personnel have been to assist federal and state authorities investigating the accident and restore services to our customers. Their pace of progress, much like after hurricane disruptions, has been amazing. We have not distracted them by asking for estimates of the financial impact in such a quickly evolving situation. In terms of property damage insurance, we have a $5 million deductible. In terms of business interruption insurance, we have a 60-day deductible.</p>
          <p>As you can tell from Jim and Mike's update, we currently do not expect to have a BI claim. All in all, we do not currently expect for this incident to have a significant impact to 2011 EBITDA or 2011 distributable cash flow for either Enterprise or Duncan Energy Partners.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Duncan Energy Partners, we're pleased to report another quarter of record gross operating margin of $81.9 million, which was 15% higher than fourth quarter 2009. And it surpassed the record established last quarter by 10%. We benefited from record NGL pipeline throughput volumes from South Texas NGL pipelines and higher storage fees at our Mont Belvieu complex. The Natural Gas Pipeline business reported a 7% increase in gross operating margin this quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to higher firm capacity fees, transportation volumes, and lower operating expenses on the Texas Intrastate System.</p>
          <p>Distributable cash flow this quarter was a record $35.8 million and enabled us to increase the quarterly distribution rate for the ninth consecutive quarter. This represents a 2.2% increase over what was paid to partners with respect to the fourth quarter of 2009 and provided 1.4 times coverage of the quarterly distribution. We retained approximately $9.4 million of DCF this quarter and $30 million for the year, which was used towards funding the Haynesville Extension. We are excited about our Haynesville Extension pipeline, which is progressing on schedule and likely under budget. We began construction on the 270-mile pipeline and related facilities in January and began laying pipe this month. We expect to have the pipeline completed and ready for operations in September. DEP had consolidated capital expenditures of $333 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included approximately $192 million for the Haynesville Extension pipeline project on a 100% basis.</p>
          <p>DEP funded approximately $128 million or 66% of the total cost of the Haynesville Extension pipeline this quarter, and for the year, the partnership spent approximately $348 million for its portion of the capital associated with the project. Sustaining capital expenditures were $14 million this quarter compared to $11 million spent in the fourth quarter of 2009, and for the year, DEP had $55 million of sustaining capital expenditures. At December 31, 2010, DEP's debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio per the calculation of the bank credit facility was 3.5 times. Under this facility, DEP's maximum allowed debt to EBITDA is 5 times. In calculating this ratio, the credit agreement also allows us to adjust EBITDA for a pro rata amount of the forecasted EBITDA associated with the Haynesville Extension.</p>
          <p>At December 31st, DEP had total liquidity of approximately $763 million, which includes cash and availability under the credit facility. Our debt has an average maturity of two years, and 100% of DEP's debt is floating rate debt.</p>
          <p>In closing, we were pleased with the strong performance of our business this quarter and for 2010. We established new high watermarks in operating and financial performance in 2010, and we are encouraged by the growth prospects for our partnership as we continue to execute on our plans.</p>
          <p>With that, Randy, we're ready to open it up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we are &#x2013; this is Mark Hurley, and we're very excited about what we have going on in the Eagle Ford both with respect to the kind of production that we see coming on there, which is in the hundreds of thousands of barrels a day over the next 10 to 15 years; the quality of the crude oil, which is very good and very easy to market into the Houston market, in particular. We like our position there with the line that we have announced. And in consideration now of an extension to that line, we announced earlier, or late in 2010, that we'd be building a terminal in Houston. And so, we're highly focused on having that be a hub for Eagle Ford crude with all the connectivity that we need to get to refiners in that area, as well as having the ability to export into other markets as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned some of the investments in the crude oil transportation, storage assets, that were made in, I think, last September, November. I was just curious, how do you think about growing that business, and how are those investments weighed against those in the Onshore Natural Gas segment and NGL segment during the capital allocation process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're pretty much done with capital allocation for 2011 and in large parts for the beginning of 2012. And the way that we look at the onshore crude and onshore gas together is we're serving producers that have interests in both of those areas. And so to the extent we can provide natural gas and crude oil solutions for them, it's kind of a win-win for us. So we're looking at ways that we can, again, leverage our value chain, provide services across all of those business segments. So we're not looking at crude oil in isolation. We're looking at the producer relationships and then how we can best serve those.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim, I've a couple of questions for you, surprisingly. First, beyond the restart of those two previously mothballed crackers that you talked about, with ethane demand tracking 960,000 a day and crackers running almost 95% of their utilization, would you have expected to see more cracker modifications by this point? I'm trying to get my arms around how much more idle capacity you think can come back online or be modified to focus on the light ends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of by fault? Oh, of modifications. I'm sitting here with Don Johnson who's in our fundamentals group and stays on top of that. And what Don is saying, he thinks there's somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day of more modifications that can be made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what about what's idle right now? And more specifically, within the framework, I'm just trying to get a feel for, if that capacity does come back online, how quickly you could match up with ramping NGL production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me get Don to dig into that, because I don't have it right at my fingertips, Darren, and get back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. That's not a problem. Switching over to your comments around expanding the LPG export terminal, as you mentioned, sold out for the better part of the next two years, what would the associated cost and timing be of that 1.5 million barrels a day capacity if you did decide to move forward with expanding that dock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the timing'd probably be in the neighborhood of a year, and I'm not sure the capital would not be outrageous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And safe to say, given your installed base of existing assets, the IRR would probably be north of traditional greenfield projects? Is that fair?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you should know better than to ask, Darren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one thing, Darren, to keep in mind, one of the things that give us the ability to expand that export facility is our expanded fractionation capacity. You don't build an export facility for fully refrigerated LPG propane unless you have the capability to produce propane with no more than 2%, 2.5% ethane. That means you better have a pretty damn &#x2013; a pretty strong, there we go, a pretty strong fractionation position supporting that export activity. You don't just go build a terminal. You better have the ability to produce the 2%, 2.5% ethane in propane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, you better get to work on building a strong fractionation footprint then, Jim. Last question for me, on the Eagle Ford logistics, I'm just thinking about moving volumes east across that rich gas main line expansion and out of the tailgate of that new gas processing plant. Now, I'm curious if you foresee any additional need to expand Wilson beyond that extra 5 Bcf you're adding this year? And then secondly, maybe any additional opportunities for storage in and around the Celia area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Darren, this is Chris. With regard to expansion at Wilson, we're pleased with the facility that'll be coming on in service here in April. It'll be a little over 5 Bcf of capacity. We're happy at that level right now. We have been &#x2013; at the analyst call last year, I talked about, we're not bullish storage for natural gas long-term. There's been significant amounts of storage developed over the last five years and the deliverability proportionate to that. And I think there's been a couple of articles that have talked about that, but we don't see a significant growth in storage needs in that area right now. There's ample storage capacity in that area, and our 5 Bcf fits right in there just nicely; our residue line ties right into that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Darren, the other thing is that taking that gas into Wilson interconnects with a number of other interstate pipelines, so we can get that gas moved to other storage facilities and places where they need it.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; this is Mark Hurley again. It's difficult to move high volumes of crude into the LLS market from the WTI market efficiently, and, of course, that's one of the reasons that spread exists. Most of it moves today by way of marine transport, and, of course, we do have a marine transport fleet, and so we look at those opportunities all the time. So that's the primary way of trying to take advantage of that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim. The one thing we are looking at, and this is part of our legacy, if you would, is we are taking a look at every pipe we have regardless of the service it's in and seeing if it can be better deployed in another service.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. Maybe just, you mentioned the Marine Transport, so you recently had the sale of the asset. Can you just talk a little bit, maybe just clarify sort of strategically, what your thought process now is with the Marine Transportation business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I don't know that it's changed much over the last year. Certainly, what we're trying to do is integrate that with the rest of our businesses more. The piece that we sold was the bunkering operations based out of Florida that, frankly, didn't fit our value chain. It's not a business that we saw integrating with what we have currently. The business that we retained is kind of the core business that TEPPCO bought. We have in 2010 bought the onshore service facilities that go with that business, trying to put it back together. We're looking at opportunities, as Mark said, to integrate that with our Crude business as well as our Refined Products business and perhaps some LPG business. So we think it could be a nice addition to our value chain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question from me, there still hasn't been any final announcements out of the Marcellus in terms of an ethane solution, and I just was curious if you had any updated thoughts on where that product ends up, and if Enterprise will play a role in that?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're &#x2013; I'll say again what I've always said, it's counterintuitive to me when you have to take ethane out of natural gas, but assuming you have to, probably if I were a producer I would want it where the biggest sponge is, and that's on the Gulf Coast. And I think we've said in the past, we could play a role in that in some fashion. If nothing else, we've got the distribution capability on the Gulf Coast to the petrochemical industry.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I got to get better at asking questions. The second question, Jim, when you think about the export facility, what kind of demand do you think is going to persist? And other than propane, what other products do you see robust demand for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, I've been in this business a long time, and I never thought I would see us exporting this amount of propane year round. I think as long as you have a gas-to-crude like we have in the U.S., then it's going to support continued exports of propane. I'm looking at Lynn Bourdon. Frankly, that's one of the things we're spending time on, as we look at our export facility, is trying to get our arms around what the demand for that incremental capacity would look like and what kind of fees it could support. But right now, we're beginning to say, you know what, this looks like this has got staying power as long as this gas-to-crude is where it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But any other products you think that...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">

          <p>Well, again, if we also consider refined products, I think we average around 600,000 barrels a day of diesel exports, in rough numbers, and we continue to believe that that market will stay there and grow with the strength of the refiners on the Gulf Coast, as well as the growth in the Eagle Ford Shale crude and other crudes coming into this market. So we believe that will grow as well.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, how do you think about the propylene? I mean that has to be generating record margins for you right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had a pretty good year. We had a great year in propylene, and you know it's strong when people are looking, when people build on-purpose plants and continue to talk about more on-purpose plants. That's indicative of the strength of propylene.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it sounds like you think there might staying power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we feel pretty good about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't expect &#x2013; let me answer that. You've got a little more production capability today than you had last year, so you may see a little bit of a narrowing, but, come on, these heavy crackers produced a heck of a lot of propylene, and they're cracking light so that supports a margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is there any way to &#x2013; do you think about trying to lock in? Go ahead. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'd love to, Yves, there's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'll just finish up by asking if the acquisitions that you did with Momentum, has the acquisition economics played out the way you thought? And maybe just expand on what you're seeing on the State Line and Fairplay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, I'll jump in here. On the State Line and Fairplay system, if you remember the strategy we talked about, remember the 42-inch corridor where the other pipelines run from Carthage to Perryville, we decided not to play in that corridor. We built south in the Haynesville and went diagonally down into Baton Rouge. Once again, our fundamentals group played a key role in helping us to find the sweet spot of where we thought the Haynesville was.</p>
          <p>If you look at the rig count on the north side of that corridor versus the south side of that corridor, we've still got eight rigs running in our State Line system, two rigs running in our Fairplay system, which is &#x2013; Fairplay system's that more easterly edge on the Texas side, but the State Line system, we're still running eight rigs. And in our two proprietary gathering systems, we've got a lot of activity at rigs. And that's the further south you go in that basin, if you remember that Momentum was our installation from the north corridor coming down into our area, what we thought was the sweet spot; that was the strategic reason why we bought that. So we're still very pleased. I think the throughput today was pushing, between the two systems, 670 million, whether it be full volumetric or getting demand payments for, in that range. So we're very pleased with where we are right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Yves, probably from a return standpoint, we may be about 150 basis points, on an annual basis, light from where we thought. But some of that's Oil Field Services sort of being a bottleneck there. But I think from where we are, like Chris said, I think we're pretty close to where we thought we'd be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And from our standpoint, we think that's primarily timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When our project kicks off, our Haynesville Extension kicks off, it really helps exploit the potential upside on State Line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any thoughts on Gulf of Mexico and Independence volumes coming back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they've come back from where they were. They're running right now around 525 million a day, and we would expect that &#x2013; I think there's another well that's coming up before the end of the year, so that'll help volumes a bit. Don't see it back at 950 million a day anytime soon, but we see some gradual improvement, and then once drilling starts back up in the Gulf of Mexico, there should be some additional volumes.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Barrett Blaschke with RBC Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, just a quick question on the Haynesville Extension. And that is, with some expectation that this might come in under budget at this point, how does this affect your outlook for financing the project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the financing is the same as it's always been. All of our financing essentially is at the OLP level, so we don't do any project financing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then at the Duncan Energy level, the credit facility that we executed in the fourth quarter gave Duncan Energy Partners, who again is providing the capital for 66% of the project, it gave us plenty of flexibility to finance that on the credit facility. And if the project comes in under budget, that just gives us more flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what it does the most is makes us question the contingencies that engineering built into all these projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the only other thing I had there was &#x2013; did I hear correctly that all of the Duncan debt is currently floating rate debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any chance of locking that in over time, some of it, as it built up, especially with project financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think one of the things we're &#x2013; as we think about the financing, we go through the stage of &#x2013; well Duncan Energy we're thinking of it, if you would, as a, or at least this Haynesville project, a little bit like a project financing where we're looking to minimize equity issuance and utilize debt down at Duncan Energy to finish the project.</p>
          <p>That being said, we'd like to come back in and get Duncan Energy's credit ratios on a standalone basis back to something that's commensurate with an investment grade rating. Ultimately, we'd like to come in and issue term debt at Duncan Energy, but to do that we need to get those credit ratios down. So I think part of our thought process is, is finish the project then use some of the excess distributable cash flow that'll be thrown off, de-lever Duncan back to a level that's appropriate, and then we'll come in and look to go out and do a term debt deal. But by that time, that could be into 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the near term, your crystal ball may be better than ours, but I guess we're just coming in and seeing where debt funds rate is, where LIBOR rates are. It doesn't seem like they're going to go anywhere fast. And our thought is let's stay floating, at least through the construction of the project, and then we can see about either terming some debt out or doing some anticipatory hedges to help lock some of that in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just, Jim, you were talking about ethane demand and how you were looking for 1 million barrels a day by 2015, and then you've already hit it. So what's your outlook now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hoping we can hold it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, do you expect a higher number now for 2015? Or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as petrochemicals becomes satisfied that the supply is going to be there, I don't know how you can ignore a $0.10 a pound advantage from ethane versus, say, NAFTA. I don't see how the petrochemical industry can ignore that cost advantage. So if that cost advantage stays, yeah, I think you'll see more demand. I've said before, if you've got $0.10 a pound advantage and you've got a 1.5 billion pound a year cracker, that's $150 million a year. That's hard to walk away from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we saw again, Jim mentioned that in December we saw on a intra-month basis 1 million barrels a day of demand or usage by the petrochemicals of ethane, and he said that there's another 75,000, 80,000 barrels a day of expansion. So right there you're kind of at 1.1 million barrels a day, and the economics are pretty compelling. So...</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question relates to DEP. Just looking at, I guess, the gross operating margins for the NGL Pipelines &amp; Services segment, it seemed like it was a pretty significant sequential increase &#x2013; just trying to understand the improvement on a sequential basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Sharon, I think it was just &#x2013; you're just seeing more Eagle Ford volumes begin to show up in the system. If you come in and you look at natural gas production coming out of the Eagle Ford of 450 million a day, I think we're handling about 300 million a day of that that's showing up at our processing plants. So you're getting incremental NGLs coming out of the plants and going into that pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sharon, bear with me. You may have asked the $65 question that stumps everybody. As far as sustaining CapEx for DEP, I guess we were remiss of not putting that in the press release. Probably on a 100% basis at the DEP I assets, call it $20 million, $25 million. For the DEP II assets, call it $30 million, $35 million.</p>
