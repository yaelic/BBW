          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome again to our usual Quarterly Financial Results Announcement. Today we have Sok Hui, CFO and Piyush, our CEO with us here. We also have our Hong Kong colleagues on the line too. And without further ado, we'd like to get Sok Hui to cover and tell us a little bit more about our second quarter results, after which Piyush would address all of you and then we'll take Q&amp;A. Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Let me now review our operating performance for the quarter. Excluding a one-time goodwill impairment charge, which I will talk about in the next slide, we earned 718 million, up 30% from year ago and 35% from the previous quarter. The quarterly earnings were the highest in our history. Operating trend strengthened further as we captured loan demand from corporate customers across the region and homebuyers in Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income also grew as a result of higher customer flows. Loans grew 9% or 12 billion from the previous quarter to 146 billion. The strong loan growth offset the impact of lower yields on securities, resulting in net interest income being unchanged from the previous quarter at 1.07 billion. Non-interest income continue to fair strongly as our assets to cross-sell progressed.</p>
          <p>Fees rose 5% from the previous quarter to 358 million as higher contributions are seen across most segments. Increased customer flows contributed to a 21% rise in trading and treasury activities to 278 million.</p>
          <p>Total income was 6% higher than the previous quarter, while total expenses grew 2%, allowances fell 43% as non-performing loans fell from 2.7% in the previous quarter to 2.3%. Of the 204 million in allowances set aside this quarter, 124 million was general provision taken in line with loan growth. Allowance coverage exceeded 100%.</p>
          <p>Let me now come back to the goodwill impairment charge that we took for DBS Hong Kong. So what is goodwill? Goodwill is an intangible asset that reflects the premium paid over the book value of investments. In this case, DBS Hong Kong Limited. The investment is purchased at a prevailing market price, which incorporates expectations of future business growth.</p>
          <p>Prior to this impairment, our investment in DBS Hong Kong Limited was carried in our book at 9.5 billion comprising book value of 3.8 billion and goodwill of 5.6 billion.</p>
          <p>We perform a test for goodwill impairment at least once a year. The test involves ascertaining the recoverable amount of the value for DBS Hong Kong Limited. If this lower than the value carried in the balance sheet, the difference is written off as an impairment charge.</p>
          <p>The recoverable value in the latest test was determined to be 8.4 billion, compared with the carrying value of 9.5 billion. The difference of 1.0 billion was taken as a goodwill impairment charge, which reduces goodwill in our books to 4.6 billion. The new carrying value of 8.4 billion is equivalent to 2.2 times the book value of DBS Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>The recoverable value was derived using a discounted cash flow method. It was based on a detailed cash flow assumption for the first five years, a long-term growth rate of 4.5% for subsequent years and 9.5% discount rate.</p>
          <p>The previous test was done in December 2009. Since then, DBS Hong Kong Limited has experienced interest margin compression and our assessment is that there are some structural issues that play. They have been noticeable and persistence strength in wholesale funding markets, which has caused banks to adjust the funding strategies and liquidity positions. These structural changes have made it more likely that the recent compression in DBS Hong Kong's net interest margins will persist.</p>
          <p>Taking a balanced view of the various factors driving DBS Hong Kong's projected cash flows, we've moderated our projections for future business as usual growth, and assess that is appropriate to take an impairment charge. We remain positive on Hong Kong and China, and Hong Kong remains the anchor for our Greater China operations. We have a fundamentally strong franchise in Hong Kong and we are making good progress in our initiatives to expand it.</p>
          <p>The goodwill charge is a non-operating and non-cash item. The impairment has no impacts on our liquidity, our capital adequacy ratios. As goodwill has already been deducted from regulatory capital on consolidation, there is also no impact on our ability to grow our business or to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>Turning back to our operating performance. Net interest income was maintained at a previous quarter's level of 1.07 billion, as lower net interest margins were offset by stronger loan volume growth. Net interest margins declined from 1.93% in the previous quarter to 1.84%. Securities yields declined as higher yielding securities were replaced by higher-quality bonds with lower yields. In addition, deposit costs were higher due to competition for U.S. and Hong Kong dollar funding.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 9% during the quarter bringing year-to-date loan growth to 12%. Of the 12 billion in loan growth this quarter, 10 billion was in business loans and 2 billion in housing loans. There was strong growth in business loans particularly from high-quality corporates across the region. The increase was broad based across industry for both Singapore dollar and foreign currency borrowing.</p>
          <p>Overall business loans grew 11% from the previous quarter accounting for 82% of this quarter's loan growth. Housing loan draw downs also remain strong. Singapore housing loans grew 7% from the previous quarter as we gained market share with our popular fixed-rate offering. In Hong Kong, housing loans grew 3% in local currency terms. Our pipeline remains healthy as we continue to utilize our capital and liquidity to support both corporate and individual customers financing needs.</p>
          <p>Net fee income rose 5% from the previous quarter to 358 million. Wealth management revenue improved as bank assurance sales volumes rose in Singapore. Credit card fees also rose from higher transaction volume to our loan syndication fees remain at a previous quarter's strong levels.</p>
          <p>Income from trading and treasury activities improved to 278 million from 230 million in the previous quarter, like the previous quarter we have strong customer flows particularly from FME and corporate customers seeking to hedge their foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Customer revenues rose 45% from the previous quarter and accounted for more than half of trading income. We also benefited from favorable trading opportunities during the quarter. Expenses rose 2% from the previous quarter as a result of higher staff costs as head count increased to support higher business volumes.</p>
          <p>Lower non-staff costs partially offset the impact of higher wage costs. This cost income ratio of 40% was little change from the previous quarter. The figures on the slide incorporate an appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong dollar of 5% from a year ago, and 1% from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong earnings fell to 65 million from 180 million in the previous quarter. As expenses for compensating constellation customers was recognized in Hong Kong's account during the quarter, the expenses already taken at group level in previous quarters. Excluding this non-recurring item, expenses and profit before allowances would have been stable from the previous quarter for Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Net interest income decreased 2% from the previous quarter. Net interest margin narrowed by 12 basis points to 1.68%, mainly due to rebalancing of the securities portfolio from high-yielding corporate bonds into high grade government papers. Deposit costs were also higher due to competitive pressures. The margin pressures were partly offset by strong loans growth. Loans grew 12% in local currency terms from the previous quarter, driven by corporate loans, trade finance and housing loan.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income was stable from the previous quarter. Higher fees from loan syndication and trade finance, together with higher sales of Treasury products were offset by decline in gains from financial investments. Allowances increased as higher general provisions are set aside in line with loan growth. Specific allowances fell due to lower charges for new NPLs and higher write-backs for corporate customers.</p>
          <p>Asset quality improved with NPAs declining by 8% from the previous quarter to 3.7 billion. And the NPL rate improved from 2.7% to 2.3%. NPLs in all regions and business units registered improvements. Specific allowances fell to 19% &#x2013; 19 basis points of loans from 97 basis points in the previous quarter, the lowest since the start of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Provision coverage for NPAs improved to 101%. If collateral were taken into account, the coverage improves to 126%. Our capital position remains strong, with Tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratio at 13.1% and 16.5% respectively. There was a moderate decline from the previous quarter as risk-weighted assets rose due to the strong loan growth we had.</p>
          <p>We are paying second quarter dividend of 14 cents per share. Based on yesterday's closing share price, DBS shares give investors an annualized dividend yield of 3.9%. The Scrip Dividend Scheme will be applicable to the final dividend.</p>
          <p>For shareholders who opt for Scrip, new shares will be issued at a 5% discount to the average closing share prices on August 20, 23 and 24. The operating trends we saw at the start of the year further strengthened in the second quarter. Revenues reached new highs, as we made new loans and cross-sold non-interest income product to a wide range of customers. Asset quality continued to improved, allowance charges declined, while allowance coverage ratio rose above 100%. The performance has been encouraging and demonstrates some early wins, as we execute on our strategy. We'll continue to focus on our customers, improve on our business processes and utilize our capital and liquidity to capture opportunities in Asia in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Piyush.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sok Hui. I guess, let me recap a couple of things Sok Hui said, and then I want to spend a few minutes talking to you about our results in some more detail.</p>
          <p>As Sok Hui mentioned, we're very pleased with this quarter's results and numbers. Obviously, there is the highest quarterly earnings in our history and that's obviously good news. But even more than that, I think we're very pleased with the quality of that number. And as I will take you through in the next few minutes, it really speaks to the fact that many of the drivers of our strategy that we laid out 6 months ago are beginning to bear fruit. And frankly, in some ways, it surprised us. As a management team, we thought it would take us about a year to start seeing the fruits of some of our actions. In point of fact, we started seeing some early results, which has been good.</p>
          <p>We do remain one of the best capitalized banks in Asia. Our total CAR is at 16.5% and Tier 1 ratios at 13% are very strong. And so, before I go into talking you through what we've been doing in the last 3 months and why I think the quality of our numbers is good, let me just take that minute to talk a little bit about the goodwill &#x2013; the impairment charge.</p>
          <p>This sounds like a tutorial and I don't intend it to be one, but I do think it's worth making a few points. As Sok Hui mentioned before, goodwill and intangible asset, and as most of you know, you're financial journalist, it reflects the premium that you pay over the book value of investment and the market value of the investment, booking price. The premium typically reflects expectation of future business growth and what it is a likely to be and is oftentimes driven and determined by an overall view and assessment of what the potential in the market is likely to be.</p>
          <p>Accounting requires that from time to time you do a fair value test. You go back and test and see whether your assumptions for the future growth profile are consistent with what you thought. If they're not, then you go back and make an adjustment to the value at which you hold that particular asset.</p>
          <p>Now what's happened, in the Hong Kong situation, we've been holding the asset at a particular price. Actually, in accounting laws, when we first bought Dao Heng, were different. In those days, requirement used to be whatever you had in goodwill you amortize equally over 20 years to actually knock it off. They changed the accounting laws in 2005 to these new laws where you actually do an impairment test from time-to-time to see what the value of that asset should be.</p>
          <p>When we did a test in 2005 the last time, we figured that the value of the asset needed to be adjusted down. And so we took an impairment charge in 2005, if you remember. Since then, our tests for the asset have been pretty consistent and we've been comfortable with the value at which we hold it.</p>
          <p>Now it's quite clear that in the last couple of years, in the aftermath of the GFC, the global financial crisis, one of the main things that's happened is, there is a fundamental shift in the liquidity and funding structures around the world. There has been clearly &#x2013; and the liquidity crisis of '07 and the early '08 brought home to everybody the value of retail deposits and the nature of the liability base that you have. It was obviously no coincidence that several of the bulge bracket investment banks around the world chose to apply for bank holding company licenses and get federal charters and all that stuff.</p>
          <p>The funding situation therefore, has structurally changed and for many players around the world the liquidity strategies that they choose to adopt have been changing. The liquidity situation has improved through '09. If you go back to this thing, the money started coming back to the market, liquidity came back. But if you look back at the last 3, 4 months, the liquidity position took a downturn, certainly through April, May. June, and I think the last part driven by Europe and the European crisis you started seeing. All over Asia dollar liquidity went out of the market.</p>
          <p>So it's quite clear to us that the change is pretty structural at a global level and the change is structural at the Asia level. There is a different stance on U.S. dollar liquidity in Asia today than they used to be. In Hong Kong, the situation is exacerbated in some &#x2013; partly because of the advent of the Mainland China banks. So a lot of the Mainland China banks have been coming into Hong Kong and using Hong Kong as a funding base, as a borrowing base.</p>
          <p>So in early past, a few months ago, you had the situation, continues to be in Hong Kong, where retail deposits are getting buildup. And there was a period of time, in fact even now, where retail deposits are being priced at LIBOR plus 50, 60, 70 basis points. There's one month in which the average retail deposits were LIBOR plus 70 whereas mortgages were being giving out at LIBOR plus 65. So, people were actually giving out mortgage loans lower than they were paying on retail deposits.</p>
          <p>The point we're making there is, look at the overall situation. It seems to us that the structural shift in liquidity therefore and particularly in the Hong Kong situation is real and likely to be enduring certainly over the next year or two. And when you figure that and then you look at your projected cash flows for what the business is likely to make, it seems to us that it is the right thing to us to moderate expectation of future cash flows. Future cash flow assumptions around the Hong Kong business were pretty aggressive. And even after moderation, our assumption of cash flows are actually fairly strong. And once you do that, you actually wind up then having to recognize a lower discounted value of your asset. That's what explains the billion dollar thing.</p>
          <p>Next slide. I think, Sok Hui made the point and I just wanted to emphasize that. So what is the real impact of goodwill impairment for us? Goodwill is a non-cash item, all right. It's an intangible asset. It doesn't go through your cash accounts. It does not affect operating performance. It's not a statement or reflection on operating performance. It does not affect our regulatory capital. Goodwill is excluded for regulatory capital, so our CAR doesn't change, our Tier 1, Tier 2s don't change. It does not impact our cash flow or our liquidity position. It does not impact our ability to pay dividends in any material terms and that does not impede any of our business expansion plans.</p>
          <p>The last comment I want to make, we are working hard at building out an expansion strategy for the Hong Kong, China business. Our current view on the future cash flows in Hong Kong has not taken into account that strategy or the impact of the strategy. It's a BAU view, business as usual view, based on what the nature of the business is as we speak right now.</p>
          <p>Having touched the goodwill thing, as I said, I want to move on to really taking you back to what I spoke about the last couple of quarters. You remember, beginning of the year, we talked about it briefly last quarter. We've laid out the strategy, which reflects on the 90 things that we want to do. Based around what we want to do in Singapore and Hong Kong, around the region, some lines of business and so on. I said that the quality of our results is very pleasing to us, because it really reflects progress we're making on these priorities. And that's what I want to walk, if not all of them, but most of them.</p>
          <p>Slide, please. So if you look at Singapore, we said our first priority is trying to get traction and address and fix our Singapore business in some ways. And we're really trying to do that by focusing on support staff teams, ones that we have to build up our Singapore dollar asset book. As the people have reflected before, we have a large amount of Singapore dollar deposits and we have to put those deposits to work in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we are making on the Singapore dollar asset book. Our total asset growth has been good. I think dollar portion of the assets grew at 2.7 or 9 was it, so for the &#x2013; $2.7 billion. As best as we can figure, we calculate market share based on our data relative to EMEAs data.</p>
          <p>Our total share of Singapore loans is up from 21.5 to 22.4%. So we think we got almost a percentage point in market share growth, which to us is very significant. That kind of market share growth in the period we have. You'll see from the slide that the growth was broad-based. So we've grown share in mortgages. We've grown share in business loans. We've grown share in credit cards, so across the board. Every category of loans in Singapore, we've grown shares.</p>
          <p>Also if you reflect and look at, I think we're not growing share by dropping pricing. We've not been using pricing as a competitive lever. We have grown share because we've been able to go out on the <mark type="inaudible" /> so we've got a lot of fixed-rate loans in our mix increasingly, it's attractive to our customers. And we're one of the few players who can do that because of the stickiness of our deposit base. So we've been leveraging on our strength, we've also been leveraging on distribution. We've been able to source more of our loans through our branch network, and I'm going to come back to that in a minute.</p>
          <p>The second area we said we were focused on is in the payment space. We've actually made good progress in the payment space as well. I spoke last time about the mobile banking launch we had. Our target was to get 70,000 customers signed up in a year, we got 70,000 in a month, we are today at 132,000 customers. What's very pleasing is these customers are not just coming in to do balance enquiry, customers are using their phones to make payments. So we're getting on an average 3,000 to 3,500 payments off the cell phone, on the mobile phone every day.</p>
          <p>We've so far made about $175 million in payments of mobile phone, and that's very pleasing. We also see progress on our Internet payments. We've upped the ante and so we're now getting 20,000 to 22,000 customers every month on our Internet bank, which is a substantial step up from what we were in the period before that.</p>
          <p>On the third big area we said we focused on in Singapore is POSB. We really wanted to focus on building out the POSB franchise. And that is, you know, one, we want to convert that from being a predominantly savings account channel to being a multi-product kind of franchise where we can sell a whole range of different things, build a more complete customer relationship. We've made extremely good progress on that front. We increased the number of sales people in our POSB branches. We increased personal finance managers by 14% in the quarter, and we're seeing the results.</p>
          <p>So our total unsecured loans, 42% of them got sourced to the branch network this quarter, up from 38% in the previous quarter, which itself was up from the quarter before that. So we're beginning to see traction in using our distribution force. Our market share of the POSB installment loan went up to 40% in June, consistently ranking the number one installment loan now through 2010. So we're seeing some progress in getting the POSB branch network to kick in as a sales channel.</p>
          <p>The second thing we want to do on the POSB network is make sure we retain that customer footprint. As you know, the POSB magic has been through building relationships with kids, and then the relationships continue through life. We've been very focused on making sure that we can continue to build on this children's segment, notwithstanding not having the CD account as we used to in the past. And we start to focus on few sub segments: the babies, the primary schools, the secondary schools. And we have programs in each of the segments from a hospital alliance for the babies to a school alliance obviously for the school kids. We opened 28,000 new POSB accounts in the quarter, which is again a record. Previous high was 24,000 some. And so, we're actually making good progress in continuing to retain our presence in the kids segment.</p>
          <p>Finally, service has been a big thing for us to get the branch service, POSB and frankly DBS branch service paradigm shifted and I'd touch on that a little bit later when I talk about what we are trying to do with the broader customer experience.</p>
          <p>Okay. Moving on to the second thing. So the second thing we said apart from Singapore, we've said we wanted to really work on Hong Kong, to really grow and re-energize our Hong Kong business. And once again, we're pleased in the quarter, we're beginning to see some very clear evidence of our strategies bearing fruit. Our overall Hong Kong performance for the quarter was extremely good. First half is up 13% year-on-year from the previous year. It's led by both loan growth. We've had good loan growth, quarter-on-quarter 12% &#x2013; to offset some of the customer margin issues I spoke to you about. But we've also saw &#x2013; seen very good growth in the non-interest income category. So you had very good cross-set, particularly in treasury and markets where we have done extremely well; loans syndications and actually some kickback, comeback in our Wealth Management business.</p>
          <p>So I feel good about that. In the consumer space, as I mentioned before, our strategy is, earlier we were focusing principally on our Wealth Management. We said we'll segment the market and we'll start looking at the mass market as a source of asset buildup and start doing asset lending. You're beginning to see the results of that, our mortgage and unsecured loans grew 18% year-on-year, and that's because of the refocus of our segmentation and our ability to drive that. Fortunately, our Wealth Management business is also beginning to look up. So we're beginning to see greater advertisement demand and that's working out as well.</p>
          <p>The third thing on the Hong Kong sales we said we would do is, try and see what we could do to leverage the China linkage. And we are seeing early progress in that, we've designated some branches in Hong Kong, are focused on Chinese nationals opening Hong Kong accounts, actually we've done the reverse as well; Hong Kongers going into Shenzhen. And so we're beginning to see some impact of that too.</p>
          <p>Finally in Hong Kong, we also said that on the institutional banking business, we had some opportunity. One, we had to improve the top end of our presence in Hong Kong. And our real focus there as I said is to focus on the Red Chips. The China Company is coming out. We've done extremely well over the quarter with that. We've added new customers, new names, and we've been able to leverage that to go back and bank them in China.</p>
          <p>The second thing we said we'd do is segment the Hong Kong SME business a lot better between the mid-caps and the small enterprises. We've completed that segmentation; we've completed the realignment of the customers. And actually that's what's allowing us to focus a lot harder on cross-selling, things like treasury products and insurance products into the customer base, so we've seen some value in that. And finally, I would say that Hong Kong that we try and &#x2013; we had a good mid-cap bank in the capital markets investment banks space in Singapore. We want to see if we can transfer that to Hong Kong, China. And so we are focused on the mid-cap space, we've had very good success. So far, we've actually got seven active mandates in the quarter working in that space, which is frankly a new area of growth and opportunity for us. So, priority number two.</p>
          <p>Third we said we're focused are &#x2013; try to start driving harder in other countries to get a better balance of our earnings mix. And as we said, we think there is lot of organic low-hanging fruit around what we can do to get that better earnings mix. So we continue to do that. In China, we've got approval; we've added one branch. We've got approval to add one branch and to open one more sub-branch. So we're going to be doing that soon.</p>
          <p>We focus very hard on improving our deposit base in China. Our loan deposit ratio in China was a constraint. It was a very high in the 130, 140%. It's actually now down to 100%. We've made very good progress building our renminbi deposit base in the last few months. We've set up a country desk, we've set up at a Taiwan and a Singapore desk because we want to go to work with Asian companies going into China in a very focused way. So we set up those desks and we're beginning to see the fruits of that.</p>
          <p>And we've also established a woofy have got a license to be able to do corporate finance advisory work within China and again, we were focused on the mid-cap, I spoke about that. In Taiwan, our integration of the Bowa business and then building of that is now beginning to become pace. We had our record quarter for loans. We had a record quarter for all our income, our deposits grew nicely. So we're feeling good about the traction we're beginning to get in the Taiwan business.</p>
          <p>In India again, we had a record quarter, all-time record for our institutional banking corporate business; to the highest ever corp revenues. So that's been good. We've got approval to open two more branches, which we'll open in the next month or so. And we just started completing our product suite so we can get into the affluent consumers space as we want to. We will see more progress in terms of getting into the space in the next half of the year, but we're quite pleased about the fact that our product suite is a lot more complete now than it was.</p>
          <p>And finally Indonesia, we've been able to actually beef up our bench strength in Indonesia. We had some gaps. And that shows in increase in our loan volume both in the corporate side and in the consumer side. Our deposits have gone up nicely as well. So in terms of our third priority trying to rebalance the earnings mix and grow outside our principal two countries, we're quite pleased with the progress we've made over the last three months.</p>
          <p>Shifting gears from the geography focus to the regional business focus, as you know, there are two large regional businesses we want to build out, the SME business and the Wealth Management business. On the SME business, on both of these, I guess fair to say what we've done in the first half of the year is really getting the team in place. So staffing and we're quite pleased with the staffing progress we made on SME. We've got a new person to head up our regional SAP as a platform, and a strategy sense to build out a blueprint for the platform, we've hired new people for the SME business in Indonesia, in Taiwan, in Hong Kong for both the community banking space and the middle space. We've hired somebody to head our credit and risk in the SME space. So we have the team in place now. Between now and the end of the year, we hope to be able to get a robust blueprint that we can start building out.</p>
          <p>On the wealth space as well, very similar. We spent time over the last quarter getting the team in place. So we have a new head for private bank, we have a new Chief Operating Officer for the private bank. We just hired a new Chief Investment Officer for the bank and the treasury space we announced today. We've got the key team leaders in each of our country businesses, so the team is very much in place. And over the next couple of quarters, we hope to be able to leverage that to start building out and building up on that wealth platform.</p>
          <p>The third business thing we said we'd focus on was GTS and T&amp;M, i.e., we needed these as cross-sell products to make sure we improve the quality of our returns. We've done the same thing in GTS, the third area where we built out a team. So we've got a far more robust team than we had including a new head for the business and new sales head for the business, sales head for the Singapore business, GTS heads for China, Taiwan, we've added a lot of appropriate people. But on the GTS front, we actually started seeing early progress as well.</p>
          <p>As China started to move consciously and more rapidly internationalizing the renminbi effectively, particularly our trade in Hong Kong. We've capitalized and jumped on that very quickly and we've been quite pleased. So we've been able to do a lot of the renminbi trade settlement business. We've added accounts, we've added customers, we did about $600 million in renminbi trade loans out of Hong Kong in this quarter, which of course also resulted in increased renminbi deposits in China. So it's been a good end-to-end piece.</p>
          <p>We've also focused and done well this quarter in the commodity trade business. We've always been an active player in the business with companies like Wilmar and Olam and globally with companies like Bancorp and Retal, but we've been able to give it another thrust and increase momentum. On the TNM side, treasury side, we've started building out the commodity derivatives capability so we can marry the commodity trade financing business with the commodity trade risk management business, exposure management business, so there's been good progress.</p>
          <p>On TNM in general, we're quite pleased that one of our things was to increase our customer revenues and increase cross sell on the Treasury side. As Sok Hui pointed out, what we call trading income is up nicely 21%, but what's really pleasing is that the bulk of that growth is customer revenues. So we've had extremely strong customer flow more than half of that trading income is actually customer revenues and it's been 45% up quarter-on-quarter. And it's across, very good cross sell in Hong Kong, very good cross sell in China, improving cross sell in Singapore, improving cross sell in India. So we're quite pleased with how that is working and proceeding.</p>
          <p>Moving to the last thing, I want to talk little bit about, on the customer experience piece, I said this is a big part of what we want to do and particularly in Singapore it's hugely important to us because of our dominant consumer retail footprint in Singapore. And I'm quite pleased with the progress we're making on that front. We've got our customer experience council, we've got two people who lead that council. We're focused on running a range of improvement projects. I've put up a couple of here as examples. So for the POSB queues as you know are hot buttons. We've set up a target for ourselves that 80% of our POSB customers should be serviced within 15 minutes.</p>
          <p>Now these are not the best targets in the world, but relative to where we're coming from, there are dramatic, dramatic improvement. And what's very pleasing to us is for the last two months, May and June, we made those targets. So our average customer wait time is now down to eight or nine minutes and we made the 80% target. What's also pleasing is we're doing it intelligently. We didn't do it just like throwing warm bodies in the problem, we did add some people. But we ran a range of process improvement channels to see what we could do to improve the experience. So things like using your ATM card to withdraw cash, even at the counter, even if you don't want to go to the ATM, you want to come to the counter so instead of getting you to fill a form we use your card. Things like putting passbook printing machines along the queue counter, so you can do that and do your passbook printing before you come to the counter.</p>
          <p>We ran a whole project to look at how we could improve the foreign worker account opening process. The foreign worker account opening tends to clog up a lot of our branches. We crashed that account opening turnaround time significantly. So we've been able to create capacity and that swing in these numbers. We've also done that, focus on trying to improve and extend our branch opening times so that people can go in bank in the evening and so we've done that. This is resulted in a substantial drop in our average queue times in several of our branches.</p>
          <p>We did the same thing on the ATMs. ATMs in Singapore are hot buttons for our clients and for us. We saw in December, we had 240 ATMs, which were hot spots, i.e. the monthly transaction in the ATM was more than 30,000. I think I mentioned before, average transaction globally is about 7000. So if you're dealing with more than 30,000, you're going to have queues. And we are systematically adding ATMs first space in the hotspots to bring that down. So for the last this thing we're now down to about 170 hotspots from the 240 that we had. We added 75 ATMs and we went systematically to where we thought we could get leverage. But the same thing, like in the branch queues, we've also done &#x2013; made a lot of progress changing the process. So we've shortened the time for transaction by 11 to 15 seconds by just doing things the way the process is managed and how the ATMs work. And our ATM availability is continuing to creep up. So that's a good thing. We started moving and filling up ATMs at night, instead of during daytime and that obviously helps with the availability and the turnaround time and so on, so without belaboring the point.</p>
          <p>We're quite pleased with the progress we're making on the customer experience front across every dimensions and obviously we have a long way to go. But overall what makes us feel good about the second quarter is that every one of the strategic areas that we're focused on, we're seeing progress. And in many of those cases that progress is they need to show up in underlying drivers, in our assets, in our liabilities, in our overall financial numbers. And so if we can keep the momentum and the progress going through the rest of this year, we're pretty confident that that we will have a good year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We do it every six months. In every six months we do a projection for what is the future earnings potential of this business and compare it with what you have. We've been very prudent in terms of forecasting going forward what we think the potential of the business is. And therefore given everything today, I don't anticipate having to take more goodwill charges. If we did, we would have taken the extra thing at this point of time.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The accounting thing, again you do this analysis every six months or whenever, in our case every six months. So at any period of time when you think there is a mismatch between your holding cost of the asset and what you think the future value of the asset is, you take it in that quarter. So this wasn't a premeditated thing, the analysis showed up that this is likely to be of less value than we have it on our books so you recognize it at the point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question. No questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Question Inaudible] found that the long-term growth rate has fallen to 4.5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unchanged from all the previous projections. So this 4.5% represents the long-term growth rate of any country, because with this cash flow model, you're simulating for a very long period of time. So that would be the benchmark that reflects the long-term growth rate of the business that we are in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talk about moderation. So I was just wanting to know, what was the previous projection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in this model that we use, we do not change the long-term growth rate, we do not change the discount rate that we use. These are all consistent with what we've disclosed in our previous annual report. What has changed is really the cash flow assumption. So basically, what you project to be your earning in the first five years and then after that, the earnings basically have a growth path. So, it's the earnings projection that has changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way the model works, and this is the larger question. You assume to have good visibility over five years. So for the first five years, you can actually take a look at the business and project what the cash flows are likely to be. Then beyond that, after five years, as a general model, you impute a macroeconomic view for what will the country and the business likely to grow at. So five years onwards, that number is 4.5% and we've always used 4.5%. Actually, we checked, the market uses about 4 to 4.5%. In fact, 4.5 is the top end of this thing. So what really we've gone back and revisited is our cash flow assumptions in the first five years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from our previous assessment in December 2009, we basically had cash flows that we simulate looking out five years. So those cash flow projections have been reduced. That's what it means, right?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. It's a model that we basically built in to the projection year-to-year, but like Piyush said, actually the five-year growth is actually still pretty healthy, in terms of what we have put in.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking a question from gentleman back there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Chris Wright for Euromoney Magazine. You spoke of rebalancing the geographic mix of the businesses. What roughly is the geographic split today in terms of the contribution of non-Singapore and Hong Kong businesses to earnings? And do you have a target in mind for where you want that to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, we're actually quite public about this early in the year, if you remember. Our current earnings are about 62% in Singapore, about 22 in Hong Kong and the balance &#x2013; India is about 8 or 9, China is 2, 3 <mark type="inaudible" />, something in the order of magnitude that we have. And we said over the medium term, over the next 5, 7 years, we really like to be able to get to a more balanced mix of something like 40-30-30.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And nothing has changed in the last six months since that announcement, in terms of the likely contribution of businesses within that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it hasn't. It's a directional statement. We don't have specifics about what's going to happen, but our view is again colored by the fact that if you want to be an Asia player, which we want to be, and you think about Asia 10 years from now and what you want to be then, it's reasonable to say, you want to get a third of your business from the China story, a third of your business from Southeast Asia and South Asia and Singapore, because it's so big, can be an anchor. So that's really what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Given that the &#x2013; I'm Julie from Channel NewsAsia. Given that the home loans <mark type="inaudible" /> still very low, what is the impact on your home loans business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We find that the mortgage growth has actually been quite healthy. So housing loans grew by some 2 billion in Singapore this time around. So there has been some mim compression as the loans that we take on could have lower use compared to the loans that are running off. So on the whole, because of the increased volume that we take on, the net interest income is actually quite stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the other thing we've said, you know, we're advantaged, we can do fixed loans for a longer tenure. So we do a three year and five year fixed rate product. And that the fixed rate loans, they're actually quite attractive to our customers and that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Syed from Reuters. I have a small question. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The punishment for beeping just now Syed, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've basically said, talked about funding strength in the Hong Kong market and obviously you've given a bit of color why this is happening, also the dollar supplied globally Europe prices. My question is, because the funding constraints are still, there's still uncertainty over the global economy. What's your sense, has it changed your outlook for this year, for the second half of this year? And if it has, what are you expecting, anticipating in terms of earnings? Can you sustain these earnings? These are record numbers. Give us some direction on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. I think, our own view is that there will be a slowdown in the second half of the year and frankly, across the board. Singapore had an astronomical first-half, it's very unlikely that you'll see anything near those growth rates for the second half of the year, but Singapore is not alone. I think the slowdown is already frankly, visible. If you look at anecdotally, the last couple of months around the region, including China, we're begin to see evidence of a slowing down in demand. So general view is that there will be some slowdown in the second half of the year overall. It's unlikely that you can expect to see Asia. Frankly, the global economy and Asia on the back of that keep the growth rates that were there in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of our own business, if you look at the lot of the drivers I spoke to you about, many of the drivers are market share gains, right. So even though we think the overall business climate will be slow, we think we can continue to gain share in several of the businesses that we are in. We will be challenged in some lines, already if you look at by line of business, our consumer retail business will be challenged. It already is somewhat. We don't expect that to bump back in hurry, because that's tightly linked to the level of interest-rates and SIBOR and IO spreads and so on, so that will be challenged. On the other hand, we're continuing to see extremely good penetration into our corporate customer base around the region. At the top end as well as in the SME market. So we hope to be able to make up some of that on the corporate side of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Could you give us an update on the investigation on the ATM disruptions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So we are still in the middle of doing a more movie we've got eight investigations, I mean on the ATM incident. We are investigating every which way you can imagine right, in terms of what &#x2013; so I think some portions of the investigation are more complete. We're quite clear now about the nature of the incident and really it reconfirms what we'd earlier understood and frankly what we had explained to the media earlier in terms of how that incident occurred and why that incident occurred.</p>
          <p>It is as we said, a pretty routine technical repair job on the machine and it was just badly handled through an incorrect and incomplete set of instructions, and that's how it goes on. What &#x2013; our investigation is now focused on, is a whole range of other things, including what can we do to improve the process of the technical solutions, other process solutions, are there other kinds of things we need to look at in terms of making sure the greater resiliency and so on, and those investigations are ongoing, they will take us the next several weeks to get them all anchored down and at base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The worst-case scenario, in terms of regulatory action on DBS. What is the worst; is it some kind of fine or what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no idea. So, I have no idea at all, what's the worst case scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your discussions with regulator, this has not been laid out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think both the regulator and we are waiting to make sure that we get a complete handle on everything that we're investigating before we get into that discussion or dialog. I think it will run in a few weeks. So I think the several investigations running in parallel, so it will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I just want to come back to your home loan, because you said that internally, although the economies in the region will be slowing down, as everybody has forecast, but internally you see that not having an impact of on you, because your growth is on gaining market share. So your loan growth for the full year expect to remain in double-digit, as you had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, unlikely. So I say one because the balance of businesses and mix. I think our loan growth won't &#x2013; is unlikely to be able to keep at same levels we've had. We grew &#x2013; so far, our loan growth has been 12% if I remember, 9% over the quarter. And so my own guess is that loan growth over the second half of the year will be shared more muted than that. I'm hopeful that we were managed to average a double-digit loan growth for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Harsha from State Times. I just wanted to check in relation to the ATM downtime. Has DBS taken any action at all against IBM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're looking with IBM collaboratively right now, to try and figure out what steps need to be taken for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's done. Last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you tell us a bit about what you think, or where you see, your net interest margins going over the next 12 months, given the pressure that we've been talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you really look at our negative margins, even though the headline net interest margins looked there off &#x2013; like they're off by about 9 basis points quarter-on-quarter, large chunk of that, about five, six basis points, is actually a reshuffling of our securities portfolio. So we went out of some high yielding paper and all the rupiyah, some corporate debt and went into some high yielding, low yielding with high quality treasury paper. So the real impact on our NIMs, which is deposit and loan related, was about 3 basis points. Some of that was funding related, because as I said the funding &#x2013; this thing have been changing and some of that was loan related, mostly mortgages, because it keeps edging down over time.</p>
          <p>My own guess is that NIM will be about in that range, so if you exclude the securities impact, so two, three basis points of NIM compression you're likely to see, but about there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the line growth, you were talking about before, you don't expect double-digit for second half, or &#x2013; that's correct or you still expect double-digit growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't expect double-digit for the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> just on Hong Kong, again, what do you expect to be growth drivers for the countries interest market, I expect it will be compressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, principal growth drivers frankly are around the China play. There is a huge China play in Hong Kong. If you look at the business in Hong Kong, they're integrating very tightly with China. So in the corporate side, I told you both ends. We are doing most of our business as China companies coming out. Red Chips the top end of the thing and the mid-tiers. And we're finding we have a very unique position, which is why we made such good progress in three, four, six months with that space, because we can bring these companies out into the region.</p>
          <p>We also found that in the mid-cap, the privately-owned, not the last date on the privately-owned mid-cap China companies, our capital markets and investor strength is a significant differentiator, which why we've been able to add such a large number of mandatory rapidly. So we clearly have a play there.</p>
          <p>We also have the companies going in from Asia into China. Many of them use Hong Kong as a route, they establish something in Hong Kong and they go in. And so we're doing a lot of working with Hong Kong-centric when moving into China with them. And both of those are being actually extremely strong.</p>
          <p>Wealth management. The business have been muted, appetite has not been there, but really Hong Kong continues to a center of wealth management for the region. And the large wealth flows both from China and from local Hong Kong, we expect that to continue to be a significant diver of growth. So there should be business, wealth management, it will be anchored in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>We've talked about organic low-hanging fruit for growth and what you're seeing on the other side, other opportunities in the &#x2013; in organic growth?</p>

          <p>Again said before, this part of this thing open to all kinds of opportunities. And certainly, over the next three, five years, we will be looking at in organic opportunities and, frankly, some of this depends on the regulation, as the regulatory environment lightens up and changes, I think, more opportunities will show up than currently on the amber. But if your &#x2013; or the timeframes you have in mind, yeah, we think there will be opportunities.</p>
