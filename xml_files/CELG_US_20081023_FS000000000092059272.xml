        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our results for the quarter, which encompassed a 68% increase in total revenue, to $587 million, led by a 72% increase in REVLIMID to $343 million, a 50% increase in VIDAZA to $64 million, overall resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>We made great advances in the quarter, financially, operationally, clinically, commercially and strategically. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with a strategic perspective, then turn it over to Dave for a detailed financial review of the quarter, and Bob for an operational perspective and review.</p>
          <p>We now have three important commercial therapies poised for long-term growth, in addition to a promising and exciting pipeline. Our lead product REVLIMID has a multi-billion dollar global potential in hematological malignancies and potentially solid tumors. Our newest compound, VIDAZA, has excellent prospects in MDS and is poised for global leadership in this indication.</p>
          <p>Multiple product launches to more than 65 countries are on plan, bringing us closer to our goal of delivering disease altering therapies to patients in nearly 100 countries over the next five years. The commercial launches of REVLIMID, thalidomide and VIDAZA will continue to support the ambitious goal of nearly 60% growth year-over-year by exceeding our total revenue forecast for 2008 of $2.2 billion, and earnings of $1.50.</p>
          <p>Celgene is strategically positioned to deliver superior top line and bottom line growth for years to come. We are now in an extraordinarily positive position, having become a global hematology oncology powerhouse. We have become a major hematology company in the EU and US with three major products, having the preeminent position in our current areas of focus, multiple myeloma and MDS.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are strengthening this position with progress towards expanding our REVLIMID label to include the important indications and major markets of newly diagnosed myeloma, with both aggressive and Phase III pivotal filing strategies, chronic lymphocytic leukemia with FDA approval and initiation of our first pivotal trial in maintenance therapy and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with FDA approval and initiation of our first pivotal trial in mantle cell lymphoma later this quarter.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, our hematology trials include maintenance therapy where REVLIMID's oral convenience, efficacy and safety and lack of cumulative toxicity make it a unique drug to investigate in this critical indication. The broad biological activity of REVLIMID can also expand into other hematological malignancies and solid tumors.</p>
          <p>With the a near term anticipated approval of VIDAZA in the EU, we will have the first therapy for MDS in 29 countries in Europe, and the only therapy proven to increase overall survival. Additionally, we are progressing with the launch of REVLIMID and thalidomide in the EU throughout the remainder of 2008 and 2009. Our operations have resulted in exceptional financial strength, a critical asset in these turbulent times. Our cash exceeds $2 billion. Our tax structure is among the best in the industry. Our cash flow exceeds $200 million per quarter. We have no debt and our business prospects are solid.</p>
          <p>We have maximized our financial opportunity for VIDAZA towards realizing its full commercial potential, by the purchase of the VIDAZA royalty stream from Pfizer. This allows us to realize the full commercial benefit of this product. We have also vertically integrated our manufacturing for REVLIMID and thalidomide and are planning to do so for VIDAZA, resulting in significant strategic and financial advantages.</p>
          <p>Moreover, being cognizant of the turbulent political and economic times we are in, it is a most fortunate position for us to be in to have life-saving therapies and we're supporting such by building a state-of-the-art global health economics capability. Our patient access programs have been rated among the best and we are among the most generous in helping patients, ensuring availability of our critical drugs.</p>
          <p>Our financial and commercial strength provides us the resources to advance our deep and diversified pipeline encompassing Celgene discovered compounds including first in class molecular entities and our programs and partnerships with cutting-edge science based companies. We have made progress in advancing our proprietary IMiD compound franchise including pomalidomide which is demonstrating activity in multiple myeloma and potentially myelofibrosis.</p>
          <p>Additionally and significantly we advanced our anti-inflammatory franchise with the Celgene discovered compounds apremilast and CC-11050. Apremilast has demonstrated promising activity in a controlled Phase II trial in moderate to severe psoriasis, is in trials in psoriatic arthritis and recalcitrant psoriasis, which is now fully enrolled and is in a broad based program as an oral TNF-alpha agent.</p>
          <p>We expect to see additional top line data for apremilast in 2009. Additionally, CC-11050, our next PDE-4 TNF-alpha has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in healthy human volunteers and will be evaluated in a number of these diseases. Our promising first-in-class JNK inhibitor CC-930 has now advanced to a Phase Ib study and has a significant therapeutic potential and a wide range of indications encompassing important unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>We also advanced our proprietary IMiD compound 10015 with a filing of an IND for evaluation for safety in scleroderma, accelerating our strategy of developing this class for serious autoimmune and inflammatory illnesses in additions to our core strength in hematology oncology. Furthermore, our landmark for this quarter was the filing of an IND for our proprietary placental stem cell based therapy initially for Crohn's disease.</p>
          <p>We continue to make exciting progress in the field of placental derived stem cell research where we are a pioneer in the manufacturing, research and development of these proprietary biological agents in human disease. Our commercial and financial strength allows us to be opportunistic as we identify companies, technologies and products which can advance our overall strategy.</p>
          <p>One of our exciting partnerships is with Acceleron where a Phase II clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the very high potential active inhibitor, ACE-011, a fundamentally unique bone anabolic agent to treat cancer related bone loss initially in multiple myeloma. We are excited by the potential of this compound to provide profoundly different therapeutic effects across a range of indications, including osteoporosis where we expect data at the International Osteoporosis Foundation annual meeting in December and indeed, in other indications.</p>
          <p>The advancement of collaborative programs reflect our corporate objective of ensuring the diversification of our pipeline towards unique and high potential novel mechanisms, exemplified by exciting partnerships with Array BioPharma in both oncology and immunology and with PTC Therapeutics, encompassing a new and unique mechanistic approach towards oncology therapeutics.</p>
          <p>We have also taken equity positions in cutting edge private companies focused on new science and compounds, having transformational potential in the treatment of serious diseases. These and other programs address our corporate objective of ensuring the strategic and science-based diversification of our pipeline. We look forward to the upcoming American Society of Hematology meeting, where we expect data for REVLIMID, VIDAZA, thalidomide and our pipeline.</p>
          <p>We have grown and diversified our commercial activities and revenue by this successful global expansion with operations in place around the world and the achievement of important approvals in Europe, Australia, Latin America and Canada. We have expanded our operational capabilities to new markets in Eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific, setting the stage for longer term successes in these emerging regions. As we move closer to our goal of providing our therapies in more than 100 countries over the next five years beginning in 2009.</p>
          <p>We are committed to realize our significant long-term growth potential, and to help improve and extend the lives of patients worldwide. I am also very pleased with the progress we've made in completing the Pharmion integration. Our original assumptions regarding the strategic, human resource, commercial, clinical and financial driving forces have been validated.</p>
          <p>Our sales forces have been merged into an effective and industry leading team. The two leading products have advanced with the approval of thalidomide in Europe, the label expansion of VIDAZA in the US and its anticipated approval in the EU. We are advancing Amrubicin in a global Phase III pivotal trial for the treatment of small cell lung cancer. All of this has resulted in a focused world leading hematology oncology company, with a diverse and potent pipeline in cancer and inflammation.</p>
          <p>In summary, Celgene is now in a fortunate position. Our business is strong; our drugs exceptional and saving lives; our research, exciting and productive; our expansion, steady throughout the world, diversifying our commercial activities and growing our business; our regulatory and clinical programs advancing; our finances strong with multiple revenue streams; our tax structure very favorable; our manufacturing integrated and seamless; and our people among the very best in the industry. We are in an enviable position as we look to the next several years with a sense of confidence and pride.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to David Gryska who will present an overview of our financial results for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sol. The third quarter revenues and earnings reached a new high, despite some seasonalities and a foreign exchange headwind. During the quarter we substantially increased revenue and earnings and continued our global expansion with more products in more countries, building a solid foundation for sustained growth worldwide.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter we reported non-GAAP total revenue of $587 million, an increase of 68% year-over-year. Total non-GAAP product sales increased to $561 million for the third quarter, up 69% from $331 million in the year ago quarter. The increase was due to the growth of REVLIMID, the addition of VIDAZA to the product portfolio, and THALOMID thalidomide sales.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.40 as Sol stated for the quarter, and $1.13 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008. We believe our results demonstrate our commitment and ability to maximize our global commercial and regulatory opportunities in the long-term, while still providing shareholders with impressive bottom line growth.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to discuss some expense trends as compared to the prior quarter. During the third quarter, we increased funding of R&amp;D to advance clinical development of our pipeline and support global regulatory filings. These increased expenses support clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs, including significant incremental investment for the advancement of REVLIMID in NHL and CLL, the development of Amrubicin, pomalidomide, Apremilast and our ongoing collaboration with Acceleron.</p>
          <p>As a point of reference our non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses were $385 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, which demonstrates our substantial support for R&amp;D programs.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased, as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to realized Pharmion merger synergies of the commercial organization. SG&amp;A is expected to increase in the fourth quarter in support of the relaunch of VIDAZA in the US with its improved survival label, launch preparations for VIDAZA in Europe, and ongoing European product launches of REVLIMID and thalidomide.</p>
          <p>We expect total non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the year to be between 605 to $610 million. The global integration process of Pharmion is nearly complete. We will incur one time integration costs primarily related to SG&amp;A and clinical expenses of approximately $30 million in 2008 of which approximately $26 million has been spent year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter was approximately 89%, compared to approximately 88% in the prior quarter. The expansion in gross margin was primarily due to a change in product mix. For the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to be near 90%.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes, our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 24%, which is consistent with the prior quarter. Due to increasing international profitability, we expect a slight decrease in the tax rate for the next quarter.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, as you know, the dollar strengthened as compared to the euro. In terms of sequential foreign exchange effect on revenues, the impact of foreign exchange on third quarter 2008 represents about 1% of total revenue for the quarter.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we enhanced our foreign currency hedging program and expect all aspects of this program to be in place over the next two quarters. In addition to hedging balance sheet foreign currency exposures during the third quarter, we began hedging our exposure related to inter-company foreign currency transactions and had a slight benefit as a result of those activities.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we began hedging a portion of our exposure to euro-based product sales. As our international operations grow, our objective is to minimize revenue and earnings exposure to foreign currency volatility and to further refine predictability of our financial performance.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to discuss a significant fourth quarter transaction involving VIDAZA. VIDAZA has a royalty obligation payable to Pfizer. Analyst projections indicate that gross payments of the VIDAZA royalty obligation over the next 10 years are estimated to exceed $1 billion. In the first week of October, we bought out the future royalty obligation from Pfizer for $425 million. Approximately 325 million of this amount will be expensed in the fourth quarter because it relates to international VIDAZA, which is not yet approved. The remaining 100 million of the payment relates to US rights, which will be capitalized. As a result of this transaction, we now have no other obligation to pay royalties on VIDAZA including oral formulations. In addition, we expect to see improvement in our VIDAZA gross margins with the anticipated international launch of the product in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>And now, a few words about our cash flows and balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. We expect this balance to be approximately $2.2 billion by the end of the year, after taking into consideration the VIDAZA royalty transaction.</p>
          <p>Moreover, our cash and marketable securities do not include any subprime mortgage-backed securities, credit derivatives, collateral debt obligations and auction rate preferred investments. Our cash is invested in high grade, US government and government agency securities and in money market funds. We have incurred no impairment charges related to our cash and marketable securities for the year. In addition, we have no debt.</p>
          <p>Next we want to iterate our strong financial outlook for 2008. Based on strong financial performance for the first nine months and greater visibility around commercial and regulatory developments and timelines, we expect total global revenue to exceed our earlier guidance of $2.2 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share should also exceed our earnings guidance of $1.50 for the year. In conclusion, we believe our strong financial standing will enable us to maximize our commercial, clinical and regulatory potential in markets around the world, and will support superior top line and bottom line long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will expand on the global, commercial, clinical and regulatory achievements of the third quarter, and give us a look as to what's coming up for the fourth quarter and beyond.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Dave and Sol have provided you with a good review of the results of the quarter and an overview of the business strategy that guides us. For the next few minutes, I'll give you a more granular and operating view of our quarterly results, and to connect these results to our key corporate objectives and to our positive outlook for our businesses over the next several years.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we made excellent progress towards our key corporate goal of maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID. Let me begin with a review of our commercial activities. You already heard the numbers, 72% increase in year-over-year revenue, $955 million of REVLIMID sales in the first nine months of the year. And with an encouraging start to the fourth quarter, REVLIMID revenue is now over $1 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>There are several other important metrics from our major markets that provide insight on the relative strength of the REVLIMID commercial performance and give us confidence that we have excellent growth opportunities within our approved indications. In the US, REVLIMID myeloma prescriptions grew by 7.5% quarter-over-quarter despite the summer months, economic uncertainty and the full impact of the VELCADE launch of its expanded newly diagnosed myeloma label.</p>
          <p>This strong performance was fueled by excellent demand for REVLIMID across all lines of myeloma therapy including the front line sector, where the continued positive response to the presentation of the ECOG and SWOG data at major medical meetings affects physician practice. Despite the strong market share increases of the past year, we see the opportunity for continued market share gains in the US.</p>
          <p>Our optimistic outlook on the role of the US market in growing REVLIMID to its full potential is illustrated in the treatment duration data generated this past quarter. Our analysis indicates that during the quarter, average REVLIMID duration of therapy in myeloma continued its march upward, adding another half month of duration since our last call, now averaging 9.5 months.</p>
          <p>This steady constant increase in duration is reflective of the durability of patient responses and the long-term tolerability of the drug, leading to its extended use. The potential of further increases in treatment duration offers significant additional upside in the US myeloma market for REVLIMID.</p>
          <p>To further support REVLIMID's market position we're committed to expanding our label's indications to include the newly diagnosed patient population as soon as possible. We're proceeding on multiple paths to achieve this objective. We have fully accrued MM015, our melphalan Prednisone REVLIMID versus melphalan Prednisone Phase III trial, which we believe may have regulatory utility in both the US and in international markets.</p>
          <p>In the US, we now have the ECOG and SWOG data in-house and are going through final data quality checks and queries prior to our presentation of the data to the FDA for the discussion of its potential usefulness as a regulatory filing.</p>
          <p>In addition to the significant continued opportunity in the United States, we view the international markets as major growth opportunities for REVLIMID in myeloma and other indications over the next several years. The growth in international markets should come from market share gains in existing markets, usage in earlier stages of disease, territorial expansion through new regulatory and reimbursement approvals and ultimately for an extended duration of therapy.</p>
          <p>Though confronted with a foreign exchange headwind, usual summer seasonal patterns, and expected price reductions, REVLIMID revenue grew in Europe with volume gains of nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter. Euro weakness and expected price reductions had an approximately $17 million impact on third quarter results.</p>
          <p>The volume increases reflect the continued market share gains made in major European markets. Across Europe, REVLIMID has achieved strong initial positioning with significant upside as it moves from a substantial third line position to a leader in the second line of therapy in many countries.</p>
          <p>There are also a number of important markets in which we have not yet filed for regulatory approval or are awaiting regulatory or reimbursement decisions. We were very pleased that earlier this month, Health Canada approved REVLIMID for previously treated multiple myeloma and look forward to positive provincial reimbursement decisions in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>We have regulatory filings under review in multiple countries including Russia and Turkey, and plan to file for myeloma in Japan in the first half of next year. Though launch in Japan is not scheduled until sometime in 2010, we believe that it could become our second largest individual market in a reasonably short period of time.</p>
          <p>We are awaiting reimbursement outcomes in Australia and the UK in the coming months. Though we expect a negative initial night assessment, we look forward to reviewing the issues that could lead to a positive final assessment in the first quarter of 2009. All-in-all, the REVLIMID commercial results for the quarter were solid, and in the context of the challenges of the quarter, they were quite strong.</p>
          <p>Our clinical commitment to the myeloma market is strongly evidenced by the recent initiation of the largest newly diagnosed multiple myeloma trial ever undertaken. MM020, the 1,590 patient trial evaluating REV/Dex versus melphalan Prednisone thalidomide in the upfront myeloma setting has begun to accrue significant numbers of patients reflecting the international enthusiasm for these highly effective oral treatment regimens.</p>
          <p>We are also advancing several important REVLIMID trials designed to demonstrate its value proposition and survival advantage in the maintenance setting, essential for the appropriate longer term positioning of the drug. Data from these large Phase III cooperative group studies is expected in 2009.</p>
          <p>Though multiple myeloma is the key driver of REVLIMID revenue today, our press release this morning highlighted the significant progress being achieved in examining REVLIMID's potential in other hematological malignancies. Specifically, we have initiated our first pivotal Phase III CLL registration trial. This study, which received SPA approval in September and is named the CONTINUUM trial, is designed to prove that REVLIMID when given as a maintenance therapy in patients after second line therapy, prolongs progression free and overall survival.</p>
          <p>Investigators have stated that REVLIMID is particularly attractive as a maintenance therapy in CLL because of the efficacy it has shown in previous trials, its safety profile and oral convenience. This registration study will take place in over 200 sites around the world, and will include approximately 680 patients. This is the first in a series of registration trials we will be conducting to investigate REVLIMID's role as a standard treatment for patients with CLL.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we're also pleased that REVLIMID as a treatment for CLL is now compendia listed, offering patients an additional path to its clinical benefits. Important new data is expected at ASH in CLL which we will believe will further broaden knowledge of REVLIMID's potential in CLL and assist in the rapid accrual of our global regulatory programs.</p>
          <p>The progress of REVLIMID in NHL is on a similar pace. Data from NHL-002, our Phase II study of REVLIMID in heavily pretreated patients with aggressive subtypes of NHL were published in the October edition of Journal of Clinical Oncology. These data demonstrated an overall response rate of 35% and a 53% response rate in a subset of patients with mantle cell lymphoma. We're looking forward to the presentation of updated data from NHL-003, our Phase II multi-center, single-arm, open-label study of REVLIMID in patients with relapsed refractory aggressive NHL at ASH.</p>
          <p>Similarly to CLL, we will be initiating several trials in the area of mantel cell lymphoma and other NHL populations in the coming months. The first of these are Phase II EMERGED registration trial received SPA approval during the quarter, and we anticipate enrollment of the first patient in the next three months. The EMERGED trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of REVLIMID in approximately 130 previously treated mantel cell lymphoma patients.</p>
          <p>We're also encouraged by the growing global cooperative group support for our expanding NHL program. Recently published and soon to be presented data should also assist in further acceleration of our NHL program. To give you a sense of our commitment to expanding REVLIMID into CLL and NHL, there are now over 65 REVLIMID trials completing, accruing or soon to be initiated in these indications.</p>
          <p>We are indeed fortunate that our product portfolio includes another breakthrough hematology oncology product with significant growth potential, VIDAZA. VIDAZA revenue for the quarter rose to $64 million, which represents a 50% increase over the year-ago quarter. In late August, the FDA approved the addition of the survival data from the AZA-001 trial into the VIDAZA label in the United States.</p>
          <p>This trial demonstrated a nearly doubling of the two-year survival rate to over 50% for higher risk MDS patients treated with VIDAZA and a 24-month median survival versus a 15-month median survival for the conventional care arm. The US relaunch of VIDAZA began in earnest in the middle of September. Positive trends have begun to emerge in just the first few weeks.</p>
          <p>These market share gains have been driven in large part by the ability to promote the exceptional survival data and the increasing awareness of the failed EORTC trial for decitibine. A focused sales and marketing effort led by our specialized MDS sales team is making a difference. We expect further data presentations at ASH and peer-reviewed publications to aid in this effort over the coming months.</p>
          <p>We believe that VIDAZA has especially high growth potential in Europe. We're following regulatory approval, will be the beneficiary of 10 years of orphan drug regulatory exclusivity. This potential was the driving factor behind our decision to buy out the royalty on VIDAZA. We will now capture the full benefit from our commercial activities over the coming 10 years.</p>
          <p>Before we can begin our VIDAZA commercial activities in Europe, we obviously require regulatory approval. We're very optimistic that we will receive a positive recommendation from the EMEA imminently and a full approval from the European Commission in a couple of months.</p>
          <p>On the REVLIMID MDS front we're anticipating the database lock of the MDS-004 trial before the end of the year. This study is our Phase III multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled three-arm study of two doses of REVLIMID versus placebo in deletion 5q MDS patients.</p>
          <p>Though REVLIMID and VIDAZA are the key growth drivers for Celgene, we're making steady progress navigating the country-by-country health ministry sign off procedures required for approval of risk management and reimbursement authorizations in the major European countries for thalidomide. We expect that we'll be able to begin active commercial activities in these major markets late this year and in the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>To achieve our corporate objective of producing high long-term growth, we're also focused on leveraging the clinical, regulatory and commercial potential of multiple promising compounds in our pipeline. Sol outlined the significant progress achieved in advancing this promising pipeline including pomalidomide, our lead anti-inflammatory compounds, our proprietary placental stem cell program, our high potential external collaborations and other promising earlier stage research activities. We're fortunate to have multiple promising programs that offer transformational potential.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, we are on track to exceed the ambitious financial and corporate goals that we set for our global team at the beginning of the year. Though we're all well aware of the many challenges of difficult economic times, we believe that our business model is sound and that we are in fact strategically positioned to gain a competitive advantage during periods of economic uncertainty. Our powerful lead products REVLIMID and VIDAZA, our strong commercial clinical research and regulatory organizations, our promising pipeline, and strong financial profile, allow us to focus on building exceptional long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention during our presentations. And now I'll ask the operator to open up the call to questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go first to Katherine Kim with Banc of America Securities.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have several questions. The first is for David. Can you just talk about the Pfizer royalty stream that you bought back? What is the effect on your &#x2013; if you can give us some detail on the effect on your internal EPS projections over time? And then the second question is the hedging strategy that you put in place, if you can discuss a little bit more detail on the hedging strategy, in terms of its impact on revenues in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the first question on VIDAZA, as I said in the prepared remarks, of the $425 million payment we wrote off &#x2013; or we expensed 325 million of that which relates to international VIDAZA because the product is not yet approved, although we expect approval any day now. As a result of that, we're not going to be seeing any inclusion of that potential, of that royalty in the cost of goods sold. So that obviously helps earnings on a go-forward basis. The second part I think of this also is of that $325 million that relates to international, some of that relates to the &#x2013; our international cash, so we're able to use our international cash more effectively without triggering a taxable event, all right. So I can't quantify for you today what the impact will be on EPS because we're still evaluating it, but there will not be a element in cost of goods sold of this royalty on a go forward basis which is approximately 20%, okay.</p>
          <p>Part two, on the hedging strategy. The hedging strategy we have is really three parts, Katherine. First, is we hedge our balance sheet risk which we've been doing now for two or three quarters. Number two, we hedge our inter-company risk, which is our cash flows. We're doing a really good job of that. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have slight benefit from that of about $3 million, which helped on the overall operating results. And finally, we have started to hedge our revenue exposure. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we started to look at our euro revenue exposure and we hedge less than 50% of that. But as we continue to roll out our strategies over the next two quarters, we'll look at other currencies in different countries like Australia or let's say Swiss francs or pounds. So the strategy is good. We have a very good strategy in place, some very good programs in place and quarter-over-quarter, we expect to keep moving out and hedging more and more of the revenue as we move out in the international arena.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. A follow-up on VIDAZA, two questions. Following European approval, can you give us a sense for the rollout picture and how that looks? Is that similar to REVLIMID or faster, just given broader compassionate use. And then the second part is, I guess to ask the VIDAZA question a little bit more specifically, after you pay down the royalties or after you buy them back, what will be your approximate gross margins be for VIDAZA? Is it closer to REVLIMID or closer to THALOMID? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I'll answer the latter part of the question first. As it relates to international VIDAZA, with the payoff of the royalties, the international piece of this, we would expect the gross margins to be -- because now all we're just dealing with is the actual cost of producing the product with no royalty, we would expect the gross margins to be kind of in that 92 to 93% range, okay, not as good as REVLIMID but obviously very good. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Geoff, on the rollout in Europe of VIDAZA, so if we receive the positive recommendation shortly and then two months later we would anticipate the European Commission, now we can begin the process of pricing and reimbursement in all those markets. I think on the balance, the rollout is going to in fact be very similar to the rollout of REVLIMID. I think on some fronts it will be a little bit quicker in the sense I think we have a stronger organization today and really understand how we need to deal with these individual countries. On the other hand, MDS is a much less developed market in Europe in the sense that you don't see a lot of active treatment and so there's an awful lot of watch and wait. So there's a more intense education process going to be required there. So, on the balance, as I look at things, I think we really feel that we'll have some positives in terms of the rollout but I think it will be very similar over time in the sense of what has happened with the REVLIMID rollout.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Charles Duncan with JMP Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for the question and congratulations on a good year-on-year financial performance. I wanted to perhaps fast forward one to three years on REVLIMID. Despite Bob's overview, how do you see the REVLIMID market potential and the key factors driving growth? Also, if you could give a little bit more color on what is encouraging to you as you look at the early fourth quarter performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a number of things. And I think it's &#x2013; the, when we look at REVLIMID over the next couple of years, the US is two things. We've made good market share gains very clearly of the couple of years that we've been on the market since approval in myeloma, so strong market share gains already but we still have upside in the US of further penetrating the market. And obviously that's going to be more challenge as you get to higher and higher levels of market share that's there. But we still see good opportunity for market share gains and significantly, as we talk about, we've continued to see good duration gains. So that's the US.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we really have the combination of, we are still in the rollout stage in terms of getting the drug approved in lots of different markets. You heard about Canada recently. We still don't have reimbursement in Australia. Japan is a next year regulatory filing. Russia, we file, we're waiting for approval, takes some time for reimbursement. Lots of different other countries that are rolling out. So clearly, one, territorial expansion is very key to getting our feet on the ground and approved in as many markets as possible. Secondly, it's not uncommon in those markets that you begin the therapy and the use of the drug in a later stage of the disease. So we have both the combination of, one, increasing market share in the indications of where we've launched the drug and we're getting traction and the benefit over time of moving it to early -- as physicians and the different markets see the benefit of moving REVLIMID earlier in treatment.</p>
          <p>And then over time, we're doing so much work in the maintenance study area. That's so critical. And I tried to highlight it in the presentation. We've got very large, 600 person, patient trials looking at REVLIMID as a maintenance therapy. One, to demonstrate the very significant advantage of taking REVLIMID for patients for a long period of time, demonstrating the survival advantage. So we've got fully accrued trials there that we'll see the data in '09. So even in the markets where there are clearly cost concerns, etcetera, I think that data will be instrumental in getting us to have the kind of duration gains that we're seeing here over the past six or nine months in the US and we look forward to seeing those going forward.</p>
          <p>So I think myeloma is clear. We've got still opportunity, we think, to broaden the MDS label. As I mentioned, we're locking the '04 database, we're hopeful that will be a trigger to some markets that we can see increasing the MDS market there. And as you heard, we're probably not going to see it in the next one to two years, but we're making good progress on the Phase III programs in CLL and NHL.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. What about fourth quarter, your, any additional colors on the encouraging signs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that we have to be careful. I think the first three weeks of the quarter have certainly been encouraging in the sense that when you look at the currency in Europe, despite that, we're making good traction and it's both in the US and in Europe. I don't think there's anything specific affecting that. I do think we have to be balanced in the outlook. It's still only three weeks in the quarter and it certainly is encouraging. The economic situation, whether it's in Europe or the United States, is clearly a concern in the sense that budgets are going to be under pressure if we see the kind of economic downturn that many people are concerned about over the coming six to nine months. So on the balance, we're feeling good but we're certainly, know that we're going to have to be prepared to be very aggressive in making sure we make our case as a value proposition for REVLIMID in all countries, and to all payers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. Quickly, Bob, you've talked in the past about the O-US component of revenue and what trend you're seeing there, could you give us some light on that? And perhaps give us a sense of when you might actually disclose O-US revenue overall because I think it's going to be helpful as we think about all this hedging and other components. And secondly, operating margins were somewhat better than Street expectations this quarter and prior periods. Can you comment on the sustainability of your operating margins at this level or higher in the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Geoffrey, I'll deal with the operating margins, the second part of the question. I'll give the first part to Bob in a minute. On the operating margins, what we saw is the synergies of the Pharmion acquisition in the SG&amp;A line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, once we take out those $30 million of integration costs which by the way are one-time costs, obviously that's going to show an improvement next year. So we are seeing the leverage of the acquisition. We said when we acquired the company in March there would be leverage. You're seeing it now in the second quarter or the third quarter, pardon me, because of the integration of the commercial teams. And as we go out quarter-over-quarter and get ready for VIDAZA launch in Europe, you're going to see more leverage. So I don't want to get too far ahead of what we talked about in January, but you're seeing now the benefits of the acquisition, the leveraging, the synergies and the integration of all our activities across the globe both the US and in Europe. Bob you want to take the second part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think the third quarter I think reinforces our view on the balance of revenue for REVLIMID as we exit the year to be in the 2/3, 1/3 US, ex-US. So I don't think we've seen any change in that trend as to what we expect there. I think over time, clearly our view is that we're going to see significant growth outside the United States and we're of the opinion and our goal is to have significantly higher revenues outside the United States than in the United States. Specifically to your question of the transparency of ex-US revenue versus US revenue, it is something that I do think when we go look at 2009 when we look at our strategy for what guidance we'll provide and how we communicate with the marketplace, we will absolutely reconsider that and I think the offset to that transparency is the competitive disadvantage and/or advantages that we have with RevAssist and S.T.E.P.S., as we know exactly what the trends are, etcetera. Obviously we can get the competitive drugs trends through different agencies and stuff. We're not even going to get the US numbers on the competitive drugs probably but twice a year, if we even get them twice a year. So I think we are committed to reviewing the strategy for 2009 in the balance of the benefit of giving people a better sense of what's happening in the products in different geographic regions, versus the benefit of the competitive advantage of knowing when and where to respond and how to deal with it. So we'll look at it as we go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Rachel McMinn with Cowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. Two questions. One when you say that REVLIMID myeloma prescriptions in the US were up 7.5% sequentially, is this comparable to what you said in prior quarters or could you give us the overall prescription trends in the US? And then just following on that, if you were to add the THALOMID and REVLIMID total prescriptions in the US since you have launched REVLIMID, I'm curious if you're seeing overall market share gains or if it's just REVLIMID swapping out for THALOMID. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that in the balance between myeloma and MDS in REVLIMID, the growth is all in myeloma. And our challenge is now with the specialized MDS sales force, obviously with VIDAZA as the key focus there, we're hopeful that we're going to get more attention to the REV 5q MDS labeled indication and we'll see a change to the &#x2013; over time, what has been a very flat MDS trend. So in that &#x2013; from a prescription point of view.</p>
          <p>And related to the question about market share and the relationship of REV versus THAL and other drugs in the sector, it's clear that the position of THAL is the one that is being challenged or being impacted by both REVLIMID and VELCADE and that's where some of the gains are coming, but it's not just from THAL. We're seeing other therapies that were more widely used and a range of different other therapies also suffering. So I think overall we're getting a very significant benefit in terms of overall market share between THAL and REV together at the expense of others but obviously REV is taking from THAL and VELCADE is taking some from THAL.</p>
          <p>So the tradeoff is a good one. The challenge for us over time is going to be clearly the benefit of REV in a newly diagnosed setting and in maintenance settings, and then ensuring that thalidomide has its position later in therapy so that it is clearly a therapy that if someone is suffering from myeloma in the course of their therapy, should be getting all the three major therapies before the course of treatments are ended. So I think we haven't seen, yet to happen, and so we're hopeful that we'll see positive trends in thalidomide over the next couple of years as it moves to later stage of therapy. But that's really what is happening.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a lot of good progress. Dave your commentary on how to think about margins going forward was actually real helpful. And I'm wondering if you could also provide us with some guardrails on how to think about your tax rate. It looks like it continues to improve here. How do we think about that over the next years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For next quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll see a slight improvement in the tax rate because of just the international profitability of about less than 100 basis points. And then getting into next year, we look to '09, if you look at our overall tax rate for '08 versus '09, I would think we would see at least another 100 basis point improvement. So if you take the overall tax rate for this year of about 24%, I can see that getting better next year by at least 100 basis points next year, if not better, as we fully put forward some of our tax strategies and the international profitability of our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's real helpful. And then Bob, I think you mentioned that duration growth with REV in the quarter increased by about half a month, which is encouraging. I think it's also about half the growth rate that we've seen in some of the prior quarters. Can you talk a little bit about what's behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think the duration growth rate has been much more than that in any previous quarter. It's a pretty consistent growth rate. And obviously, some of it's dependent on, as you gets more and more patients on therapy, the percentage of new patients becomes a smaller number. So you can actually see a little bit of an acceleration, potentially over time. So, I don't think, John, that there really has been any kind of reduction in, or the change of the slope of the increased duration. And I think that what we've seen in the third quarter is consistent, and very encouraging on the duration front. So, I don't want to paint an overly optimistic picture of where we're going to go. We're hopeful that when you look at the data about what is the potential here, and we have patients that have been on this drug for more than five years continuous. So there is lot of upside, but we have to be careful. But I don't think there's anything in the third quarter that would leave you, but an encouraging sign of duration. And clearly, over time, as you see what stage of therapy people on that will also affect duration. So, and I think the message for duration is we continue to be encouraged. It's consistent with what we've seen and we've got to continue to prove it and see what happens. But it's clearly a potential upside.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Bob, the question of REVLIMID sales from US versus ex-US. In the past you have said, national sales accounts for about 10%, amount of 343 that you have reported for this quarter, how much is actually from outside of US? I assume it's probably more than 10%. If it is, is it significantly more or just slightly more than 10%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that what we have said is that the trend as we're moving forward is that we would expect to exit 2008 with the REVLIMID numbers for the year running at about two-thirds US and one-third outside the US. And what we've seen in the third quarter is reflective of where we're going to be exiting the year, and obviously our optimism is that in 2009 and beyond, that will begin to shift as we see stronger growth outside the United States, and leading to a higher percentage of the overall revenues coming from international.</p>
