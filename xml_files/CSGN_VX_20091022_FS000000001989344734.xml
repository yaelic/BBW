          <p>Good morning, this is the conference Operator.  Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group Third Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call.  As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is recorded.  You will have the opportunity to ask questions directly after the presentation.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  At this time, I would like to turn to conference over to Mr. Brady Dougan, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group.  Please go ahead, Mr. Dougan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Welcome, everybody, to our third quarter results call.  I'm joined by our CFO, Renato Fassbind.  I'm going to make a brief introduction.  Renato will then as usual will take you through the detailed results and then I will sum up, then we will open it up to questions.  Credit Suisse has responded to the changes in the industry over the past two years with the accelerated implementation of our client-focused capital efficient strategy and reduced risk business model.</p>
          <p>I want to stress four main points.  First, we are happy with the quality of our third quarter performance, which with a very strong return on equity of 25%, complements the strong first half and shows that our strategic approach is working well.  Second, these returns were achieved in the context of our industry-leading capital position and with 30% lower risk-weighted assets compared to the third quarter of last year.  Third, taken together, these results demonstrate that our differentiated strategy and business model provide the foundation for sustainable, high quality, lower volatility earnings.  And fourth, we believe that we are well positioned for growth in the new competitive landscape.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Three, just looking at the left hand side of this chart, I wanted to highlight our focused areas over the past couple of years.  First, we have continued to invest counter-cyclically in our Private Banking business.  We've repositioned the Investment Bank towards the less volatile, more capital efficient, client-focused business.  And asset management has been more closely aligned with the integrated bank and focused on our core strengths in asset allocation, the Swiss business and alternatives.</p>
          <p>Second, we have placed great emphasis on active risk management.  This led to a rapid reduction of risky assets and to a lending portfolio which is well diversified, most of which is either hedged, mark-to-market or collateralized.  Third, we have focused on our competitive strengths.  At a time of enormous change in market disruption, our consistent strategy, leadership and client coverage have all helped us achieve gains in market share across our businesses.  In particular, having client focus at the heart of our strategy has helped deliver sustainable results.</p>
          <p>The benefits of our differentiated model are clear; we've delivered very strong results for the first nine months of 2009 with net income of almost CHF 6 billion.  Our return on equity for the year-to-date is over 21% and we generated net new asset flows across the bank of CHF 17 billion in the third quarter and over 31 billion for the first nine months.  All of this has been achieved with lower risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead in Private Banking, our business model means that we can deliver our unique expertise to a scalable global platform, which will enable us to benefit from a market recovery.  Wealth Management is a very attractive growth and while client activity has picked up in selected areas, risk appetite has improved only moderately.</p>
          <p>However, we remain confident that overall levels of demand for comprehensive investment solutions will recover in the medium term.  We will therefore continue to invest in both our international expansion and our Swiss home market, where our integrated model is yielding strong results and where we are also actively contributing to economic recovery.  For instance our loan balances for Swiss Corporate &amp; Institutional clients are unchanged over the first nine months of the year and we remain steadfast in our commitment to the Swiss market.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, we continue to be disciplined about risk and capital allocation and we expect to see sustained revenues with potential growth across a number of businesses in the portfolio, which Renato will cover in more detail shortly.</p>
          <p>Our industry leading Tier 1 ratio of 16.4% gives us a very solid capital position.  Our capital strength combined with our capital efficient strategy gives us the flexibility to grow the business and deliver attractive returns for shareholders.  We are confident about our business model and our competitive position and while we are only three weeks into the fourth quarter, so far, market conditions are consistent with the third quarter.  If markets remain constructive, we expect to be able to maintain our momentum and even if markets become more difficult, we believe that Credit Suisse is still positioned to perform well.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Renato.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good morning.  I will start my presentation on Slide Five with an overview of the third quarter and nine months' key financial highlights.  Credit Suisse's third quarter 2009 performance continues to demonstrate that our strategy is working well and that our business model provides sustainable, high quality and less volatile earnings.</p>
          <p>We achieved revenues CHF 8.9 billion and net income of CHF 2.4 billion.  Diluted earnings per shares stood at CHF 1.81 for the quarter.  The net impact from tightening credit spreads on our results was minimal this quarter at CHF 93 million, with a charge of 251 million recorded in Investment Bank, largely offset by gains on the fair value hedge transaction in the corporate center.  Excluding the net fair value losses, the cost-income ratio improved slightly to 69.3% compared to the previous quarter, as we continued to maintain tight control on expenses.</p>
          <p>For the first nine months of this year, as shown on the right side of the slide, we have recorded net income of 5.9 billion on strong net revenues of 27.1 billion.  The after-tax return on equity stood at 25.1% for the quarter and 21.8% for the first nine months of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide Six, for an overview of our divisional results.  This shows our third quarter 2009 divisional results side by side against the previous quarter and the first quarter of this year.  We excluded only the impact from movement in own debt spreads for the Investment Bank, but footnoted other significant items in the other divisions.</p>
          <p>With a pre-tax income of CHF 867 million, Private Banking reported seasonally lower results in the third quarter as seen in previous years.  While the environment has improved since March, with increased levels of assets under management in the second and third quarters, the benefit from a higher asset base and higher transaction volumes was offset by lower interest income and generally conservative client behavior.  The quarterly trends in Private Banking include the benefit of CHF 100 million of insurance proceeds in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Investment Banking results represent another strong quarterly performance, with pre-tax income of close to CHF 2 billion.  This third successive strong result was achieved with well-diversified revenues, despite the seasonally slower third quarter and with disciplined cost control.</p>
          <p>Asset Management continued to make progress on delivering a more focused business model aligned to the rest of the Group.  This quarter's pre-tax income of CHF 311 million includes a gain on closing of the transaction with Aberdeen of CHF 207 million.  This result demonstrates that we have delivered consistently strong results for the last three quarters, operating a low risk profile and a capital efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>Let me continue with further detail of our results, starting with Wealth Management clients business within Private Banking on Slide Seven.  As highlighted at our recent Investor Day, we streamlined the organizational structure in our Swiss home market.  As a consequence, the Wealth Management clients business now includes the Swiss private client segment previously reported in corporate and retail banking.  Prior periods have been restated on all the relevant slides to reflect this change.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income for Wealth Management clients was CHF 723 million, a decrease of 5% from the prior quarter with slightly lower revenues reflecting lower net interest income.  Compared to the first quarter, published pre-tax income was at the same level, but actually increased by 16% on our underlying basis adjusting for the insurance proceeds received.</p>
          <p>Asset inflows during the seasonally slower third quarter continued to be strong with net asset inflows totaling CHF 11.2 billion.  Contributions were broad and balanced across all regions.  These inflows, together with positive market effect of 21 billion, resulted in assets under management being up 32 billion or 4.2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And we continued hiring, adding an additional 80 Relationship Managers, and overall, our previously announced talent upgrade process resulted in a net reduction of 50 Relationship Managers during the quarter.  We are continuing to target our hiring on Senior Relationship Managers with a focus on ultra-high net worth clients, as we seek opportunities to upgrade our talent pool, benefiting from our strong competitive position.  With assets under management increasing in the quarter, the average assets per Relationship Manager also increased during the quarter by 10 million or 5% to CHF 197 million per RM.</p>
          <p>In summary, assets are up with continued strong inflows and improved markets.  And we are seeing good opportunities to hire Senior Relationship Managers as we take advantage of our competitive position.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to net new assets on Slide Eight.  Total net new assets inflows of CHF 11.2 billion were at the highest quarterly level so far this year and represent an annualized growth of 5.9%, only slightly below our across the cycle target rate of 6%, again, evidencing our strong competitive position.  The rolling four-quarter growth rate was lower at 3.8%, predominately as a result of the de-leveraging we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>CHF 30 billion in net new assets for the first nine months and the balanced regional contribution evidences the strength of our platform and the trust our clients have in Credit Suisse.  Those of you that followed our recent Investor Day will have seen that we have set ourselves ambitious growth targets for the coming quarters and years, targeting to achieve cumulative net new assets of between 175 and CHF 225 billion by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Net new asset inflows will always fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but this quarter's performance is a good start towards this target, given that we believe that global wealth creation will become more pronounced in coming quarters.</p>
          <p>On Slide Nine, we show the gross revenue margin analysis on the bar chart and key revenue trends affecting the margin to the right.  The gross margin decreased to 125 basis points during the quarter.  The decrease in the transaction-based component is mainly driven by lower product issuing fees and lower integrated solution revenues, which can always be somewhat lumpy quarter-to-quarter.  However, year-to-date, these integrated solution revenues are an important factor behind the increase in the transaction-based margin from 30 to 34 basis points.</p>
          <p>While the environment improved from March through the end of the third quarter, the majority of our clients remain conservative in their investment behavior, favoring direct investments in equities and bonds and thus negatively impacting the level of product issuing fees.  These trends are partially offset by slightly higher brokerage fees.</p>
          <p>The recurring margin declined five basis points, as recurring revenues decreased by CHF 23 million in the quarter.  This was mainly driven by lower interest income due to lower margins on loans from higher funding costs.  Asset-based commissions and fees increased with higher assets under management, but this quarter's increase in assets under management will only be fully reflected in revenue levels from the fourth quarter onwards.</p>
          <p>In summary, the overall margin decline was due to lower integrated solution revenues and lower interest income.  Specifically, the combination of lower interest income and the 5.1% increase in average assets under management accounts alone for more than five basis points' dilution of the gross margin when compared to the second quarter.  As pointed out before, these quarterly movements in the margin even out over the longer term, as evidenced by the margin for the first nine months this year, which actually improved by one basis point from last year to 131 basis points.</p>
          <p>I will now continue with our Corporate &amp; Institutional client business on Slide 10.  Pre-tax income decreased by 18% to CHF 144 million and the asset inflows continued to be strong at CHF 1.9 billion, reflecting continued client confidence in our business.  Although revenues were down 46 million from the second quarter, it was mostly driven by fair value losses of CHF 61 million on loan portfolio hedges.</p>
          <p>Provisions for credit losses stood at a moderate CHF 40 million despite the continuing challenging economic environment.  On an underlying basis, pre-tax income was resilient at CHF 205 million.  For the nine months, the fall in pre-tax income was driven by credit provisions and fair value charges on loan hedges.  Even after this reduction in profitability, the pre-tax margin is a very respectable 43% for the nine months.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn to Investment Banking on Slide 11.  We reported pre-tax income of CHF 2 billion in the third quarter in the Investment Bank, adjusted for charges from the tightening of credit spreads on own debt.  That is a similar level to the second and first quarter in the year, but please note that the second quarter included charges of 483 million related to the settlement with Huntsman.</p>
          <p>The pre-tax return on economic capital was a very strong 40% in the third quarter and 38% for the first nine months of the year.  Our strong results reflected good performances in our client and flow-based businesses, as we continued to gain market share across many product areas.  But lower revenues also reflect reduced market activity, including the seasonal third quarter slowdown in many of the flow businesses.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income margin stood at a very strong 38% during the third quarter and 34% for the first nine months of the year.  We continued to apply a disciplined approach to risk deployment with further reductions in both risk-weighted assets and value at risk in dollar terms.  Despite the reduction in market activity and the seasonal slowdown, the Investment Bank built on the strong results in the first and second quarters, with another set of very good operating results and a high return on the capital deployed.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows you a more detailed analysis of the 5 billion revenues achieved in the third quarter.  As shown in prior quarters, this analysis splits the revenue contribution into key clients, repositions and exit businesses.  There is more detail of the business activities within each of these three categories in the appendix of this presentation.  The key client businesses generated CHF 4.1 billion, driven by higher underwriting market share and strong non-agency RMBS revenues, offset by seasonally lower client activity, affecting especially our global rates and foreign exchange businesses.</p>
          <p>The reposition businesses had revenues of CHF 1.4 billion with higher leveraged finance results, partly offset by subdued emerging markets activities.  Losses in the businesses we are exiting were small at just 200 million, reflecting our success in reducing our exposures to areas that do not meet our strategic criteria.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at the revenue trends on Slide 13.  Equity revenues continued to be strong, being down just 12% compared to the very strong second quarter.  Key client businesses saw higher equity underwriting fees based on increased IPO activity and improved market shares for Credit Suisse, especially in Europe, offset by a seasonal decline in trading volumes.  Revenues in the reposition businesses reflected reductions in risk positions and an operating model refocused on quantitative and liquid trading strategies.  On the far right, you see the risk reduction in the exit businesses is largely completed and without material write-downs.</p>
          <p>In summary, for the first nine months this year, total equity revenues of CHF 7.1 billion reflect continued market share gains, primarily across our cash equities and prime services businesses.</p>
          <p>Total fixed income revenues as shown on Slide 14 were down 17% this quarter to CHF 3 billion, as a reduction in key client revenues more than offset the noticeable improvement from lower losses in the exit businesses.  Key client businesses were affected by seasonally reduced activity, resulting in lower revenues in rates, foreign exchange and high grade and agency RMBS trading.  This reduction was partially offset by improved debt underwriting fees with higher market share and improvements in the non-agency U.S. RMBS business.</p>
          <p>Revenues in the repositioned businesses were stable.  On the right, you can see the improving trends for the exit business with lower losses, due to continued wind-down of activity and exposures in these businesses.  We have reduced our commercial mortgage exposure by a further 45% during the quarter, down to CHF 3.6 billion with significant portfolio sales in Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>In summary, for the first nine months, total fixed income revenues of CHF 10.5 billion reflect the growth in our client and flow activities, improved performance on the repositioned areas and a sharp reduction of losses in the businesses that are being exited.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Slide 15.  This slide is reported in dollars and shows the risk trends for the Investment Bank.  The consistent trend in risk reduction, which we have shown now for many quarters, continued into the third quarter 2009.  Risk-weighted assets ended the quarter at $137 billion, down 2% in the quarter and down 29% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>For the ongoing businesses, risk-weighted assets increased to 119 billion as some of the capital was reallocated from the exit businesses.  This redeployment of capital remains a priority, as we free up existing risk capital from exit portfolios for reinvestment into our targeted client businesses.  Average one day VaR also fell further in the quarter and 44% year-on-year.  And we have not recorded any backtesting exceptions for the first nine months.  As we reinvest capital in client and flow businesses, we may see some increase to VaR over time.</p>
          <p>Our progress in moving to a low-risk capital efficient strategy for the Investment Bank has proved very effective over the last 12 months.  Going forward, we will take advantage of opportunities to selectively redeploy capital in our targeted client businesses.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows you the development in our cost base.  The compensation component is shown in the top chart.  The total compensation expenses continue to trend downwards, being down 22% from the second quarter.  Our compensation accrual is based on an economic profit model, recognizing the risk adjusted profitability overall and of each business as well as the industry environment.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact on the changing credit spreads on own debt, our compensation to revenue ration in Investment Bank fell from 44% in the second quarter to 40% this quarter.  Non-compensation expenses declined from the third quarter last year due to cost reduction measures and the U.S. dollar translation impact, partly offset by higher legal, consulting and service fees in line with higher deal activity and costs associated with exiting certain businesses.  The increase compared to the second quarter is primarily due to incremental IT investment costs and legal, consulting and service fees, in part relating to the exit businesses.</p>
          <p>Although we are one of the most efficient banks when it comes to managing costs, we remain extremely focused on realizing cost efficiencies wherever possible.  This enables us to invest in the business where we see opportunities to significantly grow our revenues.  One such example is an infrastructure project to build out our electronic trading capability within fixed income.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 is an update to a slide that we first showed at an industry conference earlier this month.  It shows the relative revenue contribution from our major businesses in the Investment Bank in the nine months of 2009.  We have attempted to give a picture of the business' medium term prospect as markets and client activity return to more normalized levels on the x-axis and how we assess the future opportunity in respect of their market share positions on the y-axis.</p>
          <p>We have color coded this chart to help illustrate how we see each of our businesses contributing going forward, green for those businesses we see having the potential to increase revenues as they capture market share.  An example would be in foreign exchange, where despite doubling our market share, we are still only a top ten player in this business compared to our ambition of becoming a top five player, through initiatives such as providing enhanced electronic trading capabilities for clients.</p>
          <p>Blue, for those businesses benefiting from revenue growth as markets improve.  As good examples, we have significant market share gains in cash equities and prime services over the last eighteen months, but revenues over the first nine months of this year generally reflected lower trading volumes, reduced hedge fund leverage and subdued client activity.  In addition, we also anticipate that emerging markets and leveraged finance, strong franchise businesses for Credit Suisse, will benefit from improving markets and client activity.</p>
          <p>And finally red, for those businesses where we see some risk of revenue reduction.  An example would be our RMBS trading and non-U.S. rates businesses that benefited in the first nine months from favorable market conditions, including high levels of volatility, wide bid-offer spreads and high volumes, although we saw these conditions begin to normalize in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We've also included two slides in the appendix showing the market share and margin movements in some of our key product lines on a quarterly and nine months cumulative basis.  Supporting the sustainability of our earnings over the medium term, we believe that any revenue reduction in the currently out-performing businesses will be more than compensated by improvement in other areas.</p>
          <p>On Slide 18, we have used the color scheme from the previous slides to illustrate this point.  Looking across from the left of the page, the dark gray bar shows the reported revenues for the first nine months of 2009, and the light gray bar shows the impact of the wind-down businesses.  The blue bar shows the reported revenues, excluding losses made in the wind-down businesses.  The green and light blue bars show the &#x2013; to the right show the areas where we expect the revenues to be sustainable or grow.  The green bar, where we are building market share shows, existing revenues pools that should improve over the mid-term, whereas the light blue bar shows revenue pools that should increase more quickly if the markets recover to more normal levels.  Together, this totals CHF 14.5 billion for the first nine months of 2009.</p>
          <p>At the far right, we think that CHF 5.3 billion of our nine months revenues are at greater risk of slowdown in the coming few quarters, predominantly due to normalization of the markets, some of which we have already experienced during the third quarter.  This pattern of performance leads us to a constructive outlook for our overall revenue base in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>This concludes the review of the Investment Banking results and I will now continue with Asset Management on Slide 19.  We continued to implement our Asset Management strategy to focus on alternative investment strategies and asset allocation products and solutions.  We completed the sale of part of our traditional investment strategies business to Aberdeen Asset Management, recording a gain of CHF 207 billion during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also, we have now fully exited the U.S. money market funds business and halved our legacy exposure to securities purchased from our money market funds to around CHF 250 million.  Assets under management were up 17 billion during the quarter, driven by positive market movement and more importantly, by encouraging inflows into our target growth areas.</p>
          <p>Overall, the business performed well and is now in a position to also benefit from a more stabilized market environment.  The gross margin remained very stable as Asset Management fees increased 5%, in line with asset levels from the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Slide 20.  Here we show you current assets under management levels, third quarter and nine months' net new asset inflows and nine months' gross margins of our businesses side-by-side.  In the net new assets column in the middle, you can see that we saw encouraging inflows into our targeted growth areas of alternative investments and asset allocation products, called MACS.</p>
          <p>The alternative investment business, which comprises our leading private equity and real estate business, and our single and multi-manager hedge fund strategies continued to see good asset inflows of CHF 1.4 billion in the quarter, despite the fact that global private equity fundraising activity remained low.  This business accounts for roughly half of asset management fees and commissions, commanding a healthy 54-basis-point gross margin year-to-date.  In MACS, we saw inflows of 3.9 billion reversing the negative trend we have seen in the first half of the year.  These two positive inflows were offset in part by outflows from our U.S. money market business, which we have largely exited.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continued to make progress in refocusing the business on its core strengths and better aligning with the integrated bank.  We saw encouraging asset inflows into multi-asset class solutions and alternative investments, a sign of the strengthening in our institutional client relationships.  The profitability of the business continues to improve, as we report stable underlying gross margins, a stabilized private equity portfolio and the near complete disposal of the money market lift-out portfolio while delivering further reductions in general and administration expenses.  This concludes the divisional results review.</p>
          <p>I will now continue with the Group's funding and capital position on Slide 21.  We built on our position as one of the best capitalized banks globally as the Basel II Tier 1 ratio improved by 90 basis points to 16.4% in the quarter.  Our core Tier 1 ratio, excluding hybrid capital, improved to over 11%.  While we see great opportunities to reinvest excess capital to fund organic growth in the business and potentially though tactical acquisitions, we continue to accrue towards a normalized dividend.  Risk-weighted assets fell 5%, about half of which is due to foreign exchange rate impact.</p>
          <p>We have also maintained a strong balance sheet this quarter, as you can see on Slide 22.  In addition, the regulatory &#x2013; the regulatory leverage ratio increased further to 4.1%.  As indicated in the past, this ratio will be affected by changes to consolidation rules from the beginning of next year under U.S. GAAP.  We currently expect these changes to increase total reported assets by less than CHF 60 billion.  We are currently finalizing the Level 3 assets detail to be disclosed with our quarterly report and expect them to be down approximately by 5%.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation, and with that, I will hand back to Brady.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Renato.  Just to sum up, we think our strategy has put us in a strong position not only to deliver sustainable profitability and growth, but also to meet the challenges of a changing industry landscape.</p>
          <p>On Slide 23, we lay out on the left hand side elements which will change as regulators respond to the crisis.  We think we are well placed in this regard.  We've already talked about our strong capitalization, we are already meeting new leverage requirements and then in addition, we've maintained strong liquidity position throughout the crisis and we are working with industry regulators to ensure the industry foundation in this area is solid.</p>
          <p>With regard to compensation, we've looked to extend the draft proposals and the principles outlined by the G-20 based on the proposals from the FSB and we've developed and put in place a state-of-the-art compensation structure consisted with those principles which we announced on Tuesday.  This reaffirms the bank's continuing commitment to fair, balanced and performance-oriented compensation policies that align long-term employee and shareholder interests.</p>
          <p>We recognize that we have a duty to play a responsible role in economic recovery both in Switzerland and as a positive force in global capital markets.  We're doing this in a number of ways.  First in Switzerland, we remained steadfast in our commitment to the economy with loans to clients unchanged in the first nine months of '09.  Second, we continue to engage in dialogue with regulators to help faster a globally coordinated approach in an effort to build a more robust financial sector that can promote global economic prosperity.</p>
          <p>Third, we believe the industry globally needs to do more to respond to regulatory recommendations on compensation and we believe that we were the first major bank to adopt the principles outlined by Finman and the G-20 and hope that this will encourage others to move in the same direction.  We believe it is important to play a responsible role in these matters and we will continue to play an active part.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to Slide 24.  In summary, the Credit Suisse franchise has gained considerable momentum over the past couple of years.  We benefited from a consistent and accelerated implementation of our strategy and stable leadership teams and this has helped to attract a wealth of talent from across the industry, enabling us to truly focus on our clients.  This is translating into our financial results.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, our private bank has a significant opportunity to strengthen its position and grow faster than the market in an encouraging industry environment.  The Investment Bank with its lower risk, more capital efficient client-focused model will continue to produce more sustainable results from its well diversified portfolio of businesses.  The Asset Management business with its refocused strategy aligned with the integrated bank has the potential to make a significant contribution to our earnings over time.</p>
          <p>And our strong capital position means that we can better manage our business in the face of changing regulatory requirements.  At the same time, it gives us the flexibility to grow our businesses and provide attractive returns to shareholders, including material dividend payments.</p>
          <p>I believe that Credit Suisse has a truly differentiated position in the marketplace with our client-focused integrated business model and lower-risk capital-efficient approach.  If markets remain constructive, we expect to be able to maintain our momentum and even if markets become more difficult, we believe that Credit Suisse is still positioned to perform well.  And with that, I'm happy to open it up to questions.  Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two questions.  First, given your strong results, could you perhaps shed your and the Board's latest thinking on the dividend accrual?  And to the extent it's obviously not yet formalized, from the outside, would it be unreasonable to be guessing in the sort of 2 to 2.50 range?  And then the second question is really more speaking on the Investment Bank, and obviously a great result, on Page 32 you obviously mentioned that margins continued to slip.  Perhaps could you give us your assessment over the next six to 12 months of how the volume margin trade-off works and whether the continued going down of margins concerns you at all?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Huw, thanks for your questions.  Yeah, I mean as to the dividend, as you know, we obviously make accrual decisions, but it's ultimately a Board recommendation that gets approved at the AGM.  So, as you say, there is still &#x2013; those are matters yet to determined.  I think we used the language in the release, which is what we will stick to, which is that we are accruing towards a normalized dividend.  So as you say, I don't think we're going to get more specific than that, but you can &#x2013; I think you can read into that, kind of the approach on dividends.</p>
          <p>On the Investment Banking side, yeah, I mean obviously there are &#x2013; there are a couple of issues.  I mean obviously the third quarter is seasonally a little bit &#x2013; a little bit less from a volume point of view, it gets impacted.  I think as we have said and you know, there is certainly are and there will probably will continue to be over time, margin movements, that margins will come out of some parts of the business.  And I guess what we've tried to do is lay out on this Slide 17 kind of our view of the different businesses.</p>
          <p>And obviously the question you're asking which is a good one is, I guess, kind of the pace of these different pieces of the business.  We have said pretty consistently since the first quarter that we felt that the high margin businesses were going to actually sustain those margins for some time, but that obviously over time, they would work down.  I think we continue to feel that way.</p>
          <p>So if you look at RMBS trading or parts of the rates businesses that are up in that red part of the box, I mean we still certainly see very good margins there and very, very good market shares from our point of view.  But we do think that over time, those will come down, and I think it is a matter of a number of quarters as opposed to a number of months or whatever.  So we think there is &#x2013; there is probably more legs to that than people generally think.  That's just our perspective.</p>
          <p>The green parts of the box here, obviously where we are looking gain share, are things that take a little bit longer for us, because we obviously have to put people in place; it takes time to sort of build those market shares.  So the green part is, we think is there is definitely upside to that, but it probably has a little bit longer of a tail.  And then the blue piece is really more of a market call from people's point of view, so in prime services, we have excellent market share.  We have continued to have growing market share in that area and yet, the levels of leverage at the hedge funds, the level of activity there has not really picked up as much as one might have thought.</p>
          <p>And so, you can sort of impose your views of what might happen in that part of the business or the leveraged finance business, for instance, where we think there is a lot of upside to that business, but how quickly that will actually materialize will be somewhat dependent on markets and players within the markets.  So you put that all together, we continue to be pretty constructive about what we think will be the outlook for Investment Banking business, but each of those probably has different timelines, as you can imagine.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  I have a few questions, but hopefully very quick, Basel II impact on market risk is the first one.  Then top line margins on Private Banking under your new accounting, what should we see as a range going forward?</p>
          <p>The third one is revenue gap on FX and commodities relative to your peers.  I'm sure you have done analysis on how you stand up against some of your peers or the top three.  How would you look at that and how &#x2013; what the likelihood of closing that gap and over what timeframe?  And lastly, comp, the U.S. banks looking more at 42, 40, 43 exit run rate of comp for the year, for the full year of '09.  Where should we look at your comp to revenues for the years, thanks, in the IB?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  The kind of indication we had from peers in terms of market risk, doubling to tripling that kind of range, I assume is the same for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now this is expressed then in the couple of hundred basis points deterioration in the Tier 1 ratio, that's included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question in terms of the gross margin, yeah, basically as you say, it is a restated gross margin we've kind of went through.  But we think the right range is sort of 125 to 135 over the cycle and obviously sort of on a  &#x2013; and obviously quarter, there is quarterly variation as well.  So you can see that we were, I think at 131 for the nine months, which is kind of in the middle of that range.  So we expect that &#x2013; we would expect the gross margin to remain in that 125 to 135 range.</p>
          <p>And the FX and commodities businesses, yeah, I mean, I think our position in those areas are obviously, we don't have the market share we would like to have there.  I think in foreign exchange, we are a top 10 player, but we are not really a top five player.  We have actually seen a substantial increase in our market share there over the past year and it's something we are very focused on.  We've made some significant IT investments in there and you actually see that in some of our cost commentary.  We have a &#x2013; we think we have a real advantage with some our automated trading systems that we actually started with on the equity side, but are now applying more to the fixed income side.</p>
          <p>So we think that's something that will be a real benefit for us and also we are beefing up the sales force there.  So we think they &#x2013; we are in sort of a &#x2013; we are in the top 10 range, but not in the top five where we would like to get to and I would think over the course of the next year or so, that ought to be something that's hopefully would be achievable.  We will see.</p>
          <p>On commodities we are probably in again, not in the top five in terms of the business.  We are really not in the power segment, stronger in the metals side than, say, gas and oil, but we continue to look at that business.  We've got, as you know, I think, a very advantageous, a strong partnership with Glencore in the business, which I think is helpful.  But we look to continue to expand that business; it's clearly, we clearly would like to have a stronger position there.</p>
          <p>And then on the comp side, yeah you can see the numbers, I mean obviously it's &#x2013; we are not, I don't think we are really making any projection as to where we are going to be for the year.  We've obviously &#x2013; I think we've been pretty disciplined about it all year, but we've obviously brought it down in the third quarter.  Where we end up will depend on performance in the fourth quarter and competitive issues, et cetera, but you can see where it is.  I think sort of year-to-date in Investment Bank it's about 43, 44 and so we will see how the fourth quarter goes and see how it progresses from there.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Derek De Vries from Bank of America.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.  I have actually three questions, the first two on the private bank side of the business.  You were talking about risk appetite of your clients and you say that clients remain pretty conservatively positioned, owning directly equities and bonds.  I was wondering how that compares with what you are telling them to be in terms of your strategy allocation?  So, has there been a progression towards risk appetite in terms of what you are telling your clients in the private bank over the first nine months of the year or have you been telling them to stay pretty conservatively positioned?  That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question number two, you hinted towards the possibility of acquisitions in the private bank, I was wondering if there is a sense of urgency, i.e. do you see sort of a six to 12-month window with people willing to sell private banking operations, given all the changes going on right now in the banking landscape?  Or is that just sort of a longer term, three to four-year, we could do acquisitions if there is a good opportunity?</p>
          <p>And then my last question is just sort of a detailed question.  If you could just remind us on compensation cost, in terms of the deferred compensation, what are you accruing at?  Do we have the deferred compensation from 08', '07, '06 in the '09 numbers and has there been a step up in terms of the percentage of compensation that is deferred?  So I'm just trying to sort of think out to 2010, 2011 in terms of what I should be doing with my comp to income ratio there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Derek, thanks, thanks very much for those questions.  I'd say on the first question, we &#x2013; I think we &#x2013; we think it's important, we think it's an important aspect of obviously our product offerings to be certainly tailoring to where we see the opportunities.  And so for instance we have increased the equity quota in the different investment strategies and profiles.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, also I mean clearly I think in general clients are, they are focused on maintaining a pretty conservative profile, so when you look at a lot of the different investment strategies we are recommending or products we are recommending, they tend to be more in that area, as you would expect.  And I think that's where we want to be.  So I'd say we've continued to, we have continued to &#x2013; we have probably progressed in terms of the recommendations, as the markets have, in order to allow our customers to take advantage of that.  But, I think that &#x2013; I think that it's a &#x2013; it's a relatively gradual movement.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; in terms of the acquisition side, I think we obviously believe we're in a good position to make an acquisition both from the point of view of capital strength and sort of financial strength, but also, we've had a very strong and continuous management team in these areas and that's &#x2013; we haven't had a lot of distractions in the business, which I think allows us to better be able to integrate a business well, et cetera.  So I think we're actually well placed for acquisitions, but we're not going to force anything and things have to meet pretty high &#x2013; pretty high, I think, operating bars for us in terms of things that fit well.</p>
          <p>And it's kind of as you say in terms of urgency, I mean obviously over the past, I mean really for the past two years, things have only gotten better in terms of the kind of properties that are available and the prices, et cetera.  So, and it may not continue for forever, but we want to be opportunistic, but we're also going to be prudent about what we add to the business.  So it's a balance, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just maybe to follow-up on that, urgency is probably the wrong word I used, but I guess, you don't see a window right now with the dislocations in the landscape and not everyone has been as fortunate as you guys in terms of having continuous management teams and keeping governments out of shareholders &#x2013; shareholder ownership.  You don't see a six to 12-month window whereby if you're going to do an acquisition, it's likely going to happen in that period or you do see an opportunities today that you wouldn't have seen two years ago and you want to act on those, I guess is my question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there are &#x2013; there are probably more opportunities now and particularly as you said, the landscape sorts out and I think many people are getting back to more core businesses.  This is not a business that's core for everybody.  This is a business that's core for us.  So I think that that's probably helpful.  And there are also people who need capital, et cetera and so I think all that is probably making it a more interesting environment now.  But I'm not sure it's a three or six-month phenomenon, I think it will be &#x2013; I think that will be probably available.  I think that will be &#x2013; I think it's something that will probably have longer &#x2013; a longer window than now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then on your last question, on the deferred compensation costs, I mean, I guess the quick answer to your question is yes.  There is deferred compensation flowing through from all those years.  To be honest with you, I'm not sure that I could identify a discernible trend in terms of amounts of deferred compensation and how they are going through.  But there clearly are, I think it's relatively stable, but there clearly are impacts on &#x2013; from the deferred on that line, but I think it's relatively stable.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Jacques-Henri Gaulard from Autonomous Research.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  Jacques-Henri Gaulard from Autonomous.  Three quick questions.  The bad debt charge in Switzerland is now very low, would you assume this is something which is recurring, the cost of risk has stabilized or we shouldn't obviously get carried away and we shouldn't be worried about the situation here in Switzerland?  Second question on Private Banking, very good numbers on the new money and assets.  The reason are inertia in revenue clearly.  When do you expect those new assets to effectively trigger some recovery in revenue?  Is it more for the first half of next year, second half of next year, a bit earlier than that just to have a little bit of guidance there?</p>
          <p>And the third question, you have reduced your risk-weighted assets in your VaR Investment Banking while, if I remember well, last quarter, you had said that maybe those measures would effectively increase.  Are you completely free to effectively take as much risk as you want in your Investment Bank or as many not risks as you want or are you still slightly monitored by the regulator and a bit constrained about what you can do there?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe I will start with the last question first and then we will go back to the others.  The &#x2013; yeah, as you say, we are, we continue to be in a position where we can certainly take more risk and when we see opportunities we will do that.  In fact, it's interesting, as you look at the RWA progression, what you'll see actually is that while the overall RWAs are down, they &#x2013; actually what we have done, which is one of the things we will continue to look to do is, as we've reduced our RWAs in some the exit or legacy businesses, we've actually redeployed those into the ongoing businesses.  So you may not have access to the color slide or whatever, but we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I actually don't &#x2013; that's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, you might want to look at that, because it's actually pretty interesting.  What you can see is we are down a little bit in risk-weighted assets, but actually ongoing businesses are up a bit.  So &#x2013; but you are right, actually that bar is down and but again, yeah, we will as we see ongoing opportunities, we are certainly going to take advantage of them.  We don't have any constraints in that respect except that we obviously want to run a disciplined model and we want to &#x2013; we want to make sure that we are disciplined about the risk that we take.</p>
          <p>So in terms of your other two questions, I'd say the bad debt charges or the loan provisions in Switzerland, as you say, are low.  We continue to feel pretty comfortable with the portfolio that we have in Switzerland and with the way it's performing right now.  I mean obviously, future quarters are, as always, unfortunately hard to predict.  I think a lot depends on the economy and how that develops.  But we do feel like we've got a high quality portfolio that's well diversified, there is a lot of collateral against it and so we see that loan portfolio actually performing pretty well.  So I guess our hope is it's recurring, but obviously, there's no way to predict that because it depends very much on how the economy rolls out, et cetera.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your &#x2013; the last question which was your second question on when we might &#x2013; when we might see some inertia on revenues from, as you say, the good asset developments there, hard to say.  I mean, I think it depends a lot on the picking up of demand for comprehensive investment products like funds, alternatives, structured products, things like that, some of our PMAC-type asset allocation products, et cetera.  And I'd say we believe that we will come, it's probably a little bit harder to determine exactly which quarter is going to come in and how pronounced it's going to be.  We certainly see clients getting more comfortable and being more opportunistic, but when we will actually see the full impact of that over time, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello, it's Jernej here from Goldman.  I have four questions; the first one and I will just go through the relevant slides as well.  The first one is on Slide Eight of your presentation where you show the net new money inflows, and I was just wondering if you could split out how much of this 11.2 billion was down to Lombard loans this quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Page Nine, which is on &#x2013; again a question on the margin and thanks very much for the explanation that the margin should stay within the communicated 125, 135 band.  But I was just wondering you quote &#x2013; you quote lower net interest income due to increasing funding cost for the third &#x2013; in the third quarter as one of the reasons for the margin having compressed.  And I think &#x2013; I probably think many investors are going to find this a little bit surprising, given that, I think, funding costs in the third quarter seemed to have come down a little bit or well, a little bit on Q2, but a lot on, I guess, on the previous quarters.  So if you could just elaborate on this one, i.e., what exactly do you mean by higher funding costs pressuring your margin here?</p>
          <p>The third question is on &#x2013; is on actually &#x2013; the third and final question is going to be on Page 21, where you show your risk-weighted assets development.  And I was just wondering, this decline of 5%, how much of that is due to FX and how much have risk-weighted assets come down on a constant currency basis?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  Thanks a lot.  I think on the last question, we &#x2013; about half of the risk-weighted asset reduction is due to currency.  So about half is sort of underlying and half is due to currency.  The &#x2013; on the first question, in terms of the net new money inflows, as you say, the 11.2 billion, I guess your question is kind of the leverage thing that we've talked about in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah, we think probably about 2.5 billion of that is due to leverage.  So, due to increased leverage, so around 2.5 of the 11.2 is due to an increase in leverage in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in your last question, it is &#x2013; it's a bit complex, but the bottom line is that the funding cost is a mixture of sort of longer-term and shorter term sort of deposit costs.  The longer-term is sort of a more wholesale part of that funding that comes in, is actually, as you say, certainly costs are lower, funding costs are lower now than they were a year ago, but they are actually higher, they are somewhat higher than the debt, that some of the new debt is replacing stuff that's rolling off.</p>
          <p>And so net, there is a slight increase in the overall cost of funding and I agree with you that's somewhat counter-intuitive when you look at what's happened with spreads et cetera in the last six or 12 months.  But on an &#x2013; on an overall, the longer-term sort of blended basis, it actually has increased the funding costs somewhat, which has squeezed the margins a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks a lot.  If I can just add to this &#x2013; to this final question, even that it seems that essentially there was a positive carry on the legacy funding you had in the Private Bank, and that's now being rolled over into something that is more expensive.  I was just wondering what &#x2013; from where then this certainty that the margin should rebound in the &#x2013; in the following quarters?  Because it seems to be a relatively longer-term issue, you know?  If you put a new funding which is more expensive than the funding that's rolled off, why &#x2013; I was just &#x2013; I mean, why should we think that there will be a rebound in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's obviously the gross margin is made up of a number of different elements, as you say, as we've tried to lay out.  So one is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think there's going to be upward pressure in the other...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.  I mean we already &#x2013; we already &#x2013; we're encouraged by the brokerage side and the fact that that was positive in the quarter, and we think that should hopefully continue.  The asset-based commission side is also, is an encouraging development.  So we're happy about that.</p>
          <p>And we also think this whole, the integrated solutions revenues, which were really actually still pretty strong, but just off of very strong second quarter, we think those should continue to probably have positive development.  So all those are positive.  The interest side, frankly, the interest side may well continue to be under pressure, because we probably &#x2013; as you say, that's probably not the funding cost side of that is not something that's going to reverse quickly.  So and again, it's not a big element of it, but it is an element of it.</p>
          <p>So, I think as we look at all those factors, our hope and our view is that, that will actually &#x2013; that this is sort of bottom of range gross margin-type numbers.  So, we'll see higher numbers going forward, but we'll see.  It's obviously an interplay among all those issues, but we do feel there is probably more items where we see upside than where we might see some downside.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I had two questions.  One was just coming back to the net new money, have you got any idea of how much is driven by new hires?  I was just trying to understand how much is market share gain versus also hiring?  And the second is, the way that you talk about the compensation ratio in the Investment Bank, I think in the slides, you tell us we can't really look at the comp to revenue ratio any more and as revenues go up higher, the staff, there is obviously, there must be some limits on bonuses.  And could you talk about that a bit more?  I mean does that mean that the comp to revenue ratio could go below 40, I am assuming that is the case?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We &#x2013; I mean, on the second question, there is &#x2013; what we are basically saying is that as we continue to evolve the approach on compensation, this is in line with a lot of the regulatory issues as well, we are looking at things much more on a capital allocation, return on capital type basis.  And so obviously at the end of the day, the comp to revenue is still a common way to look at it and it's an easy thing to calculate.  So we make reference to it, but it's actually not the way that we are &#x2013; it's not the way we are actually setting the compensation accruals.</p>
          <p>So I guess in that context, it could go a lot of different directions, but again, it's not that the &#x2013; it's not the way we look at it, but on the other hand, it's, as you can tell from the first three quarters, it's not that inconsistent in terms of how things come out.  So we do &#x2013; and but as you said, we do think as there is a diminishing scale element to it, so I think as if &#x2013; as and if performance got continued to improve, that could certainly lead to lower numbers, it's not impossible.</p>
          <p>In terms of the quarterly fluctuations, we don't really look at that.  I mean it's not easy to kind of to isolate out a quarterly movement in net new assets and how much came from new hires, et cetera.  We &#x2013; in general as you know, we tend to think that on a kind of 12-monthly basis, we think about 60% of the net new assets have come from new hires.  And so it's not, I don't think it's &#x2013; there is obviously a lot more lumpiness and a lot more discreet issues that come in to any particular quarter as net new assets, but that's in general how we view it, as kind of 60% from new hires.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what I suppose I was trying to get at was at the Investor Day, there was a slide saying that your new hires were bringing in, I think I was multiples of what they previously has brought in, i.e. you are hiring better people.  Is that one of the reasons for the improving net new money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; I mean if you look at, I mean I think we've talked about &#x2013; I mean if you look at and we actually had on net, we had less RMs in the third quarter.  We had actually did a fair amount of gross hiring particularly in the ultra-high net worth area for instance, which does end up with kind of higher quality or more assets per RM and so in that respect, yeah, I think it is a big focus of ours is the focus on quality and that obviously leads to improvements in that area.  So I think in general, the answer to that is yes.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, three questions, please.  The first one is the implementation of the market risk charge.  Is that going to be all in 2010, because though it should reflect probably a split hit in 2010 as well as 2011 or is it in line with the Basel II two press release that it's all in 2010?</p>
          <p>Second question is, in thinking about dividends and normalized levels, how do buybacks fit into just thinking there?  Are buybacks also kind of a normalized component in your thinking?  And the third one is coming back to Jernej's question on the Private Banking gross margin.  Earlier this year, you recorded a step up in net interest income because the corporate center charged you with more interest income in the private bank for your access deposits, because your CDS spread widened.  Is that already being reversed or I thought it was back then about a five-basis-point impact or should we expect that the CDS spread came down obviously over the past couple of months, that this is &#x2013; that this should also be a negatively impacting net interest income in the private bank?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Renato, want to answer the first question about market risk charge?  I think it's actually all in 2010, but....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's what we foresee, by the end of 2010 and includes &#x2013; basically that couple of hundred basis points includes all the known changes that will come out under the new Basel II framework.  So I cannot give you a straight answer besides January '11 or in December '10, but this is our rough estimate of what the impact will be on our risk-weighted assets, out again on all the foreseeable or announced changes for Basel II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question on, I guess, sort of buybacks, specifically.  Right now, I don't think given the environment and the way with all the discussions on the regulatory side all around the world, I don't think there is a &#x2013; there is not a lot of discussion about buybacks.  So obviously, your guess is as good as ours is to how that goes over time.  We clearly have a lot of capital, we have a very capital generative business model and I think that will continue to be case, but some exactly how that develops over time, I think your guess is probably as good as ours, but right now, I don't think it's really something that's a serious discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that actually means when you say a normalized level, that we just should look at historic payout ratios and just forget about the buybacks, i.e. if you don't factor in buybacks, would a historical normalized payout ratio be higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess we're &#x2013; I guess when we are &#x2013; our reference is to the dividend payouts in the past, so, yeah, without reference to the share buyback activity.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, your question on kind of revisiting this net interest margin with a &#x2013; with a reference to the CDS, as you say the corporate center CDS charge, certainly the higher funding rates have a positive impact on deposit revenues.  But there is not so much change there and I think in this quarter, it was really more the higher funding rate, I think on overall basis that had &#x2013; is the only really negative impact on the net interest margin kind of revenue side.  I am actually not sure about the CDS, we may have to get back to you on that, because I'm not exactly sure how what that previous charge was.  I actually don't know the answer to what the previous charge was and how that's playing through now, so we can &#x2013; maybe we can get back to you with that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody.  Three questions.  The first one, you've given us quite a good indication as where you think the opportunities are in the Investment Banking revenues.  But if we just perhaps focus on fixed income, obviously this year, we've seen obviously the widening of margins and the high levels of corporate debt issuances to crucial trends would including revenues.  If I was to ask you what you think those trends might be over next five quarters, perhaps you'd like to just give some thought or give some suggestion as to what you think they might be?  That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on Asset Management, you've talked in the presentation about obviously the way the business has stabilized, but can you give us a flavor for what still sits in there in terms of what Bob has in there in the private equity portfolio and to what extent that has been now reduced, so that we can see not so many losses going through the that line in the P&amp;L, which shows the losses on the private equity book?</p>
          <p>And perhaps just following on from that, clearly Bob's job has been to stabilize the business and he stepped up to the plate when David left.  What are your plans for the business going forward, because obviously Bob's background isn't in Asset Management or it has been for last couple of years, but it hasn't been historically.  What are your plans in terms of driving the business forward, once it's actually come out of the phase it's been in?</p>
          <p>And then the final question, which is a tricky one, but you seem to have done everything in terms of compensation within the Investment Bank to really deal with all the noise from the G-20 and other sort of constituents.  But having said all of that, you see Alistair Darling last night being close to saying what happened to Goldman Sachs last week sends the wrong signals.  And while you've been dealing with obviously the regulatory issues, the political issues are building very rapidly in terms of the bonus pay outs and clearly, I think you are now at a situation where compensation for employees is higher than it was in '07 for the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>So I just wonder what contingency plans you've put in place or are thinking about in terms of dealing with those pressures and you might well say, well, it doesn't really matter because everybody will be hit with the same issues.  And therefore, it's not a competitive problem.  What are you thinking about?  I mean, last week, Goldman Sachs obviously gave $200 million to charity as I am sure, part of their strategy.  I don't know if, Brady, whether you can share anything how you are going to deal with this noise that undoubtedly, from a political perspective, will get louder as you get towards December and January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for those questions.  First of all on the fixed income revenues and I guess you kind of asked the prospects for the next 12 months or so, where we see things going.  I think a lot of it comes back to that Slide 17, I mean we think that while we've enjoyed very good margins and also activity in the RMBS in a lot of rates areas, particularly outside the U.S., we think that those will certainly &#x2013; that we are going to continue to see good performances in those areas, but they may well become more competitive over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>But I think our guess is that in RMBS, the volume remains high, rates might be a little bit less and then obviously, the rate side somewhat comes onto the question of when and if central banks start to increase some rates around the world, that could obviously have some impact.</p>
          <p>In terms of other areas in fixed income, the investment grade area, as you mentioned, you cited that was an area that's obviously had a very strong performance so far this year.  We continue to see good opportunities there, but to expect it to sort of repeat over the next 12 months what we have seen in last 12 months, probably not highly likely.  We do see a lot of more upside though in areas like leveraged finance in emerging markets and obviously that's really good news for us, because we have very strong franchises in those areas.  But we see in leveraged finance, there is a lot of pent-up activity, a lot of refinancing activity from the '05, '07 deals which were done both corporate and private equity, and just a lot, there is &#x2013; there is going to be a lot of restructuring, a lot of new issuance that happens there and we have in leveraged finance, kind of the number one sales, trading, research team and we think we should actually be pretty well positioned for that.</p>
          <p>Same thing in emerging markets, we have a very strong franchise and we think activity will probably increase over the next 12 months in that area.  We're probably still going to see volatile FX markets given the environment and that probably leads to opportunities in FX.  So I think our view is FX probably, there is decent prospects for market activity in FX, and then obviously, the whole government bond issuance area is one where we &#x2013; it's really a question of we continue to see favorable interest rate markets, then I think we'll continue to see decent trends there, but we will have to see how that develops.  So it's kind of, I guess, mixed, but in general, I think our view is that there is &#x2013; there are a lot of areas which really haven't performed all that strongly so far that we think have prospects of doing so, so we'll see on that.</p>
          <p>On the Asset Management side, in terms of private equity, I guess &#x2013; I don't know.  I mean, there is good news and there is a bad news there in the sense that we do obviously have some of our own capital at work, which, as you say, has given rise to losses over previous quarters.  Those are obviously, for the most part, unrealized losses.  So, we still actually have those investments and will continue to, because it's not a business that you can move out of very quickly.  So I suspect that those positions will not change that much.  I think we have in general, about a couple billion dollars worth of exposure there.  And again, obviously as you say to the extent that markets are difficult, it's possible that there could be further write-downs there.  But if markets are &#x2013; continue to be constructive, as they've been, there could also be mark-ups there over time, but &#x2013; and there is also then obviously company-specific issues that come up, but I think that's sort of the balance.</p>
          <p>In terms of the overall business in Asset Management, I think we've, I mean, we've been working hard at executing on our strategy, which is to focus the business more and to align it better with the bank as a whole.  As you know, we've done a number of things in terms of trying to focus the business, sale of our loan-only business to Aberdeen, exit from the money market business, a number of other measures taken.</p>
          <p>What we're left with now is a business model where we're really focusing on our asset allocation business, which is very tied into the Private Bank and we think has good prospects.  Our Swiss business, where we obviously have good market share and good scale.  And then lastly, the alternatives business, where we have a number of excellent aspects of that, but also areas which we're looking to build over time.  And so, that's our focus really is on building that, building the contribution to the bottom line and therefore to the market cap of the firm overall.</p>
          <p>And I think we're &#x2013; I think the net new asset flows in the third quarter were encouraging and obviously it will be dependent on how the market goes and but we're going to continue to execute on that strategy.  So we're actually very &#x2013; we're very positive about the strategy and the impact it will have on the business.</p>
          <p>And your last question was on compensation, I mean, as you say, I mean, it's obviously, it's obviously a &#x2013; it's an issue that's of concern to shareholders and managements.  It's also a concern that goes broader to regulators and the general public.  I think in general, we have tried to be a very responsible player in this area, starting with the fact that we've had for a number of years, plans that have been designed in ways that are consistent with what's currently being suggested by regulators as kind of best practice.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; we did the PATH structure late last year, which I think was generally viewed as a constructive development on the compensation side and the fact that, as you say, two days ago we basically announced that we have put into implementation, detailed implementation, a compensation plan that is consistent with both what FINMA had laid out in their sort of discussion draft as well as what the G-20 under the auspices of the FSB had endorsed.</p>
          <p>We think the fact that we are, as far as we know, the first mover on that represents a pretty responsible step forward.  So as you say, exactly where this debate will go or how it will develop is hard to call, we are trying to do our best to make sure that we are a responsible player there, that we are doing the right things certainly for our shareholders, for our clients, but also in the broader context here.  So and as you say, I guess we will we see how that works out.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good morning.  Just two questions please.  The first one is, how should we think about the size of your excess capital today?  You've said obviously that new changes to Basel II would take about 200 basis points off your Tier 1 to 14.4%.  What standard do you think the Swiss regulators are going to hold you to?  In other words, what kind of buffer over the excess, over the 8% kind of legal minimum might they require of you?  I'm thinking should your target in the new world with new roles be more or less than the current 14?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on the Private Banking flows, net new money very good this quarter, but how do you see the risk short-term of amnesties in Italy and potentially elsewhere and do you see a risk that we might temporarily run below your 6% rate?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, thank you.  As you say, we've got, I think we've got a pretty &#x2013; we've got a very strong level of capitalization.  I think obviously we've talked about one specific element, which is some of the changes in Basel II, but we also have a business that's pretty capital generative.  So over that period, we'll also be generating capital.  So, it's a little hard to know where that all comes out.</p>
          <p>I think as you know, we've set a medium term target of, I think 12.5% Tier 1 ratio.  We think right now to be very well capitalized is helpful from a client and a counterparty point of view and also takes into account some of these developments and how things are going &#x2013; how things are going to move and uncertainties in the market.</p>
          <p>So I don't know that I can give you an exact answer to the question.  I think we are, I think by pretty much any measure, we are very well capitalized and I kind of think that you can come &#x2013; you can &#x2013; we can go through a lot of different scenarios, but I think we are well capitalized and I think we'll remain well capitalized.  So in general, I think our &#x2013; I think our medium term target of 12.5 would probably be sufficient, but obviously, we will see how things develop and whether there are other &#x2013; other issues that come up.</p>
          <p>The net new money issue and as you say, in the context of amnesties in Italy, et cetera, it's &#x2013; we will have to see how it evolves.  It's probably too early to comment in any sort of decisive way on the Italian tax amnesty issue.  Overall, we don't expect to have any material impact on that, and as we said in our Investor Day, by the end of 2012, we kind of think 175 to 225 billion of net new assets between now and then and I think we believe that in the face of a number of these things that are happening, I think the other thing to remember as well is that we are &#x2013; this is the benefit that we have.</p>
          <p>We keep talking about our onshore presences in these markets.  I mean, we do have strong capabilities to pick up even if clients do want to move money from one country to another.  For instance in Italy, we have strong onshore capabilities and I think we will certainly see flows if there are people who &#x2013; customers who want to move money out of Switzerland into Italy, we are in a good place to actually pick up that flow in our onshore business in Italy.  So that's really &#x2013; that's been our focus in developing these networks.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Firstly, a plea just wondering, if it would be possible to get same line by line disclosure for the new segments of wealth management clients, et cetera, as we get for the other divisions?  So the breakout of expenses into personal and general admin, et cetera, just make it easier to model this if nothing else?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, a question on Slide 18, where you give your adjusted revenue for the Investment Bank, and you make, I think it was 3.6 billion adjustment for the nine month revenues.  I was just wondering what elements actually go into that 3.6 billion?  So, is it own debt moves, is it the write-downs, the write-ups, is it other de-risking, just trying to match up that disclosure with some of the other figures that we've been given on sort of the non-recurring items over the past few quarters?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Matthew, thanks for those questions.  The segment obviously is Private Banking overall and as you say, we do provide the information for Private Banking.  Whether &#x2013; I guess what you're saying is you'd like to see it on a granular basis for Wealth Management and Corporate &amp; Institutional, right?  I hope.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please, yeah, if possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're going to give some thought to that.  I mean, it's obviously that would be additional information.  Well, we'll consider it and see what we can come back, but I &#x2013; we hear what you're saying.  On the 3.6 billion, is the &#x2013; which is, as you say, what we call the wind-down losses and other, about 2.6 billion of it is actual exit losses from the business and about 1 billion is from unallocated treasury cost, et cetera.  So that is sort of non-business specific costs.  So about 2.6 billion is actually related to specific losses on the businesses and which you can refer back to the fixed income slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And with those, say you had write-downs taken in the key client business or repositioned businesses, would those not be a part of those adjustments, the adjustments in that 2.6 you highlighted only relate to the exit businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  So any write-downs or any write-ups in any of those ongoing businesses would not be in that 3.6 number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And does that include the repositioned as well as the key client?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jaap Meijer from Evolution.  A question on Page 53 of your financial statements, where it shows the reconciliation within your equity and Tier 1.  Equity was up 5% in the quarter and Tier 1 is virtually stable.  And I noticed that there is a strong increase in other adjustments in this reconciliation.  I just wondered what it was.  Is this perhaps a change in your dividend accrual from a nominal level towards a percentage of earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that question, just a second.  We'll see if we can take a look at the number and take a look at the page and come back, just one second.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so you see the change or the deduction in other adjustments is going up from 3.5 to 4.8 billion in the quarter.  And I was just thinking what does it relate to?  Is it to the increased dividend accruals, because I think you might have just accrued for a nominal dividend, I think in the first six months and this is perhaps changed in to a percentage of earnings in the line of you used to pay in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of that is foreign exchange impact that were higher in the third quarter than in the second.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And then we had a &#x2013; then we had to book a, or rebook to goodwill the Apraden acquisition, which of course goes against capital, so that was also a reason why it's higher.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and could you be slightly more specific on the trading assets, because the first quantitative impact study of BIS was showing a quite a wide dispersion, so could you also confirm it's not more than at least or a couple of hundred basis points?  So it's not going to be &#x2013; Credit Suisse was not the one, the outlier in the 43 banks that was being in the &#x2013; being reviewed in the survey.</p>

          <p>Yeah, sure.  As usual, we are having a lot of tax assessment that when you file a tax return, you assess your tax, you estimate your tax and then you resolve these tax discussions with the local tax authorities.  And then of course occasionally, that results in a positive impact, because you have put aside more provisions than you actually finally need.  And of course, you will see those &#x2013; hopefully you will see those rather than the other way around going forward.</p>

          <p>Hello, I have a question on Page &#x2013; Slide 16 on the incremental costs in the Investment Banking division.  Do you expect further IT investment costs to come and for the cost associated with exiting businesses?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks for the question.  Yeah, I think in general we don't &#x2013; on the costs associated with exit, I mean there will be costs going forward, but we think they are probably pretty stable.  So, it's not that they're going to &#x2013; it's not that they are going to rise.  But we do still &#x2013; we still are &#x2013; we do still have some businesses to work out of.  In terms of investment on the IT side, yeah, we are going to &#x2013; and we view that as one of the important aspects of the overall client offering is to make sure that we have strong IT.  We've talked some things like adapting our industry-leading AES platform across our fixed income platforms, et cetera, FX, so we probably will have &#x2013; we will continue to have investment on the IT side.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  The question would be on 18 &#x2013; Slide 18 and how really to interpret it?  I'm afraid it's kind of a repetition, but I will try my luck nevertheless.  So, the right way to look at this would be to take the 4.7, 9.8 annualized, plug in a growth rate, let's say, 10%, and then also annualize the 5.3, and then take out enough percentage, let's say 50% of revenues?  And if I take for example that &#x2013; that gives me 24 billion of revenues, is that the way to look at it, is that the way you look at it and is that &#x2013; what's the time horizon for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, what this was &#x2013; this was actually just &#x2013; this was just looking at the nine-month revenues and splitting it into those categories.  So as you say, we haven't &#x2013; we haven't done &#x2013; we haven't shown here the analysis that you are going through.  As you're saying, if you wanted to trying to estimate how you thought revenues might develop, then that would be kind of a numerical way to do, a quantitative way to do what sort of I talked about when I think Huw asked the question in terms of estimating timing and scale of impact on the different areas.</p>
          <p>So for instance, you mentioned the 5.3 going down by 50%, that would be more than I would estimate, because I think as I mentioned, I think it's got actually a much longer horizon and probably more stability than most &#x2013; than maybe some people would think.  So but on the other hand, I also don't think that the top two boxes go up by 50% either so and there are different time scales, whereas I mentioned, I think probably the green box grows more slowly, because it actually requires us doing things and building our franchises, whereas the grey box is somewhat more dependent on markets.</p>
          <p>So if the prime brokerage environment just simply gets better because hedge funds increase their leverage and become more active, then that'll be something that will feed through very quickly in our results, because we've got the market share and growing market share, so.  Yeah, so but I guess as you say, that would be a &#x2013; that would be a quantitative way to kind of go through what I talked about in terms of our &#x2013; what we view as the prospects for the different areas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  Just, if we're trying to assess the earnings power of the Group sort of in a post crisis environment, do you think that the third quarter result here is reasonably useful as a run rate?  I guess with some seasonal weakness on the Private Banking margins, there is some excess returns perhaps in some of the fixed income revenues, but all, in do you think this is somewhat indicative of what this franchise should be able to deliver sort of on an ongoing basis?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's really a good question.  Obviously, in all these areas, you have the elements of the market, environment, et cetera that will &#x2013; that plays a big role.  So hard to estimate on that.  I think what we've &#x2013; what we've tried to &#x2013; when we look at the business, I think in general, we feel like the private banking business, our franchise in Switzerland has kind of maintained very good market share, in fact, grown market share, has seen very good net flows in and yet the underlying activity in the &#x2013; in that part of the business for the industry has been somewhat subdued.  So our view is that probably over time, there should be upside to that part of the business.</p>
          <p>We believe on the Asset Management side, there are certainly some industry impact, but also for us, as we mentioned, we do feel like we are making progress on our strategy and our focus in those areas.  And again, third quarter net new asset flows were encouraging in that regard.  We still have more work to do, but so we feel like that's probably an area that should hopefully do better over time.</p>
          <p>And then on the Investment Bank, again, it kind of comes back to the same story we've talked a couple of times, which is how do you weigh the different elements of the business mix and how do you view them as developing over time?  I think what we've tried to highlight is that we think there is, I mean, obviously it can go either way.  We think there is actually more potential for increases if markets continue to be constructive or get better in some of the areas, like we mentioned prime services, cash equities, emerging markets, leveraged finance, then that will give some potential up swing to the revenues.  We hope the actions we take on market share will give us some increased revenues and then obviously, you have offsets to that in other areas where margins may come down or volumes may come down.</p>
          <p>So I guess that's, maybe that's a long non-answer to your question about whether we think the third quarter is a decent run rate, but we certainly see &#x2013; certainly conditions were good in the third quarter.  There is no question that conditions were good.  Particularly for the third quarter, conditions were good, but a number of parts to the business, we still see potential upside and so hard to say how you balance all that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but obviously, I mean, with a big disclaimer for broader market conditions, but you would not discourage people to kind of use this as some sort of indication?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our hope and our aspiration is that we continue to grow the business and make more over time.  But I also think, I mean our hope is also that people do focus on the quality of the returns, because I mean, again, a 25% return on equity on a 16.5% Tier I ratio and on 30% less risk than what we had a year ago is, I think, a pretty high quality performance that's going to be fairly durable through various market environments.  So anyway, so I hope also people do focus on that.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning.  Just one question, I understand you're displaying total operations revenues of CHF 3.6 billion.  I'm not sure, but I &#x2013; that's the first time I've &#x2013; I'm seeing this figure and you're calculating that back until 2006, when you started to integrate Credit Suisse First Boston.  I would like you to explain how you calculate actually that figure and maybe also give me an argument whether you are showing that figure now in the context of the whole regulation discussion which is going on?  Just the too big to fail problem in Switzerland is being &#x2013; is being discussed very hotly and I understand that you are trying to show arguments to sustain your business model?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good, thank you.  It's actually &#x2013; actually on the collaboration revenues, we've actually &#x2013; maybe we haven't &#x2013; maybe we haven't made it prominent enough, but we've actually been disclosing those revenues, I think, for the last couple of years and so we've been actually on a quarterly basis, we have disclosed them.  So if you wanted to see the kind of historical progression, you could go back and look at that or...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>We could provide it to you.  But so, we have been showing it actually on a regular basis.  Your question about how it's calculated is a really good question.  It's obviously &#x2013; it's a somewhat complex question to answer.  But what we've tried to do is we tried to be pretty honest about what we view as revenues that we do garner as a result of being an integrated bank.  Because there are obviously some things, some revenues that are provided by different parts of the bank to other parts that you could actually do outside without much difference in the structure and so we've tried to be pretty honest about where we see real value from the integrated institution.</p>
          <p>And we do, I mean, we still &#x2013; I mean, we've set a target for actually, I think it's 2012 now of getting that number up to 10 billion and that's something that we still &#x2013; that's still our aspiration.  We see a lot of benefit for our business from having a &#x2013; from this close collaboration and so our hope is that over time, we'll continue to see that develop and we'll make that target, but obviously it's a pretty aggressive target given where we are today.</p>
          <p>I think the too big to fail issue, we are &#x2013; I think certainly that, as you say, is a debate and we are somewhat engaged in the discussions with the regulators and in general with the public.  I think that it's an important discussion.  I guess our hope is that people, first of all, recognize what's been done already, which is if you look at the changes that have been made in the Credit Suisse business model, substantial reduction in nominal balance sheet, substantial reduction in risk, a much less risky business model, much higher capitalizations than we had a couple of years ago.  So in general, that makes the institution much less systemically risky in the first place.</p>
          <p>So we hope people actually do recognize what's been done and we're not saying that it's not an important discussion and debate that we should carry on.  But there should be recognition of what has changed.  And the other thing that we think is important and maybe this is where you were getting out with your collaboration revenue question is, there also has to be some recognition of the positives that come out of the financial system and the large banks, et cetera, particularly here in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>We take very seriously our role to provide capital for the economy here, to provide access outside of the country to capital, et cetera and I think that's actually been &#x2013; I mean, I hope that's been an important part of the growth here and the financial system.  So I just think we also need to keep that in context too when we think about kind of the too big to fail issue, but we &#x2013; we've actually been regularly reporting the collaboration revenue, so.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Well thanks everybody for your questions and thanks for listening to our presentation and for those who are still on listening to the Q&amp;A.  I guess, I just wanted to leave you with the couple of points.  We &#x2013; the Investment Bank with this lower risk, more capital efficient, client-focused model, we think we'll continue to produce more sustainable results from its well-diversified portfolio of businesses.</p>
          <p>We think also that the &#x2013; we are happy with the third quality of &#x2013; the quality of the third quarter performance.  We had a very strong return on equity of 25%.  We think that complements a strong first half and shows the strategic approach is working well.  Secondly, as we mentioned, these returns have been achieved in the context of an industry-leading capital position and with 30% lower risk-weighted assets compared to the third quarter of last year.  And third, taken together, we think that the results do demonstrate that the differentiated strategy is providing a good foundation for sustainable, high quality, lower volatility earnings.  And lastly, we do believe that we're well positioned for growth in the new competitive landscape.</p>
          <p>So with that, I want to thank everybody for your time and your interest and have a good day.  Good-bye.</p>
