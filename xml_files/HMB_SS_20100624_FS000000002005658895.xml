          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hennes &amp; Mauritz Six-Months Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Mr. Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you everybody and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's second quarter results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen is with me today and he will be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, second quarter 2010. Sales excluding VAT reached 27 billion in the quarter, an increase of 2% in Swedish kronor and 10% in local currencies. Sales in comparable units decreased 1%. The quarter started with strong sales in March, while both April and May were affected by unusually cold weather for the season in most of H&amp;M's markets. In addition, April was affected by negative <mark type="inaudible" /> effect. In May, sales in local currencies were up 6% and down 4% in comparable units.</p>
          <p>May sales were affected negatively by calendar effects of around 2 to 4%. However, in June, sales in local currencies are up 23% from the 1st of June to the 22nd compared to the same period last year. The calendar effect was positive around 2 to 2.5%.</p>
          <p>Gross profit in the second quarter increased by 10% to 17.8 billion, corresponding to the gross margin of 65.9%, compared to 61% last year. Currency hedging of the mark-up on internal sales to subsidiaries had a positive effect on the gross margin of 50 basis points. In the second quarter last year, the equivalent effect was negative 130 basis points, which makes a 180 basis point swing year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The gross margin was also positively affected by the fact that the U.S. dollar at the time of the purchases for the second quarter this year was weaker than it had been this year earlier. Other factors, such as greater surplus capacity to suppliers, lower transportation costs, favorable raw material prices, and efficiency improvements in the buying process also had positive impact on the gross margin.</p>
          <p>Increased markdowns, meanwhile, had a negative impact of 30 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. The gross margin level as such is still not a main target. Our aim is always to deliver fashion and quality at the best price for our customers.</p>
          <p>Cost control remained good in the second quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were 10.8 billion, up 3% in Swedish kronor and 10% in local currencies compared to the second quarter last year. The increase is related to the expansions.</p>
          <p>Operating profits for the quarter rose 23% to nearly 7 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of 25.8%. Profit after financial items reached above 7 billion, a rise of 22% from the year before. Net profit increased 24% to 5.2 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 3.15. As you know, the number of shares were doubled on the 1st of June as a result of the 2-to-1 share split.</p>
          <p>Like we said earlier, the unseasonably cold weather in many markets in April and May had a negative impact on sales in the quarter. Germany was affected, particularly in men. Otherwise the development in Germany was solid. Eastern Europe had a tough quarter and Poland especially was hit by heavy rains and flooding. Further South in Spain, things were tougher, but the year-on-year development improved in the second quarter compared to previous quarters. The situation in Greece and Ireland was very demanding still, but our exposure to these markets is limited.</p>
          <p>In contrast, development was very good in the large and important growth markets of North America, Asia and Russia. Starting with North America, sales increased at the beginning of the year, although against weak comparables. The positive trend strengthened in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We are very satisfied with the continued strong sales growth in our new markets, Asia and Russia. Combined, these markets already represented close to 5% of group sales in the second quarter, up from 2.5% a year ago.</p>
          <p>That was a few comments on our sales and markets. Now, looking at some key figures for the period, please turn to the slide key data.</p>
          <p>The stock-in-trade was 8.6 billion, a decrease of 0.5% compared to the same time last year. Excluding currency translation effects, the stock-in-trade increased by approximately 2%. The stock-in-trade consists of more spring garments than planned due to weaker sales &#x2013; due to the weaker sales development than planned in April and May. This could lead to higher price reduction level in the third quarter compared to last year. In relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 8.3%, historically a low level. Cash flow from current operations increased by a strong 74% to 12.5 billion. The increase can be explained mainly by higher results, lower stock, and lower tax payments.</p>
          <p>During the first 6 months of the year, we invested SEK 1.7 billion, mainly in new stores. The decrease of 18% compared to the same period last year is due to currency translation effects, slightly fewer projects, and better terms as a result of the macro environment.</p>
          <p>Our finances remained strong, despite dividend of SEK 13.2 billion. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to 19 billion. Return on equity was 54.8% compared to 51.6, rolling 12 months.</p>
          <p>And now, some words on the future and our expansion plan. H&amp;M continues to grow. In the first half of the year, we opened 86 new stores and we closed 12. At the end of May, we had 2,062 stores, of which 42 were franchise. The H&amp;M brand is present in 37 countries.</p>
          <p>Our expansion target remains intact. We increased the number of stores by 10 to 15% per year with continued high profitability. We have many exciting offerings to look forward to. We plan to open <mark type="inaudible" /> 166 stores in the second half of the year. Most of the openings are planned for Germany, the U.S., the UK, France, China and Italy.</p>
          <p>We see great potential in Asia, and the Asian share of the group is likely to grow. Our newest market, South Korea, is already a success; and in Japan, the response from our customers is great also outside Tokyo. China is one of our top 5 markets in terms of openings already this year. Our expansion in Russia this autumn will include a new store in a beautiful historic building on one of Russia's most well-known streets, Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we are excited about opening our third H&amp;M store in Las Vegas. This will be a flagship store in Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, one of the strongest performing shopping centers in the U.S. The store interior will be spectacular. The opening is planned for the end of this year. We're also looking forward to our opening in Paris, where world-renowned French architect, Jean Nouvel is designing the first H&amp;M stores on Champs-Elys&#xE9;es. The store will open this autumn.</p>
          <p>Our fashion is available on 4 Continents today. We have received many questions lately about markets on other Continents, more precisely South America and Australia, and about India. These markets all offer great potential and are interesting in longer perspective. We have, however, no immediate plan to enter.</p>
          <p>Today we have 4 other new and interesting markets to tell you about. Let's start with Turkey, a large country with a young population and where fashion awareness is high. 72 million people live in Turkey and 30 million of them in Istanbul. More than 60% of the population is people younger than 35 years. The first store will be a full concept store located in Forum Istanbul, one of Europe's largest shopping centers.</p>
          <p>In 2011, Croatia and Romania will become new markets. We see a great interest for H&amp;M in both countries, and we'll open our first store in Zagreb and Bucharest next spring. Morocco will also become a new market next year via our franchise partner, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Online and catalog are important sales channels in addition to our stores. From September, our customers in the UK will be able to shop online in H&amp;M and H&amp;M Home. Thus, we developed online sales in 8 markets. As you know, we plan to open our first H&amp;M stores outside <mark type="inaudible" /> this autumn; in London, Helsinki, and Copenhagen. H&amp;M Home will also open in Amsterdam and we are looking at locations in other markets where we offer online and catalog sales.</p>
          <p>Our expansion also includes our formats, Monki, Weekday and COS, and all of them had opened new stores in attractive shopping locations during the spring. So, I think we should sum up before we take questions. We delivered strong results for the second quarter and very satisfactory sales in the first 3 weeks of June.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our designers have created new attractive collections for the upcoming autumn and winter season. We continued the work of improving our customer offer further and to give our customers an even better experience. And we maintained our positive view on the possibilities for future expansion, both in existing and new markets, and short-term as well as long-term.</p>
          <p>Thank you for attention. We're now happy to take the questions. And please remember, 1 question at a time. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder if you could talk a bit about the conditions in the supply chain right now, so we think about conditions now relative to say, 6 or 12 months ago out of Asia? Do you notice any significant influence from change in capacity, local cost pressures or the return of North American demand? How is it affecting the process relative to where you were say, 6, 12 months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah, we can see that the demand for spare capacity also &#x2013; the demand for capacity is increasing, that means less capacity compared to 6 or 12 months ago. Also, the cost inflation, higher raw material prices etcetera are getting much more negative for the retail industry than it has been for half year, one year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just with regards to the expansion, the type of new space. Are you seeing any change in the conditions in the mall market and could you give us a flavor for what proportion of your expansion is coming through high street as opposed to mall locations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can confirm, as we said in the Q1 result that the new malls globally are &#x2013; the supply of new malls is of course much more limited going forward as a result of the macro environment. It's mainly into China, we see a lot of new malls coming up, but in the rest of the world it is quite limited. So, of course, there are other ways of expanding and the expansion target for the year of 240 stores net remains, and the proportion between malls and high street is not something we prefer to really go into detail, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Karen Howland from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you &#x2013; how, and if you could &#x2013; trying to combat the increases in prices coming out of the supply chains, you are talking about the raw material. I think I noticed on &#x2013; there was a press comment saying that you do not plan to raise prices in the second half of the year. I know previously you actually said you were planning on lowering prices in the second half of the year. Does that still stand or how do you expect to counter-impact that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We have invested in our customers and we'll keep on doing that. And when it comes to these external factors that previously have been favorable for the whole retail industry, turn to be negative, so that's correct, but how we're going to react on those external factors, of course, we're looking how the market in general is reacting and adjusting to that. But for us it's always the most important thing, is to have a long-term view in our business to keep &#x2013; stick to our business idea to offer fashion and quality at the best price and to ensure that we have the best customer offer on each separate market. That is what is our goal, not the gross margin in itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think there is an opportunity to continue to invest in price in the second half of the year, despite the fact you've got these headwinds coming from the external environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we will keep on investing in our custom offer in the future as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you quantify, in the first half of the year how much you had invested in price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that we want to keep to ourselves for competitive reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the customers seem to appreciate it.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My first question is about your inventory position, up 3% in constant currency, your sales up double-digit in constant currency, yet you're still, I guess, not that happy with the composition of the inventory. Have you done something which has allowed you to flow your inventory more quickly, and so actually if it weren't for the excess spring inventory, your inventory position would be substantially better even than the number you reported today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have been working to handle this stock levels more efficiently. We have invested a lot in the logistic chain, our buying processes, our planning processes, all those things have been abling us to have a more lean stock-in-trade level. And to comment on the situation as per end May, one have to remember that this momentary picture of the stock-in-trade. And as we say, we have more spring garments than planned in the end of May due to the weaker sales in April and May that we were planning for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may sort of just add on to that. Does that mean you no longer have more spring garments than planned, given you <mark type="inaudible" /> obviously very good in June so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just started our summer sales in some of our countries just a week, a week and a half ago. So we still have them, part of them still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally one last question, promise, if you look at the season as a whole, would you regard your overall like-for-like sales performance as satisfactory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We planned for better, to be honest, but I mean given the circumstances I think we could say satisfactory, still a positive development in the 6 months.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello. I've got a new &#x2013; I'm sorry, I've got question on the new countries you're going into. There seems to be quite a few at the moment, so I was wondering what the timing is in terms of pressure on operating costs, and what you're doing in these new countries, are you putting down a new warehouse in every case and having a merchandising team, for example, in each one?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; I mean, if you look at Turkey, there is a plan for a DC, but that will be outsourced, and when it comes to the other smaller countries, they will be managed, I think, from nearby countries, at least, initially they're quite small compared to our other countries in Europe.</p>

          <p>South Korea is already up and running and there we have a DC, which is outsourced.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Could you just talk a little bit more about your strategy for Internet? You've given us a date at least for the UK launch, but will that be accompanied by a catalog in the UK? And maybe if you could just explain why the prices of new &#x2013; rolling out new countries appears to be quite slow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's the question we get very often. To start with the UK, initially we will target online sales, and the plan is to add the catalog later, because we consider the 3 channels very important; the online, catalog, as well as retail, of course, but it's a good way to start with the online. Now, when you talk about the pace, it's not that we are not happy with the development in other countries, but it's the contrary, we are developing very, very well, and Pozna&#x144;, which you know &#x2013; as you know, was launched as a <mark type="inaudible" /> online sales, it's already being expanded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So all of the UK online logistics will be done through Pozna&#x144;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure, because we thought that &#x2013; we have some other facilities, but in the beginning, I think, yes. But, of course, we'll look at &#x2013; the plan is to roll out online and catalog sales in most of our &#x2013; or all our countries, that is always we want to do with quality and take it step-by-step.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good. I just wanted to clarify your comments on June trading, if I may. Are you saying that it was boosted by an earlier sale?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are not. Actually the sale was <mark type="inaudible" /> same time, and hasn't really started in all countries yet. If anything, the sale would start later this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So are you saying that the higher markdown you referred to in the statement, is that locked in or if sales continue to grow as they have done in June then you won't have a markdown issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're not locked in, but it's too early at this stage. We just started the third quarter. We just wanted to make a statement that just because we have the lower inventory level, it's not a guarantee that the markdown level will be lower than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. And just on currency, I just had a question on that, if we looked at the gross margin in the second quarter before the internal hedge and before markdowns, was currency the biggest part of that improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't want to quantify the different factors that is causing the gross margin. But, yes, currency was one of the factors affecting the gross margin positively in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Is it possible gross margin could go down over the next few quarters as you're now buying dollars at a sharply inferior rate than the prior year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. I was wondering how you see this industry to react to the more difficult sourcing environment in Asia, whether you expect that retailers will choose to pass through sourcing cost increases starting in 2011, and if you see the likelihood of price inflation or whether you think that retailers are going to pause and seek efficiencies, and how you plan to play in this context going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's a mixed picture. There are some peers that have already announced that they will increase their prices. There's some local here in Sweden and also some in the UK. But I think some of them will probably have sold under margins as always, and the way we'll do it, as Jyrki said, we'll always try to have the best customer offer in the markets.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>On the whole, they're developing according to plan. We have today 59 stores. 40 new already this year, and compared to the 90 we had at the &#x2013; acquisition we have expanded quite aggressively. But we see a big potential for this to roll it out in many more countries.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, that is a good question. But we have chosen for competitive reasons not to talk about the different <mark type="inaudible" /> percentage between the different &#x2013; and what's retail and what's catalog. For us that is not so important. We see that the 3 channels really combined and it's a good complement and it's all about accessibility and service for the customers.</p>

          <p>Hi, gentlemen. One question on the &#x2013; just on expansion targets, 240 stores this year. Could you sort of give some assurance bearing on to your earlier comments on mall availability, that you'll be able to achieve sort of the same type of level of opening in 2011?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the follow-up. Just wondering if you could give a little detail as far as the other brands; COS, Weekday and Monki, are these now profitable brands for you? Any indication, as far as where the margin is trending in those and what the sales, comparablily to the pure H&amp;M banner is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we start with COS, we now have about 27 stores. We have opened 4 new this year. We're quite happy with the development, and we see continued potential to roll this out. I think we can now confirm that it works; now it's more about scale it up <mark type="inaudible" /> to improve the profitability. And when it comes to fabric, I just mentioned, in an earlier question, that we have now 59 stores and it's &#x2013; we have learned that initially, it's a bit lower compared to H&amp;M with regard to new countries, because H&amp;M is such a strong brand, but we see that, over time, it develops well. But, of course, integration and expansion, it takes a lot of effort and time. So, the profitability is not where we want to be in the long-term. And when it comes to H&amp;M Home &#x2013; H&amp;M Home finally, we only have 1 store so far, which is in Stockholm, and we have announced 4 H&amp;M stores this year; Copenhagen, London, Helsinki, London and we're looking at more.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. A couple of questions. First, on the internal hedging, I just wanted to confirm that, end of third quarter of this year, we should expect a 60 basis point negative impact versus last year, i.e., here on in, it's just the unwind of the positives of last year in Q3 and Q4? And the second question, just wondering what your exposure in terms of production to Bangladesh was <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One question at a time. The first question was the 60 from the last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. In Q3, 2009 we have a &#x2013; had a positive effect of 60 basis points when it comes to the internal hedging, and also then we had around 1% positive effect from the unhedged part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we should expect the full unwind in Q3 from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if it's year-on-year, yeah, the difference, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And the second question, just on Bangladesh, because there have been strikes and generally unhappy workers there, wondering what, if you are seeing any impact from your logistics and what percent should &#x2013; percentage of production you have in Bangladesh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As of now, as far we know, the production for H&amp;M has not been affected. But it is true that &#x2013; it is, we have a lot of sourcing in Bangladesh, and we &#x2013; of course, we follow the development closely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's a significant part of your sourcing then, isn't it?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Sorry, my phone was on mute. It's a question about the question actually. Earlier on, in one of your responses, you said that in the third quarter, we could expect the 60 basis point positive impact from last year's internal hedging to unwind, i.e. it would be a negative 60 bps per share, and also that the 100 bps that was unhedged would also unwind. I'm guessing you wouldn't necessarily agree with the bit about the 100 bps that was unhedged, because that....</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I had a question on the trends that you're seeing in Eastern Europe. It looks to being perhaps a relatively disappointing quarter in the region. Outside of the flooding period, did you see any reason to be more &#x2013; more positive on that part of the world? And is there some sort of catchup spend that may have filtered through into the &#x2013; into your June numbers, predominantly related to that region?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What can I say? I mean, they were negatively hit by the unseasonably rainy and floodings, of course, and apart from that, they don't stick out in any direction, I would say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just wanted to check, when we think about markdown for Q3, am I right in remembering that it was about a 100 basis points negative impact in Q3 last year, markdown?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think it will be &#x2013; your markdown experience will be worse than Q3's markdown experience of last year, just to be clear?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said, it's too early to have any good picture, but what we are saying is that the stock-in-trade has more spring garments than planned and that can cause more and more reductions, or markdowns, compared to last year, but of course that is depending on the selling during the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Yeah. While I've got you &#x2013; Germany remains an expansion market for you. Can you talk a bit about where you're now opening in your biggest market, does it tend to be slightly smaller secondary units in towns, or are you still finding room for flagship stores?</p>

          <p>Hi, sorry, shall I ask you another question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No problem. You're welcome.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm only up to 2. Just on the inventory stuff that I think Robert was just talking about, what should the inventory have been if you had been going according to plan at the end of May? What percentage lower would it have been than it actually was? And maybe it's another way of asking that question, you've seemed to imply that the 31st of May was a moment in time, might have suggested it was distorted by something or the other. I mean, where is that inventory now, expressed in the same way, ex-currency growth year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The stock-in-trade in May, it should have been lower, but we don't want to quantify exactly how much. But, as we said, it's a momentary picture of stock-in-trade and it can vary quite substantially within just 1 or 2 weeks. So that's more important to look over the assortment, planning, etcetera and that we are comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think no one else on this conference call is comfortable with that, but I just really want to get some idea of quantification, I suppose. Has there been a &#x2013; is it sort of 5% too much, that sort of level, some order of magnitude rather than an actual figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said, we don't want to go into <mark type="inaudible" /> we are, at least happy with the &#x2013; our assortment planning and the incoming planning for the months to come. As we said last year, we were a little bit lean with some garments, especially with that hit the selling in August, and from that we have learnt, hopefully, and are having a much better planning for this year.</p>

          <p>Yes, you said during the last conference call that you didn't expect any negative impact from rising wages and high capacity in Asia before, at the earliest, Q4 and possibly in Q1 '11, is that still the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if we talk about roughly 6 months lag that still remains.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yes, just one very quick follow-up. I just noticed in the quarter that you're kind of like-for-like selling expenses that the rate at which you seem to be taking cost out on a like-for-like basis appeared to slow. So should we be thinking now that that you've reached a trough in terms of your selling expense &#x2013; your expenses, OpEx per store, and as we move into next year, do you think &#x2013; do you see there being sort of inflationary trends in terms of wages, rents and energy costs for you guys in that particular line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when it comes to SG&amp;A expenses, as we have said earlier, we have a good cost focus and it has been increasing as a share on sales, but we are comfortable with the way we are controlling the cost levels. For instance, in comparable stores, we have managed to keep it more or less on the same level, even that the cost is a little bit lower for Q2. So, we are really comfortable that the increase is following the &#x2013; let's say, the expansion figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And that's something that we should be thinking for 2011 as well, we don't think there are strong inflationary pressures now in some of those lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't want to give any forward calls for that, but we are comfortable at least with our way of working with the cost level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question was actually pretty much the same as the preceding question. It goes to the SG&amp;A per store development. Then I would just like to add one question, could you instead tell us a bit more, what type of costs you've actually been able to bring down at this stage, if you look back? What are the main drivers behind the actual decline in selling cost per store at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We choose not go and elaborate on that detailed level, but we think that all our cost is controlled in a good way when it comes to staff cost also, when it comes to rent agreements and &#x2013; but we don't &#x2013; we choose not to go into such a detail and elaborate with the different levels when it comes to costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I look forward, I would suppose a typical rental index in Sweden, at least would be probably up a couple of Finnish points in this year, and so will wages be according to the most recent deal with unions. Is there any reason to think why you should have a different cost outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the cost outlook is probably the same when it comes to indexation and also the staff cost, that's true. But we always try to find more efficient ways to work, and also when it comes to negotiations, we always try to be better in that as well, but yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, you are right. I mean, that is exactly why we need to have a like-for-like in the long-term, is to offset the inflationary effects that <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Just talking a little more about the gross margin, can you explain the effect from <mark type="inaudible" /> 100 basis point in Q3 last year, that didn't came from higher proportion of spring items, did it? Wasn't that more the selling period in July, and then you ended up with too little summer items in August? So what was the actual reason to slightly higher markdowns last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a combination. It also, of course, included some spring garments, but as you said, it was more that maybe we were too aggressive when it comes to mark down the summer garments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if you &#x2013; when you say now, which you didn't say in &#x2013; after Q4, after Q4, you said it will be high in markdowns and now you say it can be, could it actually be flattish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when it comes to the Q4 comment, then we already had 2 months behind of the Q1. Now we only have 3 weeks in the Q3. So that's the big difference. Then we had a much more clearer picture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And just regarding the SG&amp;A, I mean you have so many years of track record that your SG&amp;A is growing inline with space adjusted for currency translation effects, and now we see that the trend continues. Is it more due to that you manage to, I mean, compensate inflation in more high cost countries, which &#x2013; with that you're actually entering countries with more low-cost perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a mix of them, of course. We are entering maybe low cost countries and that of course helps us when it comes to SG&amp;A.</p>
