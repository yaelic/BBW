          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Schneider Electric's 2010 Annual Results Presentation. So we have a big pleasure to have you here with us today. We'll start today with a presentation by our CEO, Jean-Pascal Tricoire and our CFO, Emmanuel Babeau and then we will take the time to answer your question &#x2013; well for those you who are here with us today and also for those who are connected by phone.</p>
          <p>So Jean-Pascal, please?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning to all of you and people who are in the room, people who are connected with us through the web. We are going to take you with Emmanuel this morning through the results of the Schneider Electric in 2010. We are going to go through a few points. I promise to be very quick on the phone, on an overview of Schneider Electric reminding you of our key figures, the key characteristics of our group. Then I am going to take you on the main highlights on the implementation of our strategy for 2010. Emmanuel will go into the detail of the financial presentation; financial figures, what happened in 2010 and then we are going to finish with the guidance on 2011.</p>
          <p>So straight into the overview of Schneider, a few reminders, we have become in 2010 for the first time in our history a &#x20AC;20 billion turnover company if you take the figures of Areva integrated on the full year, so that's a marker in our history. We do in 2010 37% of our sales in new economies and that has been a powerful engine of growth and of development. We have now 110,000 plus people in more than 100 countries and we invest and I remind you, which is important characteristic of Schneider Electric, 4% to 5% of our yearly sales in R&amp;D and we do that in 25 countries and 45 major sites around the world.</p>
          <p>Two characteristics which are very important &#x2013; for concerning Schneider, we are very global company, and we benefit from a diversified exposure to geographies. Again, another marker in our history on Q4 of 2010, Asia Pac became bigger in terms of business than North America 25% or &#x2013; 24% of our business on the total of 2010. So North America 24%, Asia Pac 24%, West Europe 34% of our turnover, and the rest of the world close to 20% of our business.</p>
          <p>Another important characteristic is a growing diversification of our end markets. Diversification which we have redeveloped in the past years and we do today 20% of our business in Utilities &amp; Infrastructure, 24% in Industrial &amp; Machine. 17% in Data Centers, and 30% in Buildings with the non-res building or residential building for a total of 10%.</p>
          <p>This diversification of exposure geographies and business has been a major factor of resilience and growth through the past two years.</p>
          <p>Moving to next slide, I am very attached to remind you that we consider sustainable development as a major part of our strategy. In the various dimension of environment, ethics, participation through green energy think tanks around the world, we lead a certain number of think tanks around the world in the development of a new way of behaving, living with energy. And finally a strong commitment into bringing energy to the bottom of pyramid with the operation that we've talked to you about several times which is called BipBop.</p>
          <p>We measure our progress around all these directions of sustainable development and we have a barometer with a target at the end of 2011 to exceed 8 on the scale of 10, and at the end of 2010 we were reaching a level of 7.4 which puts us in a very good position of reaching our target for the One Schneider plan at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to be a bit more specific and come back on the highlights of execution of our strategy which took place in 2010. The first thing that characterizes 2010 is very strong growth, very strong rebound, 9.3% of organic growth, two last quarters above 12% of organic growth. I said it, sales reached 20 billion that's organic plus acquisition with integration of Areva on the full year which is an important somewhere marker in terms of size.</p>
          <p>New economies delivered 15% and through the cycle they were always an engine of growth and resilience above the mature countries. But the good news in Q4 is that mature countries are also delivering a strong growth and we're going to go through the details of that. So therefore, we see today North America and Western Europe also continuing to the growth of the group.</p>
          <p>Second point is the strong progress of our profitability, our EBITA before restructure and before consolidation impact of Areva Distribution. I mean like-for-like is up 3.4 points, which is an excellent result. Our operating result for the first time, this time integrating Areva D, is above the bar of 3 billion and we are generating free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.7 billion with a very strong second part of the year, which has to be put in perspective with a strong sales rebound. I mean it's easier for us to generate high cash when the sales are not growing as fast but in the period of very strong growth, we also show that we deliver strong cash.</p>
          <p>Areva D, we're going to speak about acquisitions. We've done a number of acquisitions in 2010 but the biggest was Areva D, strong start, beyond our expectations. This is, as we explained to you, a complex operation but it's taking shape and we are already getting the success, the commercial success of putting together Schneider medium voltage and Areva D to form the world leader in the field of electrical distribution.</p>
          <p>And finally we exceeded &#x20AC;1.2 billion in cost savings and I am now going to come back on that. We had a plan to do 1.6 billion in three years of savings and on the second year 1.2 billion already we've &#x2013; already in two years objective on support function costs already reached and exceeded.</p>
          <p>So we've had overall a very busy year in 2010 solid execution which lays a very strong foundation for growth as we enter in a new phase of the cycle because two years &#x2013; today I mean in Q4 all the business and all the geographies are back to growth.</p>
          <p>I am going to start like this, I am showing you the sequence that we had, the sequence of rebound 2% in Q1, 10% in Q2 &#x2013; this is organic like-for-like &#x2013; 12% in Q3, 12% in Q4. The early rebounders were industry and IT and we kept you informed of that, but the good news is that from Q3 power and buildings rallied to the trend of growth and we've seen now all of our activities coming back to a rebound.</p>
          <p>We've delivered obviously a strong earnings growth of 9% on that &#x2013; again, but I'm repeating myself, due to the diversified exposure of our portfolio geographically and businesswise.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we were chasing for growth, we keep working on efficiency and the crisis for us, as you know, it was time to question the way we work. This is a time when we launch One Schneider, which is another way of working in Schneider, which we call the Schneider Way, we mutualize; we globalize a certain number of functions. We specialize our business to be more consistent and more complete and more competent in front of our customers.</p>
          <p>What we've delivered in two years, now 1.2 billion of savings. And when we look which we means that we are well in line to reach our target of 1.6 billion saving. But the most important for us is that we've already in two years made our objective of savings on support function costs above 600 million. So we've decided now as the cycle is far more positive and as we have plenty of initiatives, which are delivering a profitable growth, to reinvest selectively and I'll speak about that.</p>
          <p>And what we're going to be watching now will be the improvement of our support function cost ratio to sales. In the past two years, we've gained two points &#x2013; 200 basis points of improvement on this support function cost. And now we're going to make sure that as we go, we keep improving gradually the support function cost and we are going to reinvest again principally in R&amp;D and in business, especially in new economies.</p>
          <p>At the same time we have told you already from the end of the first half that the next part of the cost saving will be more directly to productivity, to the industrial part of what we do. And we are targeting for 2011 at least &#x20AC;400 million of savings. We expect a lot from the plan of consolidation of our supply base that we have initiated in the past two years in the frame of One Schneider. And we remind you that we buy at Schneider &#x20AC;10 billion a year from our suppliers. And to date it was a rather dice person sketch of the fort of organization purchasing. We've really worked on that in the past two years.</p>
          <p>So it is about growth but it is also about a big jump and a big change of efficiency, which is not based on just cost cutting, but on a real change in the way we work and we are organized and we interact at Schneider.</p>
          <p>Go to the next slide when we look at the direction for investment it's very simple. It is about energy efficiency where we have a unique positioning with our portfolio. It's about architecting the smart grid, being part of the pioneers or the leaders in architecting the smart grid which is a big evolution of our ecosystem and it's about new economies which are making 37% of our turnover in 2010.</p>
          <p>As we told you in One Schneider the target is to have growth which is three points above GDP across the cycle and a part of our model is to complement organic growth which is always our priority with acquisitions that we shall do and that we do in new economies, that we do to build more scale for solutions and services and I am going to go back to that.</p>
          <p>And acquisitions also to reinforce the leaderships we have in our business, remind you that at the turn of 2000 we had 50% of our portfolio that we are doing as number one or number two in the world, today &#x2013; as of today we do roughly 85% to 90% of our sales with the position of number one or number two of the world. Our experience is that not only we have to be able to integrate full solutions but at the same time we have to be leaders in each of the competency we need to master to articulate those solutions.</p>
          <p>I go to the first engine of growth, developing on my first point, growth and it's solutions. You know that we are well-known on the market in being the leader in selling component bricks of technologies through a vast and far reaching network of integrators, but our consumers are asking for more today. When the application is becoming more complex, more technical, they ask Schneider to build the solution, by the way very often with our network of partners.</p>
          <p>And what we see that in the past years the part of our turnover, solution, has grown to be today roughly one-third of our turnover, which makes a pretty large solution company, but what is very interesting to see also is that solutions have been a factor of resilience during the crisis. They have not decreased as much as the product sales. And they have been a factor of acceleration of 2010. At the beginning products have rebounded a bit faster but what we see clearly today is that solutions are taking very strong relay in driving our growth engine.</p>
          <p>And what is behind this is a systematic and articulated approach to solution, delivering and differentiating our solutions with innovative products, our solutions are not just solutions that benefit from the innovation we put in our products. It's architecting more efficiency in our solutions around ecostructure, more plug and play easy to integrate solutions.</p>
          <p>Solutions which benefit from the vast capular and local network of skills and competencies, we've got more solution centers around the world. And finally solutions signed, guaranteed by one signature brand, which is Schneider Electric, as I remind you, we've migrated 120 brands to 10 brands, which all are signed with Schneider Electric, so it's been a major move. But now our customers see that not only we deliver solution, but there is a brand which is guaranteeing the good operation of the integration of the solution.</p>
          <p>So a few examples here. Take in industry; a key seller is the integration of power and automation for efficiency. Automation is the intelligence of our systems. So by converging power and automation, we'll deliver energy savings and the base line is roughly 30% respect to conventional systems.</p>
          <p>We have the most complete system for Data Centers, today not only white space, but also the grey space, which means the medium voltage, the low voltage. The automatic transmitters, switches security of the building, the efficiency of the building, the control of the building, the cable management, we can offer all the active part of a data center, but the IT.</p>
          <p>We've done, and I'll be back to that, a lot of renewable projects. Here, we don't intend and we are not doing solar panels or wind turbines. Our business is to connect those new generation resources to the grid, to the smart grid and make sure they interact intelligently with the points of consumption. And big business today in buildings, in the energy efficiency of buildings, where we guarantee performance contract, by performance contracting we guarantee the energy performance of more and more buildings.</p>
          <p>Renewables, while we build also the, we architect the smart grid and we are participating to a number of initiatives around the world to make the smart grid a reality. We realized in 2010 more than 600 photovoltaic projects of rather medium to large scale. We are working actively as you know on the infrastructure to recharge the electric vehicle.</p>
          <p>We are working a lot on the flexible distribution, the intelligent distribution, and we are re-deploying the assets, some technological know-how of Areva D, with all of our Schneider forces around the world, so the PACiS substation automation software with all the lineup of intelligent relays for distribution automation.</p>
          <p>And finally we have started a pretty interesting activity of Demand-Response. And today, as of today we have already 100,000 points connected to the Schneider network operating centers to make sure we optimize the demand of the sites we are managing or advising to the supply of energy.</p>
          <p>Second engine for growth is new economies. Nothing new, but the figures are always speaking very well and you see that again in 2010 it appeared a strong rebound of economies. New economies have been a major growth engine. So we are a 7.3 billion sales company in new economies, which is a very large business, a strong presence in the new economies of Asia. I was telling you that Asia-Pac passed North America in sales in Q4 with a very strong dynamic and not because North America was not growing, North America is growing but Asia-Pacific is growing faster.</p>
          <p>The strong presence in Africa, Middle East, strong presence in Eastern Europe, this does not include our recent acquisition of Elektroshield Samara in Russia that will double our presence in Russia; and finally a strong and booming presence in Latin America which has been a very good geography in the past years.</p>
          <p>And I think beyond the figures and the commitment of Schneider to support its teams in the new economies, there is a robust business model. We in the new economies have a business model which is very robust and without entering into the detail it's based about a very capular, a very far reaching presence in the new economies.</p>
          <p>We serve traditionally the diffuse market. We serve the mid-sized customers. We bid on to the daily life of the new economies. We are not in new economies to just to export or to take large projects, we are here serving regular customers with famous brands every day. And we expand today our geographical coverage. We invest in solution integration and service skills. As new economies are up-scaling their capability, they are asking for more technical solutions. So everywhere we are putting together project and solution teams.</p>
          <p>But the most important evolution of the past years has been what if there's a crisis and the constraint it was putting on our resources. We've beefed up our R&amp;D teams in the new economies to develop lineups of products and solutions which are adapted to the new economies: Indian solutions for India, Russian solution for Russia, Brazilian solutions for Brazil, Chinese solution for China. Giving a lot of autonomy to those R&amp;D team, but making sure we think from the beginning our products and our lineups with the mindset of our local customers and our local competitors. And so far, is has been a really good ride.</p>
          <p>Third engine for growth is R&amp;D, and R&amp;D is the only budget we've not touched during the crisis actually we stepped up our expense in R&amp;D to build our ecostructure for all of our key segments. We put here a few examples of products which are coming up but there are only a few examples. The Roombox which is a product of convergence, a product that converges into one very simple system, the control of HVAC, the control of power, the control of security into intelligent buildings. With that kind of solution, you cut the installation systems by 30%, that's beyond the pure saving that you get on energy and on OpEx.</p>
          <p>EcoBreeze, which is a cooling solution for the data center, you know that we are the leaders in in-room cooling in the white space. But when you need room cooling in more traditional designs of data centers, this is a space where we are not traditionally, last year we went out with &#x2013; this year we go out with EcoBreeze which is our own solution. And at the same time, we complement this solution by the acquisition of Uniflair in Italy, which gives us a full lineup of perimeter cooling solutions to face our major competitor.</p>
          <p>We are renewing our world-leading products in final distribution, product called Acti 9, which is a product bringing a new level of security and easiness of installation. Here you have an example also of a motion control solution for the machine manufacturers in China, just the example of what I was mentioning before, it's designed to cost, R&amp;D in new economies to make very, very competitive products.</p>
          <p>And finally, big investment in Western Europe and particularly in France to launch a full line-up of products for the home for the residential; and here you've got your &#x2013; our newly launched line-up for wiring accessories called Odace which already knows a very, very big success.</p>
          <p>Next one, the next part of &#x2013; so I spoke about solutions, spoke about new economies, spoke about R&amp;D. The other part of our model is acquisitions. 2010 was an intense year in terms of acquisitions. And those acquisitions served our strategy of presence in new economies and our strategy of solutions.</p>
          <p>Areva Distribution spoke to it. We acquired also 50% of Elektroshield Samara which on the top of the acquisition of Areva gives us leadership in Russia, which is a country where there will be massive investment in the grid as well as in the oil and gas and mineral industry.</p>
          <p>In industry we develop our integration and solution capability with integration of Cimac, and SCADAgroup Cimac is in the Middle East, SCADAgroup in Australia, but with vast presence in new economies. In IT I spoke about Uniflair which comes with a full line-up for cooling, for perimeter cooling. We also bought just at the beginning of this year another company called APW President in India which is supplying racks, very well adapted to the Indian market.</p>
          <p>And finally we kept developing in the building control part of our business with the acquisition of Zicom, which is the biggest integrator in India for building controls. And two very interesting startups in term of technology in France, a company that we want to help to scale and get outside of their country of origin to sell their technology, a company called Vizelia with an interesting web-based technology for building controls and D5X, which is a company with a technology to characterize the traffic and the efficiency of all the buildings.</p>
          <p>So very intensive in terms of acquisition, I am very happy to welcome those new acquisitions on board. Just to focus on the very big acquisition of 2010, Areva D, we are very happy of having to welcome the people of Areva D on board of Schneider to build the leader in energy distribution in the world. Actually Areva D has exceeded in the first year our expectations, but it's not a full year. We started to consolidate from the 7th of June. 1.8 billion, 1.9 billion to be exact, over 12 months though on the profit, the natural profit on the consolidated period of 6.9% while we had guided you so far at 5%, so doing better than the initial expectation. And this includes &#x20AC;75 million of non-core profit which is trading that we do for our counterpart which is not profit making. So the real profit that we have really in Areva D is higher than what you see here.</p>
          <p>Obviously, it's a very complicated operation. We are working a lot on that, the teams are doing an excellent job. Well, I think it's an ambitious operation and every ambitious operation goes with a lot of hard work. But we've ensured the continuity of operation. We have merged the front office in 53 countries; that means we have an energy front office operating as one already in 53 countries.</p>
          <p>We have continued commercial success of the merger. Products that Areva was not selling in some countries are sold by the Schneider network and reciprocally. We have action plans already rolled out to reach our objective of &#x20AC;120 million by 2014 and this is well identified and defined in terms of execution.</p>
          <p>And the good new at the end of the year is the fact that Areva T&amp;D India mandatory offer has been completed which means that we are co-managing with ALSTHOM the Indian operation, but we have a direct right on the Indian operation.</p>
          <p>So, a very busy year. Lot of growth, lot of efficiency on complementary acquisitions and now I'm going to give the mike to Emmanuel for the financial part.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Pascal, and it's my pleasure now to lead you through some numbers and the key elements of our financial results. I suggest that we start with the review of our sales number. Our sales reached &#x20AC;19.6 billion; it's a growth of 24%, of course helped by the arrival of Areva Distribution within the company. But the organic growth that we reached is extremely strong, 9.3% through the year.</p>
          <p>If I look at the sequence of the quarters, we see that the Q4 has been the sixth quarter in a row of growth of improvement of the performance for Schneider. So coming from the Q2 of 2009 which was the bottom, if you want, we have been regularly and quarter after quarter improving the trend over the last six quarters and that has been also the case in Q4 compared to Q3 we reach 12.1% of organic growth in Q4 compared to 11.9 in Q3. And that is quite an achievement because even if the two numbers are the same or very close, the basis of comparison of Q3 in 2009 was less demanding and Q4 was more demanding. So our capability to maintain the growth rate in Q4 showed that we further accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3.</p>
          <p>The reason for this improvement in trend throughout 2010 is, I would say double, first of all in terms of geographies we've seen the mature country improving their trend through the year when the new economy kept strong during the whole period and in terms of business we have seen beginning of an improvement for the most more late cycle or mid cycle business that we have within our portfolio. And as Jean-Pascal said, we have on the pro forma basis reached the 20 billion mark for the first time for our sales.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the difference between new economies and mature economy of course the performance of new economy has been outstanding through the year. We are above 10% each quarter very similar since Q2 and to Q4 and an average of plus 15% organic growth for new economies. Asia-Pac has been leading the trend, 22% organic growth in 2010 and certainly China has been a big part of this performance. We are even north of this performance for China, but China was not the only fast growing market, we've seen India doing very well, we've seen markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore also doing well. So the growth has been really across countries for us in Asia-Pac in 2010.</p>
          <p>When I look now at the other big geographies for new economies, we see that LatAm and Russia have been performing well, certainly for Russia that was not expected at that level. Both LatAm and Russia were between plus 10% and plus 20% organic growth depending of the businesses.</p>
          <p>And Middle East and Africa were more difficult. Middle East mainly because of Dubai, I would say Dubai we did perform well but Dubai was a very difficult market, notably with the construction going significantly down. And Africa was the only negative performer in 2010 compared to 2009. That is largely due to the fact that this was with China the only growing market in 2009 so the cycle here is a bit different, the phasing is a bit different, so the comps were much more demanding for Africa.</p>
          <p>If I look now at the mature economy, here clearly we see that the profile has been improving along the year starting even negative in Q1 and finishing at a very strong plus 11% the last quarter which give an average of plus 6%.</p>
          <p>Europe, which started the year negative, did rebound. The country such as Germany and Italy performed very well. That is the weight of industry and notably of course in Germany in this country. France did perform well as well. For the three countries I have just mentioned the renewable business has been good in 2010 and has been helping the performance. Other market have been very difficult in H1 that has been the case of Spain obviously, the Nordics or the U.K. and for all this market, we've seen improvement in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at North America, a contrasted picture for North America. Industry and IT has been good for the country. It has been much more difficult in power for North America and for the United States, where so far we haven't seen a rebound whether in residential or non-residential even if we have seen stabilization for this market in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Last Japan and Australia has been good throughout the year and Australia is a very dynamic economy, which is fully benefiting from the strong need for raw materials and its embedded presence within the Asia Pac area.</p>
          <p>Well, if I look at the trend now by businesses and I will mainly focus on the full year result. We see that we have really seen three top performers among our businesses. The first one and the most impressive: industry plus 24% organic growth in total in 2010. Industry had been the most impacted business by the crisis. This is the one which is also rebounding stronger. Industry at the end of 2010 is even above the peak of 2008. So it's not only part of a recovery, it's a full recovery and even a little bit beyond that.</p>
          <p>IT also rebounded well. That had been a very early cycle business reacting to a stop in investment very early in the crisis, but the need for digitalization, the need for adapting to the cloud, that Jean-Pascal was describing has been a powerful boost for our business in 2010 and we reached a 10% organic growth with the very, I would say, homogeneous performance throughout the year.</p>
          <p>CST is a sensor business, which is very linked with business such as industry, the auto industry or the aerospace, had been very negatively impacted in 2009 and rebounded very strongly in 2010 posting 17% organic growth and posting rather we would see a very nice margin improvement as well.</p>
          <p>Our two other businesses, power and building, these started the year in a more difficult fashion but as we were progressing in 2010 they improved their performance. If you look at power, power is even finishing 2010 strongly with an 11% organic growth in Q4 and that is allowing globally a performance of 6% organic growth for power in 2010.</p>
          <p>When I look at building, building is a business with lower support coming from the new economy. We only have a 15% exposure to new economies for the building business. And the business has been recovering on the back of strong need for energy efficiency and solutions for that in the building in the Western economies and despite a construction business which has not yet recovered, as we all know.</p>
          <p>Now, if I may lead you through our profit and loss account and starting with our sales, as we've seen &#x20AC;19.6 billion in total. Excluding the Areva Distribution impact, we would have reached &#x20AC;18.4 billion which is above the peak of 2008. But be careful, we are here above the peak thanks to notably ForEx impact but in term of organic growth comparable we are at still 7%, 8% below the peak of 2008 and as we will see, what is remarkable is to be above the profitability of 2008 with organically volume which are still below the peak of 2088.</p>
          <p>Gross margin going up significantly, 40.5% gross margin, excluding Areva Distribution, global amount of gross margin was &#x20AC;7.7 billion. This improvement of 110 basis points is really the work that we have done on productivity and that I will detail later on.</p>
          <p>We've reached an EBITA number before restructuring and Areva Distribution integration cost of &#x20AC;3,052 million obviously the very important bar of 3 billion that we are crossing here and without Areva Distribution we are slightly above the latest guidance that we had given at the level of the EBITA margin. We had said between 15.5% and 16%, we are at 16.2%. This is an improvement of 3.4% and really the result of three things, dynamism of the top-line, strong productivity, and of course further reduction in SFC.</p>
          <p>Now trying to set the scene for 2011, we on a pro forms basis, and that means including 12 months for Areva Distribution, have been achieving &#x20AC;20.2 billion of sales in 2010. And if I look now at the EBITA numbers and ratio and I am here at the EBITA so I no longer take into account the restructuring cost, we are now coming back to normal cruise speed on restructuring cost and therefore we will no longer identify that as a special element.</p>
          <p>We have been reporting on the pro forma basis a 14.5% EBITA margin in 2010 that is taking into 12 months of consolidation of Areva Distribution, and we are in the middle, right in the middle of the bracket of 13 to 16% EBITA, which is our medium-term objective for our profitability. So we have headroom to still go up in terms of profitability in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Continuing to go down the P&amp;L. We took 25 million of charge on Areva D integration. We probably have an extra 20 to 25 million to incur next year. Restructuring costs were significantly down compared to last year at &#x20AC;96 million and that is giving us an EBITA of &#x20AC;2,931 million. Amortization and impairment of intangible reached &#x20AC;228 million, you will see a normal amount of amortization of our goodwill and intangible. And on top of it, you have 43 million of amortization of intangible linked with the Areva Distribution acquisition. We should have something around 30 million for next year and then until 2015 something like &#x20AC;80 million of further charge of amortization of intangible.</p>
          <p>That is leading to an EBIT number of &#x20AC;2.7 billion. Net financial expense reached &#x20AC;347 million, this is down compared to &#x20AC;384 million. But be careful this is including a charge of &#x20AC;36 million corresponding to the buyback of a bond that we have made in the course of the year, a bond that we had issued at particularly expensive conditions and that we decided to buyback, of course we will have the benefit of that in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Income tax reached &#x20AC;566 million. It's a significant improvement compared to last year of course, because our profit base is much higher. But we are staying with a rate of 24% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Then you have a few equity investment profit with the debts minority interest of &#x20AC;76 million which are mainly linked to JV's that we have in China, and that leads us to a net income group share of 1,720 million, all time high for the group. We are slightly more than doubling the net income compared to last year, and we are doubling the earnings per share.</p>
          <p>When I look at the analysis of change, really focusing on the key elements, you see that of course volume has been very big, but productivity has been almost as big as volume. So that shows the performance that we delivered in term of productivity. You see that the mix and price has been slightly negative, and on price we had guided to something around flat, we had a minus 0.2% of impact. So we are on line with our objective.</p>
          <p>We kept delivering some support function cost savings, &#x20AC;75 million. But at the same time, we have been impacted by inflation, inflation on raw materials, inflation at the level of other production cost, that's &#x20AC;236 million of cost. And inflation at the level of the support function cost, notably in the new economies, that's a charge of 136 million.</p>
          <p>Scope has been of course playing positively, that is mainly the Areva Distribution impact. And currency impact has been also positive at &#x20AC;192 million, and that is leading to this EBITA before restructuring of &#x20AC;3,052 million.</p>
          <p>Now a word about productivity, because of course, that has been one of the big stories of this year 2010 for us. One of the reasons for this strong performance has been our ability to control what we call our manufacturing base cost during this year 2010. If we compare 2010 compared to 2008 you see that we have &#x2013; we were 7% above at the level of the volume and we are only 1% above at the level of the cost. So it has been our capacity to produce much more with the same cost basis, roughly speaking, which is generating strong productivity.</p>
          <p>And when I look at the detail of the &#x20AC;505 million, you see that purchasing has been a big contributor to our productivity, &#x20AC;229 million, that is what we do in term of improving the way we are buying &#x2013; concentrating our suppliers. Lean manufacturing is to produce in a more efficient way, not only with what we call the quality value engineering, so to produce the same kind of product at a lower cost. And the rebalancing close to &#x20AC;100 million which is to produce more in low cost country and basically to get closer to where the biggest growth is to get closer to our end market. The volume impact, the mechanic volume impact, if you want, has been of &#x20AC;135 million.</p>
          <p>The SFC evolution, a nice reduction from 26.4% to 24.1%, the 2% decrease that is of course helped by the Areva Distribution integration, but excluding scope and excluding inflation we did manage to generate an extra &#x20AC;75 million of SFC reduction which means that we are crossing the bar of 600 million SFC saving which was our objective of SFC reduction. We had said at the beginning 1 billion, that including 400 million of adjustment to the crisis. The crisis now, we see is largely behind us for us. So we're happy to realize this objective for slightly more than &#x20AC;600 million.</p>
          <p>Consequences in term of profitability for our businesses. Certainly, two highlights and two very impressive situations: Industry, which has been almost doubling its profitability to get to 19%, that's really the strength or the quality of the rebound for our industry business.</p>
          <p>The sensor business, which has been moving from 6% to 16% margin and becoming again a strong profitable and contributing business, so that was the two best performers.</p>
          <p>Power did manage to increase significantly as well as the profitability and now we are beyond the 20% EBITA margin. When I look at IT, the growth has been more moderate, relatively, some price pressure and some investment on the IT business where we see a lot of potential and we keep investing a lot between &#x2013; behind this business. And building again, which has shown the lower growth and where we've seen certainly the less favorable environment only stabilizing the margin.</p>
          <p>Cash flow generation has been a very good part of the year. At the end of H1, so that we were not in such a favorable position, we had been negatively impacted by the working capital evolution by more than &#x20AC;500 million. You see that in the second half, we've been largely correcting that unfavorable evolution as the drift in working capital is limited to 206 million. That is due, as we will see, to the work that we have done on all items of the working capital. And also a positive impact of non-operating working capital such as tax or financial cost that has been boosting the performance.</p>
          <p>But in total, as we have been maintaining our CapEx slightly below last year, we are generating 1.7 billion of free cash flow. It's a total transformation of our net profit and free cash flow. And we are not that far from the record high of last year when we had benefited of an 800 million positive impact in the cash flow from the working capital. That means that we have been able to manage the growth, which traditionally has a negative impact on cash flow well and to reduce impact of the growth...</p>

          <p>...that they are not well equipped with good products from Schneider. We are back? Thank you very much. Are we back in transmission? I think we are back.</p>
          <p>Any jokes to tell, Jean-Pascal?</p>
          <p>Okay. Welcome back. We apologize for that but we maintain that this was in fact made to show that we still have a lot of potential and a lot of markets which are open to us to not only to secure power even in the mature countries such as France.</p>
          <p>I was commenting the slide on evolution of the working capital and the fact that we have reached a low point in trade working capital at 20.3% of sales at the end of 2010. We've been doing a very good job in managing the receivables. They are down three days compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Inventories, we are not that far away from the number last year when at the end of the first half we had a significant deterioration of the number of inventories and the more difficult part has been on the payables, but globally, we did manage good performance at the level of working capital management.</p>
          <p>Very rapidly in term of cash conversion, I've already said full conversion of our net profit into cash, which is, as you know, a long-term objective that we have and we finished the year with an EBITDA of &#x20AC;3.5 billion and that mean that we have a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.8 times, which is a low point compared to the last three, four years.</p>
          <p>We will propose a dividend of &#x20AC;3.20 at our shareholder meeting and we are here exactly fulfilling the rule of paying 50% of our net profit through dividend.</p>
          <p>And I now hand over to Jean-Pascal for the outlook.</p>

          <p>Briefly before we go to questions and answers, the environment that we see in front of us for the top line is we're going to keep improving power in power business. Energy also is to return to growth. Industry and IT are still on the growth, but they will be facing tougher comparisons and we see really energy efficiency, as supporting our building business.</p>
          <p>On the side of profitability, as we said we're targeting an industrial productivity of &#x20AC;400 million in 2011. We're going to invest, as we said, for growth opportunities, not where we extracted the cost but in very different places.</p>
          <p>We're going to be facing raw material inflation we estimate today at &#x20AC;250 million. We will offset a large part of that with a price increase of roughly 1%. Compounding all of this, we give a guidance of a strong organic growth in a bracket of 6 to 9% organic. And we are targeting an improvement of EBITA margin at a level situated already between 15% to 15.5%.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. Our apologies for the interruption and now we are ready to take possible questions and answers, to questions that we'll have to answer.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'd now start the Q&amp;A section. We'll give the priorities to people in the room here and then we'll take questions also from those who are connected by phone. So the first question. Peter Week microphone there please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all of you, thanks for taking the questions <mark type="inaudible" /> three points please. First of all, could you share with us your scenario in China for 2011? Is the demand coming from tier 1 or tier 2, tier 3 cities? More generally, do you believe that in emergings the dynamic is sustainable, or are you expecting a further deceleration offset by an acceleration in mature country? That was the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the M&amp;A. You have an healthy balance sheet with net debt to EBITDA of 0.8 times. Could you remind us your M&amp;A strategy in terms of activities and in terms of size when all peers are known that they want to do a large ticket acquisition?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on the raw material, could you remind us your direct exposure in percentage of sales and the exposure that you have through the confident? And could you also share with us if you are facing some supply strain issues in some specific area? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I am not sure I got your first question with China I mean the strength of the growth in China in 2011 that's what you are &#x2013; well I &#x2013; in broad lines probably we had a very strong year in China in 2010 but it was also due to basis of comparison which was low at the beginning of 2009. I remain personally quite optimist about China. There will be some cooling down probably in the major cities in some segments and the real estate we know it. But at the same time our capular presence in secondary cities in the west enables us to capture complementary growth opportunities. So it won't be probably at the level of what we've known in 2010, but we are still continuing very positive dynamics on China.</p>
          <p>And to complement you spoke about the mature countries, as I said, all the geographies now and all the business are back to growth more or less high. And we are really counting not on the markets to generate or support our growth in mature countries but new business, okay, which we have been developing in services. It's about solutions on the top of products where we used to sell only products. It's about new lineups and I spoke about a few lineups that we are launching this year and there is more to come. So it's really on the market which is not totally dynamic but coming from a very low point. So first there is a rebound effect and second, there are all the new initiatives that we are launching.</p>
          <p>M&amp;A, you want to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In M&amp;A we have a strategy which is very consistent and we are not going to change it. We &#x2013; certainly a visibility on the fact that we will continue to make a number of small to medium size acquisitions; it is a few tens to a few hundred million. That's what we have been doing in the past and that's what we will continue to do and you have seen some of them in 2010 and we will be looking at a number of projects certainly through 2011. And we know that there is a certain percentage of what we are looking at which ends up in being a done deal.</p>
          <p>In term of area where we we're going to invest: new economies, of course, not going to be a surprise to you. We want to keep increasing our impact in this new economy where we think that we can still increase our market share, gain presence, globally in fact, improve our impact in the market. There is certainly some of this big market where we are today not totally with critical size that we would like to have and I can certainly put India as one of these markets. So, new economies is our first area.</p>
          <p>Second area is everything which is linked with solutions, expertise, integration, software capability, capability to do services that is certainly area where we will look at targets and where we will envisage to make acquisitions.</p>
          <p>And third potential area for acquisition which is really across our businesses, possibility to increase our market share to do synergetic transaction that will be improving our presence whether with new geographical market share or with new capacity or new technology that we don't own today and that is something that we could envisage in our businesses.</p>
          <p>Now to the question of the biggest transaction, which is certainly part of what you are asking for. On that one, we always say that it is something that you cannot predict. What we can predict, as I said is small, medium size transaction. Transactions such as APC, such as Areva, something happen at certain stage, you have planets aligning and then you have to react, you have to do something. But it is not something that we can plan as we can plan the small and medium size acquisitions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have always our criteria for ROCI above the WACC in three years which we're measuring every opportunity against.</p>
          <p>On the last point, which is RMI, the total exposure that we have, whether it be direct purchase or prefabricated components, is 250 million. And this is inclusive for 2011 to compare to a bit more than 180 in 2010. So that's our exposure.</p>
          <p>And concerning the supply chain, we still have some issues in part which are fast growing, but it's resolving quite fast. I say we are going to be better, but clearly it has impacted some of our results in IT for instance at the end of the year where we are not able to deliver immediately or at the end of the year all of our backlog. So there are still some issues in process of resolution, but the situation is really improving.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Axel Funhoff from ING. Two questions, please. But one after one, please. The first is more of a technical question. You have shown that Power and Buildings in the fourth quarter has rebounded, has basically outgrown the full year growth on an organic basis. Can you comment on those end markets? Where do you specific &#x2013; where do you specifically see strength, where still weakness? Would you say that those markets are out of the woods?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the specific one, these are two different business, but a large part of power is also going into building first. A large part of that business for power is going into new economies, so there has been no change of trend. It has been a very solid, honorable strength.</p>
          <p>On the other side, in the more mature economies, it's been also an effect of basis of comparison certainly, on certain more &#x2013; better activity in the markets before and the launch of new lineups of product. When we complement our range of circuit breakers and wiring accessories, for instance, and we do that in many geographies that is generating growth on the whole package we are selling to a contractor.</p>
          <p>On the Building, the main engine, well, our building business has been suffering &#x2013; it's our business which is not scaled yet, which is not different. When you look at the other business of Schneider, we are covering all geographies. Building is still very located, mostly in mature countries and it has reached a further strong exposure to the U.S. in 2010.</p>
          <p>When I look at what is supported the beginning of the rebound at the end of January, it's really energy efficiency. So it's investment in energy efficiency, the capacity to build a total ecostructure around the building control on same services, admin services like performance contracting which has supported Areva. So in this case it's growth we have generated by ourselves.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we start with putting seeds of development of this activity into the new economies, and it starts to pay. You see that we -- you saw that we acquired Zicom in India as an integrator for building and that's creating the foundation for the development of this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That was helpful. Second question please, more from a financial strategic perspective. Your cash flow generation across the cycle is decent. Your cash flow generation last year has been very good although we are just in the first year of real recovery and so on. What are your thoughts about potentially adjusting your dividend policy such that you would openly communicate for example a minimum dividend that you always intend to at least pay and then you could potentially in very good years provide a higher dividend? Thereby you could kind of prevent the cyclical downside that you face during harsh market environment and thereby maybe sustain your share price a little bit better in tough times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's probably a discussion that we need a bit more private debate than with hundreds of people probably on the web &#x2013; but we and &#x2013; in the distribution of our cash we've &#x2013; since many years, we like consistency, right? And we are distributing already. We have committed to our shareholders to distribute 50% of the net. We had in the past two years proposed they will get it under the form of shares. We have decided this year to be back to dividend payment.</p>
          <p>Then I remind you that our business model is also about the consolidation of our industry. There is a real know-how and a real success at Schneider in bringing together companies from different origins, people from different cultures together to build an integrated solution and it's very value creative. So we have to keep a part of our cash for that. And I have to say that I will let Emmanuel complement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the question is certainly interesting. We've been very happy with being consistent as well for our shareholders as they know what to expect. We are not saying that our policy will remain for always but it is fair to say that for the time being we are happy with it. And we think that it is again giving our shareholder nice visibility as they know exactly what they have to expect in terms of dividend. So I am not saying that this kind of idea will never be implemented but I think that for the time being we are happy to stick with our policy.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Ms. Christel Monot from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good morning gentlemen. It's Christel here from UBS. Two questions please. The first one is on your pricing policy for 2011. You're saying you are going for about 1% increase for 2011. Can you be a bit more specific in terms of the end markets or by division and also in terms of geographies? It might be easier to put higher prices in some businesses and you might see some price pressure in other businesses. And is that the plan for January and so what are the plans I guess for July?</p>
          <p>And second question is on your margin in power. It was still strong. It was very strong in 2010 despite the fact that there is no recovery, so to speak, in construction today. So what do we expect for 2011? If we do see a recovery in construction, surely you should have more potential there?</p>
          <p>And finally on Areva D the margin is stronger than what you were expecting. So how are your thoughts for 2011, are you scared about price pressure or do you think you can continue to beat your plans? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the price increase, it's pretty much across the board. What I'm going to tell you is pretty much across the board, it's more related to the business model. So on everything which is &#x2013; we have business model which is more than 50% structured through integrators, through channel, distributors whether it be electrical distributors or whether it be IT distributors.</p>
          <p>And here we are compensating the raw material increase with price increases and some of them have already been started in geographies. It's not about January and July, that would be too simple. Some of the countries where we operate, take a small one like China, are not going exactly with a Western calendar cycle. There is something called Chinese New Year, which is not coming exactly at the same moment, so each cycle in time at different times. But we have a plan really to increase our price and to transmit what is happening to us in the upstream to the downstream market.</p>
          <p>By the way, this is something we've done in the years 2003 to 2009 actually, with a lot of success and it's not a wishful thinking. It's something we've delivered consistently and actually at that time we have overcompensated the raw material increase by the prices.</p>
          <p>On the part of business which is services and solutions, again, we are reminding that we are not particularly at Schneider dealing large projects, very visible projects, which we call service, a solution is something of a small and mid-size. And here it's really the price that we make for every of these value proposals to the customer is articulating function of the cost. So we can really adjust our margin on our decision to go with the project according to the cost we see. So it's not day-to-day price, it's a project-by-project or solution-by-solution or service-to-service solution. And there we make sure that we are at the level of the targeted margin we have to go.</p>
          <p>So our product business, we have proven many times in the past that we know how to handle pricing. On the solution and service business where we adjust according to the costs we have on each project and this is very clearly measured.</p>
          <p>The places where we could expect more pressure on the cost would be the big bids, typically for utilities, that's one, but it's a market to which we are relatively not too exposed for, something close to 10% of our turnover. And one of the strengths of our energy division that would be the one likely to receive this pressure and that comes back to your question of revenue and it's a very good question.</p>
          <p>One of the strengths of our energy division is that they benefit from a channel of access to the diffuse market which is unmatched by our competitors. On there when we go on smaller projects and basically to low voltage, medium voltage synergy which is playing there, we are packaging a low voltage, medium voltage offer and therefore we are not in the same logic of price pressure.</p>
          <p>So we think because we've been through that and because we know how to operate that, that we should be in a good position to realize the 1% price increase that we are prospecting and we have already started because the price through RMI pressure is really with us in the second half. We took 140 million of raw material pressure on the second part of the year and you see that our margin still expanded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just really on power to complement, it is clear that if we increase the volume and potentially through some rebound on the construction market, that will have a positive impact on gross margin, because better productivity, certainly, but at the same time we will be facing some headwind in raw materials as we have seen. So, yes, we will have some tailwind with growing markets favorable for power but we know that in front of that we will have a number of adverse elements and we'll see what is the net of these various plus and minus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there will be a bit of mix in 2011. We see as we were showing the graphs that the solutions are going up and this is true particularly in the power so though it is a very good margin it's not the same capital employed so it's still very profitable. There will be probably more solutions in power, therefore, some elements of compression and global margin. It's all good news, it's good growth and it's a good ROCI.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. It's Matt Williams at HSBC. Two questions if I may, firstly you mentioned the growth in energy efficiency products and I just wanted to get a sense for how much of this you feel is structural going on and how much of it is more directly correlated to the recent rise in energy costs, and if you can perhaps characterize the different buyer behaviors in that sphere?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the salary inflation within the support function costs, how should we be thinking about that for 2011 going forward whether &#x2013; I'm trying to get a sense of whether the salary inflation is a function of multiyear agreements or otherwise, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. We didn't hear you very clearly. Can you repeat your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize. I am a very long way away. I'll give it a go. The first question was relating to the growth in energy efficiency products and in particular how you feel whether this is a structural trend or whether this was accelerated particularly by the increase, the recent increase in energy costs?</p>
          <p>And the second question related to the salary inflation within support function cost and whether you &#x2013; or how we should think about that going forward into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on energy efficiency I think everything is going to the right direction to accelerate the movement. Two things, the cost of energy and the cost of oil, which we had always prospected here to increase is really very high and when I see the logic of demand and supply, I would expect it to remain at a pretty high level. And this means that the payback, on the economic payback rather than speaking just about carbon emission or the green course, so the payback is becoming shorter and shorter. And this is very true in many countries. Actually we live in France in a country where energy is absolutely cheap, but in many countries the price of energy is becoming high and this is very good for the paybacks.</p>
          <p>The second point is that the pressure for savings is increasing. We were last week participating at Schneider in a day where the big industries were meeting, the European Commission and politicians from various countries. And the fact is that when you look at the three times 20 plan of the European Commission, Europe is a good track to meet its objective of renewable, actually to overshoot the target in renewable.</p>
          <p>In energy efficiency, Europe is nowhere. If we keep going like this, we're going to not reach 20%, but 9% of energy efficiency, so totally disconnected to the objective. And there is a big awareness of that in the European Commission with the governments and they are really asking us &#x2013; or a few governments and many of us to really propose very, very concrete steps to increase the energy efficiency of the subcontinent.</p>
          <p>Clearly in Asia, this is pulled by Japan and China. China for reasons of energy dependency, forecast price anyway on dependency, strategic dependency, is really working hard on the subject of energy efficiency. And I don't count the number of opportunities where we've been summoned by the authorities or convocated into meetings to work practically on cases for energy efficiency. So price of energy and structural awareness of the country are driving this trend for energy efficiency to a new level today.</p>
          <p>Frankly, I started my year in the Middle East, in Abu Dhabi and there was a big conference about energy efficiency, this is not the first geography where you would expect that kind of initiative, but everywhere you see a lot of very precise initiatives to work on the subject of efficiency. Clearly, the world is led today on energy efficiency and we are here to propose solutions to capture.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Inflation, we have assumed the global inflation of 3% in 2010 and we believe that probably 2011 will be slightly above. So we think that probably a bracket between 3 and 3.5% of inflation on our SFC is a reasonable assumption today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question from Mr. Simon Smith from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I had two questions. The first one was really just trying to get to bridge the gap between where we &#x2013; the run rate of your margins in the second half of the year and the guidance that we're going for in 2011. I think in 2010 you've shown an excellent performance in terms of drop through margins from incremental volume you've seen coming through. Obviously, the level of underutilization is lower going into 2011, but I think still from your opening comments, you highlight the fact that the existing business is still 7, 8% from where it peaked.</p>
          <p>Looking at the relatively flat progression you have for margins on the second half into next year what really sort of imply a major collapse down in those incremental margins given all the points you've made of a special impact. I just wondered why you were looking for that and if you could give me some understanding as to how the dynamics are changing?</p>
          <p>Second question really relates to the relative growth rates within your business. Previously you've shown a very sort of clear chart where the emerging markets have had a very obvious 10% spread over your mature markets. Obviously Q4 we've seen a bit of a convergence of those two growth rates, I just wonder if you could highlight how you think that will progress through 2011 and beyond?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So on the gap and I'll leave you with of course your analysis and I am not going to enter into detailing all the numbers. I think that as always we are giving here a guidance, which correspond to the various scenario we are playing with today and we think therefore that it's a reasonable one. We have taken some possible assumption on the raw material impact and the price impact that we have shared with you. We believe that we will have also a mix impact which is likely to be negative for the reason Jean-Pascal was describing, i.e., more solution and we know that it's not playing favorably normally at the level of the gross margin.</p>
          <p>We are taking some assumption on inflation and I shared some of that with you and there is also some investments that we intend to make in order to grow in promising businesses or country and that is all together that we are getting to this guidance. And I must say that by doing that we have the feeling that we share already a lot of the details that we put in our model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of growth rates between new economies and mature economies, difficult to put a fix figure but what we've seen over the years that there has been a differential which would be consistent here on 10% over the cycle taking out the rebound effects, everything between the two kinds of economy. Now, there can be some blips, they can be some events, they can be some crises somewhere. Will it be in the mature world or the new economies which are modifying the threshold? But if you take an average over a certain number of years, there is a differential of growth which is roughly of that magnitude. While the big thing is that today new economies are making 37% of our turnover. So it is the largest geography of Schneider therefore it is a major growth engine.</p>
          <p>And again not with an opportunistic presence, what we are doing is working every day on the diffuse market with adapted offer, so being deeply rooted in all of those and new economies. And the second thing is we are very, very balanced across those new economies. It is not an India play, it is not a Russia play, it is not a Brazil play, it is not a China play. It is all of those plays together which is very important for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions, please. The first one on your IT critical power business, you mentioned some component shortages, some price pressure. We've had similar comments, maybe more cautious comments from Emerson which had relatively weak results. And your results still looked quite strong in the second half but maybe you could tell us a little bit more about the specific issues there in that business in terms of pricing versus cost?</p>
          <p>The second question is just to clarify on restructuring of Areva integration cost going forward. Obviously it will no longer be broken out in the same way but maybe you could give us a range of percentage of sales or basis points of sales we should expect over the next one or two years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the IT business first thing to remark is the very strong growth of this business respect to the industry. I think we've clearly gained market share. So we've generated some of the issues and the shortages because we've grown really fast. Okay?</p>
          <p>And the second thing is a very high level of margin respect to some of our peers in this sector. We have reached the margin that we had told you we would reach when we did the APC acquisition and this even in times of crisis. So we've delivered the promise. But it's clear we have a very strong, very innovative and very performing platform. When you look at the old system and I'm speaking about the white space that means the thing which is very close to the computer room, the place where we had historical weakness was perimeter cooling. And this is a gap that we filled in 2010 with the acquisition of Uniflair and the launch of EcoBreeze at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>So we're coming really with the full-fledged solutions and we're going to keep growing. Cleary, what we had &#x2013; we are the price leader on the IT business and there are a certain number of countries where we had created too much of an umbrella. So in 2010 because we have a margin which is really standing out with respect to the peers, we have decided to be selectively more aggressive, which we've done. But it's been nothing very severe, what we wanted is to keep the level of margin what we had declared we want to have in that business and this has been the drive energy.</p>
          <p>Now, we are still having a good momentum, still having a good growth. So there are still some places in power components where we have some shortages, but these issues are gradually resolving. But again, the main reason for that is that we have delivered the superior growth in this industry all over 2010 and especially, by the way, or as much in H1 and in H2. So it was not only a story of rebound, it was also a story of structural growth in this business.</p>
          <p>Areva?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the restructuring cost for Areva and the impact on the P&amp;L, we expect something like &#x20AC;25 million still of integration cost of Areva. Very much in line with what we said. And we also expect in terms of impact at the level of amortization of intangibles of 30 million for 2011 and then 18 million from 2012 to 2015, that will be impact of intangible that we have to amortize in the Areva Distribution acquisition.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got two questions please. In terms of SG&amp;A in the guidance there where growth will be below organic growth as input cost pressure. Can you just give some more detail how much of that really expansion in terms of head count versus kind of salary inflation? And also linked to that, where do you see the focus of productivity in your central costs, the 400 million guided to.</p>
          <p>And the second question on Russia. You seem pretty bullish on the outlook there. Can you give us a sense for why that is in terms of where the demand and where you see the demand coming from? And also what your objectives are with the TM Samara acquisition? How do you see kind of ownership in that evolving over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of support function costs, it's not head count or inflation, it's both. And sometimes it's productivity which means reduction and sometimes it's increase. I mean we've &#x2013; I think we've been very clear and very precise on the places where we are investing, where we are really investing. What we've done in the past two years is to create a new way of operating in Schneider.</p>
          <p>So we used to be very much structured entity by entity with a lot of duplications of functions and of expertise. What we've put into place in a very systematic way, and a very replicable way are shared services which are either regional or local or global. And this gives us a new capability to scale really to go out and to invest only in the places which make sense. So it can be R&amp;D because we want to beef-up R&amp;D. It can be solutions and services or it can be new economies where we want to invest, cover more geography, tackle more and more of this segment and this is what we are doing.</p>
          <p>But the global investment we are going to do is an investment in resources and it will be some time there will be inflation like for any other company. Recognition also for good year in 2010 that will translate some incentive plans but they have been taken into account already. But there will be both into the equation, right.</p>
          <p>Concerning Russia, we are &#x2013; we've been for long time in Russia and we've been successful in Russia it's been a good ride for us. It's been a good experience. Obviously Russia has its roller coasters I mean it was 99, 98, 99 with the big crisis and we were one of the companies that we &#x2013; like we always do at Schneider, we stick with our customers, we stick with our people. And we suffered with them during the crisis but there is a lot of recognition afterwards when the country is rebounding.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at the structures we are clearly at the beginning of a cycle of rebound in Russia after a very strong crisis in 2009. And guess what we did in 2009? First we stick, which is our <mark type="inaudible" /> And the second thing, we used the bottom of the cycle to acquire 50% of the leader in the energy field. And just for us in one of the most promising segment of Russia which are systems for the grid because the grid needs a lot of retrofit to support the development of the country. The oil and gas and the minerals and this not with usual products, these are products which are studied, designed for Siberia. 80% of what we have acquired in this business is east of the Urals where you don't have much or you have less competition, which is adapted to meet the very severe conditions.</p>
          <p>So always the same thing in Russia, remain flexible, be very stubborn with our strategy of development, of growing with our customers on really a Russia for Russia strategy, developing offers, lineups and presence which is specifically designed for the characteristics of Russia. So that's our strategy.</p>
          <p>With that, when I look at the countries and state of the infrastructure underneath the resources in the world we think there is a potential to serve and to serve urgently. This is the reason why we invested in the country.</p>
