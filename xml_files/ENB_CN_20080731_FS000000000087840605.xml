      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thanks, Vern. Good morning, everyone and thank you to joining us today. We've got a lot of very good news to talk about this morning so I'm going to try to move through this as rapidly as I can. As we reported earlier today our adjusted operating earnings for the second quarter were approximately $150 million or $0.42 per common share and year-to-date results were 388 million or $1.08 per common share. This represents a year-over-year adjusted earnings increase of 8%. So very good year-over-year results. These results and our projections for the balance of '08 have enabled us now to increase our full-year guidance by $0.05, where we now expect 2008 full-year earnings to be in the range of $1.85 to a $1.95 per common share. Richard, of course, will take you through the quarter in more detail as well as speaking to this guidance range in a little more detail later on.</p>
          <p>All of our business segments had very solid results for the quarter. We're extremely pleased to report that both of our sponsored investment vehicles, Enbridge Energy Partners and Enbridge Income Fund, reported record adjusted earnings for the quarter and as a result of this they were both able to increase their common distributions.</p>
          <p>With the latest distribution increase in EEP, we now hit the high splits under the partnership agreement where Enbridge as the general partner will now receive 50% of any incremental cash flows distributed by EEP. This is significant as we expect the partnership's cash flow to grow significantly over the next two years as we complete Phase II of Southern Access and Alberta Clipper, of course.</p>
          <p>I should note that both of our sponsored investment vehicles are expanding to take advantage of the Bakken Play and Saskatchewan, Montana and North Dakota, where once again this company is very well positioned. Enbridge Income Fund has been expanding its Saskatchewan system by adding 65,000 barrels a day on the Westspur system and EEP has spent $225 million over the last year to expand the North Dakota System by 80,000 barrels a day to take incremental crude deliveries shipped from the Bakken.</p>
          <p>Before we get to Richard, let me update you on the progress we have during the quarter on our slate of expansion projects. And once again I'll try to move through this very quickly because there's a lot to update you on.</p>
          <p>First of all, in our Liquids business, we're pleased to report that we're able to complete construction of two of our expansion projects. Both of these projects were completed on time and started to contribute to earnings in the second quarter. The Waupisoo pipeline was actually completed one month ahead of schedule on July, or on June 1. Given the construction delays that we've seen in our industry, we're very proud of this achievement in bringing a major project like this on stream a month early.</p>
          <p>Waupisoo has got an initial capacity of 350,000 barrels a day and will move crude from our Cheecham terminal, south of Fort McMurray, all the way down to Edmonton. Waupisoo can be expanded to an ultimate capacity of 600,000 barrels a day at a very low incremental cost now that the main line is in place. The completion of Waupisoo makes Enbridge the largest operator of regional crude oil pipeline serving the oil sands. Together, Athabasca and Waupisoo enable us now to provide shippers with the flexibility to move their crude to either of the two major Alberta hubs, either in Edmonton or Hardisty. But even more importantly we have the ability to provide interim service on these systems to oil sands start-ups as we construct dedicated systems for them and that provides us with a very significant competitive advantage as we develop further regional pipeline opportunities.</p>
          <p>Moving on, the first phase of our Southern Access expansion also came into service at the beginning of the second quarter. Phase I provides additional capacity of 190,000 barrels a day to our mainline system at a capital cost of roughly $1.3 billion. You'll recall that we started construction on Phase II of the Southern Access expansion in June and upon completion this will add another 210,000 barrels a day at capacity to the Enbridge mainline system. This phase will be complete in the second quarter of 2009 and it consists of additional mainline pumping capacity and also 133 miles of new 42-inch pipe from Delavan, Wisconsin, down to Flanagan, Illinois, just south of Chicago. Construction of our Southern Lights diluent return pipeline continues to proceed as planned. Construction activities are complete on the pipeline between Superior and Delavan and construction on the remaining US line segments began in June. This project is still expected to be in service in late 2010.</p>
          <p>Construction on Alberta Clipper and Line 4 has begun in quarter three as we received National Energy Board approval for both of those projects in the first quarter of this year. Also, regulatory applications were filed with the ERCB for the Fort Hills pipeline system during the second quarter. The project includes a 42-inch diameter crude oil pipeline and a 24-inch diluent return line. Scope and cost estimates will be further refined with the Fort Hills partners and the mid-2011 in-service date remains on target on Fort Hills.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our natural gas systems, they also continue to perform really well. Volumes at Enbridge Energy Partners have grown by more than 10% since this time last year as EEP continues to be one of the largest gathering and processing service providers in the Barnett Shale, in the Bossier and in the Anadarko regions in Texas. We continue to process over a third of the total volumes in each of these highly prolific natural gas reservoirs. Once again, positioning has been outstanding for us.</p>
          <p>Despite a weakening economic environment in Ontario, Enbridge Gas Distribution also continues to exceed our expectations. We've already added over 18,000 new customers in 2008 and we're on target to add 40,000 new customers again this year. And we're also starting now to see the financial benefits of incentive regulation where we have indicated that we hope to be able to boost our returns by 5,200 basis points on those assets.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we also made some strong progress on the number of development projects within the gas and renewable side of the business. For example, Alliance, in conjunction with our partner Questar, continues to work on the Rockies Alliance pipeline that would link fast-growing gas production in the Rockies area in the US to the Chicago pipeline hub. Earlier this year an open season held showed that there is considerable interest for the pipeline and we continue now to work with shippers to finalize the necessary shipping commitments and also the best routing for that line.</p>
          <p>During quarter two the Rabaska Partners singed a letter of intent with Gazprom US regarding supply to the proposed Rabaska LNG Terminal. Gazprom, of course, will become an equity partner in the project and will contract for 100% of the terminal's capacity. Partnership agreements are expected to be completed by the end of the year and Rabaska already has in place all of the authorizations required for the project from both the federal and provincial governments. I should caution on this project that while the LOI with Gazprom is very promising, Gazprom's ultimate participation will be dependent on the development of its Shtokman field, which is expected to be completed in 2014.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the wind business, construction of our 190 megawatt Ontario Wind Project in Kincardine is progressing well. Over two-thirds of the towers have now been installed and we expect to start producing electricity by the end of August, to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of this year. The Alberta Saline Aquifer Project, dubbed ASAP and that Enbridge is spearheading, added four more participants in the quarter and we now have a total of 33 industry participants. The ASAP Co2 sequestration project remains on schedule to have construction start in 2009. This is on the pilot and we've begun site evaluation and engineering work on that pilot project during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We're also very encouraged by the Alberta government's commitment to $2 billion to support the development of carbon sequestration projects within the province. Lastly, what I'd like to do is spend a few minutes on our current slate of developments projects, because so far I've been speaking only of those projects underway and under construction and this is primarily our Wave 2 of projects.</p>
          <p>These development projects are designed to provide our customers with access to multiple markets and provide Western Canadian producers with better optionality for their barrels. These projects will allow Western Canadian crude access to the eastern part of PADD II, this primarily refineries in Lima and Toledo, Ohio, also to the refineries in Montreal to the US East Coast refineries, primarily Philadelphia, and to the US Gulf Coast and ultimately the West Coast and the Far East.</p>
          <p>Our recently announced Trailbreaker Project will provide Western Canadian producers with access to multiple new markets. Shippers will be able to send their production to refineries in Montreal and will have access to the US Gulf Coast and the US East Coast by the Portland pipeline. The project involves expanding a portion of our mainline system within the partnership, reversing our Line 9 that currently provides service from Montreal to Sarnia. I should say re-reversing, because you may recall it was originally built to operate in the Western from Sarnia to Montreal. And then the reversal of one of the two pipelines on the Portland pipeline system. Trailbreaker has a modest capital cost of roughly $350 million and has a mid-2010 target in-service date.</p>
          <p>Once complete it will move about 220,000 barrels a day from Sarnia to Montreal, where 80,000 can be delivered to refineries in Montreal and the remaining 140,000 barrels a day then shipped to the US Gulf Coast and East Coast. We expect that the total cost of the US Gulf Coast -- to the US Gulf Coast using Trailbreaker will be around 8 to $9 dollars, inclusive of the shipping costs. Trailbreaker, of course, is part of our phased approach in getting crude to the US Gulf Coast at a low-cost way. And in the near-term, a Trailbreaker and an expansion of the Exxon Mobil Pegasus pipeline will provide ample short-term access for Canadian producers to the U.S. Gulf Coast market. And then as Western Canadian heavy crude production ramps up, our Texas Access pipeline will provide the most economic alternative to ship larger volumes to the U.S. Gulf Coast and that would be post-2011.</p>
          <p>We believe that at a capital cost of 2.6 billion, Texas Access continues to provide the strongest fundamentally competitive alternative as our existing pipeline network is already two-thirds of the way there. However, we will manage the pace of development on this project to achieve a level of throughput commitment, which ensures an adequate return on the investor's capital.</p>
          <p>My final update is on Gateway. Support for the project has never been higher. Canadian producers have recognized the value of having access to offshore export markets, primarily in the Far East. Once complete, Canadian producers will have an ongoing bid for their crude, which will improve netbacks for our customers. Belief in the project is so strong that we have obtained $100 million of funding from a group of Western Canadian producers and East Asian refiners to get the projects to regulatory approval.</p>
          <p>In exchange for the funding, the sponsors will have an option to have founder-shipper status and to make an equity investment in Gateway. The support from Asia for Gateway is broad-based and now includes refinery support from Singapore to Japan and we still expect to file the regulatory application in early 2009 on this project.</p>
          <p>So now for a little more detailed review on the Q2 results, let me turn the call over to Richard Bird.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with a review of the second quarter results, provide a little more detail on our updated guidance for 2008 and then also update you on our financing plan. So as Pat mentioned, we released our second quarter results earlier this morning and reported net income was $658 million or $1.83 per common share, up $147 million from the amount reported in 2007 and the significant quarter-over-quarter increase in reported earnings is obviously due to the gain on the sale of our investment in the Spanish refined products pipeline, CLH. This sale brought in over 1.38 billion in cash and generated a $556 million gain on the sale.</p>
          <p>Other significant items in the quarter that we adjusted out of the reported earnings include additional costs related to repairs from the 2005 hurricanes within our offshore assets and we are seeking insurance recovery of these expenses and expect to receive this in the latter half of 2008. Also adjusted for non-cash mark-to-market losses associated with the financial instruments that we use to hedge our earnings within the energy services in the Aux Sable business segments.  And lastly the warmer than normal weather in EGD's franchise area, which decreased EGD's earnings by about 4 million in the second quarter. When we exclude all of these non-operating factors, adjusted earnings for the second quarter, as Pat mentioned, were 150 million or $0.42 per common share.</p>
          <p>So just in terms of where some of this strength is coming from, in the second quarter we experienced strong performance from our liquids pipelines business unit. Earnings rose by 10 million when compared to the prior year. Our expansion projects were the primary driver for the increase. We recorded ADDC on a number of these new pipelines, Southern Lights, Southern Access and Alberta Clipper. We also, on the Athabasca System, picked up earnings for one month from the new Waupisoo pipeline, which was placed into service on June 1.</p>
          <p>Gas pipelines earnings are slightly lower than the prior year as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar as well as the depreciated rate base within the Alliance Pipeline. The significant appreciation of the Canadian dollar since the latter half of 2007 has caused the earnings generated by these U.S. operations to be lower than what they were in 2007. That's across the board for all of our U.S. operations and of course our gas pipeline earnings are all U.S. dollar-denominated.</p>
          <p>Just to give you a sense of the magnitude, overall Enbridge earnings on a year-to-date basis were lower due to the stronger Canadian dollar by approximately $12 million year-over-year or $0.03 a share compared to the first half of 2007. And as we have noted on previous calls we do hedge our economic exposure to foreign currencies and we have in fact in 2008 received after-tax hedge payments of $9 million. Unfortunately the settlements on these hedges, although they're cash in the bank, are not included in earnings reported under GAAP.</p>
          <p>The Sponsored Investment segment of our business, as Pat mentioned, had a record quarter. EEP reported adjusted results, record adjusted results in the second quarter and continues to be a very good story. EEP's earnings contribution was $3 million higher than the second quarter of 2007 and on a year-to-date basis almost $7 million higher.</p>
          <p>That increase reflects higher incentive income and outstanding performance within EEP, which was underpinned by strong throughput volumes on the liquids pipeline systems as well as higher throughput on the gas gathering and processing assets and stronger fractionation margins. The Enbridge Income Fund results are also positive in the quarter due to favorable fundamentals within the Saskatchewan system and of course flowing through to Enbridge with a 7.5% distribution increase, which was announced at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And Gas Distribution and Services also had an excellent quarter with adjusted earnings up almost 10 million over the prior-year quarter. That increase was largely due to the impact of very strong fractionation margins at Aux Sable, which allowed us to recognize a larger portion of the contingent upside sharing mechanism that we have in our agreement with BP relative to what we were able to recognize in the second quarter last year.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that the full-year earnings contribution from Aux Sable will be around $25 million. The GAAP loss that was reported in the quarter and the gain that was reported on the year-to-date basis are associated with the financial derivatives used to eliminate commodity price risk associated with this asset. We have entered into financial derivative transactions to lock in our 2008 Aux Sable earnings but these hedges don't qualify for hedge accounting and as such the quarterly changes in the fair market value of the hedges are booked to earnings.</p>
          <p>EGD's earnings in the quarter were also higher than the prior year by 3 million and that increase can be attributed to stronger customer growth, lower operating costs and lower taxes. As Pat mentioned, we're already starting to see the initial benefits of the new incentive regulation framework and those sources of earnings improvement that I just mentioned actually made a significantly stronger contribution than 3 million in the aggregate but that contribution was offset in part by a change in EGD's toll structure, where a larger portion of the annual distribution costs will come in the form of a fixed rather than a variable charge.</p>
          <p>So this change in the rate structure will increase earnings in the summer months and lower earnings in the winter months and the unfavorable year-to-date impact of this change will reverse out over the balance of the year, leaving us with just that strong fundamental performance evident in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Energy Services' full-year results are well above the prior year due to improved market fundamentals, which enabled higher margins to be captured on storage and transportation contracts. During the second quarter there was a significant non-cash mark-to-market loss related to this business. This mark-to-market loss reflects fair value charges on derivative transactions used to lock in the profitability of transportation and storage transaction at Tidal Energy.</p>
          <p>Under GAAP, these financial derivatives are revalued each quarter and any change is recorded in earnings. However the offsetting change in the underlying physical crude inventory is not revalued, so you see one side of the transaction but not the other. And as such you will see non-cash mark-to-market losses in the segment in periods of rising oil prices. The overall profitability of that transaction will not appear until the underlying crude oil is sold for inventory.</p>
          <p>So that second quarter mark-to-market loss will reverse out into reported earnings over the balance of the year. Of course in International you see the large gain on the CLH investment. After removing that gain the earnings are lower as a result of the sale of CLH, which meant we didn't have earnings during the latter part of June.</p>
          <p>And our corporate costs are slightly lower than last year in the quarter due to the use of the proceeds from CLH to retire some commercial paper balances.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to our revised guidance for 2008. As Pat mentioned, we have revised upwards by $0.05 to an adjusted operating earnings per share range of $1.85 to $1.95. And strong performance from all of our business units has caused us to revisit our earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are seeing the impact of double taxation on our tariffs earnings, which we talked about earlier this year, coming in so far and anticipated to continue to come in less than what we had expected at the beginning of the year. We are seeing growth in volumes from the oil sands projects, although slower than what we had originally anticipated. So our revised guidance reflects in part an expected $10 million improvement in tariffs earnings in 2008 due to lower taxes that were reflected in our original guidance. Just so you can keep track of that particular aspect.</p>
          <p>In the medium term we continue to expect to achieve a compound annual average growth rate in earnings per share of 10% from 2007 base to 2011, based on our commercially secured projects, with plenty of opportunity under development to extend our double-digit growth beyond 2011.</p>
          <p>And lastly just a few minutes on our updated financing plan. A couple of recent actions have made our funding of the balance of the Wave 1 commercially secured projects very manageable. First was the sale of CLH, which provided roughly 1.2 billion in after-tax proceeds. About 300 million of that proceeds will displace a portion of our debt funding and the remaining 900 million satisfies a very large portion of our equity requirement.</p>
          <p>The second item is our dividend reinvestment program. At the beginning of the year we added a 2% discount to the plan and we have seen participation in that plan increase from about 4% to roughly 30%. As a result, the dividend reinvestment plan is now expected to provide about 800 million of incremental equity over the next four years.</p>
          <p>So just to quickly revisit the impact of these two items on the overall funding requirement. You will recall that Wave 1 one requires about $12 billion of capital expenditures at Enbridge Inc., and if we deduct our free cash flow we're left with a net funding requirement of $6.6 billion. This translates into a requirement for 1.9 billion of equity and 4.7 billion of debt. On the debt side we have recently secured underwriting commitments for 1.5 billion to project finance the Southern Lights pipeline and we're in the process of syndication and closing that transaction expect to be complete in the current quarter. But the 1.5 billion is underwritten.</p>
          <p>On the equity side, the sale of CLH and our enhanced drip program will provide 1.7 billion of equity capital, which leaves us with only 200 million of equity to be funded from now until the end of 2011 to meet the requirements of that first wave of commercially secured growth projects. This equity can be met from a variety of sources that includes further asset sales, asset monetizations, the issuance of hybrid securities and in-concept common equity.</p>
          <p>However, with respect to common equity our internal valuation work continues to show a significant gap between our common share fundamental value based on the extended double-digit growth we foresee and our current market valuation. And that's the case despite the fact that our PE on current earnings is at a significant premium to the peer group. In other words, the PE still does not reflect fully our unique combination of low-risk and unparallel growth.</p>
          <p>Now we expect over the next year or so as the growth is realized that our market valuation will converge on our fundamental value but in the meanwhile issuing common equity would be dilutive to our existing shareholders and would be our least preferred source. Given the modest remaining equity requirements and the variety of preferable alternatives we have, an equity issue really isn't in the picture in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, our work on a mandatory convertible hybrid instrument indicates that it is an attractive potential source of equity because it provides a significant amount of equity credit from the rating agencies but the conversion price is at a large enough premium to avoid any shareholder value dilution to our existing investors.</p>
          <p>So a near-term hybrid security issuance or a further asset sale or monetization would provide a valuable degree of flexibility and cushion to the financing plan at a favorable economic cost, in preparation for continued success in expanding and extending our secured growth opportunities. Those are things we'll continue to work on.</p>
          <p>On that note I will turn it back to Pat for his concluding comments.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks Richard. So these are very good times for Enbridge. Our six-month results have exceeded our expectations and that has allowed us to increase our 2008 guidance by $0.05, which I'm sure you'll agree is good news. We continue to make good progress with our expansion projects and have now completed Waupisoo and the first phase of Southern Access on or ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We've almost entirely eliminated the equity funding requirements for Wave 1 with the sale of CLH, as Richard has just outlined, and of course we continue to develop our $15 billion slate of Wave 2 expansion projects that really are designed to maximize market optionality for our customers while ensuring that Enbridge system remains the lowest cost shipping solution for our customers.</p>
          <p>So on that note I think we can move to the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and strong results. I'm curious Pat, now that CLH has financed you next number of years and Richard just referred of course to your preferred hybrid potential debt financing or some combination of financing. What is non-core or semi non-core to you at this stage, looking at your Colombia pipeline, your offshore gas pipelines, your EIF interest, which, of course, we'll have to decide what we want to do in 2011, or even your new wind farm, which seems to be one off at this stage. How do you view those assets in going forward, with your core?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, Sam, I think it's fair to say that all of those assets are definitely part of core business. Some are a little bit closer to dead center core than others. But they're all a logical part of our business and you know you mentioned Colombia, I guess you could say it appears to be stranded because it's now our only international investment. But to tell you the truth, we never really considered international to be an area of investment, we just consider good investments to be a good idea for our shareholders and two of them happen to be international.</p>
          <p>Looking at Colombia, we've mentioned before that there's a good heavy oil play under way right now that's resulting in expansion opportunity within Osenza and we obviously want to be able to take advantage of that. We don't have any intention at this point to exit and see further upside on that asset. We've indicated that we will look at restructuring opportunities, both at the partnership level and at the Income Fund level to better utilize what were intended to be low-cost-to-capital vehicles in the partnership in the Income Fund, so we'll continue to do that to optimize on those structures.</p>
          <p>And the wind business, actually we're building our fourth wind farm. We've got three already. We can and have used the Income Fund as a way of monetizing those assets and could look at something similar with regard to the new Kincardine facility. There's strong interest from other partners in participating in wind. So a number of opportunities there, but none of them are outside the core business of Enbridge or burning needs to restructure or exit in any way.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pat. Quick follow-up, Rich, I guess for you. Unrealized oil derivatives are up so much in Q2, you gave us a number, I think, last quarter of what is unrealized that should be realized, unless I missed it in your press release here?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your oil derivatives, you're recording the hedge loss, but of course you have a physical value enhancement because you've locked in the economics of the one side of the trade if you may. So I'm just wondering what your running book is of what you've accrued that you can't recognize yet within the context of those derivative features contracts? I think they were $300 million last quarter or so of what should potentially come back at you, if you like, as they mature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be the cumulative amount of those, all those mark-to-market losses to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just simply do the addition of the Q2 to wherever the status was of Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Take Q1 and Q2 together, that's, all of that will come back plus of course the profit margin on that transaction as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. That's where I'm going with it. Just wondering if there's a rough idea of what is, on the come if you may, coming into your financials in your bank, for that matter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the cumulative on the oil services side is about 36 million to date mark-to-market loss, so that will all come back along with the profit margin associated with it.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody and congratulations on a nice quarter here. Just a couple of questions, the first perhaps on Trailbreaker, and here just maybe more a clarifying question. Just to make sure that in your 2008 to 2011 spending that the Trailbreaker at this point even though it's small is not part of that 11.6 billion, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 11.6 billion was a plan number that had built into it a small amount of capital over and above projects that were committed at that time &#x2013; the time we put that number together. So I think you could say that Trailbreaker will still fit within allowance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then just sort of a follow-up. There was a &#x2013; earlier I think, given some of the numbers that were tossed around on Trailbreaker, it looked like it was the current number's 350 million sort of reflective of kind of a new cost environment we're in. Pat, now that it looks like we might be sensing some at least some forward momentum on Gateway, I didn't know if you had a sense of perhaps where the initially thought $2.5 billion, where that project might be if indeed that did move forward in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, let me answer the latter part of the first and then just come back and address the first part, with regard to Trailbreaker, if I understand you correctly, Carl. First of all we have not done a new update with regard to Gateway on capital cost and we won't be doing that until we get into the year 2009. We'll work closely with the other supporters of the project in order to put that in place, so I'm not able to give that to you before. I believe the most recent number we had out was about $4.2 billion but that was about 2006 number.</p>
          <p>So obviously it's going to be revised upward on the basis of where capital costs have gone over that period of time. Coming back to Trailbreaker, I think what you're asking was that, I know I was originally quoted as indicating it was about a $100 million reversal project and then we're now talking about 350 million. The difference is that I was talking about simply the reversal portion of that project, which is still accurate at around $100 million. We're now talking about all the ancillary expansions in our U.S. systems and tankage and ancillary facilities to take that up to 350. So it was an apples and oranges comparison between 100 million and the current 350.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, I appreciate the classification and just on the Gateway, when you were putting out that number 4 billion, that included the condenson then? So we're talking about the Gateway, we're looking at both sides. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>4.2 and it included both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again just to clarify a little further on the Gateway spending profile, we're filing for regulatory application in 2009, but construction wouldn't start for a couple of years after that. So the regulatory approval process will run a couple of years and we are fully funded by our partners on the project through that period of time. So it doesn't really have a significant impact on, again on the near-term capital requirements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Looking at your Offshore business, other than the continuing impact of the 2005 hurricanes, are there any other contributors that you would attribute to the lower than expected earnings, are you seeing higher competition and maybe you can comment on the outlook for the next year and the next five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, by the way the &#x2013; first of all, with regard to the first part of that, Linda, the ongoing cost was associated, now you may recall, way back at the start we indicated that we had a ship sitting on top of one of our lines and removal of that is what has caused the continued cost. That finally has been completed and you shouldn't see any significant going forward costs associated with the hurricanes. It has been primarily delay in new facilities coming onstream, producer delays and volumes, that has caused the softer quarter and also insurance premiums, in combination with the fact that of course the Canada-U.S. dollar exchange rate has been moving the wrong way for us on that income stream as well.</p>
          <p>We do anticipate in the medium to longer term, good prospectivity in the Gulf and a significant recovery there. As you probably know, we're very well-positioned particularly in the deep water Gulf, over the prime gas gatherer and that's where the majority of the activity is. And producers post the hurricanes of course have spent a fair bit of time on remediation, getting facilities that were due to come onstream back in service and now they're able to turn their attention again to exploration and development work. So we do anticipate those assets will improve over time.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Yes, can you guys speak to what your target debt cap is going to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross, we have normally targeted in the range of 62% debt, 60 to 64% debt is kind of where the rating agencies have been and so targeting in that low 60's range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two other questions. Can you speak to the Spearhead volumes? It looks like they're down a little bit year-over-year and also if you can comment on how much of your CapEx is -- that you've already spent is not yet producing any cash flow so we can kind of move towards a performing number?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe I'll try and split that in two and have Steve Wuori, if I could ask you to speak to Spearhead volumes and then Richard to the CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Ross, that Spearhead volumes are affected by the volumes moving through the system generally and are affected by some of the delays that we've seen in the oil sands with production ramp-up. The differences aren't very large and so there's really nothing to point to there in terms of a trend. So Spearhead is basically doing fine and it has the expansion program that we have soon to go underway to increase it to 195,000 barrels a day but there is really nothing there except that some of the delays from the oil sands would have been reflected down into Spearhead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Richard on the CapEx, you are looked to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So on the CapEx side the biggest chunk of that at the moment would be the Southern Lights project. It isn't cash flowing yet. We've got about 800 million that's been spent to date on Southern Lights. A variety of the other projects like the remainder of the Southern Access Expansion, the Line 4 Extension, Alberta Clipper, would be building up capital but none of those would be a huge amount at this point in time. So with 800 million on Southern Lights I guess we're probably at this point sitting with maybe $1 billion of capital that isn't cash flowing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And one other question if I may. About what kind of capacity utilization are you guys getting on the lines right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mainline capacity utilizations, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on the line. Some of the lines are full, but probably as a rough proxy for utilization of the full aggregate capacity, probably about 85% or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Macquarie. Pat, I just wanted to I guess get your comments on Gateway. It sounds like you're, from your comments on it, it sounds like you're making progress there. I wonder if you can maybe be more specific on what kind of progress you've made in the last few months and how you see it potentially rolling out in timeline if you firm up support?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the main progress, of course, has been the continued work on preparation of the regulatory application, which we will file in the first quarter of 2009. So that has involved engineering work, right-of-way work, first nations and landowner consultations and just the beginning of the preparation of the regulatory application, Matthew, and the optimism comes from the fact that we have pulled together this $100 million funding support from a variety of supporters. Both producers and refiners have now held a number of joint project meetings with them to get their guidance and direction and input on the project and have got very strong support to move this along as quickly and promptly as we can.</p>
          <p>I personally have attended and participated in some of the meetings relating to environmental and first nations challenges, which I know we've been asked a lot about.  And my confidence and our ability to work effectively with the landowners and first nations people has gone up significantly as we have walked through with them our intentions with regard to the project and have outlined the way in which Enbridge historically has operated and will intend to operate this facility. So we've got very strong support provincially and federally for the project. It's considered very much in Canada's national best interest and hence the momentum building. We would like to be able to tell you who the other participants are. At this point we're not able to do that because of the confidentiality agreements we put in place, but we do think at some point they're going to be prepared to allow that to be announced and I think you'll be impressed with the broad-based nature of that support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And potential timing again if you file in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's filed in '09 and we would be expecting to be up and operating 2014 most likely. We initially had indicated 2012 to '14, so we still expect to be in that range, probably in the 2014 timeframe. And that's really based on need. It's going to be driven by the customer's needs as to when they feel it's most important to have that optionality with regard to markets in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess just a follow-up on Gulf Coast. I know that you could go on for a long time about it, but just in a nutshell, can you please tell us whether you've sort of given up on winning that project outside of the short-term solution, interim solution you're proposing or do you still see Enbridge as being seriously in the running for a larger and longer-term solution to the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're asking whether to &#x2013; you said have we given up and if you want me to summarize it in a nutshell, absolutely not. We think that what we have is the most responsible and cost-effective solution for our customers and due to the slowdown upstream, we feel the shorter-term, smaller volume solutions are the most appropriate, but with the need at some point to have a large volume outlet to the Gulf and we feel we are in by far the best position to provide that as a result of being two-thirds of the way there. So again in a nutshell, have we given up? Absolutely not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I had a question for you as you look at lining up shippers' support again for the Wave 2 project. Do you sense there's been any diminishment on the part of the interest of refiners in going ahead and doing the larger coking projects necessary to run more of the in bitumen projects given the recent downturn in the history or is it not really changed given that the clients we are seeing in Mayan production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would definitely say the latter, Andrew. We have seen no diminished interest in putting the cokers in place in order to be able to accommodate Canadian heavy. We stay in touch with that very issue on a day-to-day basis and I think it's fair to say that although we've seen a few delays upstream in production coming onstream that everyone is highly confident that the oil sands will be developed and it's absolutely critical to security and supply concerns in the U.S., hence the U.S. refiners will be making those investments. So we're confident of that. As you probably know, there have been a few permitting delays in some of the projects but I'm sure that the companies will work around those and the projects will proceed. Steve Wuori, you may have a comment on that as well, because you're even more in touch with it than I am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew. I think one other thought there is that we really aren't seeing any new refineries being built. So one of the angles with, to meet increasing demand and also as you set decreasing supply from elsewhere is to increase the complexity of those refineries that are existing, which cokers do. And so it really increases the flexibility they have to run the lower cost heavy barrel. And so that interest definitely continues that matches the upstream development in the oil sands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a second question if I could on the part of the upstream producers. Again for these longer-term Wave 2 projects, do you sense there's a growing interest in shipping heavier crude preferentially to upgraded synthetic crude oil? We've had a couple of upstream companies talk about post 2013 or so, perhaps not needing to build additional upgrading in Alberta and just allowing all of it to be done at the refining sites?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you've hit a good point. There's probably a practical limit to how much upgrading can be done in the oil sands and can be done economically and because there has to be a market for all of that upgraded product and we're looking at projects that will put that into markets that it doesn't traditionally find right now.</p>
          <p>But I think trendwise that's probably so. There'll continue to be upgrading for a time, but there is that practical limit after which and during the same time you're going to see heavy bitumen movements move to the higher complexity refineries in the U.S. So I think there is something of that trend and of course upgraders live and die on the differential and one of the imponderables looking forward is exactly what will the light-heavy differential be? If it's wide upgraders and new investment in upgraders makes sense, and if it's narrow and it's expected to remain narrow, and by that I mean something in the $8 a barrel range, it becomes more difficult to justify an upgrading project.</p>
          <p>So those are the factors that are playing in. Are -- what are -- there are several. Well one is, what is the availability of biluent to move the heavy oil and that's what the Southern Light Pipeline is really designed to address, to move the heavy barrel to the high complexity refinery. And then where is the differential going to go in terms of light and heavy and if that is expected to stay wide then it makes sense and if not, it doesn't as far as upgrading goes.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question is for Richard. You mentioned on the guidance and related to Terrace, that you expected a $10 million increase. Was that an increase versus '07 or an increase versus the initial guidance that Terrace taxes would take earnings down by up to $30 million for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was relative to the initial guidance and my recollection could be wrong on this, but my recollection is we were expecting about a $20 million double taxation hit in 2008. And we're now expecting more like a $10 million double taxation hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that accounts for, let's call it half of the $0.05 shift in the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just, the other question I have and I don't know whether this is for Pat or for Steve, but you had some comments in terms of some of the issues you are having around the Southern Access Extension situation. Do you think that shippers might now shift support to Keystone in terms of some of the issues, if they are going to have to pay at a full freight south of Chicago or can you just kind of give us an overview of what the situation is and what the status of the project is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't expect that kind of a shift in interest. The Southern Access Extension provides very strong, I guess, capability or opportunity to those that are shippers on the Enbridge mainline system and it's very much in their interest of moving that crude further south and then to a variety of points from Patoka. It also was a very effective prebuild for Pegasus expansion and for possible movements by a barge down the Mississippi. So we see a number of alternatives there. We're working now with customers to come up with a new tolling methodology based on stand-alone support, and Steve I don't know whether you'd like to update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's right. And of course it wasn't intended as a rolled-in project anyway. It was a stand-alone toll and the latest application to FERC involved a backstop if the revenue requirement wasn't met. And that now with the FERC decision is what we need to address in terms of still going with the stand-alone toll. But designing commercial arrangements that are acceptable to shippers to ship on that line without that broader backstop from the main system and we think that that will work. It's a fairly small project. It's 170 miles in length. We've just gone through the Illinois Commerce Commission proceedings around the eminent domain land issue and so we're well along the way in terms of the arrangements necessary to construct that project.  And as Pat said, we're discussing with shippers now the commercial arrangements that will make it work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess, Steve you brought up a good point. It's a pretty small project and with the semi-depreciated or advantageous toll into Chicago, what kind of a tie-up from the shipper side of things that really shouldn't be that big of an issue for people who want to get south of Chicago into Patoka?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, It's &#x2013; I think you said it well. It is not a really large project. It's an important link, as Pat mentioned, and so it's certainly doable and I think we just have to come to the commercial structure that works for the shippers that want to use it the most and also provides accessible economics to Enbridge.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; I think Robert, as you know, it had strong support from cap and we see that support continuing. Just disappointed that the tolling methodologies as presented were not acceptable to FERC, but we will come up with one that does work.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Just one question as it relates to your Midwest pipeline construction program. Given the weather that we saw throughout Q2, where it was very wet and a lot of severe flooding in portions of the Midwest. What did that due to labor productivity on some of your pipeline builds in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Andrew, the most severe flooding in -- when you look at the map of where our projects are, really occurred in central Wisconsin, which had already been finished by that time. We had completed stage one of Southern Access all the way down to the Illinois border. And so we really weren't affected by the flooding that hit the Madison area of Wisconsin most severely. And of course we aren't in Iowa or places like that. So actually there was not a big effect on the construction because of the June deluge that hit some of the parts of the Midwest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a bigger, broader question from a strategic perspective. How do you see your positioning for a lot of the natural gas shale plays that are really emerging and they seem to be emerging almost daily into new pockets? And admittedly you've got some pretty good exposure with EEP. But at Inc. you're not in a lot of the areas other than say, what we can see in northeast British Columbia, some of the emerging plays there with Alliance. So what are your expectations longer-term for the natural gas side of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andrew actually you made me break out into a smile when you asked that question because we feel we're very well-positioned and let me kind of march from north to south and cover as many of those places as I can. Obviously we feel that Alliance is well-positioned for both the Montney and the Horn River plays, and I think that's pretty obvious as we extend up in the Fort St. John area, particularly the Montney, we're central to that.</p>
          <p>So well-positioned on that shale play. Moving south, the Bakken, I already mentioned, particularly on the oil side in both Saskatchewan and in North Dakota, we couldn't be better positioned than we are &#x2013; with the South Saskatchewan system and with oil portal system, which is Enbridge North Dakota. So very well-positioned for that and we're looking at a potential gas pipe out of that area as a result of our oil pipe involvement there and the proximity to the Alliance system. As we move further south, we've of course got a proposal coming out of Rockies in the form of the Rockies Alliance. That project and then we move into the Texas shale plays. As mentioned, we collect about a third of the gas in the Barnett, the Bossier, the Anadarko. As you move east in the Bossier and East Bossier and over into Haynesville and up into Woodford, we're on the fringes of those plays and as well-positioned as any gas gatherer to participate in those shale plays.</p>
          <p>West Texas, we don't have a significant infrastructure in that shale play at this point, nor do we in the Appalachian play or the Quebec shale play. But I think of that total that I've run through, we're as well-positioned as any company overall to participant in those. And of course we've got the expertise in the gathering and processing business and also the intrastate pipeline opportunities through Alliance and Vector to be a big player in the shale plays. So we're very pleased with our positioning there. We don't get a chance to talk about our gas business very often and probably the biggest opportunity in all of those is in the form of the Rockies Alliance pipeline, which I gave you a brief update on earlier on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at some of the emerging shale plays like Haynesville, would you envision that being done solely at EEP or would that be done in some kind of combination depending on the size of the project between EEP and also Enbridge Inc.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think most likely at EEP, but possibly EEP in partnership with other gas processors and gatherers in the area. We touch on the western side of the Haynesville play and are working very aggressively to move that, our infrastructure further east to accommodate Haynesville. But unlikely that Enbridge Inc. would be a partner there because of the huge focus that we've got on the crude oil development projects but we would like to drive it out of the EEP office in Houston.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Just a couple of clarifications. On EGB you had a retroactive rate increase back to January. Would that have had any sort of meaningful impact in the second quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in Aux Sable, good performance there and you've pulled in some of what you expect to get for the year. Your proportion that you've captured, is that sort of similar to what you had done in the second quarter of last year or has that changed in any way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A slightly higher proportion in the quarter, but given our full-year estimate for '08, we're probably about halfway there recorded already.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And to be clear on the hedge derivative loss, you absolutely expect, based on your sales and outlook today to fully capture that by the end of this year, and rising oil prices or any other change wouldn't push that into next year or anything like that?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, it's Vern. Based on what we have on our books right now, we would fully recapture that. Should we do more business in balance of the year that crosses the year-end, then you might see some mark-to-markets that don't reverse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Shteyn with Desjardins. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everyone. First, I had a question on the potential timeline for Enbridge. I believe this was &#x2013; someone discussed it before but, I think that would be &#x2013; timeline was revised after the initial announcement of the project to somewhere in 2012, 2014. Now given the latest &#x2013; your latest announcement today that you would be looking to file for regulatory approval in 2009. Regulatory approvals could take a couple of years and then going to construction, this would probably put you towards the latter part of that 2012, 2014 time range, would that be correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think as I indicated, Daniel, we're kind of suggesting probably in the 2014 timeframe and that'll be largely dependent on when producers feel they most need this line for the optionalities that they're looking to establish around their crude markets and pricing issues. As production increases out of the oil sands and the need to broaden out the markets. But yeah, I think it's fair to say that we're kind of looking at 2014 timing at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess my concern there is that one of the reasons that you stated that your Gulf Coast pipeline may not proceed as planned was that initially shipper support was not quite there due to delays in oil sands, the startup of Oil Sands operations. Now do you believe that those issues will be resolved and there will be sufficient volumes to fill Gateway, given the fact that there's now another pipeline project, by TransCanada, that will take a significant amount of crude out of the WCSB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, it's a very good question but let me ask that you think about Gateway as a pricing play and the fact that really what producers need to do, as I indicated in my introductory remarks, free to bid around their crude and have some alternative X North America in order to create pricing tension around their crude. And therefore even though they might not be able to fill the Gateway project on day one. In other words they may not be so much upstream production driven as pricing optionality driven, Daniel, that that is their expected timing around it. And we've got some flexibility to move one way or the other around that 2014 timing. But it is primarily a pricing play for them and hence that's the timing that we're using.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I can &#x2013; I certainly appreciate the need for competitive tension. But in that case you wouldn't go to &#x2013; you would still need to go to an open season and get at least some level of shipper commitments prior to proceeding to something like that. So is there a possibility that you would have take an open season where a bunch of shippers would sign up for take-or-pay agreements and simply, I guess what you're saying is they'll sign up those firm agreements but may not actually ship?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a possibility. Yes. But obviously producers are not wanting to have those ongoing commitments. If, on the other hand, they feel that the pricing advantage that they get by making the commitment more than compensates for any take-or-pay commitment, then they'll proceed to do that. But that would be a business decision they made &#x2013; they make at the time. But you're right. We will proceed with an open season and get the shipping commitments required. We won't be going ahead with the project until we've got those firm shipping commitments because of the significant capital at risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would, the timeline for an open season, would be sometime in the 2009, 2010 range or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be later than that to tell you the truth, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wouldn't likely occur until we've got regulatory approval. And just to clarify, we obviously would have an open season to satisfy regulatory requirements, but the primary discussion would be with the partners that are currently funding the regulatory approval process. They're the ones that have first call on all of the capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And kind of related to that. What would be the earliest time that Enbridge would have to start spending or investing a significant CapEx to fund its second wave of expansion projects? Because right now first wave is really kind of the timeframe is 2008, 2011. When would be the first significant year of commitments in terms of capital expenditures for the second Wave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, could you address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, well this first wave and second wave is a bit conceptual because for the most part the way we've defined first wave is that which is commercially secured with a little bit of a margin for a few things coming in that aren't yet commercially secured. So most of the second wave would be in service post 2011, starting in 2012, but as those projects get secured and firmed up, a project could be in service in 2012. We would start to see spending, of course, before that point in time. So we could start to see second wave capital expenditures coming in not likely 2009 but quite possibly as early as 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I guess the big question is how lumpy do you think that could be? Is 2010 CapEx likely to be on the order of what you are experiencing right now, assuming that, for the sake of argument, that the bulk of the second wave proceeds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Assuming the bulk of the second wave proceeds that spending would be spread out over a fairly extended period of time. So I don't think I see 2010 as being a particularly untypical year. But we would likely see expenditure levels continuing at the rate that we're currently spending in 2008. And that becoming more or less of a steady state as we moved into Phase II.</p>

          <p>&gt;: Daniel, one of the things that we are intending to do at our Investor Day conference in October is to try to lay out for you as best we can the timeline around Wave 2 and the reason why we've chosen that timing is that we've got a number of discussions under way right now, where we think we will have a lot better clarity on the likelihood and the timing by the time we get to the early October Investor Day conference, so we should be able to be a little bit more specific with you at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well that's very good. But I guess what I'm taking away from this is that 2008 kind of CapEx levels are almost the new normal in terms of cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're probably the new normal in terms of opportunity and growth going into the future, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's fine. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way, if that leads to a question as to how we finance that, remember that at the same time the CapEx is going up, the cash flow, free cash flow associated with Wave 1 projects really starts to contribute. So we don't have any significant concerns around the financing of Wave 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I understood that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from the line of Grant Hofer of UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks guys. And Pat, this may be a bit of a premature question in light of your recent comments, but with the Texas Access pipeline being pushed back, Gateway likely to be jointly producer-owned or shipper-owned at least, is that 14 to $15 billion of Wave 2 spending still a reasonable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when we put forward the 14 to $15 billion, we said that that was a gross number and that it could include participants. It's hard to define at this point the extent to which we may have other companies participating. So that is a gross number and it was never intended to be 100% Enbridge, Grant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So potentially with where things get scaled back to, at least the way things look today, I mean you guys still talk about being able to generate double-digit earnings growth beyond 2012 after Wave 1 is completed and you still remain comfortable with that longer-term outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. And we will be more definitive on that come Investor Day Conference as well. Realized that when we talk about Wave 2 those are only the things that we're aware of today as well and there'll be other things that will emerge along the way. So that's why we think that continues to be a reasonable proxy for the capital program.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And your final question is from the line of Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate the time everybody. I just want to quickly follow up on Rockies Alliance pipeline. In talks with Questar they sort of seem to indicate that producers were perhaps looking for something that went directly into Joliet and I guess the two-pronged question here is, one, as we look to firm up support for RAP, is that something where we're also looking at possibly changing rights of way? Two and perhaps maybe even a bigger question because whatever happens if you do get more gas in the kind of the Chicago area is there possibilities for further expansions of vector beyond the 100 million a day that's going in right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good points, Carl, and first of all, answer to question one is yes, we will look at revolving options as I mentioned earlier because we are getting that kind of feedback from produces that heading directly to Joliet is maybe a little more in tune with their desires than being further upstream with Ventura as we had originally planned. So we will look at gauging support to hit exactly the right market and obviously yes, if we put additional volume into Chicago that bodes well for downstream and for the Vector system. So yes, yes to both your questions.</p>
