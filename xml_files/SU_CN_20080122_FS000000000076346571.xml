          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Suncor Energy, Inc. Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded today Tuesday, January 22, 2008 at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Rogers, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I have the usual suspects in the room, Rick George, our President and CEO; Ken Alley, our CFO; Brenda Cherry, our Corporate Controller; and Greg Friedman from the Controllers' Department also.</p>
          <p>We are going to follow the usual format, Rick is going to give you a bit of an overview of the quarter and then also his thoughts on 2008, then I will give you bit of a commentary on the outlook for 2008 and then we will throw it open for questions.</p>
          <p>So why don't I turn it right over to Rick to get started?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John. Good morning everybody, and listen, we're pleased to announce earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 of $963 million, excluding the effects of federal tax changes -- federal and provincial tax changes, the number was actually 598 million, that compares to 358 million in the fourth quarter of last year, so quarter-over-quarter looks good. Cash flow for the quarter was 1.1 -- just over 1.1 billion, last year it would have been $746 million.</p>
          <p>Now, we are also well aware that we missed targets in 2007, and obviously we are not pleased with that. And -- but I did want to discuss 2007 in the overall context of the continuing growth of Suncor and where we are. And if you look at 2007, we -- and at least internally here, will remember as a year of great change and very, very high activity levels. Our operations were dominated by two major planned maintenance events, first was a 50 plus day outage, a planned turnaround of Upgrader Number 2, which is of course our largest unit at the oil sands plant. And 50 plus days of turnaround is a huge number; and this is dealt with tying in the MCU project. The normal turnaround on these units would be about 30 days.</p>
          <p>In addition to that though, we had 120-day planned, and this is on a planned basis, of turnaround at Sarnia, ON <mark type="inaudible" /> we convert that refinery to run sour product. All that planned, but still a massive amount of work. Normal turnaround in one of these units in that refinery would be again 30 days or less, so, just shows you the massive amount of activity.</p>
          <p>In addition to that though, we also had some unplanned maintenance both at oil sands and Sarnia. And so all of that, the net-net of that is we did miss production targets on the year, missing production targets had a major impact on cash costs and so, the two are definitely related.</p>
          <p>What I would say is that while a lot of this planned work is now behind us, at least the major, major stuff. We do have a U1 -- Upgrader Number 1 outage in 2008, should be roughly 30 days, should be in the second or early third quarter of the year. And that's probably the major piece of planned maintenance coming up. So, this coming year should be a little bit -- should be quite a bit lower in terms of maintenance on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>Some of the other highlights of the year were the expansion of Upgrader Number 2, our -- a project we call the MCU project, actually progressed very well. At the end of the year, we were about 95% complete, and by the fourth quarter of this year, that project will enable the capacity at the plant to be in the 350,000 barrels a day. The $650 million Millennium naphtha unit project, engineering is about 93% complete, construction is about 20% complete. Another big project we have going at oil sands is our Steepbank extraction plant that's an $880 million project, engineering at the end of the year was 96% complete, construction about 25% complete. Both of those projects will wrap up in the middle of 2009, that's the Millennium naphtha unit and the Steepbank mine.</p>
          <p>Now, the -- starting with the diesel desulfurization and oil sands integration project, which in total, over the last three or four years about $860 million, was completed during the fourth quarter. We are going through some operational challenge in terms of startup. But I would say nothing out of the ordinary, apart from what we have seen. A little bit slow on the startup than we might have hoped, but we've also been hampered there by outage of an Air Products' hydrogen plant that has also kind of slowed down that work. So, kind of a combination of things, we are just working through those now and we expect us to have for that unit totally lined up here in the next three, four, five weeks as we go forward.</p>
          <p>One of the other highlights is, we have, at the end of 2007, spent about $2.5 billion on our project Voyageur that includes engineering, site preparation, ordering long-term equipment, and also construction on phase III Firebag which is one piece of that project. And before anybody asks, no we're not going to announce what the total project is today, in terms of cost and schedule. We expect to do that in the near future here.</p>
          <p>We also, by the way, completed our fourth and largest wind power project. It happens to be in Ontario. It was about an $86 million investment for Suncor that was completed in the -- in December and brought on line. So, that actually is quite good as well. And, we have a number of other wind power projects on -- on the run here in terms of -- on a go forward basis.</p>
          <p>The only asset -- major asset that we didn't report on, of course is our Denver refinery. They had a terrific year in 2007, and really was our -- kind of standout in terms of operating very well and going quite well in that. Our natural gas business did have more dry-hole costs than we expected, and that is one that we will be doing a deep look at here in 2008.</p>
          <p>So, that's 2007 kind of in a nutshell. And 2008, I will focus in on a couple of things on a go-forward basis, and that is our focus on operational excellence. We do know that we need to achieve a higher level of reliability from the assets we have. We know that we need to start meeting targets, that's very high on our agenda. We also are working through the control orders we have on our Firebag operation. We would hope to have lifted those control orders during the year, could be as early as the fourth quarter, but we are hoping actually that it will be much-much earlier than that and we will continue our work on trying to move all of our operations to environmental excellence, as well as operational excellence on a go forward basis.</p>
          <p>The other big focus on growth in 2008 will be around continuing, I had mentioned the project on the Millennium naphtha unit on the Steepbank mine, Firebag stage III, and then of course continued execution of our Voyageur project. We are in really good shape in terms of site clearance, in terms of progress in engineering and feel very good about where we are on that, including the ordering of long-term equipment items.</p>
          <p>The other thing that the company is looking very hard on is, taking a look at what we do beyond 2012, that work progresses, and as 2008 unfolds, I'd hope to get back to you with a little bit of announcements about what that might look like. So the other question I normally get, but I don't answer that upfront, is around royalties and the royalties discussion, quite simply what I can say is we continue to have constructive dialogue with the provincial government and we hope to resolve the issue very shortly.</p>
          <p>Having said all of that and with all the work on our plate, this is one of the busiest periods in my 17 years with the company. We know that this is a very ambitious growth time. We know we need to start to meet our targets, and we are very well aware of our need to drive operational excellence. I think we are very realistic about the size of the challenge, but I remain very optimistic about our chances for success, particularly on a go forward basis here. So with that John, one thing with that, and we will never give up, and I assure you -- I am relatively optimistic about 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks Rick. Rick already talked to you for the most part around the production volumes, the 275 to 300, and I realized that it will be a little shy of where many of you are thinking for the year. I just wanted to reinforce that the range that we put out is fairly wide, and during the year, we will actually -- as we go along and better understand how the commissioning of the assets come along, we will tighten up that range for you and give you a little tighter. So do realize, it's almost 10% from the bottom to the top, but I think that reflects the size and the magnitude of the commissioning of the assets. We did want to reinforce that this has everything to do with commissioning of the new assets and really has nothing to do with the quality of Firebag or the reservoir itself, nor the quality of the mine fleet that we are getting in. It's really a mechanical issue, in terms of getting these assets up and running and the reliability that we are looking for. So it's just taking a little longer than we'd hoped in terms of commissioning and that's the best way to say it.</p>
          <p>The splits in terms of production, is pretty well laid out there for you. We won't reiterate that and the cash operating costs reflect the wide range that we have for the production volume. So that's really all I was going to say in terms of the outlook. 2008, as liquidated before, you have to be, the 2008 cap spending will be put out soon in conjunction with the Voyageur announcements, so we will just have to wait for that and hopefully we will be able to clear that up for you pretty soon.</p>
          <p>The one modeling question we were going to deal with on the call is the change in the federal tax which changed our opening deferred tax balance, so I'll just give you the numbers for the fourth quarter and year-to-date so you have those. So, if you'll bear with me, I am going to give you a number of numbers here. First of all, for the oil sands for the fourth quarter, the reduction was 348 million year-to-date it was 413. So for the oil sands Q4, 348, year-to-date, it's 413. For natural gas, Q4 is 33 million, year-to-date, it's 39. For the R&amp;M division, 15 for Q4, 17 year-to-date and for the corporate, it's actually a positive charge of 36 and 42. So those numbers should add up for the Q4 to 360 and for 427 year-to-date.</p>
          <p>So those are the only modeling type questions, hopefully, we will deal with on the call, Brenda and Greg and I of course will be around after the call to really help you with any of your modeling questions you have for 2008 and going forward.</p>
          <p>So with that, Luke, why don't we open it up for questions for Rick and Ken in terms of the strategic questions people may have?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Amir Arif of FBR. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. Just a quick question on the '08 outlook. Can you tell, is this related more to the emission issues with the SAGD or is it just related to your own desire not to process or not to produce bitumen in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to sell bitumen, is that what you are saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, yeah, not to sell bitumen without upgrading it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, the outlook is everything to do with bringing up this huge asset. And we have to remember that it is about -- we've just spent 3.6 or slightly more than that in terms of bringing in 90,000 barrels a day in terms of that asset. So, for the most part it has a lot to do with the -- bringing up the asset. Going, we'll see how the control order is lifted, and when it's lifted, and when we're actually able to increase the amount of bitumen from Firebag. But we could find ourselves slightly short of bitumen going into the fourth quarter. But, it's not a huge amount. So, I mean, for the most part, this has to do with the commissioning of the assets as opposed to being tremendously bitumen short.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you know when that issue is going to be taken care of, the emission issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the capital, we are expecting that, it probably will be in place by the end of this year, and we are working currently with the regulators to try to get that lifted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah John, actually the issues related to emissions there, we've not actually had one contravention since early December. So, if we continue this good track record on where we are, there is an opportunity to have that lifted earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, if there was no emission issues and if the differential scenario, sounds like this production range still would remain the same for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It could be; because once you are able to actually start steaming, it will take a while to get up to some pretty good production levels. We should add that we're producing today at about 41,000 which is where we cap that, and it has continued to be in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one final question on the CapEx and the Voyageur costs, and not going into numbers, but can you narrow what you mean by releasing it soon, are we talking Q1 or sometime later in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be our expectation, Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Q1. Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen. Rick, you were taking about the -- submitting the target and reliability to be better in the future or at least in 2008 starting. Anything that have -- maybe that you learned in the fourth quarter to lead to a change in the way how you guys conduct or that the &#x2013; I mean what will make you feel more comfortable that you will be able to meet the target as well as your reliability better in 2008, any big changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Paul, if you remember, we changed our operating model and our organization and appointed Steve Williams as the Chief Operating Officer. He and his team including all the business unit heads are all working hard on a continuous improvement program around operational improvements. We haven't necessarily seen results of that working in terms of 2007, but I would expect to see a lot of that on a go forward basis. Things like increased planned maintenance, steady operation. One of the things I will say is, 2007, with all the changes I mentioned, was a year of massive amount of change, and in that, especially given the size and the scale of these plants, not always easy in terms of getting the stuff up running and smoothening them out. I think the fact that we are bringing on less assets in 2008 should also enable us to be able to focus more on operational excellence. Having said all that, we do know that we have to start delivering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, it may not be totally fair, but in the fourth quarter, I mean, you guys gave a guidance in October, which obviously by then that you already know what is the full schedule that you have. Is there anything that's unique in the fourth quarter why it was so difficult that you end up that to be missing that, say, relatively near-term target or guidance on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything you need in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, we had a major event in December that we were obviously weren't counting on. And fundamentally, what happened is we ran into a very rich ore seam in the mine. We ended up having sanding problems in the extraction plant. And it's interesting, everybody sees this business as relatively simple and from 10,000 feet it is, the problem on the ground, is in these mines you can find everything from oil that sinks instead of floats, petrified wood to -- in this case, a very rich ore that actually did not allow the sand to kind of fall out as it normally would in our process. So, listen, there is always variability, this is laid down by nature. It was a fairly major event for us and limited the amount of bitumen we produced in December. You got to remember, we also had a pretty cold spell in December, which okay if -- you usually do get these events right at the exactly wrong time. The guys recovered very well, very proud of what they did. It's just a very tough and unplanned issue. And I think that kind of goes with the territory in this business. It is a different business than refining, in the sense that your feedstock varies by the hour almost and you've got to adjust to that once in a while, something will catch you out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick if I could, two final one. One, when you are talking about the rich bitumen and not allowing the sand to fall, is that a unique just to that section or that we should expect that to the rest of the mine or that -- to the rest of the Firebag, other sections that may have this problem also? And secondly then with the federal tax rate reduction, wondering if Ken will be able to give us a rough estimate, 2008 versus the effective tax rate by division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, I will take the first one and Ken will take the second part of that. Listen, there is going to be variability in this business from the front end and I always think of the challenge in the oil sands business being the bitumen production, be that from open pit mine or SAGD, we have a lot of experience in both. You are going to see big variability, so you are going to see some surprises all over the place. And if you would only look at the Deer Creek, probably where they had breakthrough on the SAGD project to surface. We still are working on technology across this broad front. So, you know, I know that may not give you a lot of comfort, but what I would say is, we will continue to learn, continue to improve, but she can always give surprises, even a company like ours who has been in this business for 40 years, continue to find new things, and part of that is just what Mother Nature throws at us. So, it's just that variability that we have to handle. I am not making excuses, but it's not as straightforward as many parts of this business. Ken, over to you or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, one of the things we are going to do if we can is the overall tax rate for the corporation, we would expect to be in 29.5 to 30% and what we are doing is just kind of working through the tax rate by divisions. So if you bear with me, I'll actually get back to you with that number.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Hey Andrew.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had more of a strategic question for you, Rick. One of the perhaps positives of this volatile market is, if we do see a weaker year in US refining, certainly, the equities for the US refineries are a bit less expensive this year. What it is, just get an update on your views on the importance of integration if you are still looking at downstream integration in the US and if that at all could factor into your plans over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, thank you very much, and I do like that strategic question. So, absolutely, I think we continue to look for assets for sale. As you know we picked up Denver, while we thought it was right part of the cycle, that's proven to be the case. If you look at last year that asset had a 28% return on capital number, and so we are very proud of that. But, this year, you've got to pick your moments. I think we are going to appear here where refinery margins head towards a more normal range and with that I think some of the asset valuations of downstream assets will come back into a range where Suncor can actually find them acceptable.</p>
          <p>Now, the only caution I would say about that is we do have our plate full, and Voyageur is a huge project. I want to be a little bit careful about how much I load on this organization at once, and so what you can expect out of us over the next couple of years is a pretty Voyageur-centric organization, refocused on excellence in operations and execute on Voyageur. Having said that, if we could find the right -- fine assets that came up for sale, you know, in our sphere that we could reach directly within oil sands, we will be looking at talking to all those people for sure. You just wouldn't expect -- don't expect Suncor to come out with a big purchase of a large refinery at a large price. I mean, we are looking for the right sets of assets that we could fit in and make work right.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Andrew, we've kicked that around -- as you know, there's been a number of joint ventures done across this spectrum. I guess, one of the -- my biggest hurdles is, first of all, we don't have to do one of those. We have options on both sides, there's refining as well as the upstream. My fundamental belief, Andrew is, the reserves in the ground long-term are going to have higher value than do refining assets. And refined assets -- <mark type="inaudible" /> own more but you do have pressure from changes in consumer behavior on purchasing of cars, you've got ethanol and biofuels coming on, and you're going to have more product on the water around the world moving towards the US coast. So, when I look at all that, I still -- and I've been saying this for a few years that I wouldn't do that joint venture deal on the valuations they had on those refineries at that time. I would look at joint venture deals, but it would have to be the right transaction. And my underlying fundamental belief is the reserves are going to be worth more than refining assets on a go forward basis. So, I'll tell you a little bit; it's pretty hard to do a deal when a guy has that kind of mindset.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Rick, I believe, previously you mentioned that you might supplement your natural gas division's gas assets by looking at selected acquisitions or -- and I'm kind of wondering is that move forward on to your plate in the coming year, or whereabouts does that fit in your strategic thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, listen, the natural gas business has been a tough business. I expect the industry to be a pretty tough industry for the next 12 to 18 months. And you will have your own view Terry of prices. So, I want to be a little bit cautious here. Steve Williams and his team are going to be taking a look at that business going back to strategy. Acquisitions is one piece of that. If we can see the right kind of assets coming up for sale and weakness in 2008-2009, we will definitely look at that. Still a priority for me in terms of being in the natural gas business, but as you know, this has been a business that moved from a 30% return on capital business to all of a sudden a very low return on capital business, almost just the cash business for the industry during '07 and it looks like the same for '08. So, I'd just be really cautious how much money I would invest in that, although I think there will be opportunities at the bottom of this cycle somewhere to pick up some assets that make sense.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. A couple of quick questions on Voyageur, first, Firebag Stages 4 to 6, I was curious if you could update us on the regulatory process. And then second, you mentioned you'll be getting an update in the near future on Voyageur, I'm just curious what all would be included in there that would be both phases for the Upgrader and North Steepbank extension and so forth, what all would be included in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, thanks. And -- we're just going through the final stages of the regulatory approvals on 4 through 6. We expect to have that in hand in the second quarter of this year, in the middle of this year, that's our expectation. We could have it earlier. I mean, a lot of the work has actually finalized on that, and a lot of this is not in our hands in terms of -- the regulator actually is in control of the schedule. But we actually do expect to have that relatively shortly, meaning in the next three to six months. The -- on the Voyageur, we will do a full layout for you in terms of cost, schedule, how much of it is Upgrader capital versus bitumen production capital. We'll have detailed schedules, and we'll have a profile in terms of what that spending looks like. So, our intent here is when we do announce this that we'll lay it entirely out for you. And you will see quite clearly where we are. I mean I know it is very unusual to have a project where you have spent $2.5 billion, but just there is a good reason that we're not in a position today to announce it. And the one thing I would say is that I feel really good about the fact that we have done a lot of preliminary work, the engineering is pretty far along and we've done a lot of our homework with a lot of equipment purchase. So, not taking the risk out of it totally, it will still be a very challenging project, but we'll have taken a lot of the front-end risk out of it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Rick, you're using the new <mark type="inaudible" /> technology again this winter. Could you perhaps comment on the success ratio or the utilization rates of that technology this winter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can. I mean it's in full production. I don't have an exact number, but it's operating very well. It would be in the range of 15 to 20% of our production on a normal basis. I think that number is correct. And so, it's fully trimmed down and fully ready to work, we're getting ready to order our second one. And so, that will tell you a lot about our confidence around the overall technology. So, I would say kind of now, we consider that to be part of the overall production process, have the debugging kind of done on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you remind us on the lead time for the ordering and what's your scheduling then for bringing in the new units over the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So the delivery time on these -- it is about 18 to 20 months, maybe it's slightly longer. So, it would be another two years before you see us bring one on probably in the -- thinking here in '08, so it's in the '10 timeframe we'll bring the next unit on. And then, we should have another unit online by the year after that. So, it will be a kind of sequential movement on here. It's probably a little bit later than we might have indicated before, but I think part of that was we wanted to make sure we debug the technology. We also have to change the mine plan to make sure that it is set for these kind of units. And so, there is a lot of mine planning that went into that effort as well.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Rick. In your opening remarks, you talked about continuing cost pressure. I am just wondering if you are approaching a point where you're getting concerned about this continuing cost escalation or becoming more cautious about the expansion plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, no, I mean not with regard to Voyageur. We're kind of &#x2013; we're pretty far along on that. And again, because we order the major piece of equipment, our biggest -- when we do announce the number, I think our biggest risk around that will be fuel productivity. And so, at least you can narrow the risk down to that not. I'm not saying that that's easy, but at least, we'll kind of know that. One thing that I'd say about Voyageur is, we formed our Major Projects group now about six years ago. So, this whole thing is kind of being building up to this large project. This will be a major test. There is no question about that. But I am &#x2013; we're making this and we've got the best team of people with the most experience to get us through that effort.</p>
          <p>So, no, I'm not getting cold feet, if that's the question. What I would say is, we continue to experience inflation both on the operating side and the construction side. At some point, you're right in terms of -- at some point if these projects continue to escalate in Alberta -- and it's important to remember it's a worldwide issue, not here -- it will eventually choke up the economics of these projects. I don't think we're at that point yet. We still see inflation on the operating side as well, but that's probably a little bit more manageable, although it's certainly a challenge as we go forward.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, just two real quick questions. In 2008, obviously you're pretty busy with Upgraders 1 and 2 and the Sarnia restart as it were. As I look forward to the next year in 2009, should that be a reasonably clean year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's a good question. So the answer is, we're going to bring on the naphtha, the Millennium naphtha unit --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- and the Steepbank extraction plant both in the middle of 2009. And by the way, you will be finishing up Firebag Stage 3, and so again that will be a year where we're bringing our new assets, so always a challenge. I do think the base plant itself, it will -- in this year we should have the major turnouts behind us, should have fewer problems. But what I would say is that's a lot of assets to bring on. So, that alone would be several billion dollars worth of assets all coming on in one year, 2009, so, not without those challenges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as far as the base production is concerned, when you were talking about December and about the fact that you guys had a rich ore body in December, you were going to go out and assess and see whether you need to continue to blend or adjust the overall configuration, where are you out right now on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have to get <mark type="inaudible" /> give a detailed review of that. But what I would say is we've done a -- they are working on a root cause analysis of what happened, how to prevent it in the future. I believe that the way they're doing it today is by blending it off in terms of rich ore with some less rich ore and that seems to have worked fine on a go forward basis. John, have you got any other --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah -- no, no. That's where we came on in terms of the analysis is for the most part we have to fix a few things in the extraction plant, but what we're doing now is blending the really rich ore with a little leaner quality, which is fixing the issue. So, today what we're working through for the most part is just some of the valve issues, which is what we had in the Upgrader in December also and really just working through that particular dilemma.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, John from your perspective this is more of a shorter term issue versus a reconfiguring issue from a change in the ore base?</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. One on your reserve disclosures. I was curious as to how year-end commodity pricing and -- especially the differentials to some of the heavy blends from Canada might have impacted your reserve disclosures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, they didn't. We'll continue to have about 15 billion barrels of resources. So there hasn't -- was no changes there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on your hedges, it seems that you have about 10,000 barrels per day hedged for 2008, is that about the maximum level that you'd be thinking about at current crude prices or would you be looking to hedge any more of your production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, <mark type="inaudible" />, it's Ken Alley here. I mean, I think if you look at the balance sheet going forward, I mean ended 2007 with net debt of about $3.2 billion. So we feel really good about the balance sheet and our financial capacity going forward, as we move into the heavy spending period with Voyageur. As far as hedging goes, I mean I think we continue to look at our hedge strategy really as a form of prudent insurance with the balance sheet. We think it makes sense as we finalize the Voyageur spending. So, I guess I would say, we will continue to look our hedge strategies as long as we feel we could buy what I would call inexpensive insurance for the balance sheet, and when I say inexpensive it means locking in a reasonable floor price for some percentage of our production. Historically, for us that's been in the kind of 30% range or a third of production without giving up upside on the commodity as we continue to believe that the commodity prices are going to be very strong going forward. So, it's really just prudent financial management.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to ask two quick questions. The first one, in the province had given a 90-day window when it wanted the talks on a new royalty agreement to conclude by, which I think we are almost that. And so, I'm just wondering have the talks been extended or is perhaps a deal imminent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jon, it's Rick here. So, I think I have said all I can say on the royalty matters. We've got -- we continue to have a great constructive dialogue. We hope to resolve those soon. It's always a two-way street. So, we'll have to kind of wait and see where the timeline is. I don't think we're actually at the 90 days yet. But -- and again, that was the deadline that the government gave, that wasn't a Suncor deadline. I'm very hopeful that we'll be within their deadline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, the cost estimate on Voyageur, you explained a bit about why this has occurred that there has been some spending take place already, but you'll announce in the next quarter the total cost estimate. Can you again further detail a little bit about why this approach has been taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jon, I think if you look at it, we've learned a lot over the last decade on this. And if we're announcing that number earlier, then you guys, the press then reports against that number for the next three years. So, what we wanted the number that we can have some degree of assurance about what our risk is going forward. And so, one of the issues is when we do give you a final number, it will be a number, which we have some faith in we can meet. To do that, we need to make sure we have major pieces of equipment ordered, engineering pretty far along, the sites cleared, and that eliminates a lot of risk and the variability. And so, that means that I won't have to report against a number I didn't have much confidence in for the next four years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Morning guys. Apologies, I was a little later getting on the call. The production guidance that you've given for this year -- it is hopefully a real simple question simple question -- I was just wondering if it's possible to give us some idea of the patterns through the year John. You've mentioned the maintenance in the second quarter, but you've also mentioned you expect to be close to 350 by the end of the year, so maybe a little help there in modeling would be useful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll to follow the crystal ball for you Doug. That's a difficult one. I would think that you would probably think a bit about something north of 260 going into the turnaround, and then the turnaround will kind of cut the production in half, and then coming out of the turnaround, you will be north of 300,000 barrels a day. And there isn't a whole lot of science to what I just said. I mean that's our best estimate at this point in time. The numbers are going to be what they're going to be, and we'll be able to give you a better update as we go along, and a month-to-month basis, we'll get a little more comfortable with this huge new asset that we have, and really give you better idea in terms of how that production profile will turn out. But I will &#x2013; for now, if you use those kind of numbers, I think you'll be -- you'll for now have a good estimate of where it would be.</p>
