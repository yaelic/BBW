        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us today. After yesterday's market close, we announced a significant discovery of oil and gas reserves in Kern County, California. We believe it to be the largest new oil and gas discovery made in the States in more than 35 years.</p>
          <p>This new field discovery within the outlined area of the six wells we have built to date contains 150 million to 250 million gross barrel equivalent of oil and gas reserves. We believe it to be probable that there are additional reserves outside the outlined area.</p>
          <p>Mr. Steve Chazen will give you more details about this exciting program later on. It's also possible that there are similar accumulations elsewhere in Oxy's 1.1 million acre net leasehold and fee mineral holdings in California. But let me share with you how we got to our current exciting and rewarding position.</p>
          <p>Oxy has been a California oil and gas producer for more than 50 years. Our most significant expansion was in 1998, with our acquisition of the Elk Hills field from the U.S. government. When Elk Hills was acquired by Oxy in 1998, it had approximately 425 million BOE of proven reserves.</p>
          <p>Since then, it has produced more than 364 million BOE, yet, as a result of the technology applied by Oxy over the past 11 years, we have actually been able to increase its proved reserves to more than 491 million BOE today after all the production I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>So the total production of proved reserves since Oxy acquired the Elk Hills field is approximately 1 billion BOE. In the years immediately following the Elk Hills acquisition, we purchased THUMS, our operation in Long Beach Harbor, followed by our acquisition of a number of additional California properties. Those include oil and gas assets from Vintage Petroleum, Plains, Tidelands in Long Beach near THUMS, as well as other properties.</p>
          <p>Oxy's current combined California assets include more than 7,500 active wells located in 90 fields spanning 600 miles. They're currently producing about 130,000 BOE per day, 70% of which is oil, and at year end 2008, had approximately 708 million BOE of proven reserves. California represents approximately 20% of Oxy's worldwide production.</p>
          <p>Oxy is currently the third largest oil producer in California, and the largest natural gas producer. We see additional potential in our California holdings by our applying current technologies and the newest thinking to exploration and production. We have invested in California exploration accordingly, and we expect this activity to continue for the next five to 10 years. Oxy's California and U.S. exploration production program is part of an overall effort to build a pipeline of growth projects in keeping with our long-term strategy for increasing stockholder value.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to grow in our other core regions. Oxy's presence and production in the Middle East, currently producing about 186,000 BOE per day net to us, or 29% of our total worldwide production continues to expand. In recent months, we have signed new agreements in Bahrain, in Abu Dhabi and Oman, where we have an agreement to develop four gas fields in a newly formed contract area in Oman.</p>
          <p>First production of those assets is expected in the near future. Also in Oman, production of the Mukhaizna oil field, where we have a large-scale field flood project, is meeting its targets and growing. We are on pace to achieve an exit rate of 80,000 barrels per day at the close of 2009.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen to give you our second quarter financial results and other details.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ray. Net income was $682 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared to 2.3 billion in the second quarter of last year. Here's a segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and gas second quarter 2009 segment earnings were 1.1 billion compared to 3.8 billion for the second quarter of 2008. The $2.7 billion decrease in the second quarter of 2009 earnings was due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and higher DD&amp;A rates, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Occidental's average realized crude oil price in 2009 second quarter was $52.97 per barrel, a decrease of 52% from the $110.12 per barrel in the comparable period of last year. Oxy's domestic average realized gas price for the quarter was $2.87 per Mcf, compared to $9.99 per Mcf for the second quarter of last year. Worldwide oil and gas sales volumes the second quarter of 2009 were 649,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 10%, compared to the 588,000 barrels a day in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>The increase includes 20,000 BOE a day from Dolphin, 18,000 BOE a day from Argentina, 17,000 BOE a day from Oman, and 12,000 BOE a day from domestic operations, partially offset by 19,000 BOE a day from Libya. The Argentina increase includes 8,000 BOE/d from new production coming on line and the effect of 15,000 BOE a day for a production loss due to a strike in the second quarter of 2008, partially offset by a 5,000 BOE per day loss from a strike in June of this year.</p>
          <p>Dolphin's increase reflects higher cost recovery volumes in the second quarter of 2009 resulting from a catch-up of unrecovered volumes in the first quarter of 2009. Substantially all of the domestic volume increased in the Midcontinent/Rockies and Permian was attributable to 2008 acquisitions. California production increased as a result of new wells. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, Long Beach production decreased by 6,000 BOE a day due to its contract that is similar to a production sharing contract.</p>
          <p>The Middle East/North Africa included higher production in Oman and Dolphin and higher production sharing volumes compared to last year's second quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, production sharing volumes decreased by 14,000 BOE a day. Exploration expense was $54 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance of $60 million.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.32 a barrel for the first six months of 2009, a 15% decline from last year's 12-month costs of $12.13 a barrel. In the second quarter of 2009 oil and gas cash production costs declined to $10.17 per BOE, compared to the first quarter 2009 run rate of $10.48 per BOE. These declines are due to lower workover, maintenance and utilities costs and for changes from the prior year, the effect of higher production sharing volumes. The lower cost reflect our continued cost-reduction efforts.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than on income were $1.76 per barrel for the first six months of 2009 compared to $2.62 per barrel for all of 2008. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect lower crude oil and gas prices in the first half of 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, these taxes increased to $1.82 per BOE compared to the first quarter rate of $1.71 per BOE, due to higher crude oil prices.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2009 were $115 million compared to our guidance of $100 million. The higher earnings were attributable primarily to higher than expected chlorine pricing. Chemicals earned 144 million in last year's second quarter. Midstream segment earnings in the second quarter of 2009 were $63 million compared to $161 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decline in earnings was due to lower NGL realized prices in the gas processing business, lower earnings in crude oil marketing and reduced margins in the power generation business.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was 40% in the second quarter compared with our guidance of 43%. The decrease in rate reflects a higher proportion of expected total year domestic source pre-tax income.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Oxy's performance during the first six months. Net income was 1.1 billion for the first six months compared to 4.1 billion for last year's numbers.</p>
          <p>Capital spending for the second quarter of 2009 was 831 million and 1.9 billion for the first six months. We currently anticipate total year 2009 capital spending to be at 3.6 billion. The $100 million increase from our estimate that's mostly allocated for our Oil and Gas locations.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the six months of 2009 was 2.2 billion. We used 2.4 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and signing bonuses and payments in Libya and Oman, and $520 million to pay dividends.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we issued $750 million of 4.125% senior notes due in 2016 with net proceeds from the offering of $740 million. The cash balance at June 30 was 1.8 billion. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the six months were 810.8 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.7 billion.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas sales volumes to be similar to the second quarter levels at about current oil prices. The third quarter production is expected to reflect decreases from Midcontinent/Rockies due to natural declines, and Dolphin due to its production sharing contract, offset by increases in California, Argentina, and Oman.</p>
          <p>With regard to current prices, the current market prices, a $1.00 per barrel change in oil prices, impacts oil and gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. The average second quarter WTI oil price is $59.62. A swing of $0.50 per million BTUs in domestic gas prices has a $20 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. While current NYMEX gas price is around 3.70, prices in California are currently about 3.50, in the Permian around 3.30, and in the Rockies around $3.00.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $50 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs. For the chemical segment, the second half of the year looks exceptionally weak. The weakness in caustic soda is not being offset by chlorine price increases, resulting in declines in margins. The fourth quarter is traditionally the weakest for this business, and we expect it to about break even. We expect the third quarter chemical earnings to fall at least 50% from the second quarter levels.</p>
          <p>We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter of 2009 to be in the 40 to 42% range, depending on the spilt between domestic and foreign sourced income. Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in the 'Investor Relations Schedule.'</p>
          <p>California exploration is our next topic. Excluding the Kern County discovery discussed in yesterday's press release, in the course of a little over a year, we have drilled 34 exploration wells seeking non-traditional hydrocarbon-bearing zones in California. Of these wells, nine are commercial and 16 are currently being evaluated. We expect to drill an additional eight exploration wells in this year.</p>
          <p>Oxy holds 1.1 million acres of net fee acreage and leaseholds in California which have been acquired in the last year to exploit these opportunities. Discoveries similar to the Kern County discovery are possible in this net acre position. Additionally, we continue to pursue shale production, which is expected to produce oil on this acreage.</p>
          <p>As we announced yesterday, we made a significant conventional -- that is non-shale without stimulation -- discovery in Kern County, California. We believe that there are between 150 million and 250 million gross BOE of reserves within this small producing area delineated by the six wells drilled to date. The discovery area's multiple producing zones whose areal geologic extent is still being defined, consists of both conventional oil and conventional gas-bearing zones. It is probable that there are additional reserves outside of the currently defined area, as the field limits have not yet been seen.</p>
          <p>This is a classic oil and gas field with large pay zones with high permeabilities. It is most similar to deep water discovery, and bears no relationship at all to so-called resource plays. In the Kern County discovery area, we are currently producing from the six wells approximately 74 million cubic feet of gas and 5,000 barrels of liquids per day, which is more then double the BOE production we disclosed last quarter. All of this production comes from conventional zones. While there will be production from shale zones in this area, the bulk of the future production will come from conventional wells.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we expect to drill an additional 17 wells. The wells in this area cost about 3.5 to $4 million to drill and complete, and have payoff periods of less than six months. The combined finding, development and lifting costs are expected to be significantly less than $10 per BOE. We will also need to expand our 400 billion cubic feet per day gas processing plant in Elk Hills to accommodate the expected production from this Kern County discovery. Our overall working and revenue interest in this discovery is about 80%.</p>
          <p>No additional details will be provided at this time. We expect to update the production information next quarter. Copies of our press release can be found on our website or through the EDGAR system. And now we're ready take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate at Howard Weil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks, good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, it looks like a fairly clean quarter on the earnings, so if you don't mind I'm going to focus my questions on California?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What a surprise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of things. First of all, you've been very clear that this is conventional production. That to me would suggest decline rates are more in the 10% to 15% kind of range, just taking a stab, as opposed to the &#x2013; you know, the shale, 60 to 80% type of numbers. If that's reasonable, then based on your initial production, the production rates that you're telling us from these wells, is it reasonable to think that you're looking at something like six million barrels in that range over the life of the field from each of these wells? And what I am trying to get to is, what's it going to take to develop this thing in terms of capital costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a lot of questions &#x2013; words. We actually don't know what the decline rate is. In the &#x2013; since we &#x2013; the issue inside the field is recovery rate, recovery factors, so we don't actually &#x2013; the range we're showing you is not that we don't understand the rock volume, but we don't actually know what the recovery factors are. There is no good analogy that we can come up with that looks like this field anywhere in the lower 48.</p>
          <p>So we have not seen any decline to this point, so we're loath to estimate what the decline might be. Obviously all wells decline. If the wells &#x2013; if you have multiple zones, we're going to have to develop each zone separately, so you'll have drilling to &#x2013; each of the zones and production from each of the zones. So ] know, we tried to indicate the well cost \ and the resulting finding development cost, but the development program, which is still in work is going to be more complicated, because each of the zones will have to be developed separately, so &#x2013; we can't give you better guidance, because we just plain don't know at this point. Obviously, this is a very large field whose test results supports the size of the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the development of the field will be well within our financial capability internally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess getting to the bottom line, what I'm trying to identify here is that you just talked about total costs below $10. I'm taking a stab here in seeing that if these are conventional wells. you are seeing no declines, so I'm probably being a little conservative, at least in the early days, I'm guessing your F&amp;D costs could be under a buck? Is that ridiculous or is that not a bad place to start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we want to comment on what it might be, but obviously with this kind of find, your future development costs are going to be very, very low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so and the operating costs with these flow rates is going to be pretty modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you know, pretty safe with the $10. I think I said significantly below $10 actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we look below 5, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. You can always hope. We're still in the early days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, you know, I'm sure we'll have some disappointments over the next two or three years...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...as we try to extend the field, and so maybe I built in some dry holes ultimately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And thinner zones. So, it's plenty good enough with the 10, and if you want to use a lower number, one would be hard-pressed to argue about that for very long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me try two quick follow-ups, and then I'll let somebody else jump on. First obviously, you know, I guess a lot of folks are trying to do rightly or wrongly trying to make some kind of analogy about acreage and all the rest of it. I just want wanted to ask a real simple question. Your &#x2013; Cynthia, I believe, presented to one of the local townships recently and talked about 120,000 acre seismic program, 200 square miles, I believe, that she talked about. Is that related to this discovery, or is that something separate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have an ongoing exploration program in California. You wouldn't use seismic to look for shale wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'm guessing this could only represent about a 10th of your entire acreage position? Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, no, the seismic exploration seismic program is one thing. This discovery is much smaller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Much smaller. Okay. Good. And finally, the last one was just on production potential, I'm kind of thinking if I look at &#x2013; just using my numbers here, 30 wells let's say, over a limited period of time. With these variable limited decline rates. This could get up to 60,000 barrels a day. Is that an unrealistic number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We actually don't want to get into production forecasting, but it's not all that complicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. I'll let somebody else jump on. Thanks a lot, and congrats.</p>

          <p>The Long Beach arrangement is pretty much analogous to a production-sharing contract. So obviously as prices go up, net volumes go down and vice versa.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Steve, question for you on rigs, and particularly the comment on the Mid-con and Rocky volumes going into Q3. If I look at this correctly, you've gone from about 28 rigs in the lower 48 to I think just four currently running. Can you talk about the economics of lower 48 today in general, when you think you might be ramping back up, and further risks to domestic volumes if you stay at -- you know, say less than 10 rigs through the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Bill can answer the rig question better than I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, we currently have 12 rigs running.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>12 rigs. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have 12 running.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But none in the Piceance. .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then do you plan to stay at about that level through the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of volume degradation, is it fair to assume that the Q2 to Q3 pace is something that we could expect at 12 rigs to not accelerate as we move into Q4, Q1, if you stay around that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as Steve reported, we're expecting our production volumes to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In the next quarter overall. I'm just talking about, sort of, you know, the give and take with in terms of the mix with Mid-con and Rockies down, I assume that that's where you 're going to continue to see declines as you move forward into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll continue to see declines until we get a gas price in the Rockies that makes sense. And based on our view of it that's going to take a few quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So any time we wanted to, we could just drill the wells and get the production up. But doesn't make a lot of sense of $3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that sort of gets back to my original question, Steve. Can you talk about -- we haven't seen prices like this since '02, '03, and you still have services cost anywhere between sort of at '04 and '06 level. How do you see those converging over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have got to ask the service guys when they are going to cut their costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are talking to them every day, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're yelling at them everyday. I don't know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Are we going to get there within a couple of quarters? Clearly, you have got some break in the last six months. But...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think over time they'll converge. I think everybody is still hoping for a big -- a sizable increase in natural gas prices for the back half of the year. No sign of that, mind you, but I think there is a lot of hope, and maybe by the service companies too, but the costs are coming down nicely. And so we would expect that we'd get equilibrium here sometime next year. But I think it is going to be really tough this year, because I think there's still a lot of drilling going on in hopes of a price rebound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>High level question on California. We've talked about the Monterey shale, now we have a big discovery in a different conventional reservoir. Have you identified a new play concept in California that provides Oxy and potentially the industry with a new core reserve and production growth engine?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the same way they missed Elk Hills.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's -- you can't really tell. It's -- California is -- most of the acreage in California is controlled by a few parties -- mineral acreage. And over the years, most of those parties shifted their focus out of the United States in to other places and they sent their best people for things that they thought were more attractive, and that's I assume what happened. But this has been -- that's the advantage, when we talk about we want core areas and concentration, it's not just about that it's easy to manage, it's also so our people become more knowledgeable about the areas, could see things by working on them over a long period of time to generate better results. I mean, this is the result of traditional geologic work. It's not some new technology or geomystics or satellites flying over. It's traditional geologic work by a handful of imaginative people that work for us. This is like geology years ago. So I don't -- so it is a new play concept, obviously, which is why we're a little less transparent than you might like. And so I think there's more for not just us, but possibly for the others if they choose to pursue it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the Kern County conventional discovery, I realize it's early going, but you alluded to additional opportunities. Do you expect it to generally be two-thirds gas going forward, or is there the chance for a greater proportion of oil as you go forward? And is it in fact crude oil or is it more natural gas liquids? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not NGLs, it's condensate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so it looks like, I hate to say what it looks like, but you could imagine. It's very, very, very light, and can easily be either blended or sold to refiners.  We're not talking about NGLs here at all. But as far as whether it becomes oilier or not over time, we'll see as the drilling progresses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's clearly some more oil-bearing zones that are available there that we really haven't counted.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In terms of the shale opportunity, that sounds like it's predominantly oil. You've clearly drilled a number of wells. What's the timing in terms of having confidence to disclose some of the results there and when we might hear more on the shale oil opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's going to take several years. Obviously people have been diverted by this. This is a much higher return and the acreage isn't going away in the shale. So we're drilling shale wells. We'll drill water shale wells in the next two or three years. But, it's pretty predictable, has reasonably low finding costs, although not like this, and so you'll expect to see production growth over the next few years from that, but it won't be nearly as dramatic as this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. And then lastly, any update on how we should be thinking therefore about U.S. capital spending over the next few years, and including 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year, we're living with what we have. We put aside at the beginning of the year a fair amount of money to fund this or something, and so we're using that, so we're probably not going to increase the U.S. this year very, very much. There will be some increase next year. Really to exploit this, we're going to have to expand a gas plant for one thing. So, but it's not a dramatic change in our capital program. A very modest change in the capital program. So you're not going to see, this is not a huge capital program.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Well, you could view it as a map, and you've got these six wells. You want to call it a circle if you can, so when you estimate reserves, you use the, the well data to draw the map. And so what we've done is you can view it as drawing the circle around the six wells, with the well data as the primary guiding light.</p>
          <p>Obviously if you haven't seen the limits of the field yet, you could envision that there might be one or two more locations or some other number beyond that limit.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's pretty easy to do &#x2013; to estimate this year since you've got two actuals and one estimate, so you're pretty clear you're going to be in the higher end of where we are for this year. And as we get near the end of this year, we'll probably revise our outlook for next year on the production.</p>
          <p>We're still &#x2013; you have something that doubles in three months, our ability to forecast where it will exit the year and what it will do next year has got a pretty wide band around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You're basically running &#x2013; you're raising debt and running with cash on your balance sheet. Is that the plan going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the debt was &#x2013; the Dolphin debt, in fact it has to be paid off this month. So there's 600 million of cash that will go out, and 600 million of debt that will go down, so all we did was preraise the money.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as one of the many companies that bid in the Iraqi licensing round about three weeks ago, can you give us your thoughts on the process and can you also tell us if you plan to participate in subsequent rounds in Iraq?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we have said consistently, we do look at opportunities that come along, but we do have financial discipline. I mean, we still like appropriate returns for the risks involved, and being international, clearly California is less risky than being in Iraq so we do expect to get high returns. The group we were in with the best bids for bare field. However, the Iraqis felt that that number was too high for them. So, yes, we will participate in future rounds. We'll also participate in one-on-one negotiations. The consortium we have formed already, and others, but still we must get a good return. So we're not in love, we're just growing volume and I think that's been the history of the company and what's contributed to its success.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions. Steve, my recollection is when you bought Elk Hills part of the theory was that because it hadn't been exploited for a long period of time that there could be deeper horizons that could be productive. And I was just wondering if you think it's a perspective for this discovery that you have in Kern and whether or not you've tested that theory out at Elk Hills yet or plan to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a disadvantage of being around a long time, you remember all the old stories. We think it's prospective at Elk Hills.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Terrific. When do you think you might test that prospectivity out? Would it be this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this year or next year. The lease isn't going away, so it will be there a while, but as we develop &#x2013; as we figure out what's going on, we're redefining &#x2013; we're trying to figure out exactly how it works. I may not work the same in under Elk Hills as it does somewhere else, so we need to do some more work so we can minimize the dry holes if we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question has to do with your thoughts on the North American acquisition market at this point in time. Obviously, oil prices have come back up but there's a number of independents that still have challenging balance sheets and may need to sell the oil reserves to focus on their gas activities. I think in the last couple of quarters, you've said there has been a pretty big mismatch between a bid and ask. I just wondered if you could update us on your thoughts on that market right now, and your interest in it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of it's gas that's available rather than oil, or gas prospects. And we have a fair-sized gas prospect that probably has superior economics to an acquisition. So, it's hard to see buying gas reserves at this point. People's expectations are still quite high. Very little oil available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you will be interested in oil properties if you can find them, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're interested in oil properties if we can find them, and we continue to look for them, and we'll probably buy small amounts regularly.</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Steve, Borden Putnam. I wasn't going to press you on the geology, but everybody else is trying, so I thought I'd throw in kind of an idea. I'm wondering if at Kern County play, based on your limited release information here, is it's primarily a structural fault-mounted track with stacked zones which is why you can't comingle because of different pressure. And if that's true, thinking about the tectonics at Kern County is probably small, but you may have a herd of these over your acreage if you really developed a new model. Is there anything close to reality in those comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, might be. Not a lot of salt around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I realize that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So my guess is there's not a salt zone.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, conventional structure faulting is what I'm thinking, lateral, anyway interesting. I look forward to more detail on that thing as you can disclose it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Sorry for jumping back in. As I was listening to your answers on the other things, it just occurred to me that you're talking nine wells, and six, of course are related to this discovery, but nine additional successes. Can you give us any color as to how we should read into that? Obviously these are outside of this field, so does that mean that we're &#x2013; you've already made additional exploration successes, in which case, can you give any kind of analog as to how we should look at that compared to what you announced last night?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We found some other things obviously in the state. You should expect that we'll continue to find things. If it were material to the business, we would disclose it just like we've disclosed this. So, we have some smaller discoveries, better &#x2013; some good ideas, some leads, if we find something this size, we'll be sure to tell you about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. And my final one is just an update, I guess, there were only two bidders in the Bahrain deep gas round. Any update as to how you expect that to play out, potential time line for getting a conclusion?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The deep gas has been announced. We're one of two in the final list, and so the decision will be made by NOGA over the next several months. All right.</p>
