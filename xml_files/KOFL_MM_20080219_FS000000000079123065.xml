      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We achieved another year of strong top line and bottom line growth in 2007. We generated robust revenues in most, if not almost all, of our franchise territories as a result of record-breaking sales volume for our company. We increased operating income driven by Mexico's improved profitability combined with strong performance for most of our operations in South America. Profitability across all of our markets including Mexico's best quarter of the year expanded our business operating margin from 2007. The sustainable solid incremental growth and diversified cash flow generated by our operations allows to deliver to our investors attractive earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our record breaking sales volume grew 6.7% to 558 million unit cases in the fourth quarter. This growth was driven mainly by a 5.8% volume growth of brand Coca-Cola, which accounted for more than 55% of our incremental volumes during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Brand Coca-Cola continued to expand its volumes through the year driven by our blockbuster launch of the year, Coca-Cola Zero in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. Coca-Cola Zero is the cornerstone of our parity challenge three tier Cola strategy. Coca-Cola Zero is a product with the refreshing taste of Coke Classic without the calories. The successful implementation of our operations, targeted marketing strategies allows to attract new consumers and to drive incremental volume growth across the Cola category last year.</p>
          <p>Flavored sparkling beverage expanded 9.2% across our territories and accounted for more than 30% of our incremental volumes during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The still beverage category, excluding bottled water, continue to demonstrate its offside potential, delivering more than 9% growth. An exemplification of this growth is our juice-based line Hi-C in Central America, which we acquired in 2005 from individual investors. Our volume for Hi-C has grown significantly since then. The secret to our success has been our focus on what we do best; revenue and portfolio management, distribution and winning point-of-sale execution.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues rose to 18 billion pesos, the equivalent of $1.7 billion, up almost 9% year-over-year and rose 8% to 69 billion pesos or growth to $6.3 billion for the full year. During the full year, our consolidated operating income include almost 12% to 11.4 billion pesos or more than $1 billion and our consolidated EBITDA reached 14 billion pesos, $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our majority net income for the year increased 30.5% to 7 billion pesos or $632 million resulting in earnings per share of 3.74 Mexican pesos or the equivalent of U.S. $0.34 per share. Our continuous effort to generate strong consolidated cash flow in 2007 paid off. It will enable us to finance our share in the joint acquisition of Jugos del Valle with the Coca-Cola Company and to significantly reduce our total bad debt by approximately $345 million in the year.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is stronger than ever with one of the highest credit ratings among Latin American companies in our industry.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit increased 10% for 2007, increasing our gross margin by 90 basis points year-over-year despite a volatile raw material environment. Normal prices of sugar in the second half of the year combined with lower PET cost, PET light-weighting initiatives, and the appreciation of the Brazilian and Colombian currencies as applied to our dollar-dominated raw materials on those countries more than compensated for the higher cost of fructose in Mexico and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Now, let me expand on our operations.  Our Brazilian operation has been the one with the most consistent performance during the last two years, with more than double-digit top line growth and solid bottom line growth for the year.  This quarter was the best quarter for Brazil.  Much like in the rest of the year, we were able to deliver strong results, strong volume growth combined with benefits of capturing profitable volume, thanks to multi-segmentation strategies and lower raw material cost.  Excluding beer, our volume rose 14% in the fourth quarter, the largest growth recorded in over two years.   Brand Coca-Cola accounted for over 65% of the growth, driven mainly by the spectacular performance of Coca-Cola Zero.</p>
          <p>In the flavored sparkling beverage segment, we posted over 15% volume growth, made by the successful launch of Aquarius Fresh, a low calorie, lightly carbonated flavored water and the Fanta brand driven by the innovation in packaging and a flavor extension.</p>
          <p>The still beverages segment grew more than 40%.  This growth was mainly driven by the successful penetration into new categories including Minute Maid Mais and juice-based product Aquarius still flavored water; Nestea and <mark type="inaudible" /> chocolate, a milk-based product.</p>
          <p>On the beer segment, our business continued &#x2013; as I had previously mentioned, our short-term goal is to continue to strengthen brand equity for Kaiser, build up brand equity for Sol and recapture our customers in the market. Growing at a higher base than the market leader confirms that our initiatives are working.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, we post a 630 basis point expansion in our growth market, driven by revenue growth minus net initiatives and higher efficiency in managing cost.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, we recorded 40% growth in operating income, our largest growth in a single quarter in more than two years.  We achieved an EBITDA margin of 21.3%, the highest EBITDA margin recorded in Brazil since we acquired the franchise in 2003.  The dynamics of the Brazilian market combined with our redesigned and enhanced go-to-market strategy and improved execution will continue delivering sustainable profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our Central American operations, we post volume growth of almost 4%, that was partially offset by a 2.8% decline in average prices per unit case, during the fourth quarter.  This decline was mainly driven by increased multi-serve presentations volume and growth of the value protection brand, Frescolita, which carries a lower price per unit case.  Brand Coca-Cola and flavored sparkling beverages accounted for more than 75% of our operations incremental volume. In the still beverage category, volume grew more than 10%, mainly driven by strong growth of <mark type="inaudible" /> our juice-based product line.</p>
          <p>Our Central American operations, total revenues increased close to 1% lapping at 12.3% volume growth in the same quarter last year.  For the full year, these operations' total revenues reached almost 5 billion pesos, a 5.5% increase compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, our fourth quarter operating income increased almost 10% to 205 million pesos, due to lower operating expenses.  Consequently our operating margins expanded 130 basis points.  For the full year, our operating income posted a double-digit increase of 11.5% to 750 million almost $65 million and generated an operating margin expansion of 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our Argentine operations, volume grew 14% for the fourth quarter.  The majority of these operations incremental volume came from the sparkling beverages supported by successful launch of Coca-Cola Zero.  Brand Coca-Cola accounted for more than 60% of our operations incremental volume. Flavored sparkling beverages driven by Fanta accounted for the rest.</p>
          <p>Also, we grew our sparkling beverage business by 14% in the year.  A favorable shift in our product mix toward non-returnable presentations combined with some price increases contributed in better pricing per unit case for the quarter.  However, Argentina continues to be the territory with the lowest price per unit case among other territories.</p>
          <p>Our double-digit top line growth was partially offset by higher sweetener and labor costs, resulting in 13.5% growth in operating income.  The fourth quarter seasonality of this operation helped to drive higher fixed cost absorption.  For the full year, operating income reached 1,292 million pesos growing 11.3%.</p>
          <p>Moving to Venezuela, we achieved 14% growth in sales volume for the fourth quarter.  Our redefined portfolio combined with the strong local consumption, led to more than 18% growth in the sparkling beverages' segment for the quarter.  Flavored sparkling beverages driven by Hit accounted for more than 70% of the growth with brand Coca-Cola accounting for the balance.</p>
          <p>Top-line growth combined with lower PET cost and higher operating efficiencies delivered favorable results.  Our manufacturing efficiencies, SKU rationalization strategies and our ability to supply the market with more of our core products on top of our successful multi segmentation strategy allows us to increase our year-over-year profitability from a very low base.  The operating income margins for Venezuela continued to be the lowest amongst our territories.</p>
          <p>Our Colombian operation's top-line declined 3% to 1.8 billion pesos during the fourth quarter.  Our total sales volume decreased 1.9%, mainly due to difficult comparable of 12% volume growth in the fourth quarter of last year.  The average price per unit case declined 1.2% in the fourth quarter, however for the full year increased sales volume and high average price per unit case equally contributed to a 7% increase in total revenues.  In the first half of the year, we deployed revenue management initiatives in anticipation of the entrance of our beer brand beverage producer.</p>
          <p>In the second half, we started to face a more intense competitive environment.  However, our marketing investment and revenue management strategies should help us to continue reaching our profitability.  At the gross profit level, our Colombian operations post double digit growth, achieving a gross margin expansion of 640 basis points in the fourth quarter.  Lower sweetener cost and operating efficiencies combined with a strong appreciation of the Colombian pesos as applied to our U.S. dollar denominated PET cost generated about 10% growth in gross profit.  For 2007, our gross margin expanded 500 basis points.</p>
          <p>Operating income for our Colombian operation declined 6.6% in the fourth quarter to 310 million pesos compared with the same period of last year.  This decline was driven by increases in marketing expenses to reinvigorate our plants, higher breakage cost to sustain the returnable rates which are in the market, and incremental expenses for the maintenance of our distribution fleet.  For the full year, Colombia's operating income expanded more than 39% to 1,242 million pesos with an operating margin expansion of 1,210 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our Mexican operations continue to improve the profitability by posting their best quarter of the year.  Total sales volume grew 3.7% during the fourth quarter, driven by our sparkling beverage and bulk water volumes.  We achieved 2.6% volume growth in the sparkling beverage category with brand Coca-Cola up 3.6% supported by the growth of Coca-Cola Zero.  Average prices per unit case increased almost 1% during the fourth quarter, mainly driven by price increases for sparkling beverages.  Excluding bulk water, the average price increased 1.1% in real terms, or close to 5% in nominal terms.</p>
          <p>During the year, we were almost able to keep prices in line with inflation.  The pricing environment in Mexico is becoming more rational.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2008, we perceive an industry focused on profitability that, to our correct revenue management and multi-segmentation strategies, should allow us to continue this trend.  Total revenues for the quarter increased 4.4% to 8.1 billion pesos as compared to the same quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>At the gross profit level, our Mexican operations achieved a gross margin expansion of 60 basis points to 53.8% of total revenues for the quarter.  This increase was driven by our light-weighting initiatives which lowered PET costs year-over-year and more than compensated for higher sweetener cost.</p>
          <p>Gross profit was 4.4 billion pesos for the quarter, an increase of more than 5%.  For the full year, gross profit reached 17 billion pesos, an increase of almost 2%.  It is important to highlight that in the first half of 2007, our Mexican operations faced a tough cost of sweetener environment which eventually become more favorable towards the end of the year.  Additionally, it was able to offset higher concentrate cost during the year.</p>
          <p>Our Mexican territories delivered 3.7% increase in operating income during the fourth quarter.  This increase was driven mainly by top-line growth but we managed to trickle down to the bottom-line by maintaining our cost on expenses in line with last year, resulting in operating margin in line with the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>But now let me walk you through our financial performance for the quarter.  Our financial performance continued to reinforce our strong balance sheet and well-balanced capital structure.  Operations outside of Mexico delivered almost half of our EBITDA underscoring our geographically balanced stream of cash flow.</p>
          <p>Consolidated EBITDA reached 3.9 billion pesos or $360 million in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, our EBITDA rose to 14.4 billion pesos or equivalent of more than $1.3 billion.  Approximately 50% of our total debt is denominated in local currency, mostly Mexican pesos and more than 65% of our total debt carries a fixed rate of interest.</p>
          <p>As of December 2007, our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio average was below 0.8 times, total net debt decreased approximately $345 million compared with year-end 2006.  This debt reduction includes a $201 million that we invested in this Jugos del Valle acquisition, net of reimbursements received from other Coca-Cola bottlers as of December 2007.</p>
          <p>As you know, in November 2007, Coca-Cola FEMSA and The Coca-Cola Company successfully concluded the tender offer to acquire Jugos del Valle, one of the leading juice producers in Mexico and Brazil, our new joint venture company, with all the necessary approval from the Mexican authorities.  This acquisition will advance our multi category strategy and make us the largest producer of still beverage in the region, considerably increasing our company's position in Latin America's fast-growing underdeveloped juice based beverage segment.</p>
          <p>We are proud to announce that we had begun to distribute Jugos del Valle's products in some of our Mexican territories in the past few weeks.  Even we took control of the company, we began implementing revenue management strategies, which in our operational experience is key for creating value.  Most of the Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico are already part of this venture with a few to follow.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect to significantly develop this category across our territories.  This is a great opportunity for us to deliver our clients and customers a more complete and balanced portfolio as well as a great result for our company.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our strategy of growing through acquisitions in 2007, we also announced an agreement to acquire The Coca-Cola Company's REMIL franchise in Brazil.  We are in the final phase of this process and expect to close this transaction very soon.</p>
          <p>Our Brazilian operations are already delivering extraordinary results and with the consolidation of this new franchise, we will achieve scale and total critical mass in one of the most dynamic markets in the world.  We are eager to implement our will and execution model in the traditional franchise, enrich the profitability levels of the rest of our Brazilian operations.</p>
          <p>This was a great year for our company.  Every single one of our operations continued to progress in their individual ever changing market environments.  We are very excited about the challenges that lie ahead in 2008 and we believe that we are better positioned and with more knowledge of our market dynamics to deliver another year of growth and attractive returns to our shareholders and investors.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued trust and support and now I would like to open the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" />.  And our first question comes from the line of Tufic Salem from Credit Suisse.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning everyone.  Congratulations for the results.  My question is regarding the Mexican operations.  I want to get a better sense from you on the top-line, in terms of pricing, if you can give us a better sense of how much is the actual price increase and how much is from a mix change in the quarter?  And also, if you can please give us a better feeling about your experience in these price increases, how the competition followed?  I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how this volume increase ties in with this, what appears to be a softening macro backdrop here in Mexico.  So maybe you can give us a better idea about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Tufic. I think that some of the key elements during this past year is that when you look at the very aggressive pricing environment that we saw during 2006, especially with, when Pepsi-Cola was launching the three-liter presentation at very aggressive prices, we had mentioned in the past, basically pricing at the same price point as Big Cola.  But we were suffering on that pricing front, on the pricing front in 2006.  Then the first half of 2007, we started to see a lot of pressure on raw materials and when you look at some of the profitability that has been achieved by some of the other companies including Big Cola that tried to do it, on some financing bonds in Mexico and therefore, they did some filing of some of the information. You see that the profitability will suffer a lot and that they were basically breaking even now.</p>
          <p>So with that in mind, we basically started to increase some of the prices or strategic prices of some of our products, basically the large presentation that was returnable, the large returnable presentation that we have that that clearly opened up the space to some of the competitors to increase their prices and improve a little bit their profitability and also in the 600 milliliter presentation, which is one of the largest volume presentations for us.</p>
          <p>And the reaction of the competitor was basically to immediately increase prices also with the exception of Jarritos; that continues with the same price point on their two-liter presentation.  They have not increased their prices and, but the rest of the competitors have followed suit.</p>
          <p>So my feeling a little bit here, Tufic, is that during 2008, we will continue to have that trend of course, doing some strategic price increases and some of the competitors following with those price increases after we increase. So if you ask me for 2008 which I think is basically the core of your question, I do believe that we will be able to increase prices with inflation during 2008 and that the competitors will continue to follow this price point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks and in the context of what seems to be a softer consumer environment, do you, you know, in your experience in raising these prices last year and as you look into 2008, do you feel that you don't expect a very big impact in terms of the volume performance given the softer macro backdrop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we haven't seen a lot of reaction in the marketplace towards these moves about, you know, the recession in the U.S. Obviously, it's been &#x2013; a lower growth in the U.S. economy will impact Mexico's, no doubt about it.  But I think that the industry where we are, it's a little bit more isolated from this impact. I will say that we will continue seeing what we traditionally call CSDs or the so-called now sparkling industry growing below single-digit numbers and with very important growth in the new categories where I do see double-digit growth.  So, I think, that we will continue to have good growth for this year.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone, well, congrats on the results.  Just in terms of what you expect in an offset in terms of we discussed that before in terms of the cost environment and I know HFCS is up even though, you know, you had some positives in Brazil from the currency as you explained in your prepared comments.  Can you elaborate on sugar and sweetener costs in general in Mexico?  I was curious to know where the balance will be, what you expect for 2008.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>And also on the Venezuela situation, I know it's very political, but just as the situation sort of changed just last week, if you can elaborate a little bit more on that as well.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrea.  I think that in general what we have been seeing with respect to sweeteners, we have seen some reduction in the pricing.  The one component of sweeteners that were behaving differently in the second part of last year was high fructose, where we saw some increases, mainly in the market where we use high fructose, which is Mexico and Argentina.</p>
          <p>The rest of the cost of sugar has been experiencing some reduction and obviously we are, we have been using less and less high fructose in, especially in market where we have less flexibility, like in Mexico.  The importance of high fructose in our mix is reducing of those continues to be the most used sweetener for us. In terms of 2008, we believe that we will continue to see this reduction in prices of sweeteners.  Basically, the decline that we have seen recently is somewhere around 10% decline versus what we had in the beginning of last year.</p>
          <p>With respect to PET, we have a little bit the reverse.  During 2007, we've seen some reductions in PET and lately, we have seen some small increases, basically around the 5% level versus what we had over the middle of or end of 2007 and I think that's basically the environment that we will have with respect to some of these raw materials for 2008.</p>
          <p>With respect to Venezuela, we have this problem that has been for quite some time with us, we have a <mark type="inaudible" /> in that front. It's basically in relations to some ex-distributors or ex-confectioners that some of them were in our opinion, legally indemnified, some of them more than 25 years ago, actually when we bought a Pepsi bottling operation. And we have won in every single instance in court for what they are claiming, that they feel that they were not appropriately indemnified at that time. And they have the support of basically a couple of Congress people.  We have the support from the authorities and the government, and at the end of the day, basically the result of this one-week closing of some of our facilities is that close to 30% of our operation was closed for one week.</p>
          <p>And that we are back again to the same negotiations, negotiation table that we shared, where we are trying to negotiate not the compensation that they are claiming, but basically some additional benefit that we can have with these people that used to work for the company long time ago and that they might need some additional medical expense or something like that.  That's basically what we're to the table with more solidarity kind of funding small programs for medical purposes rather than going through all these complicated schemes of looking for a different indemnification of what has already been settled importantly. And then we are back to normal and I think that the negotiations table should continue working and we hope that with no problem in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, H&#xE9;ctor, but can you give us an idea of how much, how many people would be involved and how much would be the expense if you go ahead and decide to pay as you correct &#x2013; I mean you pointed out. So the &#x2013; being as a token to get this situation over how much would be, obviously wouldn't be the $500 million, but you know give us a sense of how much would be the provision for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrea, in some of the claims that they presented to the press, they say that they are looking for an indemnification for a period somewhere around $500 million which is totally out of any reasonable calculation.  Our, the resources that we have been offering to move these negotiation table somewhere in the order of 3 to $4 million for some form to cover as I mentioned some of the medical expenses.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned it's more of a solidarity issues with these guys that used to work for this company long time ago, but never going to the computation of indemnification according to law because that has already been clear and paid and every single instances that we have won is an agreement that indemnification was correct at that point in time in the past.</p>

          <p>Reinaldo yes, if you look at the numbers of the year 2007, basically if we isolate the acquisition of Jugos del Valle, which I mentioned was around $200 million to you <mark type="inaudible" /> of December, we basically generated around $500 million of resources after CapEx, after taxes, after interest and <mark type="inaudible" /> that in theory should be you know like the cash flow that was available to repay debt and acquisitions.  We happened to acquire Jugos del Valle and that's why we used this $200 million.  Next year we have a CapEx figure that will be a little bit larger.  2007 was around $250 million, next year we will be looking somewhere around $400 million in CapEx.  And we are planning basically to form REMIL with the cash balances that we have now.  In that instances we will have the cash balance as of December and we will use that cash balance as soon as we close the transaction and we will use our cash balances but we will not incur additional debt for the acquisition of REMIL.  I feel that with that I have answered most of the questions.</p>

          <p>We are very close, Reinaldo I think that it should not take more than 30 days from this date.  We are working some of the documentation. As you know we have an agreement on the price.  We've have an agreement on how contingencies are going to be handled and everything.  It's just basically the implementation process that is taking a little bit more time than anticipated.  But as we just start to write the agreement <mark type="inaudible" /> but my expectation is in the next 30 days.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning everybody.  Good morning, H&#xE9;ctor and congratulations on the quarter.  With the exception of Central America, every territory saw an increase in selling expenses that led revenues and I suspect that part of that was Zero but I was curious if there was anything else and what you expected in terms of selling expenses per territories in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is different in each territory, Robert, but let me give you one thing that was common to most of the territories that we have some extraordinary adjustment especially when you look at the fourth quarter that has to do with &#x2013; remember that we had variable compensation for the executives that is based on economic value added and certainly most of the, or all the operations are growing some of them strongly above the expectations that we have in the year for example in the case of Colombia.  Some of them in line with what we were expecting that was basically the case of Mexico and that <mark type="inaudible" /> the need to do a provision during the fourth quarter for this extraordinary variable compensation that will be given to the executives given the performance for the year. That is because of price and some of the provisions were that we were improving quarter-by-quarter the operations continue to improve on a faster pace than what we were anticipating.</p>
          <p>In some of the operations we have probably most important than this first issue is some additional marketing expense. That was especially the case in Colombia during this fourth quarter. And that had to do with presence of a new big brand competitor reaction from <mark type="inaudible" /> lowering the price of our very important presentation for them and on the marketing activity that had to be performed in the fourth quarter.  Still there is a &#x2013; when you look at the numbers for the full year I think that that also compares with the very important performance of the Colombian market during the full year.  In some other cases, we have and that was also true for example in Colombia additional introduction of returnable bottles and cleaning up some of the what we call this sparkling or cleaning up some of the old bottles so that we have a better presentation to our consumers and reinforcing the presence of returnable as the way of competing when you have big brands competing with us in the marketplace.  So I think that those are the main, the main characteristics that we see in the SG&amp;A line in some of the territories, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, H&#xE9;ctor, just to get it straight in terms of what's recurring and non-recurring, I mean, I would have anticipated part of this to be a big increase in advertising to support the launch of Zero instead of franchise territories but it sounds like it's not necessarily, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it's not necessary.  I think that a lot of these increases are non-recurring.  In the marketing side, we will continue to have a little bit more of marketing strategy in some areas like Colombia.  But, I think that the majority of these are a one-time effect during the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with respect to the light-weighting initiative that you had, particularly in Mexico, and I think it was the 600 milliliter presentation that you light weighted by about 18%, can you give us the timing of that net increase because that was extraordinary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The light weighting, as you correctly pointed out, was basically in the 600 ml and has to do with a total redesign of the bottle including using a shorter cap that also saved us in the plastic content of the cap.  We are testing some of the larger presentations and obviously, every time we change the design of the bottle The Coca-Cola Company does an extensive analysis of the quality of the product so that that is maintained.  And as you can probably guess, it has to do a lot with preserving the carbonization and the rotation that you have with the product at the point of sale so that the shelf life is appropriate.  The 600 ml, I think that it was introduced basically in the first quarter, I want to &#x2013; it was at the beginning of the year, Bob, I don't remember exactly the date. And I think that we will have some additional light-weighting during this year in the higher and the larger presentations and we are trying to replicate that in every market. Obviously, when you go to rural markets The Coca-Cola Company is not as comfortable with the light-weighting immediately because of transportation, the temperature and the longer time that the product stays on the shelf.  We have to balance out those equations but this has been a very important initiative for us in the past year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, H&#xE9;ctor.  A question for you in terms of the volume outlook for 2008, and I know you don't like to give specific volume forecast, but can you talk a little bit about Coke Zero?  If I am not mistaken, you launched it around a year ago in Mexico and as you go through the different countries, particularly Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, it seems like it was an awfully important contributor to the strong volumes in 2007.  So if you look at 2008, how much do you think that the operators can build on the momentum of the brand in 2007 or do you think we should see slower volume growth as you lap the launch in the different markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lore, good morning.  I think that again, we have different cases for different &#x2013; on the three countries where we launched Coca-Cola Zero.  In Brazil, Argentina, it continues to be a very important element of where on the volume growth and you see a trend that continues to increase month-over-month.  In Mexico, we are in the process of re-launching as we speak.  Basically I believe that two or three days ago was the re-launching of Coca-Cola Zero. We have an issue with some of the elements in the formula that are there politicians in Mexico who are not very happy with that, because it's not proven to use in most of Europe, the formula that is being used in Europe or in the U.S. it is not approved.  So we've changed the formula, we are in the process of re-launching, but what you see is that Coca Cola Zero has had a tremendous positive impact during the first part of the year when we launched it, and it was reducing its importance because of the negative pricing pattern and The Coca-Cola Company together with the bottlers decided to do a full re-launching of this product.</p>
          <p>It's too early to say the impact of the re-launching process, as I mentioned it was re-launched at the beginning of this week, but there are a lot of marketing dollars being behind this campaign.  We are using a different formula than is used in different part of the world. <mark type="inaudible" /> or something like that.  It's not the U.S. formula, it's a different formula. The authorities in Mexico were convinced that the element was not harmful, but they didn't like is the bad publicity that was being run by some in the media, over the Internet and the newspapers and it got very negative press in Mexico.  So with that said, I think that it would be very achievable, Lore, to get as I mentioned some low single digit growth in CSDs during 2008 in Mexico and the rest of the continent and with most of the most of the larger growth in terms of percentage wise coming from the introduction of new products and the successful launching of Jugos del Valle in our platform.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an idea, in some of the territories in <mark type="inaudible" /> that was the first one to &#x2013; where we were carrying Jugos del Valle in some of our trucks as we successfully discontinued it, most of the distributors that were handling Jugos del Valle from the previous or the previous owners.  In three days we basically sold what the guys in <mark type="inaudible" /> were expecting to sell in one month.  Obviously that have to do with all the filling the pipeline and the trade and it still is too early to know what is the impact of this will be but what I am trying to convey is that I think that we have a very big area of opportunity with juices and juice-based products that is new for the company and that we have for the first time this year.  We are launching some experiments we have made in the past but this is &#x2013; I think that this is different this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect and just a second question. In Colombia, you've talked about how 2007 played out, you priced at the beginning of the year and then the market, as you anticipated, changed during the course of 2007 and we saw a good year in Colombia last year but obviously not a strong finish to the year.  Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for Colombia in 2008, how do you see the competitive and pricing environment as you start the year and how you see it evolving?  I know the volumes were negative in the fourth quarter and they were off a difficult comp but I would have thought the entrance of a low price player would grow the whole market and that wouldn't affect you necessarily as much as in a market that would be growing less, for instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that you correctly described the outlook for 2007, now we have a very good year overall but certainly the quarter was not very, the fourth quarter was not very positive in that sense.  We have this distortion created in the SG&amp;A line with what I explained a few minutes ago about some additional performances for executives and things like that but in the competitive environment what is what we have.</p>
          <p>We have a new competitor that delay a lot their entrance because of regulations in their factory, in their plant.  They launched the product but to our surprise postponed &#x2013; they launched the product at a price that we were comfortable with because we have increased prices at the end of 2006 and beginning of 2007.  We shared a platform and we have always said not the same &#x2013; I mean, if we are going to have a lowering prices is better to have it at a higher price than at a lower price.  So we said the environment to have this were at a higher price and Big Cola started with a comfortable price for us. As a matter of fact, the price differential was not close to what we have in Mexico or some other package.</p>
          <p>But to our surprise, first of all, we acted very aggressively with one product, I don't know if it was a three liter or three point something liter, three and a quarter I believe, at a very aggressive price, under pricing Big Cola and that has created a lot of tension in the market, in the competitive environment.  We have gone through a lot of marketing expenses and promotional activity to support our price, I do see that activity continuing at the beginning of 2008. And therefore Colombia is &#x2013; I think that we'll continue to post good results. But the comparison versus the previous year will not be as favorable because of this competitive environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see any possibility of taking any pricing in 2008, or will 2008 be a year where you just protect your current price point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be more of a rotation of the current prices, Lore.  Colombia has an inflation that is higher than what we have in some of the other countries, so I think it will be difficult to fully pass prices with inflation in Colombia this year.</p>

          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Alex Robarts from Santander.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody.  Thanks, yeah.  I wanted just to start off on the Mexico pricing issue, I mean you give us some confidence, or you seem to say, H&#xE9;ctor, that Mexico, this year the average pricing seems or can possibly get inflation, or in line with inflation. I mean that would a big achievement, I mean, looking at the last four or five years and I guess my thought is when you look at the bulk waters growing at five times the rate of CSDs, it looks like Jarritos has not increased pricing, in line with your increases.  And then you have this three-liter, kind of, pilot launch which I guess on an average selling case &#x2013; price per case basis will have an impact at some point.  I mean what makes you feel confident about getting inflation this year in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex, good morning.  Obviously, we have to get used to this idea of having bottled water in the territories where we have that, which is basically Mexico.  Bottled water it's a reality here, we are growing the business, it is an important element for us to defend our industry. It's a very offensive -- for us it is an offensive strategy, also. And we believe that our competitors get a lot of their profitability from the bottled water category and I think that it is important that we compete in that area and not to leave our competitors alone in that category.</p>
          <p>Having said that, as bottled water grows, certainly the price per unit case compare &#x2013; when you compare that, it's a different story from CSDs or juices.  What I am saying, that I see a positive environment, is that when you look at the financial results of PBG, when you look at the financial results of <mark type="inaudible" />, you see that they are basically breaking even, or just making a very, very small profit, Alex.</p>
          <p>I do see some pressure on them to get additional profitability.  And that's why we were &#x2013; I think that, correctly, in differing in price increases that we saw in CSDs during 2007. And that's why we were immediately followed by these competitors. Because we should remember that the raw material environment is very different from what we had a few years ago and you are correct when you said that we have had a very difficult price environment over the last three or four years.  But also the raw material environment has changed and has put a lot of pressure on these competitors.</p>
          <p>So on one side, we have water that will certainly affect the average price per unit case when you look at the total cases and total revenues, no doubt about it. But when you isolate that effect of water, I see that we have a positive environment in Mexico for us to strategically improve the prices of some price points in certain packages, and for other competitors to follow that.</p>
          <p>And the third, I mean here, Alex, is all these new categories that we are just starting to develop, that in a way bring a new formula again or a new equation to this pricing formula which are unit based problems, <mark type="inaudible" /> and all of that, that we have been very successful over a very small base and obviously those folks have the opposite of bottled water, they have a higher price per unit case than the CSDs.</p>
          <p>So it's very difficult to look just at the &#x2013; and to predict what the outcome of the revenues divided by cases will be &#x2013; or the price per unit case.  But when we speak about the strategic statements that we have, I think that we have a very positive environment in CSDs because of the reasons I explained about the raw material pressure, the profitability, the lack of profitability to some of our competitors we have these new environment of juices and juiced-based products.  For example, as long &#x2013; as soon as we took over Jugos del Valle, we have increased the prices 10% in most of the portfolio in Jugos del Valle.</p>
          <p>So that certainly will have a very positive effect on us and that was followed by good mix, also.  So I think that we are in a new environment, Alex, that maybe it's going to be very difficult to analyze just on a revenue per total unit case.  We will have to dissect a little bit more of this.  We will make some when we look at the prices going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. And, just to confirm, the three-liter launch that you did in 2007 in CSD; I mean, is that tactical? And maybe a response in certain lower socioeconomic areas to demand? Or could the three-liter in CSD become something a little bit more relevant in your product portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a very tactical presentation that I think that has been good for us, Alex, because one reason, we are selling three liters in the low socioeconomic areas of Mexico City. And also in different areas including high socioeconomic areas when we go, like, places like <mark type="inaudible" /> when you got all this <mark type="inaudible" />.  But the important element here is that we are selling that presentation at 20 pesos, which is a very different economic proposal for the company than what you have with Pepsi or Coca-Cola, 30 pesos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just the second and last thing is going back on the sweetener.  You gave us a nice overview of Mexico and Venezuela and I wanted to ask about sugar in Brazil.  The gross margin expansion clearly being very -- very significant in the fourth quarter in Brazil, as well as in the full year.  I mean, what was your average sugar cost decline in 2007 versus '06?  And where, or, kind of, what's your initial sense of where sugar prices could be, on average in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll explain &#x2013; in -- during 2007 the prices for us Brazil were probably &#x2013; I would say around 20% below what we had in 2006, around that level.  And we are starting to see when you look at &#x2013; if you look at the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter 2006, we are seeing a small increment around 5%. But when you look at the full year 2007 versus 2006, we are seeing important reductions, I'll say, 18 to 20% reductions in sweeteners in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Alex, we will benefit the first half of 2008 from lower cost of sugar because if you remember we lowered prices in '06, for the fourth quarter of '06 and the first half of '07.  So, the benefit in gross margins you already start see that in the third quarter '07, in the fourth quarter of '07 that we showed today.  So, we will still be looking at significant benefits from that in the first half of '08 in Brazil.</p>
