          <p>Good morning. My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners first quarter 2011 earnings conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>Randy Burkhalter, you may begin the conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners and Duncan Energy Partners joint conference call to discuss first quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Mike Creel, President and CEO of Enterprise's General Partner, followed by Jim Teague, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and then Randy Fowler, Executive Vice President and CFO of the General Partner of Enterprise and President and CEO of the General Partner of Duncan Energy Partners. Also in attendance today are other members of our senior management team.</p>
          <p>During this call, we will make forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management of both Enterprise and Duncan.</p>
          <p>Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Creel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Randy. Before we get started today, I'd like to remind everyone that the purpose of this call is to discuss first quarter results, and so we won't be discussing the proposed Enterprise Partners Duncan Energy Partners merger, and we will not entertain any questions regarding the proposed merger.</p>
          <p>We're off to a good start in 2011 with record net income, adjusted EDITDA, and distributable cash flow this quarter attributable to higher natural gas and NGL pipeline transportation volumes, record NGL fractionation and fee-based processing volumes, and strong equity NGL production. Our diversified integrated system continues to benefit from increased demands for NGLs as reflected in higher pipeline throughput and improved sales margins.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the quarter increased 9% to $875 million from $806 million in the first quarter of 2010 with the NGL pipeline and services onshore natural gas pipeline and services and onshore crude oil pipeline and services segments each reporting improved results. This led to record adjusted EBITDA of $890 million and record net income of $435 million.</p>
          <p>Our partnership generated record distributable cash flow of $694 million this quarter, which provides 1.4 times coverage of the increased cash distribution of $0.5975 per unit with respect to the quarter. We retained $207 million of distributable cash flow this quarter, which is available to help fund our growth capital projects. The largest improvements for the quarter came from our NGL pipeline and services segment, which reported gross operating margin of $504 million, a 15% increase from the $437 million reported in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our natural gas processing and related NGL marketing business benefited from an improved demand for NGLs as higher NGL sales margins and volumes led to an $18 million increase in gross operating margin. Our Rocky Mountain plant contributed $6 million to the quarter-to-quarter increase primarily due to higher fee-based processing volumes. We also had a significant increase in fee-based processing volumes in Texas primarily from gas production from the Eagle Ford.</p>
          <p>Our NGL pipeline and storage business had a 20% increase in gross operating margin this quarter compared with the first quarter of last year primarily due to the mid-America pipeline, which had increased longhaul movements at higher tariff rates that went into effect last July. We also had higher gross operating margin from our NGL terminals in our South Texas and Lou-Tex NGL pipeline systems. In addition, we escorted 10.2 million barrels of propane for the quarter, a 34% increase over the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Production of NGLs in the Rockies continues to be strong with new gas processing plants expected to extract an additional 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of natural gas liquids by 2014 from major basins in Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico. To meet this expected volume increase, last week we announced a planned expansion of the Rocky Mountain portion of our mid-America pipeline system. This project will include looping the existing pipeline with up to 290 miles of 16-inch pipe and adding more pump station capacity.</p>
          <p>Shippers executed 10 year firm shipper paid transportation agreements with a total initial commitment of 38,500 barrels a day that may ultimately increase to 85,000 barrels per day. Subject to certain regulatory approvals, we expect this expansion to begin service in the third quarter of 2014.</p>
          <p>Our NGL fractionation business reported record gross operating margin of $46 million, a 70% increase over the $27 million reported in the first quarter of 2010. This increase was largely attributable to our new frac 4 unit at the Mont Belvieu complex, which began commercial operations during the fourth quarter of last year. The new facility is running at full capacity with rates greater than 80,000 barrels a day.</p>
          <p>Due to strong petrochemical demand for NGLs, we currently are constructing a fifth fractionation unit at Mont Belvieu, also with an expected capacity of over 80,000 barrels a day that we expect to be full when it begins operations in the fourth quarter this year. With our recent acquisition of an additional 1,200 acres at our Mont Belvieu complex, we have plenty of room to build additional fractionation capacity as needed.</p>
          <p>Our Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines &amp; Services segment reported a $29 million or 22% increase in gross operating margin on transportation volumes of 11.7 trillion BTUs per day, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2010. $15 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase was from the State Line and Fairplay natural gas gathering systems we acquired in the second quarter of 2010. Higher capacity revenues earned in South Texas on our Texas Intrastate system and improved natural gas marketing margins accounted for $15 million of the increase.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin for the Offshore Crude Oil Pipelines &amp; Services segment increased $5 million or 19% over the first quarter of 2010 primarily from crude oil marketing, which benefited from improved crude differentials and volume growth on the Red River, West Texas, and South Texas pipelines. Our South Texas pipelines benefited from increased crude oil production from the Eagle Ford, and the Seaway pipeline had a 13% decrease in net throughput.</p>
          <p>We recently announced our intention to form a joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners to construct a crude oil pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Houston. This pipeline would give producers greater access to the Gulf Coast refining markets and provide an outlet for more than 400,000 barrels a day of crude oil supplies, which currently are stranded at the Cushing hub and priced at a substantial discount to imported crude oil on the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>The project also includes approximately 500,000 barrels of crude oil storage capacity to be added at our new ECHO terminal in South-East Houston. We're continuing to work with producers to secure support for the proposed pipeline.</p>
          <p>Our Offshore Pipelines &amp; Services segment had a $20 million decrease in gross operating margin this quarter from the first quarter of 2010 due in large part to lower exploration and development activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The first quarter of last year included $9 million of insurance-related gains. Naturally-occurring production declines has not been offset by new drilling, and until replacement wells are drilled volumes are expected to remain below prior year levels. While the federal government has resumed issuing deepwater permits, progress has been slow.</p>
          <p>Gross operating margin from the Petrochemical &amp; Refined Product Services segment was $112 million this quarter compared to $120 million for the same quarter last year. The Refined Products Pipeline business had a $31 million decrease in gross operating margin primarily due to an estimated $14 million decline as a result of lower revenues and higher expenses related to repairs of the segment of our products pipeline system in New York.</p>
          <p>Other decreases on our Refined Products Pipelines include approximately $10 million from lower transportation volumes originating on the Gulf Coast for delivery to Midwest markets and $5 million from higher maintenance and pipeline integrity expenses.</p>
          <p>The propylene fractionation business had a $6 million increase in gross operating margin to $52 million as lower operating expenses more than offset the effect of decreased fractionation and pipeline volumes due to refinery outages. The remaining businesses in the Petrochemical &amp; Refined Products Services segment reported increased gross operating margin this quarter compared to the first quarter last year with the largest improvement coming from the butane isomerization business, which reported an $11 million increase due to increased sales of by-products and higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Based on our continued strong performance and record distributable cash flow, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash distribution to $0.5975 per unit or $2.39 on an annualized basis. This is a 5.3% increase over the distribution declared with respect to the first quarter of 2010, and it's our 27th consecutive quarterly distribution increase and our 36th increase since our IPO in July of 1998.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with our results for the quarter. I want to recognize our employees for their efforts. Across all of our departments from Commercial, Engineering and Operations, to Accounting, Finance, Legal and all of our other administrative and support groups, we have an incredibly talented and dedicated team. With this team and our diversified and well-positioned asset base, we believe we should be able to continue to build value for our investors.</p>
          <p>Our goal, as always, is to be the provider of choice for customers seeking the best in a full spectrum of economic and dependable mid-stream energy services, and we continue to put capital to work to serve them.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Let's talk about opportunities to serve our customers, both producers and consumers, and that's what motivates us at Enterprise.</p>
          <p>Opportunity is normal butane today to RBOB at $1.20 a gallon. Opportunity is ethane in Conway at over $0.20 a gallon below Mont Belvieu &#x2013; we've seen it at $0.25 &#x2013; and the Y-grade barrel at $0.15 to $0.20 a gallon off of Mont Belvieu.</p>
          <p>Opportunity is $1.00 a gallon gas processing margins. Opportunity is LLS selling to WTI at $14 over. Opportunity is natural gas below 30% accrued on a BTU basis or propylene approaching $1 a pound. Opportunity is growing production driven by shale gas and expanding demand driven by petrochemicals.</p>
          <p>It's opportunities like these that continue to provide us with linkage and expansion projects across our business lines. And we believe these fundamentals will remain strong. Across our businesses in crude, natural gas, NGLs, refined products and petrochemicals, we remain disciplined in pursuing projects that integrate well with our existing system of assets.</p>
          <p>In the Eagle Ford, we are fully subscribed on our initial 600 million a day gas processing plant, and we're already in negotiations with producers to fill the next phase of that plant. Our Eagle Ford crude oil pipeline is almost fully subscribed but can be expanded.</p>
          <p>The Eagle Ford has been a team effort as we have provided our customers with a full spectrum of services including gas gathering and processing, residue takeaway, NGL transportation, fractionation and marketing, and crude oil transportation and marketing. Our fifth Mont Belvieu NGL fractionation train will be operational by December this year, and we recently applied for the required permits for a sixth train should we decide to build it.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, with our fifth Mont Belvieu fractionation train, we will operate more than 750,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity in the U.S. Our pipelines remain strong, driven by wide price differentials, strong petrochemical demand and production growth.</p>
          <p>For the last year, you've heard us say don't under estimate the petrochemical industry's ability to consume more ethane. Given the recent announcements, we'll probably retire that statement. Those announcements speak for themselves as to the health of the petrochemical industry, and those same fundamentals point to a bright future for midstream companies that are aligned with that industry as we are.</p>
          <p>In our recent analyst meeting, we outlined some of the fundamentals around ethane economics and our view that ethane margins for gas processing will remain robust, even as NGL production ramps up from rich gas basins like the Rockies, the Eagle Ford, the Woodford and the Permian. The primary support for ethane processing margins is coming from petrochemical demand driven by the gas to crude spread.</p>
          <p>Our internal forecast shows potential ethane demand to increase an incremental 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day by 2015. That would have raised a few eyebrows just a few months ago, but in light of the announcements from Dow, Chevron Phillips, Westlake, and announcements we expect from others, incremental ethane demand could reach the high side of our forecast by that time.</p>
          <p>The only way to meet the demand for ethane that petrochemicals are projecting is for producers to continue developing rich gas resources and for midstream companies like Enterprise to continue building the infrastructure &#x2013; pipelines, fractionation, storage and distribution systems &#x2013; to bring those volumes to market.</p>
          <p>We spend a lot of time analyzing the quality of these gas plays, and our forecast calls for ethane production to increase to as much as 1.1 million barrels a day by 2015. That does not include any production from the Marcellus. The question is quickly becoming, in order to meet the projected demands for ethane on the Gulf Coast, does the petrochemical industry need Marcellus ethane and Mont Belvieu?</p>
          <p>The U.S. is not just competitive in ethane. Our propane resources and continued demand growth around the world has driven an increased reliance on U.S. propane exports. Our propane export terminal is essentially sold out through the end of 2012 and into 2013.</p>
          <p>The demand for incremental exports has supported the expansion of our terminal that will allow for loading up to three vessels at once and increase our loading capability to more than 10,000 barrels per hour of fully refrigerated propane and more than 13,000 barrels per hour of total NGLs. If that expansion had been in place last year and had been full, Enterprise would have been the second largest exporter of propane behind Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p>While we don't talk about it as much as we should, we spend as much time on the demand side of the equation as we do on the supply side. In doing so, we are supporting the supply growth by ensuring that demand is growing, and here's a couple of examples. We've been directly involved in the logistics solution to many crackers that have modified their traditional naphtha furnaces to use more ethane. We can identify 100,000 barrels a day of ethane usage today that was traditionally naphtha. That represents 275 million of natural gas equivalent. We continue to work with petrochemicals as they seek to further expand their usage.</p>
          <p>We've been exporting some 36 million barrels a year of propane to markets not served from the U.S. in the past. That's equivalent to 380 million a day of natural gas. We also focus on customer quality or demand quality. Our Haynesville extension, while crossing some 10 to 12 interstate pipelines, terminates in the Mississippi River industrial corridor with some 1.5 Bcf a day of continuous natural gas demand. In other words, those manufacturing sites use as much at midnight as they do at noon.</p>
          <p>We take seriously our commitment to provide our customers with two &#x2013; our producer customers &#x2013; with two critically important services, and this is what we try to differentiate ourselves with. First, flow assurance; second, market choices. We also take seriously the needs of our petrochemical and refining customers to have their wide variety of feedstock choices where they want it, when they want it.</p>
          <p>Mike mentioned our petrochemical business posting solid results. With crackers continuing to crack light, reliance on splitter produce propylene is high, and we think that demand will remain strong for the foreseeable future as they seek to go lighter and lighter. Just yesterday we announced a 500 million pound a year splitter expansion, evidencing our belief in continued strong demand and margins in propylene.</p>
          <p>As far as natural gas, we gave a pretty extensive review of production, depth and longevity at our recent analyst meeting. Construction on our Haynesville lateral continues to progress on time, and we anticipate nicely under budget. And we're looking forward to getting that project up in the September/October timeframe.</p>
          <p>Drilling and production results continue to be good in the area where our pipeline originates in DeSoto and Red River parishes. Wood Mackenzie recently published a paper on the Haynesville and identified this area as the absolute sweet spot from an acreage valuation total reserves per well and highest production rates.</p>
          <p>In our crude business, I think we can skip the questions about the reversal of the Seaway pipeline as Mike has mentioned our recent announcement to form a joint venture with Energy Transfer for a project to move 400,000 barrels a day of crude from Cushing to our new Houston crude oil terminal. A little more flavor, that project will be comprised of new and existing pipeline. It should be in service at the end of 2012, first of 2013. Existing pipe makes up 40% of the distance, and most new pipe will follow existing pipeline corridors.</p>
          <p>Last week we announced a project to extend our Eagle Ford crude oil pipeline 90 miles to a place called Gordondale. This extension is anchored by Chesapeake, but it has many more potential shippers, and you can bet we're fully engaged. One only has to look at the crude oil projects we've announced to appreciate the Enterprise-Lincoln leverage strategy. Originally our NGL strategy adopted by our natural gas business is alive and well in our crude oil business. A fully integrated system from offshore, South Texas, West Texas, North Texas, and Oklahoma tied to storage hubs with connectivity to 4 million barrels a day of refining capacity in Cushing and Houston soon to be totally integrated.</p>
          <p>And finally in our marine sector, we've rebranded our fleet. We continue to integrate that business and our marketing activities in crude oil, refined products and NGLs. We have projects underway in virtually every business segment and, rest assured, projects on the drawing board in every business segment.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss additional financial items. General and administrative costs decreased $2 million this quarter compared to the first quarter last year primarily due to lower public company expenses and payroll costs associated with the merger of EPE into EPD.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased $184 million this quarter from $158 million reported for the first quarter last year. Average debt balances were $14.1 billion and $12.3 billion for the first quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively.</p>
          <p>Partially offsetting the increase in interest expense this quarter was higher capitalized interest, which reduces interest expense for the period it is recorded and increases the carrying value of our related asset.</p>
          <p>Capitalized interest this quarter was $17 million versus $10 million for the first quarter 2010. For 2011, we estimate total capitalized interest will be $100 million to $110 million compared to $47 million recorded in 2010, primarily due to increased capital expenditures during 2011.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures were $718 million this quarter, which included $665 million for growth projects. Approximately 76% of the growth capital expenditures this quarter were comprised of the Haynesville and Eagle Ford related projects.</p>
          <p>Based on approved projects, we expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion for growth capital expenditures in 2011, the bulk of which would be for the Haynesville and Eagle Ford projects. Sustaining CapEx were $53 million this quarter. We continue to expect to spend in the area of $250 million to $260 million for this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of capitalization, adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011 was $3.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less equity earnings plus actual cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates. Our consolidated leverage ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.97 times for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. This is after adjusting debt for the 50% equity treatment of the junior subordinated notes or hybrid debt securities.</p>
          <p>Our floating interest rate exposure at March 31st is approximately 12% of the total debt portfolio. The average debt life was 10.4 years using the first call date for the hybrids. And our effective average cost of debt was 5.4%.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity at March 31, 2011, we had consolidated liquidity of $2.5 billion. This includes available unrestricted cash, as well as available capacity under the EPD and DEP credit facilities.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Duncan Energy Partners, this quarter DEP had $30.7 million of distributable cash flow which provided 1.15 times coverage of the $0.4575 per unit cash distribution that was paid to investors on May 6th. Cash flow from fee based assets enabled us to increase the cash distribution to our partners for the 10th consecutive quarter. DEP had total liquidity of $648 million at March 31, including availability under its revolving credit facilities and cash.</p>
          <p>With that, Randy, ready for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question is from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I've just got a couple questions for you, and let me say I appreciate all your comments about light end ethylene capacity additions and what you think that means to ethane demand. But on the other side of the equation, even in the last few days we've heard of at least another 200,000 barrels a day of frac capacity that's coming online, and probably more to come. And I realize that not all frac capacity is equal when you start considering the connectivity downstream, but is there a point that you get to for total Belvieu frac capacity that starts to make you think that the industry has overbuilt demand projections such that it could impact liquids pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dayton is about 16 miles north of Mont Belvieu, and our objective is to have frac trains all the way to Dayton &#x2013; which is a joke, Darren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I figured, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You said it. Not all frac is the same. Frankly, our fifth train, when it comes up, is full. It's full with long term contracts with demand fees. I said we've applied for the permits bill for our sixth train. We're going to take a hard look at that, and we're going to try to understand is that something we want to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, is it fair to assume that you could probably backstop the majority of a frac 6 just with the off-take that's going to Louisiana right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's fair to assume that 5 is going be up when it starts. It's fair to assume that we plan to bridge Eagle Ford with Louisiana.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. And then last question for me and this goes back to something that you mentioned in your prepared commentary. When you think about leveraging your asset footprint to get more Y-grade from Conway to Belvieu, how do you think about adding more takeaway capacity without negatively impacting that spread because that spread's obviously very delicate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay, let me think about this, Darren. With that spread, if you added capability to move product from Conway to Mont Belvieu, effectively you are trading guarantee for margin. Does that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does, yeah. I'm just trying to figure out if you'd be more incentivised to add Y-grade or just maybe expand a Hobbs and drop more ethane down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're probably incented to have more Y-grade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate it, Jim. Thank you very much. Congrats on a good quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the MAPL expansion, I'm just curious the in-service date is not for a little more than three years. Is that more of a demand issue or is it more permitting, construction issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a permitting and construction issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you remind us what the capacity is on the Rocky Mountain portion currently?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today we can do 275,000 barrels a day and with all plants producing its full we're off-loading.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to the Cushing Gulf Coast pipeline, how are discussions with shippers? Do you also continue to expect to have commitments in about a month or two?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Mark Hurley. We've been talking to really all segments of the crude oil business, producers, traders, refiners and we're seeing strong interest from all those segments. We're talking to folks in Canada. And those discussions are going very well. We expect to come out with a commitment period here within the next two weeks or so, and we expect a good response.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of cost estimates for the project, are they changed at all? And are you willing to provide a preliminary cost estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just final question, on the Haynesville extension I saw the press release had $1.6 billion for the cost. I thought it was lower than that. Have things changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think $1.6 billion was what it was originally advertised. We expect it to come in lower than that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Real quick, on the total number of growth projects out there, I think in the press release you guys mentioned five billion that you had under construction and that was kind of similar to what you had in the Analyst Day a few months ago. Is that number you think is relatively low? I mean, you've had several announcements since the Analyst Day, and it seems like that has an upward bias at this point. Is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, the numbers continue to grow, but a lot of that's going to be spending in 2012 and '13. So I think we're still comfortable with ballpark estimate that we had for spending in 2011. But as you might imagine, as we continue to move forward in time, we keep seeing more and more opportunities. So that number will continue to build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Fair enough. And then we've seen a number of obviously fractionation expansions, cracker expansions, pipeline construction. We saw this kind of back a few years ago when we went through the long haul natural gas pipeline kind of build out. Are you guys &#x2013; how are you handling the cost of construction and kind of your dealings with the E&amp;Cs at this point? Are you seeing price escalation? Just kind of if you could give us a feel for comfort in the cost estimate at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Bill Ordemann. We're seeing prices, with the exception of steel prices, pretty much staying flat. And actually I met with someone last year saying labor rates were actually coming down a little bit still. We're seeing steel kind of increase modestly. And we think we're able to control that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it at a point where you can still get kind of flat fee or kind of turnkey type of arrangements with E&amp;Cs on fractionators or some of these expansions? Or is it still cost plus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've been doing almost all turnkey work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're still able to lock those in today?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. And then lastly on the propylene splitter, you guys mentioned that some of that was going to existing customers, you're increasing connectivity to other customers. And then you also were planning to connect it to the export market. How much of that is actually destined to the export market at this point? Or is most of that just demand domestically as a result of the byproduct availability going down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We anticipate the bulk of that new production to go to domestic consumption.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much can you export if you wanted to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Some of my questions have been answered, but in terms of the export market, the ethylene exports last year, I guess, were crowded out a little bit by strong domestic demand. And I was just curious, it seems like the export outlook still remains pretty favorable for ethylene derivatives, and also you're expanding your NGL import/export terminal to take the propane. And so I guess my question is, is what do you see in terms of the growth outlook for exports? And how important is that market to sustain growth for the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about ethylene or propane?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, ethylene first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Polyethylene and everything, I probably can't give you a good answer. The sense we get is they're pretty excited about their competitive position globally. And I would assume they got to believe that some percentage of that production will be exported. You'd rather be cracking ethane in the U.S. Gulf Coast than naphtha in Northwest Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just secondly, you mentioned the Seaway pipeline. I know there's been a lot of conjecture around that. I mean at this point if ConocoPhillips decided to reverse it tomorrow, then basically what you're saying is you would just continue to move forward as part of the joint venture with EPP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that's probably a stretch that they would decide tomorrow to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But certainly if they did, they're a partner of ours, it's something we'd have to consider.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just asking a little bit about kind of into the Rockies. We saw a dip in your equity NGL volumes, but then a big jump in processing volumes. Is that just less Rockies equity volumes? Or what's going on, kind of that mismatch between the equity NGLs versus the processing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ted. What you're &#x2013; this is Tom &#x2013; what you're seeing there is a shift in the contracting structure that we pointed out, more fee-based processing revenue versus percent of liquids. And the equity volumes, of course, should reflect that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. But no big change in terms of the volumes from different basins? I'm also thinking about your MAPL expansion here, which I think you said you had 38,000 a day of commitments but you could go up to 85,000. I think you'd probably get that full ultimately, but I'm just thinking about what the Rockies are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is <mark type="ph" /> Jim Connelly (29:07). The variance there is giving the producers a little longer to lock up their volumes so they could meet the commitment. The open season gave them an opportunity to give us an initial number, which totals 38, and they have till the end of this year to upsize that. We've got several producers that are waiting on permits to build additional plants, and once they get those permits they're telling us they're going to come in and lock up higher volumes. We will not build spec. It will be fully subscribed. That's what we'll build to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And still under ten year commitments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plus an extension of their current commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, great. Okay. And then just if I could switch over just to the NGL, just the pricing itself, are you more actively hedging in the market now with where NGL prices have gone? How far out have you gone out in tenure? Can you talk about your hedging strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't know the exact percentage, but we've hedged a good percentage of our propane plus through the end of the year. We've been &#x2013; we're watching ethane, and we've got a little bit of that hedged, but it's so backwardated and looking at the fundamentals that we see, we think it will come to us as it approaches the front.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Good morning, everybody.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Jim, could you just elaborate on what your thinking is around the Marcellus right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Confusion. Not sure, Yves. We said at the conference we've got a project, and we visited with the key producers about that project. We've got some petrochemical customers that are excited about it, but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere, to speak frank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, how do you &#x2013; has the strategy of the pet chem guys changed at all in terms of how they're approaching their feedstock? And where do you think that may go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't understand what you're &#x2013; the question, Yves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question is, are they trying to &#x2013; I guess Dow is locking in feedstock evidentially from the Marcellus. You've got NOVA trying to lock in ethane as well. And I'm just wondering how you think about that? Is that a new paradigm within the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're consistent with their past. The more they have, the better they like it. So they're going to do everything in their power to attract more feedstock to the Gulf Coast. I would imagine that they're looking at it from a portfolio perspective so that they might have some &#x2013; it wouldn't surprise me if they had some that was gas related and then other contracts or Mont Belvieu related. So I think they're looking to attract more, and they're probably looking at it from a portfolio perspective tying some to natural gas and some to Belvieu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could in terms of thinking about the proposed pipeline from Cushing down to Houston, what are the hurdles that you need to get through to get this project done in addition to getting the contractual commitments? Are there any major obstacles that you see or that you need jump through &#x2013; jump over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mark. It's really pretty straightforward both from a permitting standpoint and acquiring right of way. We've already got the work underway to do that. There are some long lead time items, but we understand what those time lines are. And so we've got things in progress already underway to meet the deadlines that we've set out. So we see it &#x2013; it's a big project, and of course it's challenging, but it's pretty straightforward compared to other projects that we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then two quick ones. One is, what are you seeing on the natural gas marketing side? It looked like you had a good quarter on gas marketing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, this is Chris. The basic thing is the spreads have opened up a little bit this year over last year on some of our long haul stuff. And the northern border capacity especially is we're 100% hedged off for the first quarter. And we're recovering full demand costs there. And in our Gulf Crossing, our strategy is in place and it's ramping up. And by October the Gulf Crossing will all be behind us with pretty sure dedication to our buying commitments will be up to our commitment levels to cover that whole capacity. So that problem will be 100% behind us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last question is, can you just review how you're looking at asset dispositions? It looked like you had a couple of sales during the quarter. Can you talk about the rationale for that? And do you have additional assets that you might try to monetize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kind of threw you off there, Yves, huh? We're not used to selling things if people don't force us to. Frankly, we're looking at all of our assets and from time to time we see assets that really don't fit our value chain, a couple of fractionators up in the Rockies that we don't operate, a couple marine assets. Those made sense to sell because they really just didn't add value, they weren't core to what we were doing.</p>
          <p>We'll take that cash and redeploy it in some of these other projects, which frankly is a lot more exciting to us. But we'll continue to look at assets. I don't think you'll see anything near term that's earth shattering. There may be a few odds and ends. That doesn't mean that we're not going to look at all of our assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Mike, but I just got to ask the last one. How wedded are you to the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Gulf of Mexico is important in some respects. It brings supply onshore to some of our plants, and so you can tell what we're doing there. We've really reduced our spending in the offshore. We do have some projects that we're doing and we're looking at others. But frankly, as we look at our capital spending going forward, this year we've got some things that we want to do in Louisiana and Texas that have a little bit higher priority over some other things that we might do in the Gulf.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Noah Lerner with Hartz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just a quick question. Probably a short-term effect, but with the potential for down river flooding from the Mississippi if this thing plays out over the next couple of weeks, I was wondering what impact you think it could have on refinery demand for ethane and other products? And what the impact would be backing up the entire value chain throughout the summer and maybe into the fall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, do you have any ideas on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only announcement I've seen so far, Noah, is that Exxon was going to have to shut down their docks in Baton Rouge, and they may have to reduce refinery runs a little bit. We're certainly monitoring the situation and don't expect a significant impact in any of our plants or customers other than what I've heard there. So I haven't heard anything that would be problematic at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing to consider is that even though it may cause some disruptions, as you saw in prior years with hurricanes causing disruptions in certain geographic areas, it might provide opportunities elsewhere. So I think from an impact on Enterprise, it shouldn't have much, but certainly we're all hoping that it doesn't impact our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. Thanks for the information.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions. One, Jim, you gave a projection for ethane production out to 2015. I guess two questions on that. One, should we assume a similar trajectory for propane based on your guys' internal work? And then the second question is if you could just broadly talk about the big picture assumptions behind that? Where is that production growth coming from? And what is your assumption on base production declines? And what's going on with the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Christmas, Michael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got a book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've formed a new fundamentals group. They've done a heck of a job in analyzing what we expect and where we expect it from. And they just kind of wind me up and I talk. I think what we're seeing is growth in the Eagle Ford. Mike already talked about what we're doing in the Rockies, so obviously we see growth in the Rockies. We see growth in the Permian and the Woodford. So that's kind of the areas. As far as a decline rate, I think that's a $64,000 question. Everybody &#x2013; what decline rate are we using now for legacy, 2%? We just plug in 2%, Michael. There is no science to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was your last --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on propane. Would you assume the same trajectory for propane supply as ethane?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd see it growing, but not on the same trajectory because the stream is getting lighter, it has more ethane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my last question is turning to Refined Products Pipelines. If you look at the year-over-year changes, you had $10 million down because effectively the spread between WTI and LLS and then $5 million for maintenance and integrity spending. Assuming that spread remains, would you assume those flows stay as they are? And then is there something going on that your integrity costs are going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Refined Products Pipeline, remember we had some repair costs up in New York state and then also with the high cost of gasoline you had reduced demand in the Midwest, so that affected it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Your next question is from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How you doing, guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looks like a nice uptick in volumes in South Louisiana and Lou-</p>
          <p>Tex. Are you moving product to Louisiana for fracing because you're full in Mont Belvieu? Or what's going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly what's happening, Ross.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, any impact from the floods on the marine business here in the next several weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Gerry Cardillo. We are abiding by, and very cautious. And there will be impacts on marine traffic going east and west. There has been impacts on traffic north and south but all with solid due diligence and in compliance with industry and regulatory agencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what's your impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had two Enterprise marine tubs and barges idled in Paducah, Kentucky, on charter for 10 day periods, and we expect them to be in a congested spot for the next 7 days. And based on &#x2013; I'm sorry, and &#x2013; yeah, and we're still on charter. And then basis for what our gauge looks like on the Morgan City area and the intracoastal canal, we could have up to 19 tows impacted all on a revenue earning basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Also obviously there's a change in mix here going from POP to fee-based. How aggressive is that movement towards fee-based by the producers and by yourself? And what do you see the forward impact being on earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you go back to my comments, $1 a gallon processing spread, producers want that. So you give them what they want and you take the fee and you try to get it as high as you can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ross, I think it's fair to say that we are willing to trade a bit of margin for stability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's easier to do that today than it used to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Very good. One final question. Keystone has obviously got its Gulf extension; seems to be hung up somewhat on regulations and what have you. There's a decent amount of that contracted. Is there an ability, in your opinion, for some of those people contracted on the Gulf extension with Keystone to shift over to your project or any view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Mark. Yeah, we believe there is. We've talked to all the folks who we think will be significant shippers on the line, and not one of them have mentioned that as a barrier to shipping on the line that we will build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we think whatever that commitment is, they can transition out of it in some way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. That's it for me, guys. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Your next question is from John Edwards with Morgan Keegan &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up here. You mentioned about five billion or so of projects under construction, and you have expectations for that growing. What do you view as your backlog of opportunities now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, if you talk about backlog of opportunities, things that aren't &#x2013; including the projects that aren't sanctioned but look really good to us, it's $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion, who knows. The question you might want to ask is what kind of what do we think we ought to be spending on an annual basis...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, playing your straight man. So I think that just in terms of what do we need to spend to be able to continue to grow our distribution. For the next couple of years it's probably closer to $1 billion, $1.5 billion. What do I think we'll actually spend? It's probably, I like to say $2.5 billion. Jim keeps saying it's going to be higher. So it may be something like you've seen this year and last year, frankly. But we don't have that kind of a spending locked in for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'm trying &#x2013; this is kind of a follow-up to Ted's question. On the ramp here, you have the equity NGL production was flattish, and then the fee-based natural gas processing was way up. It was 38% up year-over-year. Now is part of that growth marketing? One of your guys mentioned there was a switch in the type of contracting that you're doing there. I'm just trying to get an idea of what kind of ramp should we be expecting between those two elements to sort of drive your NGL segment margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Tom. I'm not sure how I could quantify it in numbers, but our focus has been, as Jim said earlier, to give the producers the type of contracting arrangement they want. They want to see more of the liquids themselves these days. So our contracts take a bend toward fee-based contracts. And that's what you see in the slightly lower equity volumes, the lower percent proceed, particularly with the Eagle Ford contracts coming on in South Texas at a higher fee-based revenue stream from the processing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much &#x2013; was there a &#x2013; were there marketing volumes in those numbers? Or was that all fee-based processing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not sure I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, was there &#x2013; I'm just trying to get an idea, I guess, how much &#x2013; so that's just being driven by customer, that's just customer-driven demand here? I guess, what's &#x2013; how sustainable or what kind of growth outlook should we expect on natural gas processing then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, if you're looking at the fee-based natural gas volumes on --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the volumes because they were up so strongly. They were up 38% year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; John this is Randy &#x2013; there were two places that they were up. They were probably up about 570 million a day up in the Rockies, and they up, call it, 450 million a day in South Texas. As far as in and some of that, like Tom said, maybe you lost 3,000 barrels a day of equity NGL production in the Rockies, maybe 3,000 in South Texas. But again, some of that is just migrating from percent of liquids keep whole to fee-based. Then we did have a pickup in equity NGL production over in South Louisiana.</p>
          <p>Now, I mean when you come in and you look from a plant standpoint, plants up in the Rockies are running full. We had capacity in South Texas. We're filling that up with new Eagle Ford volumes. The next growth component to look for in processing would be when the Yoakum plant comes up on 600 million a day, you ought to see more combination of equity NGL production and fee-based volumes come up when that plant goes up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not aware of any lingering issues. We're in the process of demolition. We're still in the process of doing temporary interconnects to get the connectivity restored to the few customers we have remaining without connectivity. We're in the process of emptying the wells over there on a temporary basis. We're not going to be able to use those wells until we get the rebuild complete, but we are already getting the product out of those wells at the present. I think we're emptying two of them as we speak. And then we're going ahead with plans. We've ordered long lead equipment, and we're going ahead and putting the plans together and doing the engineering on the rebuild. It will be rebuilt exactly like it was, but we'll make it more efficient. And we're thinking early 2012 we'll have it completely rebuilt and we'll have it all behind us.</p>
