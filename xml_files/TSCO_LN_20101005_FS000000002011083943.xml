          <p>[Starts Abruptly] ...to our meeting today. We have a slightly different running order today. We'll begin with Laurie, who will take you through the numbers, and welcome then Philip Clarke to his first one of these sessions. Philip, as you know, will be taking over as CEO in March, and Phil will provide an update on International; and then Terry will provide us with his usual update on strategy; and after that, as ever, we'll be pleased to take all your questions.</p>
          <p>So, let's kick off with Laurie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Well, we've delivered a strong performance in the first half with double-digit profit growth. We've continued to invest both in the customers' offer and platforms for long-term growth. We've funded this through an excellent productivity program right across the Group; and our balance sheet continues to strengthen and we're on track to beat our target for net debt reduction. We're beginning to deliver on our commitment to increase return on capital employed.</p>
          <p>I'll start by taking you through a summary of our Group performance. On this slide, you can see the financial highlights for the first half. Group sales were 32.9 billion, up 8.3%; Group trading profit rose by 9.1%; and underlying profit grew by 14.1%.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our policy of growing dividends broadly in line with underlying diluted EPS, the interim dividend is &#xA3;0.0437; up 12.3% on a constant tax basis. The performance is a result of strongly broadly-based growth, of which more than half has come from outside the UK.</p>
          <p>I'll now take you through the key areas in turn. Our UK business has delivered another strong, or robust performance during a period of unusually slow industry growth. Total sales in the UK, ex-petrol, were 4.2%, with like-for-like growth of 1.2% and net new space contributing 3%.</p>
          <p>In the first half, the industry was lapping last year's high inflation and customers were also facing high petrol prices and this was leaving them less money to spend in store. This resulted in lower growth across the market. However, our sustained investment in the customer shopping trip and our strong opening program have meant that we've continue to outperform the industry.</p>
          <p>UK trading profit was 1.2 billion, up 5.5%, or 8.6% before the effect of the sale and leaseback program. This was supported by excellent productivity from our Step-change program, which is on track to deliver savings of 550 million. And this is part of our 800 million planned for the Group as a whole.</p>
          <p>Our new store opening program is strong this year. And because I'm aware this is a topic of discussion for you at the moment, I thought I would share with you some data on store impacts because these provide a useful gauge of how capacity growth is affecting the industry.</p>
          <p>This chart looks at the impact on Tesco sales of new store openings, both Tesco and its competitors. It shows that the impacts are low with little variation over time. So far this year, there has been no material change despite a rise in capacity growth. It may move up in the second half as our new space, as usual, is back-end loaded. But I believe this data is persuasive and is good evidence that the investment in new space is not a major issue for the industry. And that's because much of it is non-food, convenience, or recycled.</p>
          <p>This next chart, which shows the UK's return on capital employed, reinforces the point about the robustness of the UK business. Even after splitting out the impact of the property divestment program, you can see that the UK continues to deliver gently improving returns.</p>
          <p>I talked at the prelims about improving trends in Asia. As economic recovery gathers pace, these trends have continued with sales up 20% and trading profit up 30%. We've seen progressively stronger growth from existing stores, a good performance from new space, and a very strong growth in Korea with the performance of the stores acquired in 2008 continuing to converge with our core business.</p>
          <p>In Japan, the environment remains challenging and the business continued to make a modest loss. Given we had limited headroom on the carrying value of the remaining goodwill, it was appropriate to take a further non-cash impairment charge of 55 million, and goodwill in Japan is now fully impaired.</p>
          <p>In Europe, our local management teams adjusted their business well to the demands of the recession and now, with leaner cost structures, they are well geared into a recovery. Overall, sales were up 6% and profits grew by 11%. The first half saw the beginning of a strongly improving sales trend, which is flowing through to the bottom line, and further improvements are expected in the second half.</p>
          <p>In the United States, Fresh &amp; Easy has seen overall sales growth of 47%, including very strong like-for-like. First half losses rose to 95 million, with additional costs from taking in house the operations of two of our suppliers. However, we do not expect losses this year to be materially different from last year. But Phil will update you in more detail on our International performance later.</p>
          <p>Our Retail Services division delivered a solid first half. In Tesco Bank, the re-platforming of our systems is going well. And despite the parallel running costs linked to this, trading profit rose by 12% to 129 million. Banking profitability is continuing to strengthen, helped by growing customer numbers, high retention rates, and by an improved margin environment in credit cards and the loan book.</p>
          <p>This was partly offset by lower income from insurance, resulting from an increase in bodily injury claims and lower investment income, both of which are industry-wide trends. The bad debt charge is 19% lower than the first half of last year, driven by falling delinquency rates. This is as a result of stabilizing unemployment and the tightening of our credit policy. Here we have a chart showing the trend in the credit card book over the last 12 months. Our high quality book means our bad debt performance remains significantly better than the industry average.</p>
          <p>The Tesco Bank balance sheet remains strong and the business has generated cash flow as a result of further growth in savings. Loans to customers also increased, reflecting a competitive product offering on credit cards and loans. The Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the first half was 13.6%, and we've provided a first-half income statement and balance sheet in your packs.</p>
          <p>The release of fair value provisions that were made in the Group balance sheet on acquisition of the Bank has, as planned, supported the Bank's profitability during the recession. These releases, which last year for the full year were 118 million, are now tapering off with around 90 million this year, and then falling away quite quickly. The Bank's strong underlying profitability growth will at least offset the reduction in provision releases next year.</p>
          <p>Looking further ahead, with a growing and increasing loyal customer base, improving margins, falling bad debts, and double running costs starting to fall away, we are confident that the Bank will start to show a strongly improving growth profile.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to our Group balance sheet. Group capital expenditure in the half was 1.9 billion, including 0.8 billion for International and 1.1 billion for the UK, and that's including the Bank. One of the factors driving lower UK CapEx is that we are developing a proportion of the capital-in-progress on the balance sheet, with the aim of reducing the current 2 billion balance to a more normal level of around 1 billion over the next two to three years.</p>
          <p>We're on track to deliver 9.1 million square feet of net new space across the Group and maintain our CapEx guidance of around 3.5 billion for the full year. Our retail operating cash flow was 2.3 billion, 0.4 billion higher than CapEx.</p>
          <p>Property proceeds totaled 1.2 billion with very attractive initial store yields on the last transaction of less than 5%, which demonstrates again the quality of both our asset base and our covenants. We expect total divestments for the year to be similar to last year.</p>
          <p>We're now in the fifth year of our five-year property divestment program, from which we've raised proceeds of &#xA3;5 billion and generated &#xA3;1 billion of property profits. Shareholders have benefited directly in the form of a 1.1 billion share buyback and 300 million more of additional dividends. We'll update you on the shape of the program going forward, and at the preliminary results give you more detail.</p>
          <p>Moving on to pensions, there's been a small increase in the net deficit to &#xA3;1.4 billion, up &#xA3;100 million from the year end, mainly as a result of the movement in the corporate bond yields. Obviously, this does not reflect the change in our funding obligation; our actuarial deficit remains small and manageable.</p>
          <p>We're making excellent progress with debt reduction. Net debt has fallen to 7.6 billion. And given that we always have a stronger cash flow in the second half, we're on track to reduce it to 7 billion by the year end; obviously, ahead of our target.</p>
          <p>I want to talk to you about improving returns. At over 12%, Tesco returns on capital is good by industry standards. But growing it is a high priority for us. And that is why we reaffirmed our target in April to raise ROCE to 14.6%.</p>
          <p>Today I want to explain in more detail the dynamics of that improvement, so that you can share our confidence in stronger returns going forward. The key drivers are these: economic recovery; maturing International assets; delivering on acquisitions; the growth of services; increased capital efficiency; and leveraging Group scale and skill.</p>
          <p>I'll briefly cover each in turn because whilst they overlap to some extent, any one of these drivers has the potential to move the dial for the Group. First, the benefits of recovery are starting to flow and these will strengthen as our markets continue to emerge from recession. As you can see from this chart like-for-like sales in both Asia and Europe have improved markedly over last year, and this is feeding through to improved profitability.</p>
          <p>International margins saw a drop of over 100 basis points between peak and trough for Asia and Europe, but they have already started to recover, as these numbers demonstrate.</p>
          <p>A second key driver is the increasing maturity of our International assets. Maturity delivers high returns in two ways; through the maturity of individual store assets, and also through the benefits of a business getting to scale in its local market. The chart shows the first of these two effects, with the difference in CROIs between the mature assets and all our assets in the International business last year.</p>
          <p>In the second chart, which makes a similar comparison but this time for our most mature countries, it shows clearly that even for businesses, which can still be a multiple times larger how strong the returns are becoming. And importantly, this group of countries now generates more than enough cash to generate its own growth or fund its own growth.</p>
          <p>The third driver is the improving performance of acquisitions we made in 2008. Those deals cost &#xA3;2 billion, and only the bank was making money at that time. So they were returns dilutive. Two years on, returns on the Korean acquisition are rising fast as the success of the integration moves its profitability close to that of the core business.</p>
          <p>Because Korea's profits are heavily second half weighted, there's more to come here. The Bank was always high returning, but there's more to come here too, as we come through the phase of migration from RBS into a stronger growth in the medium and long-term.</p>
          <p>The mix effect on Group returns from services is a fourth driver of improving ROCE. Services returns are above the Group, and as we move towards our 1 billion profit target, their increased weighting in the Group's profits will be accretive. This of course is because these businesses have much lower capital intensity by using the existing store assets.</p>
          <p>We're also using our capital more efficiently through unwinding some of the UK work-in-progress on the balance sheet, which I referred to earlier; a bigger proportion of our new space coming in lower capital intensive formats and leasehold property; our sale and leaseback program, which sells mature assets and recycles, funds new growth.</p>
          <p>The final key driver is leveraging Group scale and skill. And this is very important because we're now seeing substantial dividends beginning to come through and emerge from being a large international group.</p>
          <p>Our global non-food sourcing strategy has shown benefits that can be gained from taking an international approach. We're now applying what we've learned on a much broader basis, starting with international buying of our own brands, fresh foods, and also goods not for resale. The savings from international sourcing are already substantial, but over the next few years, we expect the benefits to grow from tens of millions to hundreds of millions.</p>
          <p>We're leveraging the group's scale and skill in many other areas, such as Clubcard, now in nine countries; brand development with F&amp;F in 10 countries; and Discount Brands in seven. The Tesco operating model now delivers best practice for the benefit of all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>So to sum up, Tesco's delivered a strong, broadly based set of results. We've made further good progress on the balance sheet; and the direction of travel on returns is good. This year will see the start of the increase in ROCE, and I'll update you on our progress at our prelims in April.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll now hand over to Philip.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Laurie. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover Ireland; Central and Eastern Europe; Asia; and the United States. By way of introduction, our International business has, I think, delivered a very strong performance, growing sales, profits, and market share, helped by a steadily improving economic environment, both in Asia and in Europe. Although the pace of recovery does vary by market, I'm pleased we're growing like-for-likes in all three regions. And with the step-up in new space that we announced in April, we're also seeing accelerating growth now in total sales, whilst profitability is improving following the difficult changes we had to make to the cost base during the recession.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start the regional review with Asia, which has delivered an excellent performance, and where sales are on an improving trajectory with Q2 stronger than Q1. Overall, sales grew by 20% and profits by 30%. Trading margin for the region as a whole also resumed its progression, improving to 4.6%.</p>
          <p>In Korea, which is our largest International business, they had an outstanding first half. Sales grew by 23%; profits by 51%. Our market share continues to grow, and we're closing the gap with E-mart. The regional business has benefited from the planned acquisition synergies and is performing very well indeed. The acquired stores are improving customer and operational metrics, as well as top line sales and operating margins. We expect the improving trend in sales growth to continue into the second half, although profit growth is going to moderate as we start to annualize the improving numbers of last year. And our online grocery business now delivers 24,000 orders per week out of just 49 stores. It's doing very well, with growth of 72% in the first half.</p>
          <p>In Thailand, we had a very strong second quarter, following a first quarter which was disrupted by political unrest. I was in Bangkok at the time and I'd like to pay tribute now to our staff who performed heroics; did brilliantly well, kept serving customers, in what was a very difficult situation. For the first half, sales grew by 15%; profits by 26%. The business is performing on an upward path; a like-for-like growth of almost 5% in the second quarter and a growing share. We're planning an acceleration of new space in the second half.</p>
          <p>In China, a recovering consumer and a good store opening program are driving strong growth; sales are up 20%. All three regions are growing well. The fastest like-for-likes are in the south and the improvement in the shopping trip we've delivered are being rewarded by growing customer loyalty and improving like-for-like sales. Our first three Lifespace malls are trading well. Sales have been growing steadily as the customer flows improve. Occupancy rates are high; and the tenant mix is starting to settle. Most importantly, the Tesco hypermarkets in the malls are performing very well, with sales levels similar to stores in Tier 1 cities. I'll be taking some of you to one of the malls during our trip to Asia in November, where you'll be able to see in more detail how the China strategy is coming together. We're going to open another three new malls this year, all in the second half, with our largest mall so far, Anshan, due to open on October 25.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Malaysia, where the consumer's been cautious for longer than most, like-for-likes have been improving and total sales in the half are up 24%, supported by our space opening program. There's more to come again as we step up our rate of expansion in the second half.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we continue to make progress set against sector like-for-likes, which remain negative. As Laurie explained, we've restructured the business to reflect the market conditions and in the first half, we opened 12 new stores and we converted 11 existing ones to our new format. The early results of those conversions have been encouraging; sales uplifts, as you can see in the chart, more than 20% from the converted stores.</p>
          <p>And importantly, in August I attended the opening of our fresh kitchen in Tokyo, which is going to supply our stores with high quality pre-packed fish, including sushi and sashimi. We expect that kitchen will improve quality, reduce costs, and improve margins in a category which you'll know is very, very important for the Japanese customers.</p>
          <p>Moving to India, we're pleased with progress in the first half. The wholesale company's now fully set up and supplies Star Bazaar. They've added two hypermarkets in the first half, bringing the total to nine, and our cumulative like-for-like sales in Star Bazaar since we set up the franchise agreement is now almost 75%.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Europe, we're seeing strong like-for-like improvements, particularly for the second quarter. Overall, sales in the first half grew by 6% and profits by 11%, with trading margin improving to 4.8 from 4.6% last year.</p>
          <p>Let's take a little look now at each country in turn, starting with Ireland, where we've continued a remarkable turnaround following the restructuring of the business last year. Despite an economy that's still can best be described as lackluster, sales at constant rates grew by 8%, of which like for like was 6. We made good market share gains, and once again delivered a strong profit performance.</p>
          <p>Our business in Poland has delivered another good set of results, with sales up 15% and profits up 26. It's now becoming a much more important driver of growth for us in Europe. Whilst Q1's numbers were affected by the period of mourning which followed the tragic death of President Lech Kaczynski, it did recover very quickly in the second quarter. Importantly for us, our small stores are performing extremely well, with double-digit like-for-like growth, in line with the market leader, and our overall market share has grown well.</p>
          <p>In Hungary, we've got a market-leading and a very profitable business, which continues to perform well in a very difficult environment. Our team there, again, has demonstrated great resilience, investing for customers and winning market share, but sales and profits did reduce in the first half. I can report that the economy has now started to grow again, and in recent weeks we've seen some early sign of a pick up in sales. We recently launched Clubcard to a great start. In the first five weeks, we've already signed up almost 1 million customers.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic, where our recent Clubcard launch also went well, our small store formats have helped produce a strong improvement in our sales performance. Like-for-like growth has improved steadily over the half and turned positive in the second quarter. Total sales grew by 5%; profits slightly faster; and we continue to outperform the market and are increasing our share.</p>
          <p>In Slovakia, an export-led recovery is now well underway. Strong top line growth of 13% in the half, driven by 10% like for like, has helped us deliver a significant increase in profitability. We've grown share and are extending our market leadership further.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, a step-up in our space opening program has delivered good top line growth in the first half, with total sales up 17%. With the economy back in growth and unemployment starting to come down, we expect sales growth to improve further in the second half.</p>
          <p>I hope you can see growing momentum in our European business. And it's not only coming from the economic recovery. There are a growing number now of European-wide initiatives underway; I'm just going to share a couple of them with you.</p>
          <p>We've developed a refreshed hyper store, we call it Extra; you may be familiar with the term. Our first trial is in Petrzalka, which is in Bratislava in Slovakia. We reopened it in April. It's proving to be very popular with customers. It's achieved more than a 20% uplift in like-for-like sales. We've extended the Extra pilot to Fogarasi in Hungary, Czestochowa in Poland, Pilzen in Czech, and the early results are still very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Projects like that, and the regional sourcing initiative that Laurie talked about earlier, are improving the shopping trip for customers. They're making our business much simpler for staff and they're lowering the costs of our operations. It's a winning formula we think and one you'll hear more about in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the United States, Fresh &amp; Easy continues to grow well with sales up 47% and like-for-like growth approaching 10% for the half. We opened 14 new stores, including our most northerly stores to date in Fresno, which have started well, and we plan to open a further 19 in the second half.</p>
          <p>In a few locations, the scale of the residential and the commercial property crash has been so severe that we've taken the decision to mothball 13 stores, six in Nevada, six in Arizona, and one in inland California. The expected population growth in these neighborhoods has just not materialized. We're going to reopen them when the housing and employment conditions in these locations pick up.</p>
          <p>In contrast though, where conditions are more normal, our model is working and so it's right to accelerate our store opening program. I'd like to explain to you why we're so confident about this.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the foundations for our growth is the enthusiasm and the loyalty of our customers. Satisfaction levels remain very high. And in a recent survey, our customers rated their experience much more positively than customers of other stores. In this chart, the green line shows the satisfaction levels of Fresh &amp; Easy customers. And you can see, across nearly all measures we outperform the local competition, and by some distance on most metrics.</p>
          <p>So, the green line is Fresh &amp; Easy, the outer line. We're only behind on one metric, that's one-stop shopping, which isn't surprising given our stores are neighborhood stores. And you can see we're stronger on every other metric, especially if you go to three o'clock, friendly and helpful, freshness, eco-friendliness, checkouts, value, environment, stock, shopping ease; very, very strong performance.</p>
          <p>The second reason we're confident is that one of the key differentiators we enjoy is the fresh meal solutions that we produce in our kitchen, now accounting for 30% of food sales.</p>
          <p>In June, we acquired the local operations of our two largest fresh suppliers, 2 Sisters Food Group and Wild Rocket, and merged these into the Fresh &amp; Easy kitchen that's on the same campus in Riverside. This is soon going to lower our overall end-to-end costs, and service levels have already started to pick up.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, and as you can see here, we're making good progress, even without a bounce in the economy. In our trade areas overall, grocery market sales have declined 2.1% in the last quarter and many retailers are struggling on a like-for-like basis, yet look at our stores putting on very good growth.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, we're also making good progress on store profitability. As you can see from this chart, as we build our scale and experience, sales per store and gross margin are improving. And with a greater number of stores, our marketing spend has become more efficient, resulting in lower marketing costs per store. At the same time, growing scale is also helping the business improve its operational metrics, such as distribution costs and staff productivity.</p>
          <p>So the combined effect of these sales, marketing, and operational improvements, is a very positive impact on store economics, with losses per store declining steadily, as you can see here, by 9% of sales compared with the same time last year. So four reasons to be confident.</p>
          <p>And with strong sales growth, improving gross margins, store economics moving in the right direction, the key components of the profitable model are coming together. Of course, there's more to do, but that's why our plan to accelerate our store opening program next year is right.</p>
          <p>The economy should help. But even if it doesn't, we've got a very strong plan, a plan which sees us cross the line into profitability during the financial year 2012-'13. At this point, we'll be close to full capacity in the DC, which can accommodate around 400 stores.</p>
          <p>So, in conclusion, our International businesses are performing very well. We adjusted successfully to the downturn. We tightened our operations. We invested in customers. We strengthened our market positions, and we took tough action to reduce costs. The good work by the team is now paying off in the form of improving profitability. The conditions that will help increase return on capital in our International business are now very much in evidence. Thank you for listening, and I'll now hand over to Terry Leahy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Laurie. Thanks, Phil and good morning, everyone. We've made a good start to the year. Once again, all parts of the business have contributed to our growth as the headwinds of global recession become tailwinds of recovery. We're delivering improving sales and profit momentum, particularly from our International businesses.</p>
          <p>The investments made during the downturn in new space growth, in acquisitions, and in the customer offer, particularly in loyalty, are providing the platform for growth that we're now seeing, and will continue to see, in the second half of the year and beyond.</p>
          <p>Phil talked about the strong performance in International. I'd like to update you on progress in other parts of our strategy; the UK, non-food, services, and the community. Now, you'll be familiar, I'm sure, with the Tesco steering wheel, it's our internal balanced scorecard for setting our priorities and measuring our performance against those priorities. It helps us stay focused on near-term objectives, while keeping us on track with our long-term goals and strategy.</p>
          <p>So, I'm going to use it as my framework for today's update on the UK As always, we start with customers. Now they've been out of recession now for several months. The chart on the left shows consumer sentiment is on an improving trend. It flattened a bit, is the truth, coming around election, talk of austerity cuts, also and we can talk about this in Q&amp;A, the rise in petrol prices. But the cyclical shape is the consumer is in recovery.</p>
          <p>There's also evidence actually of improving customer confidence with trading up that we're seeing in food. Good example is the growth in our Finest range, and we put that on the second chart for comparison. So consumers are okay.</p>
          <p>What's behind the industry's slower growth at the moment is actually more about low inflation, or rather lapping high inflation, and high fuel prices. Petrol's been more than 20% higher year-on-year for much of the first half. It peaked in May. It was hitting the average family's budget by &#xA3;20 per month; not surprisingly, this had quite a big impact on many customers. It probably actually came out of their weekly expenditure, so it was the same pot as food spending; every day essentials, running the car.</p>
          <p>It's affected industry volume growth, and we've seen its effect in some non-food categories. Petrol prices are now easing, as this chart shows. And we'll also start to annualize the impact soon into the autumn, which is encouraging for the outlook for the second half.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to earn our customers' lifetime loyalty, and our increased investment in Clubcard is helping us to do just that. Tesco has, by far, the highest number of loyal customers in the industry, both functionally, in terms of how much they spend and emotionally, in terms of how committed they are to the business.</p>
          <p>Now a good measure of functional loyalty is the percentage of customers doing more than half their shopping with one company. And as this chart shows, we perform strongly on that measure. And it's interesting that loyalty for the sector as a whole, measured in this way, has actually been declining during the recession, more high-low promotions, more promiscuous shoppers being rewarded has actually eroded loyalty within the industry. But actually, at Tesco we've bucked that trend and we're increasing our loyalty emotionally, functionally, and we're widening the gap with competitors on this measure.</p>
          <p>With double points, we're rewarding customers more than ever for shopping at Tesco. And alongside a number of other initiatives, it's increasing customer engagement with Clubcard. A higher proportion of vouchers are being used, and Clubcard rewards, as customers learn about the great deals on offer with partners. With the big exchange in August, we saw 1 million customers double the value of their vouchers. And more than 750,000 customers have downloaded our Clubcard apps for their smartphones. And they're all pretty recent though, as actually we only did the shopping one a week or two ago.</p>
          <p>We've funded the investment in double points, supported by Step-change, so it's already in the base, we've paid for it. And yet we expect the benefits, in terms of growing loyalty, to continue to build further from here. We also know, of course, that earning customers' loyalty is more than just rewarding them through Clubcard; it's about delivering a great all-round shopping trip every week.</p>
          <p>Customers value the quality and the breadth of Tesco's range. It's a real strength for us, our range, and we continue to innovate in this area, particularly in own brands. We launched well over 1,000 new or improved products in the first half. The popularity of our own brand range with customers has meant now that Finest and Value are in themselves, in their own right, big brands in the UK</p>
          <p>In fact, Value has become the second largest food brand in the UK, actually ahead of Coca-Cola. And it's only pushed into second place by Tesco Finest, which is the largest brand in the UK More than half of our customers buy from the Finest range on a regular basis, so it's got a very wide appeal, and it's an important component of our sales mix.</p>
          <p>Our increased focus and investment in quality has continued in the first half; a lot of it actually in ready meals. We've also, though, improved the way we merchandise produce. We've retrained our staff there; we're delivering higher product standards; better visual appeal. We've got good customer feedback on that.</p>
          <p>Our late-bake initiative is increasing availability and freshness of our bread in the evening. We've introduced more specialists now, fresh food specialists, back into the stores. In some ways, it's a lesson of our International business, as we've brought fresh skills back into our UK business. And we've retrained counter staff right across the business, and the counters are looking better than ever.</p>
          <p>These and other measures to strengthen our fresh offer, alongside a marketing campaign which highlights the quality of the ingredients, the freshness, the local sourcing of the Tesco range, have together improved customer perception of our fresh food.</p>
          <p>The second segment of our steering wheel is community. And we've built on our leadership role in tackling climate change; we're on track to meet our UK emissions target for the year through investment in energy efficiency, natural refrigeration systems, and other low carbon technologies.</p>
          <p>We're also helping customers as well be more green. We've launched a home energy efficiency range, offering services from insulation right the way through to solar panels. And we've sent a climate change self-help booklet, with lots of simple tips, to 6 million customers who receive the Tesco magazine.</p>
          <p>We've organized 100 community fairs this summer. They've provided an invaluable opportunity for local and national charities to attract new volunteers. We've actually signed up tens of thousands of volunteers to charitable work. And it's also helped local suppliers &#x2013; linked local suppliers with our customers. 20,000 of our own UK staff signed up for Race for Life.</p>
          <p>In operations, we're making good progress against tough internal targets. We're achieving record levels of availability on our dotcom picking measure, with some good work, improving the way that we react to weather changes now, and how we predict promotional volumes. So those two big causes of volatility, we're getting a much more consistent result.</p>
          <p>We're always looking for ways to improve our high standards of service to stay ahead of competitors. We've made good improvements to our self-service checkouts; 10 million customers a week or certainly 10 million customer transactions a week are now chosen on self-service checkouts.</p>
          <p>We're trialing hand-held scan-as-you-shop services, with a plan to roll this out to many stores next year. And we're putting more equipment for staff on to the shop floor so they can spend more time with customers. So the offices at the back are effectively closing. You can run your store from the sales floor; a lot more staff presence there. And actually, they can answer questions instantly because they've got the technology in their hands.</p>
          <p>Our people are our strongest assets. We invest in them, and they respond by looking after our customers and staying loyal to Tesco. Almost 8,000 staff are now on our Options program, training for management roles. And because we've continued to invest in staff, and in pay, and in benefits, and training through the recession, the levels of staff morale are high, very &#x2013; record high actually. And rates of absenteeism and turnover are, in contrast, at record lows.</p>
          <p>The finance segment of our steering wheel is the output of the other segments, not the starting point. As a result of operating a balanced scorecard approach to manage the business, we're able to maintain consistent, long-term financial performance, even through periods of slower like-for-like; through ups and downs in inflation; and through the economic cycles.</p>
          <p>Now, this approach also means that our financial performance is really, rarely remarkable in any single year. But it's only remarkable if you look at our performance over a number of years, with the cumulative effect of consistent growth. This consistency in Tesco is supported by two key things; first, a strong program of quality new space; and second, a long-term program of structural productivity improvement.</p>
          <p>This year, we're on track to deliver a 6.5% increase in space in the UK, with good growth across all the formats. Nearly all the space is from new stores. Now that means we're getting less like-for-like kicker from extensions and some of our competitors are getting a bit more at the moment.</p>
          <p>Productivity growth is strong. And because Tesco is also experienced in carefully balancing the other levers of margin management, from mix to promotional investment, our strong and stable profitability is not an accident.</p>
          <p>Our track record shows it. We've maintained a stable profit margin in the UK, even when sales' growth has been harder to come by. And, of course, that's what underpins our robust first half trading margin of over 6%. So, in summary, once again, the steering wheel is guiding us towards another year of solid, profitable growth in the UK</p>
          <p>The next pillar of our strategy is non-food, where sales have continued to grow despite challenging conditions for discretionary spending in many markets. Internationally, our non-food business is now growing strongly through a combination of recovering economies, new space growth, and a growing potency in our own general merchandise offer.</p>
          <p>In Central Europe, our clothing business continues to thrive with 12% growth in sales and good improvements in market share. Actually, in Hungary and the Czech Republic, F&amp;F is actually the market leader in clothing, which is quite remarkable.</p>
          <p>In Asia, also a recovering consumer has helped non-food sales grow. But we've also seen a strongly improved performance in electrical's and too in clothing. In the UK, non-food sales growth remains positive overall, but it slowed with weaker market demand in important Tesco categories, like electrics and entertainment. And I think that petrol has had an effect there.</p>
          <p>We've had a good performance in clothing, growing ahead of the market, with particularly strong growth in childrens wear, helped by a very successful back-to-school season.</p>
          <p>Moving on to retailing services, Tesco Bank continues to grow well with an increase in customer numbers across all major products. We're attracting and retaining Tesco customers using Clubcard. For example, by highlighting the Clubcard points benefit of our credit card, or by offering discounts on car insurance to Clubcard holders. We're also rewarding loyalty, for example, by extending the introductory bonus rate to savers who stay with us.</p>
          <p>So I'm delighted to see our customer retention rates are rising quite sharply, which has always been an objective of ours at the Bank, and which, of course, helps profitability, long-term.</p>
          <p>Our systems migration plan is making good progress. The first product to be launched on our new banking platform is a fixed-rate savings bond; it goes live later this month. And we'll be writing business on the new insurance platform in the next few weeks. The migration will continue until the second half of next year, when the double running costs will start to fall away quite rapidly.</p>
          <p>Online, we've achieved solid, double-digit growth in our dotcom grocery business. We opened our third dotcom-only store in Greenford. We're trialing a Click &amp; Collect drive-through in Baldock; it's actually started very well. Tesco Direct itself saw strong growth, with sales up 25% in the first half.</p>
          <p>Our Telecoms business continues to make good &#x2013; actually, very good progress. Tesco Mobile has grown to almost 2.3 million customers, with very encouraging growth in Pay Monthly, which we've only recently introduced. We already have more than 160,000 subscribers, and we're adding around 25,000 a month. Our phone shops are playing an important part in driving this growth, offering customers an assisted sale with specialist staff.</p>
          <p>For the half year, we had 143 phone shops and we plan to open another 50 by the year end. Dunnhumby has delivered another excellent set of results with good growth in both the UK and internationally. Sales are up 25%, profits up 50%. We recently acquired the remaining interest in dunnhumby, so it's a fully-owned subsidiary.</p>
          <p>I talked about some of the UK's achievements on community. Now, as part of the group steering wheel, of course, we place the same emphasis on community. And we're on track to meet our global '10/'11 carbon targets. We reduced emissions from our 2007 base line; we set a base line in 2007 by 8% in the year. And we actually achieved a level of emissions from new stores and DCs where we could make new investment, 32% lower than our base line.</p>
          <p>We're doing more to support local suppliers across all of our markets. For example, we recently had a suppliers meeting in Poland, our buyers, technical teams turned up; we do this all over the world. 350 suppliers were there. We offered them advice on working with Tesco; how to grow with Tesco; what kind of investments to make; build stronger bonds; actually, build trust and confidence in doing business with Tesco.</p>
          <p>We're helping customers enjoy healthier lives. We're building on the success of Race for Life in the UK And also the Tesco FA soccer skills program, which has been amazingly successful. We've launched in Thailand their own program; it's Get healthy with Tesco Lotus initiative with a target of getting 4 million people, 4 million customers and staff, active.</p>
          <p>We now have over 350 Community Champions in stores right across the Group with more to come. And our continued growth in investment across our markets means that we're on track to meet our target of creating 16,000 jobs worldwide; 9,000 of which will be in the UK. And 600 of those will be from the long-term unemployed, created through our very successful regeneration partnerships.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, the global recovery is providing helpful tailwinds to every part of our business. In some markets, such as the UK, we're on a slow and steady growth path. And in others like China and Slovakia, the bounce back is more dramatic. Despite only being at an early stage of the economic recovery, profitability in our International business is recovering strongly and there's more to come. The UK has also shown a robust performance, delivering a better shopping trip and an improved margin, despite subdued sector growth.</p>
          <p>With the recovery in our International business coming through strongly and the prospects of faster growth in the UK in the second half, we're well placed to deliver good profit growth this year and beyond. And with the capital investments of the last several years coming through, we're beginning to deliver on our commitment to increase our return on capital, starting this year. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Just on your final point on return on capital there, your new debt guidance, obviously 500 million lower than last seen. Assuming you get similar levels of profit growth in the second half, that implies quite a big step-up actually in this year's return on capital using your calculation, magnitude 50 to 100 basis points. Can you give us a broad indication? You haven't given us a timeframe for this big step-up in return on capital. Can you give us a broad indication if that is broadly correct? You're actually looking at a fairly sizeable step up in return on capital employed this year?</p>

          <p>Hi there. Just a couple of quick questions. Could you give us some numbers on the non-food sourcing benefits you're getting and going to get, and give a number also on the prizing and label, et cetera in food? That's the global aspect of it. And secondly, could Laurie reconcile the fall in the depreciation charge in the first half, what he expects to happen in the second half and going forward, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>You're the Finance Director, Laurie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I forgot that. I think on the non-food, I mean, we said in the presentations that it was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will handle the depreciation....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, &#x2013; he's a much better Finance Director than I am, I tell you &#x2013; non-food savings so far, we said in the presentation that it was tens of millions; it's high tens of millions. But going forward, this could raise to 200, &#xA3;300 million worth of benefits out two to three years. On depreciation, obviously we've been selling assets that were previously depreciating in our P&amp;L, and as we sell them the depreciation charge comes down. And then if that question expanded to amortization, obviously we're writing off the intangibles within the Bank, and that's lower half-on-half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And going forward, because obviously you're opening stores and stuff? And you didn't answer the question on the food global sourcing, prize and all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll have a similar trend on depreciation. We're still working through the details of our property program going forward, which will obviously have an effect. But without doing the modeling for you, it will follow a similar trend. On food sourcing, I'm counting the tens of millions to hundreds of millions in that benefit.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just do a follow-up on the sourcing one, the truth is we don't have an internal target for benefits from Group sourcing, largely because as you know, historically they've been illusory. But they are real now. They were first real in non-food, but they are real also in food. And one of the reasons that in the new structure we've created a Group commercial role is actually to unlock those benefits. And I think with that role, it will be more appropriate for us to have actually a quantified target for a cross-border economy.</p>

          <p>Thanks. It's James Anstead from Barclays Capital. Firstly, a question about franchising. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the decision to start using a franchise model for the first time; perhaps what's the size of the opportunity there, and whether that could be an interesting contributor to return on capital in the longer term. And also, two quick questions on the U.S.; I wonder if you can give us any flavor of to what extent the first half numbers were hit by the cost of acquiring the two suppliers. And also, you've hinted that the U.S. should breakeven at some point in 2012, 2013. I'm guessing you don't necessarily want us to pencil in a profit for the year overall, but are you happy that we do that for 2013, 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question of franchising, the world's full of shopkeepers and people who'd like to be shopkeepers, and who are prepared to commit a bit of their own capital to start up a business. We can help them with the systems, with the brand, and so we first began that in South Korea, and it has applications in other places. Were it to go to other places, it would help improve returns because your capital investment is lower. So, yes, it would, but very early days for us at the moment.</p>

          <p>Laurie, are you going to pick up U.S.; two questions on the cost of buying &#x2013; the impact of buying in the two suppliers, and breakeven in 2012, '13?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Those suppliers were loss-making when we acquired them. Their losses and the impact on our P&amp;L is less than 10 million. And then you're right in terms of your assumption on 2013; we're growing to a breakeven position in our financial year 2013. And then as we come through that, hopefully we'll be achieving much greater profitability in the years to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Caroline Gulliver from Execution Noble. I had a question on the UK first, please. I was just wondering what makes you so confident we're seeing a consumer recovery. I had a couple of concerns. One, the contribution from petrol did ease in the second quarter, yet you didn't see a sort of corresponding pick-up in like-for-likes. And you also mentioned that non-food growth slowed in the second quarter. I was wondering if you were putting that all down to the blip in consumer confidence following the budget or whether there was something else going on there.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just on International, the comps do get quite a bit tougher in second half; are you still very confident, given that you said we were at the early signs of recovery, that you can accelerate your like-for-like sales growth from what you saw in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks like it's more than possible that the second half's going to be stronger than the first, in both Asia and Europe. Consumers have got back into expansion mode, into spending mode. We're seeing them buy more general merchandise. We're seeing them trade up a little bit in food. Our offer is improving too; it's not just the economy. So it looks like it's going to go the right way and they're going to strengthen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>UK, Terry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also Phil's being modest. We've done a fantastic job through the recession, kept investing, kept improving the customer offer. You got a taste of it with the Extras there, which have been spectacularly successful. And we really have come out of the recession stronger than we went in.</p>
          <p>On the UK, it's from talking to customers. It's clear that in the ether, in the media, it's all about double-dip and austerity and cuts and job losses and so on. But actually, talking to the customers, they have mentally moved into recovery. And it's a long run trend. And the economy is actually growing. There are jobs being created. There is a resumption in activity in financial services, in construction, in exporting, and so on.</p>
          <p>But that growth would be more marked &#x2013; you'd actually see it much more were it not for the rise in petrol prices. It put a crimp straight on the weekly budget; quite significant amounts of money. So our feeling is that when that is annualized, assuming there's no big explosion in oil costs, people won't be better off, but at least they'll be able to accommodate it. So the reallocation of weekly spending will have happened, and it will leave more coming into Christmas for non-food and for food. And, as I say, the trading up you see in food is quite encouraging. People want to trade up, but it's almost that they've had to cap their expenditure because of the petrol bill, so actually it's volume that's gone missing.</p>
          <p>On non-food, I think it is petrol. I think there's a couple of other factors, if I'm honest. I think that those retailers who don't have Apple will have struggled in electrical compared to those who do. And we don't have iPad, we don't have Apple Mac, and so on. We only get the iPhone on a restricted basis. Now, when we get the Apple technology, we do extremely well. And we got the iPod and we have a very good share. And that will come in time, and there are other smart products coming on to the market.</p>
          <p>We had the same issue, you may remember, with games a couple of years ago when that boomed and we were restricted to our historic market share rather than our potential market share. And that quickly corrected itself and we grew market share very rapidly. And I think in smart technology, you'll see a similar thing going forward, where we'll catch up.</p>
          <p>The final thing I'd say on non-food, which is quite interesting, is actually the currency effect that for much of 2009, say three quarters of 2009, we were buying at about 1.98. We then had to buy at 1.45, which &#x2013; however you manage it, takes away a bit of your firepower in terms of the value that you can put before a customer.</p>
          <p>We're now through that, and indeed we're slightly better. We're about -- I forget the latest. Laurie, it's about? 1.55, so we're through that period. So those things taken together, the petrol, the underlying recovery of customers, a couple of little local things in terms of our ability, I think means that the outlook for non-food will be a bit better going into Christmas.</p>

          <p>Can I just follow-up? So, are you still confident your exit rate &#x2013; you'll exit this year at 3 to 4% like-for-like?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think 3. I mean the context of that question was post recession is what you always used to speak about, 3 to 4%, possible, and it is possible. I don't think you'll exit at 4, but I think you can exit at 3.</p>
          <p>Now, as I said last time, I expected quarter one to be slow. I expected quarter two to be better, and it wasn't better. So we're about a percent behind where I expected to be. But I think I know what the factors were and so I think we can exit at 3, but we'll build toward it.</p>

          <p>Good Morning. Geoff Ruddell from Morgan Stanley. Two very different questions. Firstly, on India, if I may. When you first announced you were going into India you talked about the relationship with Star Bazaar, but you also talked about opening cash and carry outlets. And there was no mention of that in your presentation; I was wondering if that's still on your agenda.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the dotcom business in the UK, as I read the statement correctly, the 16% growth in the first half includes the non-food and the International, which I guess, therefore given the very strong rates of growth in those areas means that the core UK grocery dotcom business is probably growing high single-digit now, or thereabouts. And I was wondering if that slowdown is a reflection of either your belief in the maturity of the market, or whether your market share is unsustainably high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I do the dotcom first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that worth saying? I don't think it quite breaks down &#x2013; do we publish the separate figures? But if we don't, I'll guess at it. And if we don't publish it, I'm bound to be right. It's still in double-digits. I think it's because the size is such a big part of the total dotcom operation. The International is growing rapidly, but it's small, and direct is more material. But I doubt whether it would get to 20% of the grocery business. So it still is in double-digit. I think actually the year-on-year growth has been maintained. I don't think it's slowed.</p>
          <p>The service has improved a lot. We're getting very good &#x2013; we've done lots and lots of process improvements in our dotcom business. The customer feedback is very strong. I think &#x2013; I mean it is true; we have over time lost share simply because of new entrants. I think our starting share was over 70%, and then you've had Asda come into the market; and Ocado expand and Waitrose come in; and Sainsbury expand their network. So it's almost inevitable that you'd get some attrition. But we're still in the middle 50%, and I don't think our share has much altered in the last 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on India, on the cash and carry store, we'd hoped to get one opened in Mumbai. It's proved very difficult to secure the land that we wanted. But we have signed on a site in Bangalore and expect to open there the first half of next year, first half calendar year.</p>
          <p>You've got to make sure you're not forced to over pay. The team are ready. The wholesale company's set up. It's now supplying the whole of Star Bazaar. It's got the capability to do that for the cash and carry business. Star Bazaar's growing two places; West Coast and East Coast, around Mumbai, around Bangalore. They remain the targets, so by the time we get to this time next year, we should be able to at least show you a photograph and some customers.</p>

          <p>Hi. Tom Gadsby from Matrix. Quick question on the Bank. Can you give us an update on your ambition there? Can we expect some kind of a step change at some point in the near future?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The bank's growth is very good. We're growing &#x2013; as you can see from our results, the bank's growing at about 12%. But if you back out the fair value adjustments, if you back out the aspect that is attributable to migration, we've actually taken quite a big charge on the insurance book in the period as well, the circa 25 million. The underlying growth in the Bank is closer to 30%. So if you start to model that through coming through next year and the following year, you will see quite a good uptick in terms of overall Bank growth. I'm not going to give you a number, but you can do the modeling on that basis I think. So, pretty strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you not need to see a much bigger increase in the savings book though, or else look for funding elsewhere if you're going to really--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually we've got a surplus in the saving book. We're actually lending money to other banks at the moment because our savings book is larger than our loan and credit card book. We've got an increase in customer accounts and our savings book is growing. It's sitting at about 4.5 billion at the moment. Customer accounts have gone up by about 200,000 year-on-year, so there's enough growth in there.</p>
          <p>We're launching a new savings product really in the coming weeks; that will give us a bit more firepower. But my opinion is we can grow the savings book quite aggressively. There is an appetite to use us as a savings bank. If your question's kind of leading to, well, how do you finance other products going forward, like mortgages, then there will be an aspect of wholesale funding. But predominantly, it will be financed by our savings book.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It will be 2011. We've been very careful with the development of our infrastructure. It's going very well. The insurance platform is pretty much complete. We'll be writing new insurance on to that platform very soon. We've developed that, as you know, with Fortis. And the banking platform's pretty much complete as well. Hence, we're able to launch a savings product on to it. We see that as the best first product to launch on it. But we should be ready either second or third quarter of 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. Charles Allen from Consumer Equity Research. A couple of unrelated questions, if I could. First of all, could you just comment on why the stock level rose faster than sales in the first half? And as a more general question on the UK and the sale and leaseback program, how much operational tension do you think the UK business can take from rising rents in comparison to your peer group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right. The inventory level did increase half-on-half. But the average inventory level has remained below the half for last year, and really it's just about timing. So we've built in some fairly big events which required stock at that time. We're certainly not going to undermine the success of those events by trying to dive for the line on inventory. But the overall guidance in terms of working capital improvement year-on-year of 500 million, we're on target to achieve via the full year.</p>
          <p>And then your second question, which was about operational tension, you've seen an increase in the operating margin of the UK year-on-year. And that's despite putting in a net 40 million of extra costs from rent net of depreciation in the first half of the year. So we seem to have got the balance just about right. We can get good profit growth. In fact, ex the sale and leasebacks, the UK P&amp;L grew trading profit by about 8.6%, and post that, about 5.5%.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Marc de Speville from Redburn Partners. Two questions. Firstly, the UK expected or hoped for, like-for-like run rate of around 3% by year-end. What sort of food price inflation increase does that imply from here?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the UK margin was up nearly 10 basis points in H1 despite dilution from higher petrol contribution, presumably from faster growth of the higher margin services. So if petrol inflation subsides in H2, can we see a similar, or even higher margin evolution through less petrol dilution in H2 as the services continue to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean Laurie touches on the margin. On inflation, in those comments, I'm not really assuming a change in inflation. There is already some inflation in food. It depends how you measure it, between 2 and 3%, so what you've got is this curious picture of trading up, some food inflation and, therefore, negative volumes. And, as I say, I think those volumes are to with the cap on expenditure caused by the pinch on higher petrol prices.</p>
          <p>When that, as I say, annualizes, when it gets absorbed into the base, plus the gathering recovery anyway, they're the conditions that will allow a gentle rise towards 3% like-for-like. And that will be helped by inflation; it will be helped by inflation. I don't &#x2013; as far as we look at it, we can see some rise in inflation but not of the orders of magnitude that you saw in 2007 where, if you remember, I think it peaked, depends which measure, but 8%. So we would see it peaking at 3 to 4%, something like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's James Collins from Deutsche. A couple of questions, on the U.S. first. Firstly, in terms of the gross margin increase in the first half year-on-year, what's driving that? I guess specifically how much is coming from mix because I know you've made some big range changes there? And second on the U.S., looking beyond breakeven, if you were at full capacity at 400 stores in 2012, '13, what then drives the business on to good levels of profitability? Is it just the maturity of those existing stores? Or is there more to come in terms of covering the overall costs of the business?</p>
          <p>And then two questions on format. Can you talk about lower capital intensity formats? You talked a little bit about franchise, but I think there's probably something more there other than just franchise stores? And also, what's new in the new Extra store in Bratislava? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Extra is, first of all, it's got Services in it. So it's got a phone shop operated by Tesco, it's got an optician, it's got a pharmacy, and it's got a photo shop, and they're adding a very nice new set of services for customers and increasing the popular. We've invested in space for growing markets, reallocated the space into consumer electronics, into whole new ranges. Pet care department's grown, all the counters have gone up a notch to be a bit more contemporary. The alcohol range has widened. A lot of work in each category, module by module in food, to get the range right, putting in a bit more better and best, and the overall experience has improved.</p>
          <p>Probably the biggest change of all is the clothing offer. We've gone in, in Bratislava, in Petrzalka, up to 17,000 square feet of clothing and that's got 55% like-for-like, bigger ranges. The Central European clothing team we've had in place for three or four years, four years now actually, they've had double-digit like-for-like growth for all that time and now they've gone and really pushed the boat out.</p>
          <p>So, it's a great store for customers. And it's over &#x2013; how old is it? It must be 12 years. More than 10 years old; got a complete new lease of life. There's a Carrefour opposite it. We're very pleased and we've taken that same blueprint and put it into the other three and we're opening one in Izmir, I'm going to see it later this week. So very early days, but very, very promising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the U.S., the two questions on the U.S., the improvement in gross margin really is just the maturing of the model and it's marked and it's one of the reasons that gives me encouragement, because actually if you worked &#x2013; it never quite works like this, but if you worked on a stable margin year-on-year, your like-for-like growth would be another at least 10% higher. So &#x2013; and it's also a gathering like-for-like. I think we've broken it out in the pack second &#x2013; first quarter, second quarter, so you can see a gathering like-for-like.</p>
          <p>So, and that's without any help from the economy at all. So that's actually quite encouraging to see those improvements in margin and at the same time see very strong and improving like-for-like.</p>
          <p>In terms of the scale point, I mean it's theoretical. We will in theory be at capacity in Riverside in the factory. I actually think there's a bit more room in it when you get to it because everything else we've ever built, you find more capacity out of it. But notwithstanding that, it's so operationally geared the U.S. that when you break through the line it's a very steep build up into profitability.</p>
          <p>And the reason it's so operationally geared is 30% of everything we sell in the store we manufacture in the central kitchen and in the two campus partners. That's quite a bit upfront investment. And they're running at 20%, 25% capacity, I guess, theoretically.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; a lot of the stores are leasehold, so you get a lot of upfront gearing there. Remember, the leaseholds were taken right before the crunch, right at the peak, so some of them were a bit expensive the leaseholds. Whereas the later openings, you're averaging down quite quickly because you're getting &#x2013; you're opening those in the slump, so that's quite a good kicker.</p>
          <p>And obviously all the rest, the distribution, quite sophisticated overhead because we felt &#x2013; in the developing countries, you could ease your way in, you didn't have strong local competitors. In a developed market, you've got to put a lot of up front capability in. So the operational gearing is very good on the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of the stores that we can open and are opening in the future are a small format, which is predominately leasehold, or is indeed of a lower CapEx spend per square foot. So if you go from the extremes of franchise through to Express-like formats you'd be familiar with in the UK to small supermarkets, that's what we mean by lower capital intensity.</p>
          <p>And there's a mixture of build our own and leasehold within that as well. And we also call our online businesses a format as well. So, our grocery online business is a very low capital intensity and gives a great halo effect to every store that we put it into. Philip referenced the grocery home shopping business in Korea, it's just used the infrastructure of the stores that we already have.</p>

          <p>It's Dave McCarthy at Evolution. Just following up on the U.S. there, there's one bit I just can't get my mind around -- that despite all the positive things you've run through, your sales are up 47% and your underlying losses increased. So it kind of feels like there's something wrong with the operational model, so what is it that we haven't got and the missing part of the equation there?</p>
          <p>Next, on International returns, you've got four very good countries, been producing returns over 15% now for five years, six years since you've first shown us the bubble chart, and note we haven't got the bubble chart today; when are we going to see some other countries move from that kind of below 10% returns into the premier league?</p>
          <p>And then on like-for-like sales, are you still happy with the guidance you gave us a few months ago of a medium range annual target of 3 to 4% like-for-like? And then related to that, Terry, you just talked about 3 to 4 &#x2013; sorry, an exit rate of 3% this year. Of course, we've had the VAT increase, and I assume you're talking an in-VAT number there. On the last conference call, we clarified you thought that you've assumed no increase in VAT so, therefore, have you effectively cut the guidance for the year end from 3 to 4 down to 2?</p>

          <p>Shall I &#x2013; Laurie, you maybe do International returns; I'll do the others.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yes, yeah.</p>

          <p>Just quickly on the US &#x2013; the truth is, when you've got a new model with all of that upfront cost and largely leasehold, that when you expand at the same time as actually maturing the model, you can quite easily run into higher levels of losses until such time as the branch profitability of a new store is clearly into profit, which it's not at the moment; you have to wait for the model to mature. So that's why it's a little bit on a knife-edge in terms of how fast you grow against the progress you make on maturing the model, is the truth.</p>
          <p>It's not helped by having a number of stores that opens in the housing bust areas, which were taken at fairly high rents actually, and you've seen depopulation, not population growth. Nonetheless, we can see our way clear through that now, David. And we feel we can see enough to know that the levels at which stores will open, where we're now opening the areas, how quickly they'll come through to branch profitability. So that's why we've been able to say losses have peaked, which they have, and then obviously you'll see an improvement in the level of losses next year through to hitting breakeven in '12, '13.</p>

          <p>But I still don't understand why your underlying losses increased because you went from I think it was 85% to 95%. Laurie said that the two factories you bought were less than 10 million, and you've got 47% more sales in the till, so what &#x2013; and then you've given us a list of everything that has shown an improvement, the gross margin, the productivity, so what's the piece of the math that is going down to offset those gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no piece of math going down. If you look at the 47% growth, remember the like-for-like within that is 10%, it's gathering. So this 30% odd of new space &#x2013; and that new space comes on unprofitability at the moment and has to mature through to profitability, so in that sense that's how it works.</p>
          <p>Now, as the underlying model itself matures, when you open new space it doesn't dip under quite so much. It actually comes through much closer to profitability, actually opening at profitability, so that's the factor that's going on. And that's the thing that can allow you to accelerate your rate of opening. You can actually bring on more new sales because you're not taking the hit on profitability. And we're just moving out of that period really where you were taking such a hit on profitability when you opened space that it would have increased the total losses.</p>
          <p>On the UK, as I said in answer to an earlier question, we're about a percent behind where I expected to be at the moment, because the industry sales are a bit subdued. Our relative position is fine. We're growing market share. I think I know what the factors have been, and I'd expect sales like-for-like to grow to exit at 3%.</p>
          <p>Now what I'm saying by 3% is 3%, so it's notwithstanding VAT rates, David. I don't consider that a difference in forecast. You don't forecast on the basis of tax changes. And in terms of the potential for 3% to 4% guidance, I think that we can get back to that. But we've got to go with a recovering consumer, so that's in the recovered part of the cycle.</p>

          <p>You'll be pleased to know, Terry, that I don't actually have a question for you. But I think I'm one of the few analysts here that was around on your first analyst meeting, and it's actually somewhat frightening to think 15 years ago Bill Kerr and I were sitting -</p>

          <p>It is frightening that 15 years ago Bill Kerr and I were sitting in Liverpool anticipating how you would do as a 30-something Chief Executive of Tesco, and it's quite frightening to think on that basis. But a lot has changed since then. We weren't quite using quills then, but we were using fax machines, for example, to communicate. And I think the fact that you've delivered financial performance of 4, 5 times growth of the business is a quite outstanding achievement. And there's just two things I wanted to say; from an ex-teenage scribbler, thank you very much for the amount of material you've given us to write about and comment on. And I think it's only appropriate as well we wish you a fantastic retirement. And I hope you have a lot of fun because you've put a hell of a shift in for Tesco, and congratulate you on that.</p>
