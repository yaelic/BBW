          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to today's sanofi-aventis group conference call. For your information this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Sanjay Gupta. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us for the presentation of our 2007 results. Let me take care of the legal formalities first. During this conference call, we may make projections and forward-looking statements that are based on the management's current expectations. Actual results may vary, and may be different, due to various factors. These risk factors can be consulted by reading our 20-F which was filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>We'll now begin the presentation of 2007 results with a short introduction by Mr. G&#xE9;rard Le Fur.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello everybody. Although the pharmaceutical environment was a little bit complicated last year, we were able to deliver a solid performance one more time.</p>
          <p>EPS excluding selected items is &#x20AC;5.17, which corresponds to an increase to close to 6% in euros and more than 15% in U.S. dollars. The earning growth in fact was ahead of our guidance, which I remind you was initially 9, then 10% and finally bottom line which is 13.2%.</p>
          <p>We have an ongoing selective adaptation of our resources and in fact although the decrease in the group outcome account is only 1.5%, in fact, as you can see in the slide, there is an increase of roughly 7% in the vaccines area and a decrease in the Pharma.</p>
          <p>Concerning Pharma, in fact we stabilized the R&amp;D headcounts but we decreased the head count of both support function and industry &#x2013; and the industrial level of about 4%. Inside Pharma operations, one more time it was heterogeneous because in fact we decreased the head count. In U.S. and Europe, for instance, for close to 7%. Although, we increased the head count elsewhere, especially at the intercontinental and Asia Pacific of more than 4%.</p>
          <p>We are, as you can see here, a continuing decrease in the SG&amp;A to sales ratio starting from more than 30% in 2005 to less than 27% in 2007 and we believe that we are very competitive concerning this ratio versus our peers.</p>
          <p>We still have 8 blockbusters, meaning eight compounds of over 1 billion of sales, and 4 of them are double-digit growth compounds. This is especially the case with Plavix with an increase close to 30% and we are quite happy of the full recovery of Plavix in the States.</p>
          <p>Lovenox is still the number in a very &#x2013; in a still growing market and Lantus beat the 2 billion turnover this year with an increase of close to 30%. Moreover, Taxotere, which is the anti-cancer agent with broadest spectrum has a turnover close to 2 billion and a double digit growth.</p>
          <p>In fact, definitely the vaccine is a strategic priority for us and in fact we got an increase of the sales of more than 14% last year and right now the vaccine business represents 10% of the consolidated net sales.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are leader in the area of the flu vaccine and we do have very new vaccines such as Menactra with a huge increase as you can see here. Moreover, don't forget the successful launch of Gardasil with our &#x2013; by our European JV with Merck.</p>
          <p>We still have leading position in tomorrow's major markets. For instance, we are number one in BRIC-M countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico, and this is thanks to a full-scope offer for our innovative products and vaccines that also generate OTC and standard local ranges. This is due to some substantial investment sustained over time.</p>
          <p>Concerning R&amp;D, last September Marc Cluzel and his team made a full presentation of the portfolio and announced the target for submission for the period of 2007 till 2010. And moreover, we wanted to strengthen our involvement bio-tech.</p>
          <p>Today as you will see in this presentation, the projects are in line with the targets announced at the R&amp;D Day; and moreover, the business development alliances are able to support our biotech strategy. This is the case for instance with Regeneron but don't forget what happened today with Vioxx and this also true in the vaccines business such as with Acambis or Oxford BioMedica.</p>
          <p>Concerning the dividends in line with our commitments, we propose a strong increase in the dividends. It's &#x20AC;2.07 per share which corresponds to an increase of more than 18%, and a payout with a 40% of earnings per share excluding selective items, which is in line with our European peers. And as you can see in the slide, we doubled the dividend from 2003 to 2007.</p>
          <p>And I just would like to remind you that we implemented a share buyback program that we acquired last year, our share till 1.8 billion and we still acquire new shares till May by using the 1.2 billion that we are allowed to.</p>
          <p>So that's only what I wanted to say to you and if you don't mind, Jean-Claude Leroy will present to you right now the finance part of our presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean, and good morning, and good afternoon to all of you. From a financial perspective, a few words about the performance in 2007.</p>
          <p>First a few highlights from the 2007 year, which was first mainly driven by the full recovery for Plavix in the States that was the case at the end of the first half of 2007 where Plavix took its place as it has before. Second, as you know, 2007 was a year where there was an impact of some generification of some main product and Hanspeter will be back on that afterwards. But &#x2013; and I just mention then.</p>
          <p>And Eloxatin in Europe, to say the least, impacted our sales development.  Facing this situation we &#x2013; and also the change, mainly in Europe and the state of the organization that we are facing in the pharmaceutical business, we adapted strongly our selling and general expense as we did before. We went on this one. We came up to selling, general and administrative expenses, amounting 26.9 on sales ratio, which is a decrease by 1.4 as compared to what we were in 2006, 28.3. And then I can tell you that from a benchmark perspective we are well ahead of the general average. Just for information purpose, the benchmark is little bit over 30% in '07.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the profitability ratio, there are a bunch of them. But in a few words you can see that we were able to increase the operating income current ratio to sales. And as you can see just one figure, this is an increase by 6.5%, including exchange rate, which is to be related to the increase on a comparable basis to the sales which is 2.8.</p>
          <p>So we have that leverage in that first part of the P&amp;L, which is a reflect of the &#x2013; all the operations we were capable to drive to save money on the mainly SG&amp;A. But as you would see later, not only on this line item to come up to an adjusted net income excluding selected items ratio which is 24.8% on net sales this year, which is an improvement by 1.6% over last year. Once again something which is remarkable among our peers, and to end up on the EPS excluding selected items.</p>
          <p>And I would point out that this is an increase by 15.7% in U.S. dollars and this is not just to please the <mark type="inaudible" /> but this is the only currency in which we can compare what we do against or among the others and you know that the reporting of the majority of our peers is in U.S. dollars. So if you make the comparison, you will see that the 15.7 is well comparing to the others.</p>
          <p>A few words about the fourth quarter before going back to the entire year, because what you've seen in the fourth quarter is a so-called contradiction between the evolution in sales and the evolution at the EPS level.  A decline against &#x2013; I'd say a strong increase, especially if I am talking in U.S. dollar. So net sales as you see a decline of 2.2 on a comparable basis, flu vaccine, there was a swing of around &#x20AC;200 million between quarter number three and quarter number four when you compare with last year 2006. And this is more than offsetting the decline at the net sales table.</p>
          <p>I could add that there is an additional one point, which is due to the fact that we recouped, we bought back some product from our Japanese associates for a long time. And that by doing so, buying back some inventories we had to cancel the related sales, which is a negative, in fact, in other words. And this is what is written there at the Pharma level.</p>
          <p>All in all, we are delivering a sales evolution which is more or less in line with what we have been delivering on the three quarters of 2007.</p>
          <p>At the same token, we have a cost of sale which is decreasing or burdening. You see 28.4 compared to 26.6. Once again the flu vaccine swing effects the exchange rate, and you would remember that when it comes to the euro-dollar exchange rate, we have a drop which is rather important in &#x2013; during the fourth quarter.  Obviously the Ambien generics impact which is at the third quarter of the fourth quarter comparison which is <mark type="inaudible" /> AV. All we know, with these three line items you would have a cost of sales ratio which would be equivalent to the '06 situation.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter than it was during the three first quarter of '07, 8.3 before exchange rate, when it was 4.4 during the three first quarters.  Two main items to explain this difference. First, well, it was a little bit heavier in the vaccines &#x2013; the R&amp;D vaccines. All in all, we finished up in the R&amp;D vaccines with a said gain of the rate on sales. That we are on a global &#x2013; pharmaceutical and global continuing basis and a special one which is the cost of discontinuing the Nycomed Altana contract; when we get back the ciclesonide product to our partner and we had to discontinue operation and close back one of our facilities in the U.K.</p>
          <p>To go down, remaining simply that we went up decreasing our SG&amp;A ratio and that the spending was decreasing over 7%; nonetheless, we are showing an operating <mark type="inaudible" /> diminishing by a little bit more 13%. Once again, you take into account that swing I was talking about in the flu vaccine business and the exchange rate, you would come to something which is totally comparable or stable from one year to another.</p>
          <p>Why do we come up again of the P&amp;L with a, I would say, a strong increase at the EPS level, &#x20AC;16, 18 in dollars simply because we encountered that recovery of Plavix that was mentioned earlier, and this is particularly true in the fourth quarter of '07 as compared to '06 which was certainly down and Plavix is obviously one of the two line items which are part of the explanation. So Plavix from one part in the U.S., the other is monitoring the expense during the fourth quarter as we did before.</p>
          <p>Now let's go quickly through the various big line items of the '07 P&amp;L.  To begin with the sales, starting from 2.8 on a comparable basis gross, the exchange rate effect is negative 2.8. Out of that 80% is due to the U.S. dollars. So we finish up with minus 1.1 on a reported level. As you can see, it's not very meaningful to look at the evolution directly as &#x2013; on the first column which tells you that net sales is minus 1.1 where operating income &#x2013; current is minus 0.1%.</p>
          <p>We prefer to give you more information excluding the exchange rate so that you are able to better monitor, understand and judge our performance; net sales 2.8, operating income &#x2013; current plus 6.5. That shows you the leverage we were able to put during this year, and as I showed you on the evolution of the head count that is a lot to do with this particularly positive evolution from sales to the operating income.</p>
          <p>Let's go ahead on these three main item to be viewed &#x2013; a little of the view of what's going to happen or what should happen during the year 2008 &#x2013; 2007, and the high cost of sales, so a little decrease or burden of 0.4, obviously definitely impact of Ambien IR in the U.S. This slide shows you that we've done a lot of things in the industrial area, not mentioning them, not making a lot of publicity but simply decreasing selling, closing a re-adaptable mean to come down on this line item to do what we have to do.</p>
          <p>What we expect for 2008 is to try and keep up the 27 cost of sales level out this way, thanks to the Copaxone settlement and a contract which is going to help simply because in this contract the costs of sales was rather heavy, this contract ends up at the end of the first quarter. We will be back on that in more detail at the end of the first quarter. But simply keep in mind that the Copaxone and of the contract is not going to change the bottom line of the full group.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the R&amp;D, we said that we've encountered 5.5 increase excluding exchange rate basis, this is true obviously for the global group, in Pharma, a little bit less. I would say, in vaccine a lot more, plus 12.7%.  We've said earlier that we had to invest in this area, we will keep on investing. When it comes to the global evolution, in that you can expect in the year 2008, let's say that no significant rise in R&amp;D expense is to be expected next year or this year.</p>
          <p>Last, very important line items, selling and general expenses. So SG&amp;A, I know, very improvement -year of improvement, the ratio is 26.90. It's a lot less than the average of our competitors.  We go on adapting and you've seen through G&#xE9;rard's presentation that it's an adaptation in the western part of the world where it is an adaptation on a plus basis, I mean, going on and being behind investment and the countries which are showing an improvement in the gross. So we still are improving, we will go on adapting also in this line item next year.</p>
          <p>To go directly to the bottom line, to come to quick comments, income tax expense, a decrease, unfortunately it's not purely a decrease because of the debt reductions decrease of say 100 million interest expense because of that and unfortunately minus 40 because of higher interest rate. I am sure all of you know the reason for that higher interest rates, especially in the second part of the year. Income tax expense, what is clear is that the effective tax rate is 30 &#x2013; with 30% is unchanged from 2006 and we should get around 1 point improvement next year especially due to the decrease in the German tax rate.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we come up we said, I've said, before tax selected items that are before going to the <mark type="inaudible" /> I want to point out some &#x2013; very quickly on the selected item. You know that these items which we emphasized on are unpredictable. They are mainly driven by seeing such as tax and new role reserve of settlements of disputes. As you &#x2013; you don't &#x2013; you see that from last year capital gains or just the restructuring because this is the main component. As you can see it's very unpredictable. Positive last year, positive this year, positive last year, mainly through capital gains positive this year mainly as through settlement of tax disputes or then contributed to the bottom line.  And we will therefore come up from &#x2013; trying to do that &#x2013; okay, thank you &#x2013; trying to come from the adjusted net income of over &#x20AC;7 billion which is &#x20AC;5.28 a share, to the excluding selected item. And once again, this is the one on which we want to revoke on which we've based our guidance and we will went on basing our guidance close to 7 billion, &#x20AC;5.7 a share plus 6 in euro and plus, over 15 in U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>I don't go back to the explanation G&#xE9;rard gave that we did better and ahead of the guidance by 3%. He said that we made 13.3 not purely because of the evolution of the exchange rates; it's the main reason being the cost containment that we were able to achieve during the year.</p>
          <p>The '08 guidance and, once again G&#xE9;rard will be back on that a little bit later on, but we propose and we commit to a very major event towards EPS excluding selected item growth around 7%. Obviously we have to take a basis, so it's calculated at constant 2007 euro-dollar parity and you will know that this parity was 1.371 as an average for the year at 2007 and we give the sensitivity to the euro-dollar parity. If you work down statement of cash flow, once again we were able to decrease the level of debt at the company from 5.8 back to &#x20AC;4.2 billion and as in token we delivered a cash return to the shareholders which in '07 was &#x20AC;4.2 billion, exactly the double of the 2.1 in '06 for dividend in share repurchase. This is starting from the 5.8 billion of free cash flow before dividend and share repurchase. You could say a little bit later that the 6.2 of 2006, remember that in 2006 we had at disposal of assets of around 1.3 billion, when this year in 2007 we had only 300 million. So the comparison is once again a good comparison from 2007 to 2006 and as you can see the gearing is very low on the balance sheet at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>So, to finish up I want to repeat what G&#xE9;rard said about the increase in dividend, our commitment, we just made it, and I guess it is fair to said that we are just doing what we said we would be doing. We are very well indebted. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Claude. And the next speaker will be Hanspeter Spek from Pharmaceutical Operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, good afternoon to everybody. I will try to cover on four issues in my presentation. First of all, comment again on the performance in 2007. Second, to analyze this performance also from a regional and geographical angle. Third, to comment on the performance of some key products, and lastly to give you some comments on how we see the pharmaceutical industry landscape changing and how we intend to cope with it.</p>
          <p>So, first on the overall sales results, it has not been mentioned so far in absolute terms. So I do it, we have been selling slightly more than 28 billion and if you compare the left part of the slide which is reflecting our quarterly sales in the fourth quarter 2007 and compare with the annual development, you see a slight change from plus 2.8% to minus 2.2%, which could indicate that the fourth quarter has been relatively lighter in comparison with the others. Beyond the comments that Jean-Claude just made a couple of minutes ago, yes, it is true that it is first of all due to the vaccines; the vaccines had earlier anticipated sales in 2006 in the third quarter right now in 2007 that took place in the fourth quarter, and the dollar exchange rate.</p>
          <p>As you see from the next chart, if you focus sales analysis on Pharma sales only you see that of course there has been a significant dip through the generification of Ambien IR during the second quarter 2007. But then later on you see very clearly that the pharmaceutical sales in the fourth quarter had nicely recovered and are more or less exactly on the same level as the second quarter. So whatever you see as a visual reduction of sales it is strictly technical and consequently we look with a lot of confidence also in the first quarter 2008 of course.</p>
          <p>Now looking to the product, there are a number of, as I see, very &#x2013; positive comments to be made. First of all as he commented all our major products show a very strong growth. This is true for Lovenox, growing over the year by more than 13%; Plavix growing on a worldwide basis, consolidated, has nothing to do of course with the sales <mark type="inaudible" /> 9.5%; Lantus 29%, and Taxotere nearly 12%.</p>
          <p>Second, you see very well that all those products even have a slight acceleration in the fourth quarter which is exactly in line with what I said before, the fact that the fourth quarter has been a good &#x2013; reasonably good quarter for our Pharmaceutical Operations where we see a further acceleration.</p>
          <p>Overall our 15 leading products show a good growth and this is especially true if you eliminate the negative growth of those products which are all being touched by generification, first of all most importantly of course Ambien IR in the U.S.; Eloxatin in Europe, and Amaryl and Tritace on a worldwide basis. If you would eliminate those products, you come up with a growth rate of well above 10% which means very much above the worldwide growth of the pharmaceutical market which will be between 6 and 7% for the total year.</p>
          <p>Now focusing more on a regional angle, you'll see and that's a good tradition now that the let's call them, developing markets contribute more and more to our growth whilst Europe has even slightly decreasing sales besides the dollar effect. This is of course due to the continued intervention on pharmaceutical stock prices in Europe. But you see then if you combine BRIC plus Mexico plus rest of the world that those two parts of the world meanwhile even contribute more to our growth than the United States, which is a strong confirmation of what we have said in earlier years that it is important to concentrate on those markets in order to leverage future potential.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, United States of course remains for us the key market where we achieve more than 50% of our sales and you see that besides Ambien, we are in a very good and positive setting; the right side of the chart you see the impressive recovery of Plavix, as mentioned before, of course not in our books consolidated, but nevertheless very important for our baseline. And you see that our other key products are all growing nicely more or less in two digits, and if you go through a product like Lantus and Ambien CR even into very high two digits.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we have adapted our structures &#x2013; our commercial structures but not only in United States due to the changes of our portfolio and you see that there has been a significant reduction in sales force head count by nearly 20% of heads. Over the last two years from previously 9,500 pharmaceutical sales representative, we are today at approximately 7,800. So you see that restructurization and continued growth not at all an opposite.</p>
          <p>And now to focus on another part of the world, Japan historically a soft spot in our environment; for historical reasons we had issued several statements that we will target Japan for accelerated growth and we are content to report that in 2007 we really made that big step forward; you see that our commercial presence has been increased by 11% to $1.3 billion. This is not a figure you would see in our economics but you'd find again in 2007 in IMS. And you see then first is that all our key products on the right side of the chart performed very well above their respective markets, and of course one of the big growth engine in Japan became Plavix, which is totaling more than &#x20AC;10 million sales on a monthly basis by the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>What is the outlook? I cannot say differently but saying that this is bright outlook because we have made significant efforts in 2007 to integrate sales of products, which have been with partners, Jean-Claude was referring <mark type="inaudible" /> buyback of outstanding shares in joint ventures and you see that we estimate for 2008 in our sales in the neighborhood of 1.2, &#x20AC;1.3 billion on one side by reintegration of product, on the other side by internal growth and of course within Plavix will continue to play a very important role within this. We are today the fastest growing international company in Japan; overall even the fastest growing pharmaceutical company in Japan and we will picture ourselves very well among the leading 10 in 2008 and we believe from therefore the years to come for the given reason we have a bright outlook for this very important market, which is the second most important market within pharmaceutical market in the world.</p>
          <p>BRIC and Mexico, shows markets where the future developments will continue to come from; you see for a very simple reason, why the macro economic situation in those markets is <mark type="inaudible" /> nothing to do, let's say with Europe or with United States, we see a GDP growth of close to 10% and consequently a pharmaceutical growth of being close to 14 to 15%. We performed very well from our market leading positions. You see us ahead of Novartis, Pfizer and others, this approaching 2007 of 11.5% totaling nearly 2 billion of sales and is once again leveraging in a good even ideal manner. We see opportunities coming from our base business, the top 15 and growing synergies with vaccines and this of course is supported by tentative investments over the last year into our structure, and this is not only for promotion.</p>
          <p>Other sunny side of the street, so to say for us, China, we have achieved growth in China of more than 300 million growing by 36%. We continued so not for our consecutive number of living to higher two digits. We see that in China the picture is different from other developing markets, the business is totally and only driven by our innovative product, but is strategically and technically very much supported by our full footprint in terms of organization. You will see from the chart that we have regionalized China with ten regions. We are strongly convinced that China cannot be marketed a different way than by very solid and strong regionalization. And you also see that we have in total three manufacturing plants, one newly funded during 2007 for vaccines out of those three.</p>
          <p>I jumped again on another continent, South America. With Brazil, we are the number one in the company. We see once again that the starting point is very different to, let's say, China, we have a mixture of portfolio. There we make significant sales even with PHC and OTC products we see that the base business plays a very important role and yes, once again, we have a two-digit sales growth selling margin, half a billion. We are fully present once again with the large production unit and we will further leverage this as of 2007/2008 in going out, in offensive generics, in these market because we are just convinced that this market needs also more access to pharmaceutical products and we have to make those products available in producing generics at adequate cost and adequate price.</p>
          <p>Three comments on major products besides Lantus because Lantus will be covered intensively later by Pierre Chancel. Let me start with Lovenox, still the most important product in our portfolio, with sales of 2.6 billion, you see once again attributed growth rate of 13.4%. We have gained nearly two points of market share and each market share point adds value of approximately 60 million. There is a lot of opportunity<mark type="inaudible" />  outset because you're seeing in very impressive terms that only approximately half of those patients who should get prophylactics with the relevant treatment of low molecular weight heparin is getting his treatment today. Today we further see very, very positive support from the relevant guidelines. And yes, we have also been comforted during 2007 by the recent declaration of the Federal Drug Administration in the context of approving biogeneric low molecular weight heparin, a stance which has been meanwhile confirmed in a recent publication by all relevant academic proofs.</p>
          <p>Plavix, besides the <mark type="inaudible" /> coming sales, we believe that Plavix will continue to grow up in front of the upcoming <mark type="inaudible" /> competition. We are eager to answer your questions in this respect. We see mainly two reasons for our continued growth: one, we have started to advertise Plavix in the field of peripheral arterial disease, also to <mark type="inaudible" /> 2007, and we are expecting for the second half of the year the results of an important clinical trial, where Plavix is being used in arterial fibrillation. If this trial turns out to be positive, it will give us access to approximately 60 million patients which are today not having access to our Plavix treatment.</p>
          <p>Taxotere, an issue for me which I took over the last year, is a little bit personal. I was committed to bring together with my colleagues this product back to a real solid growth, and yes we are happy and proud to report that we succeeded. The product is not only nearly selling 2 billion, but it is also growing by 12%; as G&#xE9;rard mentioned earlier, it is the cytotoxic with the largest scope of indications, 8 in the United States and 11 in the European Community and we continue to try out this product further and we believe that we have significant additional opportunity. Last word from a portfolio angle on the base business, the so-called base business which represents more than 8 billion.</p>
          <p>And here, yes, we are equally happy to report that we continue to succeed to keep this base business stable, you see that if you eliminate out of the sales 2007, <mark type="inaudible" /> which is more an accident than anything else in this respect, the sales of those products are flat. And more importantly, you see that in many parts of the world you have three examples, Latin America, Africa and Middle East, the products are not only flat, they are even growing at two digits because they still are very, very valid for those markets in terms of epidemiology, but also cost.</p>
          <p>Now let me conclude with some comments on the landscape. I believe that 2007 has been a turning point for this industry, because finally this industry has stopped and said that the market is changing and the industry has started to change itself. Innovation, where you could say that you have today three market models: the emerging market, the intermediate market and the advanced market, and yes it is evident that the trend goes to the right side of the chart and it is marked by an increasing number of entry barriers and hurdles. If this is the best part, I strongly believe that the good side is that as more hurdles exist, as more opportunities are to exist for us to interfere and have impact on those market conditions, that we have an organization in place which is flexible enough and intelligent enough to do that.</p>
          <p>And it is therefore that we continued to try for stronger regionalization, we have started to do so in 2007 to address those three markets' needs, as once again they are outlined here in the chart you have in front of you, which means we delegate no responsibility to those markets in order to get closer to our customers to take a good decision in a more rapid speed a the point of sale where really the issues and the opportunity lay.</p>
          <p>To really conclude, let me show you three examples where we have been acting differently to us in the industry, and where we believe we have superior results. The first example genericization, the example given is Eloxatine in Germany. We have generic &#x2013; very strong generic competition, approximately 5-10 generic products are on the market since March, 2007. And you see that through proactive measures we have managed to keep about 75% of the volume part of the market, which has at least two advantages. First, we keep our factories busy, second we keep the patients on same treatment, we don't expose the patients to a change in treatment and last but not least as a consequence, we keep our positions as therapy captains in their respective fields, in colon cancer &#x2013; where as you know of course we are preparing new products to be launched within the imminent future.</p>
          <p>Second example, regionalization you have here the landmap of the United Kingdom, but it's equally true for the United States. Both markets are undergoing, in the fields of healthcare and the way healthcare is being financed, strong regionalization between the West and East Coast in the United States, and between London and let's say Aberdeen in Scotland and consequently, we have totally reworked our structures in the same sense that we built our organization around the decision bodies which are in both countries and those are only examples is that more and more regional.</p>
          <p>Also as more qualitative measures cannot go without a strong effort on the quantitative side, and you see here the example, and you see that overall we have been reducing the numbers of our sales representatives. Once again, without making a lot of noise, once again in a very fair and integrated way for the people concerned. Nevertheless, we have made a significant reduction in our overall head count in promotions, and we are have in the same period succeeded to increase as a qualitative and quantitative benchmark, such as the number of calls per sales representative and as well the number of education days and coaching days out in the field. With this we permanently change and adapt our commercial models, we see many trends which goes more to the point of sales which means pharmacy and we make the necessary adjustments in terms of organization, but of course also in terms of economic policy.</p>
          <p>So to sum it up, I believe that 2007 has not only confirmed that we are able to deliver what we have predicted, before we have overdelivered. And besides, I strongly believe that we have built a very, very solid basis to master and successfully manage the changing environment in changing ourselves as a company during 2007 for the years to come. Thank you so much, and I pass on to Pierre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, good morning, everyone. I am going to cover the 2007 result and some key achievements. And then I will present you the 2008 and beyond ambition in diabetes for sanofi-aventis. So we are very pleased to present Aventis crossed the &#x20AC;2 billion threshold 2007, more exactly it's &#x20AC;2.031 billion in 2007. We have a growth rate of almost 30% growth. What is really interesting and so is to look at right hand side of the chart, which shows in the U.S. the very strong growth of the Lantus family, which is a virus cartridge and <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S. It is <mark type="inaudible" /> so you can see that it's a straight line and the straight line is the same, that the result that we have got in '06, '05 and also in '04, which means that although the launch of Byetta or even Januvia or Janumet, which is not on this slide, actually Lantus has managed to maintain strong growth and a very healthy growth.</p>
          <p>Key achievement during 2007 is, I am going to the guidelines actually, that were made public in 2007, ADA and EASD guidelines, fully recognizing the basal insulin as the most effective to treat A1-C. As you can see right, with lifestyle intervention and metformin, today basal insulin, and Lantus is 70% of total basal insulin is qualified as the most effective, when sulfonylurea</p>
          <p>is expensive, and Glitazone is unqualified. And again, it is not my words, it's the ADA words. The product, which can be second line, but potentially can increase risk of CHF.</p>
          <p>Last, but not least in terms of achievement is the launch of Lantus SoloSTAR and Apidra SoloSTAR and again see in this slide also the impressive ramp up of Lantus SoloSTAR in the US when compared with Flexpen. And in Spain the strong push given by SoloSTAR and Apidra when compared again with the benchmark, which was &#x2013; which is actually NovoRapid with is a short-acting analog from Nova in the U.S. As a matter of fact, the ambition for 2000 and beyond is to move from the number one insulin, to the number one anti-diabetic drug worldwide by sales and today we are already number one in Europe, number three in the U.S., and number 2 worldwide. But clearly the ambition is to become the leading anti-diabetic product worldwide. And our ambition obviously is not only to focus on Lantus as a standalone, but also to maximize the full potential of the diabetes franchise with Lantus, indeed <mark type="inaudible" /> and I will allude to it in some time when looking at the emerging market.</p>
          <p>Reason for confidence is based on the market environment and business conditions; more and more patient diabetes is the epidemic of the 21st century and also you see that 60, 70% of patients are still not come forward. Second point is that intervention will be made earlier and earlier and this already started because today insulin and Lantus actually, need help drive insulinization earlier, post diagnosis. Second point is as the basis of our confidence, is the very strong position of Lantus. Today is well recognized in &#x2013; by the payers and you see on these slides actually the position of Lantus in the managed care organization in the U.S., almost 100% of Tier 2, or higher coverage, which is clearly the recognition of Lantus' value by the payers.</p>
          <p>Two is a strong commitment and ambition in the emerging markets. A good portfolio to start with, as I said with Lantus and Ambien, which is very well positioned to tackle the &#x2013; as an oral form and so the diabetic population where the problem is probably more insulin deficiency than insulin sensitization. So what we want is to redo the job, expand market technologies education, influence market with the established, clear guidelines according to ADA, EASD and IDF guidelines, drive the global business management and as Hanspeter alluded to, clearly increase investments. Two is a major investment in <mark type="inaudible" /> operations, so it gives us the means to succeed, increased capacity in active ingredients, cartridge, file, new devices and we are even exploring additional capability in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>The third point is the portfolio. I already alluded to the current marketed product but I want to strongly highlight, the future portfolio, and with our GLP-1 agonist AVE10, <mark type="inaudible" /> Acomplia, that will be expended with the filing of the diabetes indication by 2009 will give us again the new breadth to accelerate in diabetes management. Diabetes is an evolving disease, each step deserves a combination therapy on new treatment and also with the diabetes type II or diabetic patients actually have a lot of comorbidities and the old rationale or strategy for the portfolio will be to offer the best product alone or in combination with others to tackle and address each step of the diabetes disease.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, what we want to go is we want &#x2013; we need to tackle the last dimension which is to move actually from the management of risk factor or surrogate marker to move to the prevention of cardiovascular complication, and this is the ORIGIN [Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention] trial. ORIGIN is to be a very interesting and exciting study. Results will be available in 2010 and the point with this is clearly to go beyond or earlier than the ADA or EASD algorithm, which means that in this study, 20% of patients are IGD &#x2013; impaired glucose tolerance patients, so default diagnosis, current diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes patients that's diagnosed so with maybe or all and not more. And clearly the goal, the question is can early use of Lantus reduce CV events in patients with clear diabetes and diabetes more than [inaudible] Clearly, this is creating or giving us again the means to create a new start out and move again forward in the designation of ambition in innovative Type II diabetes management.</p>
          <p>So all in all, and this is my last slide actually, we clearly have an ambition vision and aspiration in diabetes to reinforce our position to become the world class leader in diabetes. And we will not develop this if we are not the best partner for patient healthcare and providers, healthcare authorities and payers in order to again to maximize our very strong position in the diabetes business.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning. Sanofi Pasteur experienced strong growth in 2007. Sales were up 14.5% on a comparable basis. Our growth was driven across all of our product franchises. I would like to point out that our joint venture in Europe, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, exceeded &#x20AC;1 billion in sales for the first time driven by the launch of Gardasil, which generated &#x20AC;341 million in sales.</p>
          <p>Looking at our flu business, our flu strategy has only four components. The first component is to drive the seasonal flu from marketplace; the second component is to expand the capacity to basically fulfill the market demand. The third component is to develop innovative vaccines, particularly for the elderly, who can benefit from increased protection. And the third is to continue with our aggressive pandemic preparedness.</p>
          <p>On a seasonal basis, we recorded 180 million doses of production and sale in 2007. This is up 10 million doses. We had strong sales of Vaxigrip and Fluzone worldwide. In terms of capacity, we are approaching the completion of a new facility in the U.S. that will give us 100 million doses of additional capacity. That facility will come online in 2009. We have announced plans to basically build a bulk manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China and we have both formulation and filling facilities under construction right now in France and the U.S., and these will come online in the staged fashion from 2009 to 2011.</p>
          <p>In terms of new products, we are working on a number of new products to improve the efficacy. The first is a flu microinjection system. This product was actually filed in EU in December and the file was accepted for review. We will file for the same product or similar products using Fluzone in 2009. This coming year, we will be filing for an improved flu product in the U.S. which will increase immunogenicity, and that filing is scheduled for Q2. Our shell culture program is also progressing quite well.</p>
          <p>In terms of the <mark type="inaudible" /> area, we recorded nearly &#x20AC;100 million of sales of H5N1 contracts with the U.S. Government, and we licensed the first prototype vaccine in U.S. and have filed a mock dossier in the EU. Additionally, we have had very results with our novel adjuvant. This has indicated that we might be able to lower the dose of a pandemic vaccine to as low as 3.8 or even 1.9 micrograms.</p>
          <p>Looking specifically at the U.S. for the first time in seven years, the industry not only met but actually exceeded market demand in 2007. It's projected that 130 million doses were delivered to the U.S. marketplace and about 110 to 50 million doses were actually used for immunization. Sanofi Pasteur sold its entire production of 50 million doses in U.S. In the U.S., the focus now is to return to expanding immunization rates, which were suspended several years ago by the ACIP due to the shortages. The ACIP has a goal of universal growth recommendation in the U.S. and if you look at the targeted population where they are recommending immunization, it exceeds 200 million people.</p>
          <p>Looking at our Polio franchise, which is the cornerstone of our pediatric products, sales were &#x20AC;660 million in 2007 and we expect this franchise to approach &#x20AC;1 billion in the next several years. The main drivers in 2007 was the launch of a pentavalent vaccine, Pentaxim; this was launched in Mexico and Turkey. Mexico was the first Latin American country now to basically move from whole cell pertussis to acellular pertussis and from oral polio vaccine to an activated polio vaccine. We expect the rest of Latin America to follow over the next several years. Turkey did the same and was the first major market in Asia to do that. In 2008, we expect Pentaxim to basically continue expanding into the international zone to launch Pentacel in the U.S. and complete the development of Pediacel in Europe with a filing in 2009.</p>
          <p>In terms of our Booster business, the booster products are targeted for adolescents and adults. We had very strong growth in 2007 of 27% and sales now over &#x20AC;44 million. The Pertussis base boosters within this franchise basically grew 45%, and we expect strong growth in the future. In fact, we would expect the booster marketplace to double in the next several yeas as we see increased recommendations within the EU and the U.S. in immunized adolescents and adults. One of the things that have been observed by the policymakers is that infants that are most susceptible to the disease actually contract the disease from siblings and parents and healthcare workers, and these are the targets for the booster business.</p>
          <p>Looking at bacterial meningitis. This is a devastating disease. Meningitis is often misdiagnosed. It has a rapid onset of actions and it has high morbidity and mortality. It's one of the biggest challenges in terms of providing coverage, because it's caused by multiple serotypes. Our quadrivalent vaccine, Menactra, achieved very strong growth in 2007. The growth rate was over 80%. Our sales now again are over &#x20AC;40 million, we secured a strong recommendation from the ACIP for all 11 to 18 year olds. We also secured a two to ten year license in 2007 in the U.S. This product is going to be a major growth driver in the future for us as we broaden recommendation in the U.S., increase our capacity. We have plans to produce 8 to 10 million doses in several years. And then in 2010 a new facility will come online which has the capacity over 20 million doses. That will allow us to basically leverage the opportunities in Europe as well as in the International zone.</p>
          <p>Looking quickly at Gardasil, Gardasil was launched in the late first quarter in Europe and it achieved sales of &#x20AC;340 million. Gardasil is on its way to being a blockbuster. It has clear benefits as a quadrivalent vaccine affecting against serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18. The main objective in 2008 will be securing the recommendations and reimbursements. In 2007, Germany was the first with this and we saw a tremendous update, and recently France basically was on board with our recommendation on Gardasil as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of our future growth, one of our key strategies is forming alliances with Biotech firm. And we've had a number of deals that closed in 2007. We had two partnerships with Acambis; one for Japanese encephalitis, which is endemic throughout the Asia/Pacific region. The other with Acambis was the West Nile virus.  And West Nile virus has become endemic in the U.S. and these two products strengthen our travel endemic franchise. We formed partnership with Crucell for rabies monoclonal antibodies, and this is a part that will be used for rabies-focused exposure. There are 55,000 deaths worldwide each year from rabies. We also have partnerships with Statens Serum Institut for tuberculosis and with Institut Pasteur for malaria. And these are two major areas of unmet medical needs in our developing world.</p>
          <p>Looking at our pipeline, the pipeline is well balanced with new targets in lifecycle management. I already mentioned a flu micro-injection system, which has been filed in Europe and this will not only improve immunogenicity but also provide greater convenience. Menactra toddler will allow the product to be used at the nine months of age; and this will basically a two dose series and will remove the need for immunization for infants, which really requires a four dosage.</p>
          <p>And then dengue, which is our most exciting project in our travel endemic area. This is a disease that is second to malaria in infants. Dengue is caused by four stereotypes and endemic route Latin America and Asia Pacific, and interestingly we've seen that the vector, the mosquito that transmit the disease is now present in 23 states in the United States and for the first time in 2005 we saw dengue in the U.S.; there were 25 patients and in 2006 the number grew 10-fold to 250. So, <mark type="inaudible" /> to increase the trend; we wouldn't be surprised to see dengue to be epidemic or endemic in Southern U.S. states within the next three to four years.</p>
          <p>In terms of our planned submissions over the next four years, we have 11 products to be submitted. It's a balance of lifecycle management and new entities and these filings basically will assure us sustainable growth in the next four-year period.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, sanofi pasteur had another strong year in terms of revenue. We are moving forward increasing our capacity. We've had a number of alliances which strengthened our pipeline; and we are progressing towards a solid performance over the next four years. Sanjay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. So in September 2007, we did a roadmap, and I think what we are trying to sort of show that in fact we follow the roadmap. By following the roadmap in fact we are able to increase the value of the portfolio of short term just because the products are closer to submission and we will also do the presentation of some kind of results. And also we are allowing for the long-term impact, a minimum of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So, first a quick summary of what was and what is our roadmap. It is 30 potential submissions of new products, including vaccine, so new chemical entities and biological, planned by end 2010 and out of the 30 products for the R&amp;D department, I like 18 products.</p>
          <p>At the same time, it seems that the <mark type="inaudible" /> to our two products where you said that you have the reason to 2014 and 2015.  We considered that we need to put 20 candidates per year into development and those were really impacted by 16 products into development. But considering that we put a Phase III program into development by the acquisition of TroVax, we are close to our goal.</p>
          <p>At the same time, again to sustain our growth into the future, we need to continue to increase our investment in value price and by doing that that increase our &#x2013; actually our business development activity and I think that to date we have originally run the number and Dyax deal today in fact we are totally on track with this objective.</p>
          <p>So, a quick summary since &#x2013; what happened since September.  We register Lovenox in Japan and at the same time we submitted <mark type="inaudible" /> in December, in Europe and U.S. which explains why in fact it is not under development.</p>
          <p>At the same time we ended &#x2013; we ended the two products. Most of the time we terminate products because of safety or efficacy trouble. In this case it is a little bit different because exactly we take the ride; as far as these results but we decided that in front of AVE5026 in fact it was more interesting to put more resources on AVE5026 and you will see that we have less <mark type="inaudible" /> And for dianicline it is a mix between the extent of benefit versus the first of class and also some problems with the drug itself.</p>
          <p>So for AVE5530, we have now the results of the Phase II/b. So, three messages from our side. First one that we have strongly positive versus placebo starting at a dose of 25 milligrams. The second and it was partly because we made the dosing AM and PM. We had the greater efficacy PM and just because of the change in time. And the third point is that even if there is a numerical difference in February officially, we think that with a small number and get sense of statistical difference, we still compete &#x2013; we can still be competing with <mark type="inaudible" /> with a 60 milligram dose PM.</p>
          <p>Some of the advantages about efficacy versus the placebo is the quasi-absence of absorption by 50-30 at least relative to placebo and I think one more indication of that is the total absence of liver proximity in our toxicological data and we are showing the data that we have at the present time, which is a longer toxicological study. So six months in rats and 12 months in monkeys.</p>
          <p>We had a meeting with the FDA very recently. So we can say that the Phase III program is on track for submission in 2010 as it was expected and we are doing at the same time a submission of monotherapy and as a combo with <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>GLP-1 pack. There is one just to go for the program. So, we have presented the results of the phase 2b study in September. We have picked up the dose of 20 microgram per day and we have a rather ambitious program in diabetes considering the most of the recent program indication where less of the <mark type="inaudible" /> and what's the current situation of the treatment for the maximum of three months. We have more than 3,000 patients and we've &#x2013; the total duration of treatment for some patients is one year and up. Also what is interesting that this &#x2013; and it is a very good dose ranging that we got during the phase 2b. We thought that by good titration, we should still be able to decrease in fact the side effect of the initiation of the program and to avoid a lot of drop outs.</p>
          <p>In fact <mark type="inaudible" /> to show you that the program in diabetes is on time. That for the <mark type="inaudible" /> study and the monotherapy study after a little bit of slowdown, the recruitment is on time and to have the recruitment finished during the middle of this year. And in fact to go now to our presentation of results. You know that now we are trying to present the most of our clinical results during congress, during meetings. So the results of rimonabant, in arteriosclerosis, in coronary disease will be presented at the ACC in March 2008. The full characterization of the effect on rimonabant on lipid profile would be presented at the European Atherosclerosis Society in April 2008. And I think one of the most interesting data for rimonabant will be ARPEGGIO which is the effect on rimonabant on top of insulin, meaning that we will actually look at two parameters, one of course, is the HbA1C, which is classical for diabetes but the other point will be weight loss. Since you know that the treatment with insulin is increasing the weight gain and still the purpose of all treatments for a diabetic patient is to reduce the weight. At the same time, we implement doing all our study in fact the new requirement by the FDA, mainly in terms of pediatric adverse events. It's not specific for rimonabant but for all <mark type="inaudible" /> it's also not only for all <mark type="inaudible" />, but also <mark type="inaudible" /> agents.</p>
          <p>The definition and <mark type="inaudible" /> based on the program which was presented on slide 93 is still planned in 2009. In terms of fixed combination &#x2013; the combination with metformin is planned for 2010 and the combination with simvastatin in 2011.</p>
          <p>For <mark type="inaudible" /> the minimum treatment duration is 3 years and as we expect at the end of the conclusion in the middle of this year, the submission for registration will be in 2011. So, I will not comment the interest of AVE 5026 since it was done in September just to remind you and you have some experience with the intricate relationship for us it is the best treatment in terms of beneficiaries for in fact knee replacement. And based on these facts and also with the pickup of the dose of 20 milligram tablet, 20 milligram allowing in fact with a reduction of DT event of 60% <mark type="inaudible" /> and a reduction of bleeding including major and minor bleeding of 20 to 30% following the best benefit efficacy dose. We have a mixed end season, <mark type="inaudible" /> on these program seems we want to include &#x2013; to recruit close to 10,000 patients within less than two years. So the three initial studies are <mark type="inaudible" /> when you want to study and the guidelines which is hip replacement, knee replacement, and hip fracture.</p>
          <p>What is the little bit difference in fact some other programs is our emphasis on concept both for surgical patients and for medical patients; and for medical patients in fact we will look not only to radiographic prevention of the events, but also in fact formal chemotherapy. I would like to remind you and it was presented in September that 16% of the drugs for <mark type="inaudible" /> are closed in fact by these events. At the same time, and it is also where there is most clinical need it's medical patient -for medical patients just to go a little bit from here just because of the number of patients to be treated amongst further condition. So the submission for the specific indication will be in 2011.</p>
          <p>For <mark type="inaudible" /> one of the advantage in fact &#x2013; some of the people are considering that the undervalue is always better than an injectable route and in fact we think at least for 5026 that even in molecule for <mark type="inaudible" /> In fact it is a significant to even advantage. It is an advantage because we have less viability and because we increased our income viability by close  100%. No drug intervention. At the same time we have no need for reclaiming the specific study of specific measurement to which <mark type="inaudible" /> And we have also no need collateral monitoring. At the same time it is very convenient for the patient and for the doctor and all the inquiry that we did when we asked what will be the best regiment prepared between anti-vitamin kit all are anti-regulant and/or either of our unit, it might be patient, it might be doctor and in fact the same as the family we always end up in  the same intro than the first way of administration was once a week. And in fact we have some confirmation and because both patients and doctors where very unhappy when we took at least in terms of continued for the patient.</p>
          <p>In terms of clinical program as you can see, for EQUINOX with the ability for recruitment is finished for CASSIOPEA which is similarly one-third of the patient are recruited And we started an important with BOREALIS in atrial fibrillation on a double blind, double dummy design, which is quite difficult but we still monitoring now. If we want to register the drug with only one study.</p>
          <p>For Multaq  so it's a little bit complicated slide; in terms of the first patient was in June 2005, the last patient out in January 08, acceptance why we are not presenting data ATC because we don not have the data at the present time &#x2013; in fact we will not have that kind of ATC since we have worked through six weeks after that by closing.</p>
          <p>When you are considering that the minimum duration of TX maximum duration of 12 months &#x2013; it means I am sorry &#x2013; it means that in fact the recruitment due to roughly one year and up and recruit in population 5000 patients within one year on is from our point of view showing a wide acceptance by both physician and patient of the treatment.</p>
          <p>When you are looking at the last part of the slide, you can see that we have 30-call demography for our <mark type="inaudible" /> patients with 60% we structured up disease and 30% <mark type="inaudible" /> A big difference is on <mark type="inaudible" /> one-half of the situation where we felt the sheer distribution of this population or atrial fibrillation at in patients.</p>
          <p>So in the results, where we are not available at the ATC. It was decided at the same event at the next available meeting which is American Atherosclerosis Society May 2008 and we are still on track for submission and &#x2013; one product in fact for submission because of the end of the second trimester.</p>
          <p>Llpatril I will pass Amibegron I will pass. So I will go directly for the new and exciting result of this presentation which in fact eplivanserin. So eplivanserin I will not comment because it was also presented in September. It is a new approach to insomnia treatment. It is not identical of sleep but in fact it is improving the quality of sleep mainly by increasing the stage III and IV of sleep entering the most reasons many times with eplivanserin or with <mark type="inaudible" /> The advantage of this class since this is absolutely not a antagonist content we can expect each to be non-scheduled drug in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The Phase III program is three safe week studies, two is self patients WASO: Wake After Sleep Onset reported and one with putting some aggressive. Now the result of the first Phase III studies since we are one is still with &#x2013; we are still waiting for the results. So for the study EPLILONG, I think it is interesting for two reasons. The first reason and it is patient-reported, so, really the patient is feeling the difference. We have a strong difference which is flexible and more dynamic and quite a huge number when compared to human biology.</p>
          <p>So we have a strong difference for both WASO and the number of awakening. But I think from our point of view and with some experience which is even more interesting that most of the time <mark type="inaudible" /> you have the tendency in fact with time to have a decrease of the activity of the drug and in fact even a decrease between the first day of administration and the third week. And here is an estimate of 12 weeks. We have worked with the same activity and event for the number of awakening, we have an increase of the activity of the product which is totally un usual with these kind of drugs.</p>
          <p>At the same time since we are increasing the &#x2013; since we are decreasing the waking of the sleeping pattern &#x2013; the number of waking during the night, it is not too surprising to find that the patient is experiencing a better quality of sleep.</p>
          <p>We have the same results with the BSG. <mark type="inaudible" /> the number of <mark type="inaudible" /> The only point &#x2013; and again it's so many times it's just placebo except at six weeks which is not specifically <mark type="inaudible" />. We have some experience of the part of the same results in blood biology. I think &#x2013; we think that that it is mainly due to the techniques of this situation since the later is totally different with the way &#x2013; totally different of <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>In terms of 50, you have the profile and the profile is very good that is the placebo. And even if you are taking some specific adverse events, we are seeing some insomniac drugs. We can see that pulmonary increments and for the patient we have totally comparable for placebo. We have of course &#x2013; not of course but it was &#x2013; surely we no evidence from <mark type="inaudible" /> effect. In fact we have given the <mark type="inaudible" /> if you are going back to the presentation. Last February we have shown in fact that the patients are feeling better. In the morning we did <mark type="inaudible" /> that placebo and see if we are not touching &#x2013; we have &#x2013; the biologic system &#x2013; no withdrawal effects at just two weeks &#x2013; after two weeks of proper treatment.</p>
          <p>For depression saredutant. You know that we have two statistically significant studies as to the placebo for saredutant. We have two studies where saredutant is not specifically significant difference from Placebo but where saredutant is still better than placebo. And when you are doing the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the first disease saredutant is better than placebo.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the safety profile of rimonabant is equal to placebo with even some better effect on sexual dysfunction. And so the submission is scheduled for the 3Q 2008, but we are still waiting for the results of elderly patient and <mark type="inaudible" /> but really the submission is ready. Just we think that the interest of such products is mainly on top of its ORI or SNLI and so we have two studies with these kind of design and the last study will be available in 2009 and we are also doing studies in <mark type="inaudible" /> So one big role &#x2013; there is a little bit difference since we need to have positive results &#x2013; another positive results for this compound and also as I &#x2013; as we presented in September less than <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; we need to let this before we take a decision for filing.</p>
          <p>For Oncology &#x2013; for this one I will talk very quickly because we are little bit late better to run this on time. For until I start again the program is on time. We have the flexibility of submission at the end of 2008 for <mark type="inaudible" /> of our income is the <mark type="inaudible" /> the study offering full difference &#x2013; I would like to remind to you that we have no placebo or no comparator on &#x2013; and no comparator in the study. So the submission will only be only placebo which is the total difference between 2 and 4.</p>
          <p>At the same time on the poor integration that he suffered prostate second line metastatic colorectal lung cancer in compared to the initiated. For first line metastatic colorectal cancer we're doing the pilot study in order to calibrate ourselves versus Avastin and following the advisory committee meeting in December about the results of Avastin in first line blood cancer and the possibility to use operations for <mark type="inaudible" /> We are likely to start the study in the near future and given the indication and several abstracts will be presented at the ASCO.</p>
          <p>The program is on time. So in renal cancer the potential submission in 2009 as you know we are also going for Colorectal cancer; the program is ongoing, and we think that we can accurate these vaccines. It is &#x2013; this kind of treatment is more in line with most of chemotherapy that it is more true for curetted vaccine that the smaller is the tumor the bigger &#x2013; the biggest might be the effect and quite interesting to initiate the treatment when the tumor is still small and the tumor is small at the beginning of the concept or adjuvant treatment is certainly one of the best option for this kind of treatment, and so we are initiating a study in adjuvant treatment even if without result in first line metastatic colorectal cancer with the British group unfortunately, you know the duration of the study is quite long between three and five years. So the results are not expected before 2014.</p>
          <p>Larotaxel and XRP6258, again I think that now we have a very good indication where we want to go. I would like to remind you that in fact the patents for Larotaxel is extending lastly after 20/20 so we are have two potential indication ongoing; one, which is a second line pancreas and second one, which is first line letter, whether it's still a lot of medical needs. In terms of growth, which is certainly a very interesting indication looking at the efficacy of taxotere but perhaps have a very good probability of Flexpen. We are doing a study in new adjuvant breast &#x2013; for new adjuvant is before surgery when nutrient to come from that that the Taxotere.</p>
          <p>The answer is that you can look at the ethological results and carry forward very quickly your product that is Taxotere. Of course the result is positive we will go adjuvant 3, a good indication that we are in factor benefit against provision, which means some interest by the oncology about the scan of treatment. This in fact for XRP6258 in second line <mark type="inaudible" /> again we are a good expectations in terms of recruitment which for us I like again under medical need and definition of the product is scheduled in 2010 now.</p>
          <p>I will pass on AVI8062, because we are late. So, just as part of in fact of our roadmap describing just under was on short-term products in terms of results. I am sorry &#x2013; I'll introduce you to these two products, but just going from roadmap we have to be able to the portfolio as to 2014, 2015 for that in fact the duration.  The duration was to increase a little bit out of our geographic exposure and a little bit away from Europe and U.S. So we have opened our first Asian from it's <mark type="inaudible" /> India pharmaceutical development from and at the same time we introduce our presents in China  knowing that in China we do not want to establish  a flexible R&amp;D center but we want to really work in collaboration officially the fundamental scientists from the University and Chinese Academic of Finance . Where did we find one deal in Shenzhen about the same sense about likely before the end of the deal have signed, five or  six more the &#x2013; at the same time, we sensor  with comfort, which was into a put for regenerative medicine.</p>
          <p>De son engagement, at the R&amp;D day was to geographical it does in fact continue to reimburse ourselves in biological and in fact it's what we did with Regeneron. I think pretty aware that original is the one of the best geographical platform for engineering antibodies coming from mice.  It is a true collaboration &#x2013; it seems there will be synergy for the finding of the target and still have we will provide the tool to test the target to sprint the target, I think your estimated vintage in packing with pharmaceutical tools test the target.  Regeneron <mark type="inaudible" />  the ability of provision and for end I think we have a little bit more because the for instead give up them.  If you go to India we've two more products  using our  portfolio when we achieved anti-IL-6 and it will in return to compare this is pretty humanize competition, which is a generic adjunct and we're also including in our portfolio and I'll see there is a like in four, which will make in fact these that we think today.</p>
          <p>So, just by amibegron we have DGF drug, which is preventing the growth of <mark type="inaudible" /> We are accommodating that and we see which is decrypting so this was using genre . We have DLL4  in fact we achieved a presenting the normal growth of virtually we didn't and which at this &#x2013; after figure of  DGF and at the same time as you know we singed  today and yesterday a deal with Dyax, so the deal with Dyax has two advantages . The first one that there is two ways of producing antibodies, one is going through immunization of the mice which is which is original platform and you are also aware the page display, so we have now an agreement to license this page display technology and there is not so many license and variables for  this technology and at the same time  we are getting and  those we are of un-generic ,  which you stay one, which is close through IND.</p>
          <p>On the last slide, in fact it is exactly the same slide as in September, expect that Aquilda is no more in to the two since Aquilda is already submitted. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Before answer you questions, just quickly two slide as a completion for they have only for me.  To increase on that we can get really a quite a lot of results for &#x2013; quite a lot of clinical trial ailments in  2008, for we still believe that we'll have with both of flexible thermal products and vaccine, a good deal in 2008 is however because of the very complicated pharmaceutical environment the need for further selective and effective adaptation measures and we do it we now &#x2013; we've announced but we believe we need to decentralize management, which corresponds exactly to changes in each of our market and that certainly one more can moderate for me too.  We insist on the guidance some occur all ready mentioned that you but it will be around 7% growth of adjusted EPS excluding selective icon for sure on constant euro-dollar currency</p>
          <p>So, right now we are ready to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have our first question from Chris Schott with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Just a couple of quick questions; first on Menactra. The additional capacity coming in 2010, how much of that is allocated to the, let's say the two through ten year old opportunity or the toddler opportunity in the U.S. versus the overall kind of European and rest of world opportunity? And then can you comment on the impact you would expect on the Menactra franchise if there were an infant meningitis A,C,Y vaccine to become available? And then a second question on AVE5530, just an update on your intent if this is a product that you are still seeking to partner or one that you're going to pursue independently? And again if we look at you starting on Phase III later this year, should we assume that if you start that Phase III that this is a drug that you are likely going to be developing independently? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start with the questions on Menactra. Our &#x2013; in 2007, we produced 7.4 million doses and with the existing facility we will be producing upwards of 10 million doses by 2009 and then in 2010 we have the new facility that brings on an additional 20 million doses. The two to ten indication assuming ACIP makes a recommendation which we believe they will once we have capacity they will probably come in with a recommendation for one dose for this birth cohort. So about &#x2013; the birth cohort in the U.S. is about four million children and normally you would see an uptake in the range of 80, 85% in that type of age group. So that new capacity somewhere between close to four million doses would be earmarked for the U.S. and the rest of the capacity would then be available for the other markets in Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of the impact of a potential infant meningitis vaccine, first of all, we have a product in development for that. However, we believe that the toddler strategy might be the most appropriate one for a couple of reasons. One is the complexity of the immunization in the first six months of life, which is at two, four, and six months. Today, the children are receiving anywhere from six to nine immunizations or &#x2013; in that period. And a toddler approach would basically &#x2013; would circumvent having to basically bring &#x2013; add an initial shot or bring into play the concerns around the interaction and safety associated with multiple immunizations. So we believe Menactra is going to be very competitive should an infant product become available somewhere in the future in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for AVE5530, so we go to a meeting with the FDA very recently. And we were happy to see that in fact they were in agreement with our program, which means that we will start the Phase III during 2Q, 2008, and we will do it independently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Our next question comes from Graham Parry with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. I've got four; just starting on dronedarone. Your comments seem fairly inconclusive or mixed on the product. In the press release you're indicating the product could be filed by mid-2008. So my question would be would you actually file if you got no mortality benefit in the ATHENA study but also there's no adverse mortality effect, and just try and get approval on the basis of the EURIDIS and ADONIS and have you discussed with the FDA the acceptability of such a filing? Also, could we expect a press release on whether the data has met the primary morbidity/mortality endpoint when you actually do know this?</p>
          <p>Second question is on S-1, I was just wondering if you could give us detail on the design of the first line metastatic colorectal cancer study. Are you running this head-to-head with 5-FU or versus Xeloda? And thirdly, wondering why you discontinued the ciclesonide combination. Was it an efficacy, formulation or an economic decision? And then finally, a question on operating margins in developing countries versus developed countries, if you could just give us a feel for how they differ given the increasing importance of developing countries to your revenue line. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I start with the question on the operating margins. The operating margins between those markets and other markets is comparable. You may see a slightly lower ex-factory price level, but this is set off or not to say margin set off by usually a lower overall cost in promotion and to a lesser extent also in administration. So our overall profitability between those markets and the advanced markets is absolutely comparable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For ciclesonide I think it was &#x2013; perhaps Hanspeter can answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think for ciclesonide if you go back to the previous communication on the issue there was a first decision of Altana, the predecessor company of Nycomed who had decided not to launch the product together with us, this again had then triggered our decision that we also dropped out of this. So the product consequently went back to Nycomed and Nycomed is now free to do with it. And as I recently understood they are in the process of doing something. The reasoning for former Altana and our reasoning has been clearly lack of commercial interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for dronedarone, and obviously we created some misunderstanding, so I will try to make it very simple. We have in fact two objectives with ATHENA. The first objective of course is to be positive on our primary endpoint and our primary endpoint is hospitalization for cardiac reason, plus all codes mortality, so this is expected result for ATHENA. But at the same time, because of ANDROMEDA, we have to show that we are not increasing the number of deaths with dronedarone and it was something which was agreed with the FDA. So this is part of our communication. Since the results of ATHENA are not known at the present time I think it's rather fair to put the conditional about the filing because of course if we are not meeting the expectation of the FDA especially for the potential increase of mortality, the dossier will not be submitted. At the same time you can think that &#x2013; but it's just speculation, you can think that if we went so far we should be at least close of the expected data. For S-1, capecitabine is not registered in the U.S. in colorectal first line so we are still thinking to go against FOLFOX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we can take the next question from the Internet questions that have been submitted. So we'll take the first of the three of the questions from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. His question is can you tell us why dianicline was terminated, was it safety or lack of efficacy or what exactly. And then the second question is on the cholesterol absorption inhibitor &#x2013; can you clarify what dose will you take to Phase III, will it be dosed in the PM.  And then the last question is for Hanspeter on the base business maybe we can take that afterwards. Marc?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of the dose and it was agreed now &#x2013; and it is agreed now by the FDA, it would be 25 and 50 milligram PM. In terms of dianicline it was a mix of class and no definitive advantage before in front of the first in class which is varenicline. So it's a mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the base business question for Hanspeter is that with the large 8 billion a year base business, can you comment on the future trajectory of this line. Is it likely to be flat, down slightly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first let me go back to the previous situation, pre-mergers this was a business which was largely coming from previous aventis, which was decreasing by 10% a year and our concern was of course that this could not continue like this.  I believe that if we continue to keep this business with a slight decrease in the neighborhood of a black zero or a little negative one digit decrease of 2 or 3% we do a reasonably good job.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We can also take the next question submitted by Tracey West from Piper Jaffray. And the question is for Wayne. It says are you still trying to initiate a Phase III trial for the dengue vaccine in 2008? Can you tell us more about your development plan for this product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our dengue vaccine has proof of concept and is currently in Phase II. And the plans in 2008 are to expand upon the studies that are underway &#x2013; I'm referring to the efficacy studies. And so we have probably another three to four years of a development program, which should result then in applying <mark type="inaudible" /> firstly in Asia-Pacific and then ultimately in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>Yeah, thanks. It's <mark type="inaudible" /> at Deutsche Bank.  Just one question on rimonabant, please; the changes to the monitoring that you've agreed with the FDA, and you're implementing in the diabetes program, was that in time that you can actually cover enough patients in the diabetes program to fulfill the FDA requirements?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To make it simple, yes, I'm sorry, is yes.  We have a rather extensive program in diabetes.  It is true that the request of the FDA are quite important, but we still hope to fulfill all the requirements of the FDA for the diabetes program. It's not only for the diabetes program, because by example all the <mark type="inaudible" /> in fact is for all the programs.  It is true that we have also some specific requirements for the diabetes program.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Firstly on Lovenox; you sounded much more confident on the status of generics.  I just wondered if there's been an update in your discussions with the FDA, or if you're simply referring to the non-approvable letter that Momenta got last year.  So any color that you can add there would be helpful.  And then just quickly on Taxotere, can you say anything more about the improvement in growth, where it's coming from both U.S. and ex-U.S., and is there any price component in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the letter, first it's coming from all over the world, Lovenox is growing all over, all ten markets where we have no price effect at all or even negative pricing effects, if I refer to Europe where we continue to be in a relatively difficult environment in terms of price. Also coming from the fact that the competitors are generic.  The question on Lovenox, we have no feedback from the FDA beyond what is in the public domain on the non-approvable.  But we feel further to be reasonably confident by the recent publications which you'll find out there's a quote in our brochure by <mark type="inaudible" /> and others which is a summary of all relevant academic groups taking care of low molecular weight heparin and guidelines, which is perfectly supporting the previous statements of the FDA indicating that there may be intrinsic risks which have to be further studied and addressed.</p>

          <p>We're going to take a few questions from the Internet.  The next one is from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Dresdner Kleinwort, and the question is what kind of efficacy did amibegron show when compared to Lexapro in the <mark type="inaudible" /> Marc?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a little bit less than the two products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very clear very answer.  Next we'll move on to another question from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.  It's with regards to AVE5026.  Tim asks in your comparison to enoxaparin at the 20, 40, and 60 mg doses, that showed better efficacy, there was more bleeding.  Is this a potential problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> when you are mixing in fact minor and major bleeding on the AVE5026 versus Lovenox and there was only one major bleeding vis-&#xE0;-vis AVE5026 at 20 mg, the rate of bleeding was 20 to 30% less than the one with Lovenox.  And you need to associate that with a 60% reduction in terms of venous thromboembolism, because if you are going up to 60 mg, you are going up to more than 90% of VTE reduction.  But bleeding at 60 mg might be a concern, not at 20 mg.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Marc.  Another question from Tim on saredutant and he says when you refer to the drug as a drug that modulates the <mark type="inaudible" /> what do you mean exactly?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an interesting question.  I think that in fact you have in the brand, but I think it would be a little bit difficult to comment during this kind of teleconference.  You have bigger pictures <mark type="inaudible" /> the bigger picture, so depending which one has the bigger picture <mark type="inaudible" /> system which is modulating these bigger pictures, and in fact the neurokinin, especially NK2 is modulated <mark type="inaudible" /> pathway.</p>

He asks would you consider a development of aflibercept in other neovascularization conditions like acute macular degeneration.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Thank you.  I was just wondering where will we see the saredutant data.  You said it would be out on Q2, but would we actually see the data or the headline data at that time?  Secondly, on AVE5530, also I was just wondering if we are going to see the full Phase IIb data published anywhere or are we going to have to wait until some of the Phase III trials come out?  And then lastly I was just wondering if there are any comments on the Plavix, statin and A2 combinations that you are looking at.  I notice they are still on track for filing in 2009.  I don't know if you have any comments either on the patent situation or when we might see any data or any further information on those.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start by the end; Plavix patent, yes we are still on track for submission.  It's nothing that is brand new but it's just the fact that more than 60% or 70% of the patients that are taking Plavix are also under a statin.  So we have <mark type="inaudible" /> combination of the two drugs so just for convenience it is making sense of doing a placebo.  For 5530 I think we have been relatively open in terms of presentation of the results, the safety so far is excellent, the drug is not absorbed, it is likely that we will publish the data before the end of Phase III. And for saredutant submission is expected 3Q 2008, it is likely that we will try to make a full presentation of the results at least around the submission of the dossier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have a question here with regards to the role of Crucell's PER.C6 for sanofi pasteur and Crucell is our partner in developing a cell culture influenza vaccine. The PER.C6 cell line is the first cell line to make &#x2013; and the only cell line that's been shown to be scalable to a 20,000 liter fermenter level, and this is important as it relates to developing a viable cell culture vaccine for flu, because of the need to have reasonable cost of goods, and because cell culture will be competing with egg-based manufacturing and cost of goods, and selling price is a critical variable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have another question, Wayne, from Tim again. And he asks, can you comment on your flu vaccine sales in 2007, they seem to be less than in 2006?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When comparing 2007 to 2006 there is a couple of things that you need to know about 2006. In 2006 in the U.S., there was still a shortage of vaccine from the, our competitors and the U.S. government asked us to extend our production season well into November. So we sold nearly 58 million doses of Fluzone in 2006 and this is an unusually high level relative to historical norms. So in 2007 we produced 50 million doses and sold the 50 million doses, so that explains the decline in the U.S. on seasonal flu. However, we were up 10 million doses overall because our sales of Fluzone outside of the U.S. <mark type="inaudible" /> in Europe and international basically resulted in an increase of 10 million doses. And the other variable in 2007 was that we sold &#x20AC;98 million of H5N1 to the U.S. Government. And the contract with the U.S. Government in 2007 for H5N1 was smaller than the contract in 2006. So all in all, it was a, from our perspective it was a good seasonal flu season for us, up 10 million doses and the H5N1 business which is based &#x2013; is more opportunistic business for us and that was down because of the size of the contract with the U.S. Government.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wayne. We will take a few questions from the internet. Before we close, there is a question from Graham Parry at Merrill Lynch on AVE0010. And his question is what nausea rates do we have with this product, what doses are we taking into Phase III for the short-acting version. What is the dosing frequency of the longer-acting version and given the A1C drops that we have seen with AVE0010, they are not as impressive as with other GLPs but the weight loss <mark type="inaudible" /> looks good, would you consider developing this as an obesity agent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to start the nausea is in the range of 20%, <mark type="inaudible" /> a little bit more in the 30% range. The dose once a day is 20 microgram, the dose of the long-acting, the one which is expected once a week, we did agree about the weekly effect of our <mark type="inaudible" /> has the same effect as the other GLP-1 which is in the range of a drop of 0.8 to 1% of HbA1c. The question of association is interesting, so going for obesity the answer is no, but in fact GLP-1 can be associated to our drug of our portfolio, rimonabant, in order get better control of HbA1c, but at the same time also to increase the weight loss which might be interesting and at the other end of the range and in fact, Pierre mentioned it this morning, it can be also associated with Lantus, in fact, for presenting a little bit the weight gain with insulin and at the same time, perhaps to allow to decrease the dose of insulin and to allow a better control of glycemia, even if Lantus is already proving a very good control.</p>
