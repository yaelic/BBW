      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, good morning and thanks for joining us today to discuss our First Half 2012 Results. Obviously, a bit of the mystery has gone out of it, because we pre-announced a few of the key figures on the 30th of April along with our U.K. review. But I do still want to call out some of the main highlights.</p>
          <p>The Group has reported cash earnings of $2.828 million, a respectable 6% up on the prior corresponding period and 1% up on the second half 2011. Revenue momentum has also been solid notwithstanding the funding challenges during the period. We've kept our expenses broadly flat enabling us to deliver peer leading pre-provision profit growth of 7% over the second half of 2011. The dividend has grown a little faster than cash earnings, up 7% on the prior corresponding period to $0.90 fully franked, which is a good result for our 477,000 shareholders.</p>
          <p>The core Tier 1 ratio has also materially improved, rising nearly a full percentage point over the year to just over 8%. The cash return on equity was broadly stable at 15%. We provided a lot of detail on the U.K. on the 30th of April. And as I said at the time, I'm not happy with our returns in that market. However, I'm pleased that our other businesses have been able to offset the sharp deterioration in the U.K. earnings to still deliver reasonable growth.</p>
          <p>Our result needs to be seen in the context of an environment, which has had its fair share of challenges. All of our core markets are experiencing very weak credit growth. As I'm sure you're aware, housing credit growth is at a 34-year low and business credit remains broadly flat. Funding costs continue to rise, as we need to pay both more for customer deposits and term funding while repricing lending remains a highly charged issue.</p>
          <p>The regulatory agenda is also very busy, especially around Basel III capital implementations scheduled to be begin on the 1st of January 2013, but we're definitely on track. And as David Thorburn mentioned on the 30th of April, the economic output in the U.K. is still 4% below the level of 2007, as the U.K. experienced an even slower recovery than what was experienced in the 1930s.</p>
          <p>I thought it was worthwhile to revisit the key strategic priorities I laid out in 2009, and how we are progressing against them. We aim to deliver sustainable and satisfactory shareholder returns by focusing on four key areas. Firstly, a strong balance sheet, especially in relation to capital and funding and we see this as a non-negotiable.</p>
          <p>Second, we need to cut our costs for a potentially extended period of weaker credit growth, which means our cost structures need to be flexible and competitive, while at the same time continue to make investments to ensure we have a world class technology platform, and I'll say more on this later.</p>
          <p>Third, our success remains dependent on a highly engaged workforce that is dealing head on with the reputation challenges the industry faces. Reputation is and will continue to be an important part of our NAB agenda and one where NAB will continue to differentiate itself. And finally, our core strengths are in Australia and our focus remains on the Australian and New Zealand franchise. We made it clear three years ago that we will continue to build upon these strengths while managing our international assets for value and optionality.</p>
          <p>We've made good progress against these three strategic priorities as we continue to focus on what we can control. Our balance sheet has strengthened since March 2009. Core Tier 1 is just over 8%, up from 6.6%. Our Collective Provision and GRCL coverage stands at 1.76% of non-housing credit risk-weighted assets, up from 1.38% and despite a more challenging market for term funding; our Stable Funding Index is now 85%, up from 76%.</p>
          <p>Expense growth has been well contained with a three-year CAGR of 1.6%, while at the same time maintaining a high level of investment spend, including on technology re-platforming. We have made good gains in our relationship with our customers and our people. Three years ago, our customer satisfaction score was the lowest of the major banks.</p>
          <p>We needed to get back in the game and we have since then customer satisfaction has risen more than 10 percentage points, and we are now well above the peer average. Employee engagement has also improved from below to be well above global industry finance norms, and NAB remains an Employer of Choice for the women for the sixth year in a row.</p>
          <p>Within our portfolio of businesses, we have gained market share in our core franchises in Australia, both on the lending and deposit side. The Wholesale Bank, which you'll recall is restructured NAB capital in 2009 has been refocused on lower risk customer revenue streams and is growing customer income by 14% CAGR since September 2008. SGA has reduced its risk-weighted assets by 68% since September 2009, and in March removed the economic risk on the remaining SCDOs.</p>
          <p>You might remember that in March 2009, the notional mark-to-market loss on conduits would have been almost $4 billion. Managing this as a run-off portfolio over the past three years has achieved a much better outcome for shareholders than exiting the portfolio that would have been the bottom of the market.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we've made good progress in our core Australian and New Zealand franchises. Market share gains in housing have been matched by similar gains in household deposit share. Business lending market share continues to grow, notwithstanding NAB's position as the number one business lender, while in New Zealand market share has grown especially in retail deposits and agribusiness lending.</p>
          <p>We spent a lot of time talking about the U.K. on the 30th of April, so I won't spend too much time on it here. But in summary, we have simplified the business model to improve the return profile. Reorienting to retail and SME in Scotland and Northern England. Clydesdale's balance sheet structure will be improved by the transfer and run-off of commercial real estate, and its funding position will be strengthened with core assets more closely matched by customer deposits. Commercial real estate provision coverage has also been improved. The restructuring is expected to achieve annualized cost savings of &#xA3;74 million by 2015 with one-off restructuring costs of &#xA3;195 million.</p>
          <p>As the chart shows, our collective provision in GRCL coverage is higher than our peers because the GRCL is deducted from Tier 1 capital. It has a similar economic impact as Collective Provisions. While our coverage declined over the last 12 months, this is consistent with the peers and indicative of the more stable credit environment in Australia. Mark will have more to say on this later.</p>
          <p>Our capital position continues to strengthen. Core Tier 1 on a Basel II basis is now the second highest of the peer group and above 8% for the first time and during the last 12 months, our core Tier 1 ratio has grown by 91 basis points.</p>
          <p>Our technology program continues to progress well. We've achieved a number of important milestones, including the successful implementation of a major technology release in February, which has delivered the foundation of our new banking platform. All NAB customers will migrate to this platform starting with UBank customers by the end of the year. This was a significant milestone. It was the combination of almost two year's work and was the largest single IT project ever implemented by NAB. It will provide the foundation for improved functionality, greater self-service and real-time banking capability.</p>
          <p>Over the coming year we expect to launch two major technology initiatives. The first is a new share trading platform fully integrated into NAB's banking platform. The new platform will enable customers have greater access to research an information on ASX listed companies than any of our major competitors with direct access to linked NAB accounts and real-time transfer capability.</p>
          <p>The second initiative is in the payment space, where technology gains will enable us to offer same day settlement for merchant customers, compared to the more normal overnight settlement and that will be great benefit to our business customers. While the work we are doing in our core banking platform gets most of the headlines, we also now well advanced our infrastructure in network transformation, including a shared virtual platform for all contact centers and the build of a new data center.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we highlighted the importance of reputation to the success of our business strategy and progress on this front has been pleasing. Customer satisfaction as I mentioned earlier has improved strongly and reached a 15-year high during the half. The reputation of the Business Bank has been further strengthened through its commitment to relationship banking, and its support of customers during the crisis.</p>
          <p>NAB Wealth has led the way in its efforts to improve trust and transparency in financial planning. While these efforts have been recognized with numerous industry awards, our shareholders are also benefiting growth in market share. Over the last three years net new transaction accounts for the Personal Bank has increased 12 fold.</p>
          <p>In summary, while the global macro outlook is still challenging. We have balance sheet strength and the cost disciplines to see our way through these more difficult times. We have made good progress in our strategic priorities, but there is obviously still more to do. In particular, we need to successfully execute the new U.K. business model and continue to advance the technology agenda, while maintaining the momentum we've established in our core Australian franchises.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to Mark to take you through the numbers in a little bit more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. My pleasure as usual to take you through the financial details. Not surprisingly, many of the trends we've seen in this reporting season are evident in our result too. But nevertheless, I think we've got a decent story to tell, particularly as it applies to the core Australian and New Zealand franchises.</p>
          <p>And in particular, I'll point to continued strong capital generation, disciplined cost management, market share gains across both assets and deposits in the main banking franchises with good deposit coverage of our growth and a high quality contribution from the Wholesale Bank.</p>
          <p>So turning to the aggregate result and making some comments on a sequential basis. The first obvious thing is that the NII has stalled in this period, with only one-third the growth in GLAs in the last six months that we experienced in the prior six months. And with a weaker NIM reflecting mainly the repricing lags that have characterized recent periods.</p>
          <p>So that has led to a 1.2% decline in NII. OOI, however, has risen $400 million and that broadly splits into three contributions, a A$300 million uplift in the Wholesale Bank, of which just over a third was the recovery of losses recorded in the second half of 2011. So if you remember that the August-September period was difficult for the wholesale businesses as markets suddenly assimilated a different view of Europe. And I said at that time that cost us around $175 million to $200 million and we estimate that we made back about a $120 million of that in the current period.</p>
          <p>And, of the other $100 million improvement in OOI, about $50 million comes from the Wealth franchises and there is about a $50 million delta out of SGA, partly to do with the SCDO mark-to-markets that were a loss in the second half of last year and a small gain, I think $17 million in this particular period, but also some other items in SGA. And most of the other sources of OOI were pretty much flat in this period.</p>
          <p>As you can see here expenses were tightly managed with small nominal reductions in total spending continuing into this half and that was a result achieved despite continued high level of investment, especially in technology and infrastructure. And as we get into it, you'll see the FTE numbers have come down quite significantly. They are down 4% PCP. So therefore, despite the softness in demand for credit, the business was able to continue to deliver positive jaws and underlying profit was up just over 7%.</p>
          <p>For us, leakage has come on the B&amp;DD line, where B&amp;DDs are up 35%. Excluding the U.K., we're up 16% sequentially, and that's really attributable to two things. First of all, you'll notice an uptick in the B&amp;DD in the SGA portfolio, which is coming out of northern hemisphere leveraged loan facilities. And the other difference is that in the second half of 2011, we released our Queensland floods overlay and obviously that doesn't recur in this period.</p>
          <p>In fact if you take the Australian bank in aggregate, personal business and wholesale, the sequential increase in our B&amp;DD is zero and that reflects pretty much the underlying AQ metrics. So on a &#x2013; so cash earnings were up only 1% on a sequential basis and the one other factor I would highlight on this page, I'll come back to it and Cameron already mentioned it, is the core Tier 1, which in each of the last two halves has added about 45 basis points to our ratios. And in this period was recorded despite an increase in operational risk RWAs, which is something that I do expect to continue over coming periods, so they took three basis points. And of course, the move to the Basel 2.5 with the stress bar and the securitization adjustments are taking 7 basis points. So between them that was a 10 basis point headwind on the capital generation side.</p>
          <p>If we look at in a waterfall sense, the bottom half of this slide is &#x2013; will be no surprise to you, we've just talked through that, but looking at the top, at the business unit contributions <mark type="inaudible" /> (14:40), the Business Bank and the Personal Bank are essentially flat through this period. So Business Bank felt the price lag most acutely, got to some re-pricing in February, but it made only a small contribution to revenue in this half and of course will do more in the second half. But made up for it with a good cost control and a 10% lower B&amp;DD expense to bring them flat with the prior period.</p>
          <p>For the Personal Bank, it's down a bit. Again re-pricing lags, which have only recently been addressed and we do have a seasonality in the bad debt expense in the Personal Bank, which pretty much accounts for a $30 million increase in B&amp;DD there. In fact there is no underlying issues in the credit quality overall and that tends to be driven by seasonal factors in the credit card portfolio. And that business did continue to grow; probably it had about twice the volume growth of the Business Bank.</p>
          <p>The Wholesale Bank was obviously very strong, recovered to be up we think largely on trend, perhaps a little strong due to this second half 2011, first half 2012 swing that I mentioned earlier. Offsetting that, the U.K. shows a sharp reversal in the recovery that was slowly building in that franchise with pressure on NIM and substantially higher B&amp;DD as we discussed last week. New Zealand is performing very nicely and is probably as we get into it, you will see probably at the minimum we can expect on the B&amp;DD front. And perhaps at a peak in its NIM as well, but very good ratio is coming out of the New Zealand business.</p>
          <p>Wealth saw some recovery in the Insurance business and a more normal contribution from IORE, but was otherwise flat and on the investment side in particular, probably not a bad outcome in light of the industry performance that we've seen reported so far this season. And the SGA is both running off and as I said before had some recurrence of B&amp;DD mainly out of the U.K. giving it a slightly negative contribution.</p>
          <p>No real surprises in the group NIM, which we indicated in the trading update, was lower. I think the first quarter trading update we reported 2.19%, we finished at 2.17%. We've made a slight adjustment to the way we format this to try and highlight what's really going on at the customer level, because some of the other factors that created noise in the NIM are more material than they might normally be. I'm talking about things like holding high levels of liquid assets and the real skew in balance sheet growth to the low margin, high return mortgage portfolio.</p>
          <p>So putting those things aside, what we can see in &#x2013; and focusing on the customer elements of it, what we can see in the group NIM that is, we got a three basis point improvement from re-pricing in the quarter. I think re-price in the half, re-pricing that we undertook in the half lifted our revenue by about $65 million. The second half effective that plus the recent re-pricing in the mortgage portfolio adds a further $240 million probably in the second half. So hopefully we'll see a bigger contribution from lending margin coming. But you can see the headwinds there and the fact that those headwinds are really dealt with on a timely basis. And that margin erosion from deposits and from funding and liquidity are 4 and 5 basis points, respectively.</p>
          <p>And then you can see down below, we've set out the NIM erosion on a business unit basis and try to isolate the customer effects within those franchises as well, which doesn't tell a substantially different story down at the business unit level.</p>
          <p>As to the outlook for NIM, which is always something we're asked and is very difficult to predict with any accuracy. Obviously, there will continue to be pressure on NIM in my view. Competition for volumes on the asset side and the deposit side continues. Whenever we have a nervous market as we seem to be building up to today as we speak, wholesale spreads move out quite rapidly and term deposit rates spike and we're seeing both of those things today. And those sorts of things take time to come back to more normal levels.</p>
          <p>And we are moving to hold higher levels of liquids and liquids of a higher quality. And you saw the Australian Commonwealth Government borrowing rates are at the lowest probably they've ever been. That constitutes a higher holding cost of liquids in a business like ours. So none of these things are that helpful and we might &#x2013; while we might get focused on repricing from time-to-time and think that that is really dealt with these issues. If you look back over the GFC, our average cost of funds is probably risen about five basis points per quarter. So in a business like ours, that's about a $250 million headwind per quarter. So the repricing challenge continues.</p>
          <p>As I said, we were pleased with the cost outcomes and those cost outcomes reflect embedded capabilities around process efficiency and a cost consciousness that we've been working to bring into the DNA of the organization over recent periods with some success. So as I said to you, the FTEs were lower, down 4% PCP, they're down 1,250 roughly in the last six months.</p>
          <p>This cost outcome was achieved despite continuing to run at a substantially elevated level of investment. If you remember a few years ago, we used to run around $800 million, $850 million per annum, we now run more like $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion as we take on major infrastructure and technology transformation, a lot of which finds its way to the P&amp;L straight away and some of which gets capitalized. But despite that activity, the cost outcomes are very good. And we've been able to sustain positive jaws. Here the revenue lines are restated only to take out the SCDO marks and to the foreign exchange effects which pretty much mirror on what's going on, on the cost side anyway. But you can see fairly steady jaws through this period despite a softer period of revenue expansion, which we are pleased about.</p>
          <p>We are always realistic about this though. Eventually capitalized software finds its way into depreciation. At $1.3 billion, we are at the low end of the peer range in terms of our capitalized software, but we are having about a $100 million every six months at the moment. So eventually that will find its way into costs and we will have transition costs as well as we get into coexistence of systems, business readiness and customer transfer and the like. So we will have our work cut out on the cost front, but we are still working to positive jaws. And as I said, the embedded capabilities continued to deliver good bottom up contribution to the cost outcomes.</p>
          <p>On the B&amp;DD side, as I said B&amp;DDs rose nearly $300 million in the half with the U.K. banking accounting for just over $200 million of that, with much of that coming from its CRE portfolio as we laid out last week. SGA has also had four losses driving a $50 million increase in its B&amp;DD to $71 million and the remainder relates primarily to that non-recurrence of the Queensland flood release, which was a $70 million period to period difference.</p>
          <p>The charge ex-U.K. remains at around 32 basis points to GLA, which is flat, so you can see the red line up ticking at the group level, the blue line is everything excluding the U.K. which pretty much continues our observation that bad debts remain somewhat elevated, but &#x2013; and quite sticky, but not at extraordinary levels. They are below our recent average, but above &#x2013; below our long-term average, but above our sort of benign period average.</p>
          <p>The first thing you can say about asset quality at the group level is that it has improved. The GIA to GLA is down 8 basis points to 124 basis points despite the U.K. rising 34 basis points. However, as a lead indicator, the 90-day past dues are up 4 basis points to 49. And they rose 2 basis points to 45 excluding the U.K., you'll always get some volatility in that. But nevertheless some slight deterioration in that lead indicator. So the combined ratio is down slightly overall and our watch loans are flat. Interestingly, in the March quarter, the newly impaired assets, so the new arrival of impaired assets was at the lowest it's been in a quarter since September 2008.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Collective Provisions fell by $340 million, a $160 million of that was the utilization of the provision that was pointed at the CSOs and CDOs, and in the wash up of all that provision was used as previously foreshadowed. The remaining reduction represents factors such as transfers to specific provisions as assets become impaired and the specific coverage has improved accordingly. RWA released initiatives that mean that credit quality improves and provisions are not required and the general improvement in upgrading of our Basel II models.</p>
          <p>The CP coverage remained strong at a 102 basis points, albeit down 8 basis points and of course the CSO provision accounts for a large chunk of that. And including the GRCL, this brings the ratio to 132%, which is down 9 basis points, sequentially. And you'll see if you look across that chart in the bottom right, with the GRCL top up is pretty constant at around 30 basis points, which shows how the provisioning levels are tracking the underlying asset quality on an expected loss basis and there is no widening in that relationship. You may also know that the proposed introductions of IFRS 9 may in time make this distinction quite mute.</p>
          <p>Turning then just to the businesses and give a little more color on them. Starting with the Business Bank, which was you've seen had a subdued half with flat earnings, but overall we're pretty pleased with the performance. And, you see in the bottom right there a reduction in the NIM, but really back to levels of this time last year. And you can see in the &#x2013; at the top there, continued expansion in the book, only $2 billion in the average balance sheet for business lending and further $1 billion in mortgages, but nevertheless continued share gain in the business sector raising another 50 basis points to 22.9%.</p>
          <p>Expenses were well managed. They are down 1.1% in this business and FTEs were 350 lower. And the B&amp;DDs are lower and the credit quality metrics is stable.</p>
          <p>You'll see a sharp downturn in the SME B&amp;DD charge there on the bottom left that really reflects the fact that in the September half, we consciously went and did a reassessment of all underlying security values in commercial property particularly around Southeast Queensland and the like, which probably inflated the B&amp;DD charge in that half by $78 million to $80 million and that doesn't recur in this period.</p>
          <p>All that said, confidence remains relatively weak in this sector and therefore the outlook remains somewhat subdued. We're also pleased with how the Personal Bank is travelling despite a 7% drop in its profit result this time. The SVR pricing changes that we undertook through the period have provided some revenue offset to the rising cost of funds, but you can see that not enough was done. And as I say that's an ongoing challenge, so we have got a reduction of 12 basis points in the customer margin there that we will need to continue to work to address.</p>
          <p>And the B&amp;D (sic) [B&amp;DD], you can see there the seasonality of the B&amp;DDs in that accounting for the uptick. So that should correct itself in the second half. This business continued to generate strong mortgage flows. There was $6 billion on a spot basis of new mortgages in the second half that compares to about $10 billion per half that we have been recording and that reflects market softness or a lower level of activity. But still this business grew at 2.2 times the system. And for those of you who've been reading this statistics and see the NAB franchise, closer to system in aggregate that's because the Business Banking channel is much softer in its demand for mortgages at the moment.</p>
          <p>And, then pleasingly also in the bottom right there, you can see that the new mortgages coming in over the last four years continue to season at rates materially better than those historically experienced, which is underpinning and averaging up in the quality of the mortgage portfolio overall.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking had a strong half year result. It was up more than 90% sequentially, while it comprises a number of businesses including our Custody Business and Specialist Finance, obviously the market sales and trading is the most important part of this part of the franchise. And if we aggregate the customer side of all these franchises and you can see on the top right there, customer contribution being separated from the risk trading contribution. You can see a steady build on the customer side, which reflects continued growth in these businesses and improved cost cross-sell penetration on a number of fronts that we've targeted. So that's progressing well.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile on the trading income side, which can easily be dismissed as low quality, we really see actually reasonable underlying stability there particularly if you come to the September 2011 and you take that $200 million that I mentioned and the $120 million recovery of it in March, 2012 and you smooth for those things, you get a fairly consistent contribution out of the risk activities of this business at around the $375 million to $400 million or so over the last five periods. A strong cost control in this business also was up 1.3% and an uptick in its B&amp;DD related only to as is normally the case, a small number of exposures.</p>
          <p>For NAB Wealth, in what continues to be a difficult environment for wealth businesses. NAB Wealth had an improvement this half, up 11% pre-IROE and up 23% when you include it. Against the 11%, investments was up 3% and insurance was up 29%. In the investments business, discretionary flows remain weak and margins were under pressure, although MLC is working to sustain its margins, and so far has been reasonably successful. The annuity experience provided a boost in this half with mortality rates more favorable and positive movements in the bond portfolio underpinning the annuity business. And higher closing FUM, we are hopeful we will support stronger revenues in the second half. But confidence and so discretionary flows remain weak.</p>
          <p>On the insurance side, you see modest growth in premiums in force and we are consciously avoiding trying to grow PIF too aggressively at the moment. Because there seems to be a lot of discounting and acceptance of risk at unrealistic rates in the market at this time, so we're being fairly cautious about them and continuing to focus, as is a trademark this franchise, focusing on higher quality risks. But we did also see in this period a more normal claims experience and a less marked lapsed skew and also a strong management of costs. That all combined to lift the insurance cash earnings on a PCP &#x2013; on a sequential basis by 29%, although, it's still 14% below its performance on a PCP basis.</p>
          <p>In other areas, the aligned advisors continued to grow strongly. They were up 32 net on a sequential basis and 84 on a PCP. And across the whole franchise, FTEs were down 275.</p>
          <p>New Zealand has had a very good run. It had reasonably strong revenue growth in the half, so revenue growth was 4%, despite the balance sheet growth only being 2%. The business experienced a continued expansion in margins, which was partly attributable to repricing, particularly on the business side and partly attributable to customer shifting into higher margin variable rate mortgage products. So we've come from a historic position where roughly 20% of mortgages were variable to today we're roughly two thirds of variables. So we're probably not going to get much of a continued uplift from that second factor.</p>
          <p>Cost control, which has been a feature of this business, as always, tries to target flat costs. Cost control has been very good and the business has delivered 4.5% positive jaws in the half. And B&amp;DDs are now down to 12 basis points to GLAs, which, I don't have any great foresight, but I suspect will be a level hard to maintain.</p>
          <p>The other notable feature in New Zealand has been the balance sheet discipline, which was seen over the last six months deposit growth at 1.5 times the asset growth improving, therefore, the funding ratios.</p>
          <p>For the other international businesses, the U.K. downturn and the reasons for it were covered last week, primarily the B&amp;DD situation given a downturn in the U.K. economy and commercial property in particular. And the NII decline related to the three-notch downgrade in credit rating. But the other &#x2013; covering the other international businesses, GWB is progressing well despite some headwinds of its own, it had to do with some regulatory changes and it has its own effective run-off portfolio of some of the FDIC loss share covered assets, which it has to replace with new customer volumes and the like. But the markets in which GWB operates look to be somewhat stronger and so we're very pleased with the way this business is continuing along and is generating at its level a decent ROE as well.</p>
          <p>The SGA portfolio, as Cameron said, is now effectively two-thirds of the way through its run-off on a RWA basis. We started at around $24 billion of RWAs, we are now down to about $8 billion. You can see in a run-off portfolio like this, B&amp;DDs persist for a while, which is not uncommon as you change the nature of your relationship with customers and try and bring things to a head and seek repayment and the like. And we went through period of high B&amp;DD and really brought that under control. But we've now had this uptick because you do remain exposed to the underlying economic conditions. So and as I say that uptick primarily relates to what's going on in private equity and similar type deals in the U.K.</p>
          <p>For the SCDO portfolio, as we've already disclosed to you, we removed the risk on the final two instruments, $600 million of credit risk, reduced the RWAs associated with that and then did a cleanup of the provision and accelerated the hedge premium cost write-off, which inevitably would have been written-off in any case just over time. And that brings to an end, I'm sure you'll be pleased to know the mark-to-market noise from the SCDOs and as I say, made a significant contribution to reducing the RWAs in this period.</p>
          <p>On the capital side, you can see here the, there is more and more focus on core Tier 1 rather than Tier 1, but you got both on here. But the core Tier 1 is lifted from 7.58% to 8.03%, substantially reflecting strong capital generation out of the business at 56 basis points, with some give up to the regulatory changes on the Basal 2.5 and of course, with some items being taken below the line, they get captured in the capital equation as well. From a hybrid capacity point of view, we have a couple of billion dollars of hybrid capacity that the rules around the features that hybrids need to exhibit are now becoming more clear and there has been some issuance. So it's more likely that we'll move to issue some of that in due course. In the meantime, we do have some hybrid bridges that are likely to convert in the second half of 2012 and the first half of FY 2013, which should bring another $1.1 billion approximately of capital into the core Tier 1 ratio in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>On the regulatory side, slightly advanced picture, although dialogue continues, on a Basel II basis, we are 8.03%, on an international BIS aligned calculation, we estimate that we are closer to 9.3% core Tier 1. And we know &#x2013; well, with what we know, what APRA is likely to do in localizing that calculation that we would be close to 7.6%. But with core capital generation in the second half in the conversion of the bridges, we do expect to be over 8% by the time of the requirements actually get adopted at the beginning of January 2013. We do get some new news through the period, I've already mentioned some of the requirements for hybrids, but we did also get a line of sight on the transitional arrangements around hybrids and how they were runoff and that will include our national income securities, which with an outcome we were pleased about.</p>
          <p>On the funding and the liquidity front, the dialogue continues. We nevertheless are making steps on the funding side in the liquidity portfolio that are directionally correct, but it remains to be seen exactly how big and what role the RBA committed liquidity facility will play, but we do expect this to take shape over the next 12 months as well.</p>
          <p>On the funding side in particular, it's been a difficult period, the first quarter when we normally get quite a bit of issuance done, was disrupted by the European sovereign debt concerns and so we really had to play some catch up. After that we're pleased where we've got to by the half at $14.5 billion of issuance, including $4.6 billion of secured out of NAB Limited. That exceeds by a little bit what matured during the half, but you'll see that our aggregate measures under the Stable Funding Index of customer funding at 65% and term funding at 20%, have been stable. And I think we are happy to have held those ratios through that period.</p>
          <p>What you can't see is that there has also have been some averaging up of the quality on the customer deposit side. For example, while Australian term deposits grew by 7%. The term deposits below $5 million grew by 14% and the term deposits over a $100 million fell by 16% and that's because the smaller balances they're going to have a higher value under Basel III. So these all metrics don't necessarily capture all the work that's been going on.</p>
          <p>As to the covered bonds, we have talked about 9% of our covered bond capacity. We have tended to hang back a little bit on covered bond issuance because when markets get shaky they are much more likely to be able to issue AAA instruments particularly into international markets. So, we've kept our powder pretty dry on the covered bond front, and although, some issuance in the second half is quite likely.</p>
          <p>The liquids remain elevated. They are at $106 billion including the contingent liquidity. That's down $10 billion on September, that's not a conscious running down of the portfolio except that in September was when we were really getting a strong sense of the European sovereign crisis, so liquids were a little bit elevated at that point, but we did also have quite an inflow of collateral around that time. But so, liquids remained at elevated levels.</p>
          <p>And then finally on customer deposits. The franchises has been performing very well on the deposit front. What you see here on the top left is the retail deposits less total lending on a spot basis across each of the franchises and the Wholesale Bank doesn't raise retail deposits, so that represents just the growth in its assets. So for the relevant franchises pretty much, there was a net positive gathering of deposits and a $6.3 billion positive across the franchise.</p>
          <p>In fact, the group has been virtually fully customer deposit funded for new lending over the last 12 months, despite consistent asset market share gains. And since September 2008, retail deposit growth has exceeded GLA growth by $27 billion. Customer deposits in the Private Bank and the Business Bank have both grown above systems since March 2009. And this is something that we expect our deployment of new technology to swing in behind and support continued delivery on this very important front.</p>
          <p>So then in summary, solid momentum in the Australian and New Zealand franchises, gaining share, more than providing for that with customer deposits, certainly, not increasing in any substantial way, our reliance on wholesale markets, managing to positive jaws while continuing to invest and being realistic about the challenges on that front. Balance sheet strength is a consistent priority and with the franchise now very well placed to assimilate the new regulatory requirements and a strong focus on ROE at the group and the business unit levels that we're getting some decent traction on now and the group ROE again excluding the U.K., which is in a distress market is sitting quite nicely relative to peers.</p>
          <p>Our outlook of course is somewhat subdued given the lead of the global economy and you'd have to say weak confidence across business and consumers in Australia. We will focus on growing our deposits and managing our margin appropriately, and we will continue to drive efficiency to accommodate our technology transition, and finally we have the new challenge of executing on the U.K. business model changes coming in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>So with that we'd be happy to take any questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Ross. A question on the Personal Bank if I could, if you just look this performance over a number of years now since three years or so the strategy has been going, the change in strategy. Over that time profitability has been broadly flat, but the balance sheet has grown by about $55 billion and the return on assets has fallen from 95bps to about 65 basis points, so it's come under a lot of pressure, understand you can leverage the business up if it's only mortgages that the ROE hasn't fallen as far, but in the funding constrained market it still uses a lot of funding and obviously it's expensive to do that. Are you happy with the returns there and at what stage do you think you need to re-address the pricing strategy and the strategy as a whole in that Personal Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very happy with the Personal Bank. I think you've got to go back three and a half years ago to where we were and this, you know, we look at the business very much on an enterprise wide basis and how each of the businesses contribute to each other. We were in a situation three and a half years ago with a Personal Bank at the bottom on customer satisfaction, was not gathering deposits, was growing poor quality mortgages and half the system. Now that situation, if it was allowed to persist would begin to threaten other parts of our franchise. We would start to have issues where we couldn't grow because we weren't raising deposits. We couldn't grow because we are getting balance sheet concentrations.</p>
          <p>The external environment at that time was also where you had substantial government support into the mortgage sector. You had mergers that had occurred in banks that were stronger. So we only have one opportunity and that was to undertake a radical organic strategy, and we think it's absolutely delivered. We've improved customer satisfaction; we've substantially improved deposit gathering capability; we've stretched that into a cross-sell relation with higher ROE products. It has delivered substantial benefits to our Business Bank by improving the balance sheet. So we are very comfortable with the Personal Bank strategies at this point in time so we'll continue the review, but it's been a very strong delivery to the outperformance over the last couple of years.</p>

          <p>Hi, just on the &#x2013; a question probably more so for Joseph in terms of the Business Bank. I just wanted to get a sense of the competitive dynamics you see in the market in terms of just margins and you do seem to have a bit of re-pricing coming through in February. I just wanted to get a sense we've heard some competitors make some noise about wanting to expand market share in that segment. And just want to get a feel for your growth aspects and notice the fact as well, in terms of the economic forecasts, Business Banking is not expected to really pick up as quickly as mortgage growth is. I just wanted to get your sense of what you are seeing in terms of the outlook there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question, just on the second question around outlook, we are cautiously optimistic. The issue really is around business confidence and when do we see business confidence starting to pick up and obviously you'll see activity because it's been a period now almost of three years if not longer of below system level of investment outside the resource sector. So we do see when confidence turns, that we'll see an uplift in business activity. But the outlook as Mark mentioned right now is somewhat more conservative in terms of our expectations.</p>
          <p>On the first part of the question around competition, no real change from last half. I mean the intensity of competition is high as I've seen it with all of the major banks seeking to grow their business lending share, particularly in the SME space. And that appetite for a business lending, of course is into a market with a subdued level of activity. So it does mean there is lot of pressure on price. And increasingly in some segments of the market, we have seen some relaxation in credit standards. So our approach is to be very disciplined around how we are pricing and the risk &#x2013; the level of risk that we are taking, but the level of competition remains at quite a high level, and we expect that to continue as other banks seek to grow the Business Bank share.</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. A very strong capital outcome this half, I note that you've had $9 billion of RWA optimization within that outcome. You've said that looking forward, you think you will get 8 plus percent and we heard, Westpac, last week say that core equity Tier 1, they were there or thereabouts and they just below 8% at this point. So what's your view on further risk-weighted asset optimization, then ultimately when is enough capital enough, and what you do from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, hopefully the optimization will continue, I mean, it's &#x2013; a lot of it is coming from housekeeping, we didn't really have a NAB, as I've said before, late to qualify for Basel II. And so the sophistication of its models for example was not there. So we continue to work on things like models, like collateral matching as we improve our internal processes and these things bring down RWAs. So we &#x2013; every time, we deliver something; we refresh our agenda and we go off to get some more. It won't necessarily always be at the same level. You will get diminishing returns, but we are hopeful that that will continue to contribute going forward. As to the level, we need to see both exactly where the regulator wants it to sit, where the board wants it to sit, where peers sit, as we've said, our sort of interim target, self imposed was to get to 8% and then see where things settle out, depending on, as I say, where others settle and what's appropriate, given likely volatility in that measure and so forth. Bu, so we set ourselves the target of getting to 8%, I think we'll be above 8%, around September or soon after or certainly by the time the second bridge converts and then I think we'll reassess at that point.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions if I may, firstly on expenses, you highlighted there is some additional expenses coming through and you're looking to continue to invest. You've delivered arguably superior expense performance to your peers so far, over a number of periods, do you feel you can continue doing that, given that additional expenditure coming through. And also on the provisioning, if I look at slide 90, your specific provisions slide indicates that net write-offs were around $500 million, whereas on a Group level, in your disclosures, it was closer to a $1 billion. So I'm assuming there is some write-offs that have been incurred that haven't necessarily been already in the provisions and you've effectively needed top-ups and you are suggesting that there is some of it coming from U.K. exposure and SGA, given that both U.K. issues and SGA issues have been known for some time, do you think there is some or perhaps not enough conservatism in your models and which will affect the leads to additional provisions that you need to take in excess to what's already been provided for the loans that you've known.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Mike talk to the provisioning, on the expenses, yeah, I think we took a view a couple of years ago that we had to manage expenses very tightly, but we needed to do it in a sort of a methodical fashion, because we could see a number of challenges. One is that we are building up with replacement technology that replacement accelerates, which we're pleased about and will ultimately drive some efficiency, you're building up clearly depreciation issue you've got to deal with. We're not going to win the argument just because we're replacing 40-year old technology we can depreciate on the same time scale.</p>
          <p>So that was clear, but the other thing was that, you can see a subdued revenue outlook and so we saw a diligence on expenses would help us do with that future depreciation as well as the subdued revenue outlook. And the reason we've been quite methodical about it is that, it is actually important that we don't have big sort of lumpy or jerky expense adjustments and suddenly panic and so we've got to drive it out. And what's been pleasing is our employee engagements actually continue to improve quite remarkably as we sort of dealt to it methodically.</p>
          <p>Can we keep up, well, I mean we are &#x2013; it's very much a cultural phenomenon now in NAB that we manage these expenses very closely. Other than our technology investment, we don't have big expansion goals that would necessarily drive expense, but the depreciation thing hasn't got any better and the revenue environment hasn't necessarily improved. So it's going to be difficult, but it &#x2013; I think it just underpins the approach we've taken over the last couple of years. We just got to keep going out it in a very methodically fashion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then on the models, I didn't mean to throw the risk organization under the bus and say that we are completely inept on this front, but our models are, I mean, they are perfectly adequate, but they are improving and that does lead to some a lesser requirement for Collective Provisions in particular when you see in fine detail exactly what your risks are. And as to the specifics, we are focused on keeping things moving through not having them sit and impaired and wrapping them up as quickly as we can and that probably gives rise to volumes that are seeing on page 90.</p>

          <p>Hi. I have a question for Mark and then one for Cameron. Mark, just if we can idea of sort of how the margin is sitting at the moment just sort of post-balance date, is it materially below where the average was for the half. And then Cameron I noticed in the outlook, the focus is to grow deposits and maintain margins, no bank has been able to do that today, just sort of interested if how you plan to do it and given the competitive environment. We've got Westpac saying the same very strategy and term deposit rates at a very high levels, how you can grow deposits and maintain margins at the same time without asset pricing maybe you can do it on the liability side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the ever-elusive exit margin, it's impossible to say and the more you shorten the period, the more volatile our margin can be. And I am not quite sure when our last mortgage increase kicks in, but that day our margin will be better. But, what you have is this inexorable 5 basis points a quarter rise in the average cost of funds and then you get these step functions in the repricing. So we don't measure it over such short periods, so I couldn't tell you exactly what it was in the last week prior to results of this week or anything else, but I can tell you that it's challenge to maintain it at the current levels because you constantly have to be out there in the newspapers and talking to customers and whatever and keep that flowing through if you want to preserve that. So it's very clear what the challenge is. It's just a question of execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a pretty difficult aspiration. We've got to &#x2013; but we have to &#x2013; that's how what we manage to. Always we're trying to improve our deposit coverage. I think we look at deposits through a couple of lenses and we appreciate everyone's out there competing for retail deposits. We are pleased with their track record and then you'll see there on slide 29, we've had 7% to 9% growth in Personal Bank and 11% in Business over the last three years. So this is the track record there. We are writing more deposits than we're lending at the moment.</p>
          <p>We look at it through two lenses, there's one we are very focused as Mark said on the quality and the qualification of those deposits of Basal III. We can scoop up lots of deposits to improve the ratio, but we have a very focused in certain segments and we'll tend to sort of pie in those segments and be less sharp in others, because that's going to be quite important when we do convert and the value of those deposits to determine. It also applies to, I know, there is always a lot of skepticism around the issue of cross-sell, but what we have done is used the increasing relationship platform in Business and in the Personal Bank to deepen those customer relationships and that's been quite helpful. I mean the mortgage rate has come with a very substantial transaction account growth and that's been quite helpful as well. So I think if we continue to push down that down that path that will help.</p>
          <p>I guess the final point is, we are increasingly deploying more of our new technology platform and that provides quite a solid way of gathering deposits and particularly at lower cost. So I think the aspiration is there. We realized everyone is sort of fishing in the same pond, but I think we've got a couple of things that will help us, I'll show you that.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley, Cameron, the loan losses were down in Business Bank, but during the half the RBA has been forced to cut by 100 basis points, they are clearly less optimistic about the economy. Your recent Business Bank were up in half, so could you please comment on how comfortable you feel that credit quality now relative to six months ago. And also please explain why the &#x2013; or what's driving the increase in the arrears in the Business Bank, is it housing, is it commercial, is it SME?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Joseph maybe to comment on the arrears, but the &#x2013; this is a extraordinarily difficult economy to read, so in a sense that the underlying fundamentals are actually quite strong, I would interact with dozens of our Business Bank customers every week, with Joseph and others and you get a markedly stronger picture of the economy than you would get if you read newspaper headlines. The confidence is low and of course, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:21) it's difficult to reason? Do I remain comfortable about the outlook? I do at this point in time. But confidence hasn't improved just probably got worse over the six months, and there will be some point when, in fact, that will tip in. Now, the unemployment numbers will be out, well they will be out now, if they're not good, then of course that just plays into the confidence issue. So it's a pretty fragile outlook. I'd have to say, but if you took a snapshot standing here today, the economy and our Business Bank customers are actually performing quite well, but in a very, very fragile environment. Do you want to talk about the arrears though Joseph?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think do so, I mean the arrears position affects the economy. And it's largely in SME. It does include housing as well. There has been an uptick in the levels of arrears in the Business Bank housing book, but that reflects the fact that's correlated to the performance of the SME book and that most of our housing lending is to SME customers. So with &#x2013; the housing uptick there, it reflects what's been happening in the economy, but we are comfortable with where it's at, it's in line with what we expected to see given the economic environment.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. Two questions if I may. Mark, the decline in the dilutive cash in government bonds that we see in the liquidity with the big uptick we saw in the September half year. Was that something that was executed right towards the end of March or was it &#x2013; did we get full run rate impacted the reduction in dilutive liquidity in this quarter or do we get it in next one? And the second one is, if you have a look on page 98, the emerging new impaired assets are about just a whisker over $2 billion, but during the narrative you were saying that in the second quarter was below the first quarter. Would there be any chance that we can get quarter-on-quarter split, just to get a feeling on what was happening on the exit run rate on the rate of new bad loans coming through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the second one, I'll look at that. I'll just check we're not crossing some line on disclosure and if we can tell you. I'll tell you and as to whether there was any like, Eric, you can tell me if there was any late period swing in the liquidity or?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did do some re-shaping around the liquidity, but it was on after the &#x2013; after December, we did see some opportunity to pick up some bank paper and we did reduce our semi-government holdings, which would be in the bucket you're referring to. That was some changes in the portfolio.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Craig Williams from Citi. Doing the math on page 139 your release, if you strip out the Life Insurance liabilities and the other liabilities, your deposit funding seems to be about 51% of your total liabilities and equity, and your short-term wholesale funding is somewhere in excess of 20% the balances as well. It seems to be funding a larger liquid position than your peers have. So some of your peers are closer to 60% deposit funding and 15% short-term wholesale given the direction Basel III, do you think that the required shift in your liability mix would be a challenging headwind to your relative revenue growth as you move forward. And in the event of crisis, do you want a such a large short-term wholesale funded balance sheet, and consequently having dispose of liquids under these circumstances, presumably that could also bring about risk contagion to your other funding arrangements. So what are your considerations around setting things up in this manner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously with stable fundings at 85%, we need to recut that on an NSFR basis, but broadly we've got the same sort of challenge under either scenario that about 15% of our assets are effectively funded short although a big chunk of that is actually term debt with less than 12 months to maturity and that's something we need to continue to chip away. We've chipped away at over the last five or six years we've probably come half the distance we need to go and that's the challenge for the Australian banking sector. It's not a NAB challenge.</p>

          <p>Michael Wiblin from Macquarie. My question is really perhaps for Lisa, just on the retail strategy, if you have a look at it, I guess you are generating a little bit from brokers these days marginally, moved back the system on mortgages as well and we've seen a big decline in UBank interest rates, can you just comment a little bit on some of those moves and the changes and how are they factoring into the longer term strategy in the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll take that. Lisa has got a personal issue there. The &#x2013; look, I think the transformation that we went through in the retail, it's a multi-year transformation and it can only be done organically. And the important thing as we get into some of the longer term issues there, which is sales force productivity, reconfiguring our store network, driving in the technology changes, it had to be done off a franchise with momentum, which it has. We also had to &#x2013; we also wanted to ensure that we dealt with any future risks with regard to consumer action and we still remain very confident, everything we've done on fees and other things have insulated that business substantially relative to peers and what's coming and you only have to look at what's going on in PPI.</p>
          <p>The consumer and pressure for social dividends has not ended. That's all dealt with and we've taken that hit and washed through that. So there is a lot more to be done on the Personal Bank quite clearly, but had we not reinvigorated that franchise, the longer term things we need to do around things like sales force productivity and reconfiguring the store network, the investments we make in technology and digital and other things, it would have been academic by and large if you look back at the environment that we have faced with 3.5 years ago when we started it.</p>
          <p>On things like UBank, I mean, UBank has been very helpful for a number of fronts. It is a brand that attacks a different segment of the market. It's been very effective in deploying and showing the new technology which is important, but 85% of its customers remain new to NAB. So the cannibalization is very low. So it's been a very attractive segment and one that we think we increasingly are learning a lot from in terms of efficiency given its low cost channel. So it's a very important component of our strategy. So Personal Bank is still on a journey, but I would much rather be in the &#x2013; have the Personal Bank we've got today than the one we had three years ago, that's for sure.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. When we take out trading income, your income fell from the second half 2011 to the first half 2012, does that tell you that the days of gaining market share through having a low price are over and that as you mentioned in your outlook statement, the focus now has to be on ROE rather than gaining market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the, first of all trading &#x2013; I mean trading income is legitimate to include all banks to do it. I mean we will &#x2013; we're not different to any other bank in that so you can strip trading income out of everyone's business then you can make that comparison.</p>
          <p>The interesting thing is the assumption is that we are the only bank that's ever used a price lever. There's been some extraordinary pricing going on in this market in the business. It's interesting to see someone comment that I was surprised to having mortgage growth. Well, if you're discounting 115 basis points under the table you are going to get mortgage growth. So I mean pricing is just going on across the board. We just happened to actually use it as an external label, which has been great and that's why we got 650,000 new customers. So it's a dynamic of the market you've got everyone raising around trying to get deposits and you got weak volume growth. Price is going to be a feature. We just happened to talk about it. This is the fact that everyone is doing it. That's a nature of a slow growth market. Scott?</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. I just wanted to have a chat around dividend policy going forward. If you look at the current construct of earnings, obviously revenue growth is harder to come by provision growth kind of struggling and then everyone can choose their own adventure on the outlook for bad and doubtful, which will obviously have an impact on cash earnings. The level of capital that you'll need to be post the conversion of the instruments, can you just talk to us about the importance of the dividend, sustaining the dividend and growing the dividend, inflating the payout ratio, but clawing it back through a bigger DRP discount. Ultimately the dividend yields on banks stocks bank stocks what's ultimately looking attractive relative to the rest of the market at the moment. So I think dividend is the key.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't think 7% both sequentially and PCP on pre-provision growth is struggling. So they are not relative to the market. I think it is pretty good. It's better than 4% and 1%, which we've seen in the recent reporting period, but on the dividend, I think we feel comfortable with where it's at, we done it. The important goal and we are able to obviously increase it slightly in this half. The important thing for us is that we want to be clearing the ways as quickly as possible &#x2013; as practically possible about what we think is going to be the Basel III level with the buffer that we will determine. At that point obviously, we will start to revisit how we manage dividend policy at that point in time. But in terms of payout ratio and the capital we generate, we feel quite comfortable with that dividend position at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p />
          <p>Yeah, we're at 71% payout now &#x2013; our sustainable payout ratio is much higher than that, but we have to wait and see what happens to market, volumes and things like that. I don't think you want to be raising your dividend often then you decide to grow with the market and you have to start cutting it to sustain the capital all having diluted DRPs and things like that. But once we hit our target ratios it is probably first thing to go would be discounts on DRPs and things like that and then as Cameron said maybe you do some buyback or maybe you would raise your payout ratio if you think that the position is likely to be sustained. So that's all decisions to be made starting probably in the 6 to 12 months from now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, T.S. from Bell Potter, are you still optimistic about the outlook in Northern England and Scotland. I thought the prospect would be as gloomy as the weather there?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to make the mistake of one of my predecessors on commenting on the Scottish economy, but I think, I think look let me just make this in a broad sense, we &#x2013; I'm clearly not happy with the returns in the U.K. and I am very aware that it's a driver if not the most significant driver of the discount of our stocks. So clearly we have been very focused at every opportunity. If we can find a way to reverse that situation, we're absolutely attuned to it. But we made two &#x2013; I guess three commitments when we put our strategy out. The first was that we're going to focus on Australia, we want the Australian franchise to be as strong as possible and if I had a choice between a weak U.K., and weak Australia I'll pick the weak U.K. because Australia and New Zealand are our core markets and we didn't want to have anything that was going on over that last 3.5 years, distract us from the Australian franchise and this Australian franchise is clearly stronger now than it was 3.5 years ago.</p>
          <p>At some point, the U.K. will resolve itself one way or another, we will return from a return profile and that there, we don't want to then turn to be renovating the Australian franchise. We then want the true value of what is I think pretty strong Australian performance in this environment to come through. So we have demonstrated I think through the SGA and the SCDOs that I considered management of legacy issues is a better outcome. We could have many said take the testosterone approach and write the SGA, well, it would have been $4 billion and that starts to get you in to raising capital.</p>
          <p>We've got to work our way through it and we'll work our way through it. It will be a better outcome for shareholders, but what we will continue to do is not let any of that distract us from the quality of the core franchises. So, U.K. is in a difficult situation, its economy is 4% smaller now than it was in 2007. The Australian economy is 7% larger. So it's going to be a difficult environment, but having said that the Yorkshire and the Clydesdale brands are very strong brands. When we had the three-notch rating downgrade and we had the deposit issue on, those brands attract deposits. There are quality brands in those markets. So we do feel that we're playing in markets I've been in for a longtime. You've got some insulation against the economy. But the economic outlook there is not good clearly.</p>
