      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Stephanie. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Together with Pascal Soriot, Chief Operating Officer Roche Pharma; Dan O'Day, Chief Operating Officer Roche Diagnostics; Karl Mahler, Head of Investor Relations and key members of our team, I welcome you to the annual results 2009 telephone conference, and thanks very much for taking the time so early in the morning.</p>
          <p>This event starts three interesting dates for all of us. After this call we will have a 10 a.m. media conference here in Basel, at 3 p.m. analyst meeting in London and on Friday a 12.30 analyst meeting in New York. Our comments will be based on the Investor's presentation which you were able to download this morning at 7 a.m. I expect that there is plenty of information which was actually offered to you and of course we will try over the next 90 minutes to be as helpful as possible to lead you through this information and to give you as much background information as possible.</p>
          <p>This afternoon our CEO, Severin Schwan in London will address the Group section.</p>
          <p>Let me just select some of his chart for comment. So if we go to chart five the highlights, 2009 was an excellent year and an excellent platform for the future. You see that both divisions had sales above the market and as we had guided you, we achieved a very solid double-digit Core EPS growth. These were elements you may have expected.</p>
          <p>The third element is maybe new to some of you, but this also shows you the speed and the success of the Genentech integration. Let's go back to the half year call, we told you that the whole integration planning of Roche Genentech was finished and you saw in September, we already announced the implementation of the new management team and this was not only a declaration.</p>
          <p>These teams started to work and especially in the field of supply chain management. We have a new team, who really reroute the worldwide situation, the worldwide supply chain inventory levels and this has led to worldwide adjustment of policy and Pascal Soriot, who was at the end of last year the CEO of Genentech and who is of course in charge of this &#x2013; of the Pharma business and has guided this growth that can give you more details in his section.</p>
          <p>What is important for you that this trend in the fourth quarter doesn't predict the trend into 2010, we can really tell you that prescription levels were not affected and since yesterday evening, we have the January 2010 figures and they confirmed that we have a healthy trend in all our businesses.</p>
          <p>If we go further now a little bit more into the future, we are pleased to have excellent progress in developing our late stage pipeline and we have a very active management of R&amp;D investment. You have followed also there the going together of Roche and Genentech has led to certain prioritization changes in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Overall based on this excellent platform of 2009 the Board suggests to the annual shareholders meeting to increase the dividend by 20% to 6 francs, which is also totally in line with our commitment, an increase of our payout ratio.</p>
          <p>If we turn to chart number eight, you have a little bit more of the figures and you see that the operating profit before exceptional items grew by 14% and Core EPS by 20%. If we turn to chart number nine, on one hand it's nice to live in a country and to report in a currency which was strong against almost all other currencies around the world. On the other hand it hits your results and what you can see very clearly is the blue bars show you the success in local currency and the yellow bars show you how much it was impacted by the currency FX.</p>
          <p>If we turn to chart number 10, here we try to really help you understand the fourth quarter which &#x2013; if we just focus now on the Pharma business because the whole adjustments in the supply chain were primarily driven of course in the Pharma business worldwide. You see a growth overall of 7.9% and then of course if we calculate the Tamiflu effect out of 11.1, you have what can be &#x2013; in a first it's seen as a sobering minus 3.2%, but then we kindly to come on an apples-one-apples comparison. We invite you to see that of course we had a massive CellCept effect from the generalization in the United States. We have Raptiva and Accutane no longer there. We had some product divestments and if we then look into how we have refused the wholesaler's inventory, we add another 4.4% and I think this brings us to this 5.3% which gives us confident that we are on track, well on track into the future.</p>
          <p>If we go to page 12, I mean you see the Core EPS we have delivered for 2009 and nothing changes in our commitment for this year to again deliver a double-digit increase of the Core EPS. And please don't measure the bar. It's &#x2013; you won't find the secrets by going into it and magnifying it. It's just a qualitative bar about the commitment is there.</p>
          <p>If we then go onto 13 and of course Pascal is much more competent to answer all the questions around the Genentech integration, but we can just really say this was a big success.</p>
          <p>If I look back 12 months, we were in another situation and we tend to forget so quickly that last year when we did the same call the major questions you had were around, hey, guys can you even do this deal? Can you finance this deal?</p>
          <p>Now just 12 months later we are talking about how this all has been implemented and I think the research platforms are implemented on both sides. And what you now also have seen in the whole inventory level, the effect this transaction has had on a global scale are already showing up as a bottom-line in product development, marketing and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>And we also remember back that one major concern was that Roche in the end would buy brick and mortars and not the brains of the Genentech employees and that we would lose a majority of them or significant numbers of them.</p>
          <p>And on chart 14 you have actually the results of an independent employee survey at Genentech, which was done after September announcement of the new management structures, and I think &#x2013; it speaks for itself that so many people have a clear commitment at least in an independent survey to stay with this company, to see this still as a very great place to work.</p>
          <p>And you may be surprised there is always this independent survey about a great place to work as an American company and you may have seen those who followed the results that Genentech again can even after such a difficult year with a lot of change came into top 20 of all employers in the United States.</p>
          <p>And at the right of chart you also see the very, very limited attrition rate, which makes us confident that we are building the future and not looking past and are losing people.</p>
          <p>If we go to chart 15, apart from the figures, this really excites us. I think we can be proud of where we stand with our late stage pipeline and we will focus on this now and of course also on our Investor's Day on March 18.</p>
          <p>Sixteen, we are in close contact of you and we understand very well, that you were worried about the build up of our R&amp;D expenses, but what you can see here, we are at the change of a trend. We very much were committed to bring this brilliant late stage pipeline and also the earlier stage ahead. But the good news is we are not sacrificing to really commit to this, but at the same time, we are now flattening out and coming back in absolute terms and you see the argument for 2009 but for 2010, I mean the fact that we took out a whole R&amp;D side with its fixed costs in Palo Alto, all these elements are now already starting to show a very positive effect.</p>
          <p>So this leads me to chart number 17, to Roche Investor Day, today it's more on the figures, for you to understand everything which happened in 2009 and how we really start into 2010. But I think it's essential, with such a multitude of late stage events and also earlier stage pipeline events that we sit down together in a relaxed atmosphere in March and then really go through what excites us to drive this company ahead in the next years.</p>
          <p>And this brings me to chart 18, the outlook for 2010. For the Group and Pharma and of course now excluding Tamiflu, we see a solid mid single-digit growth for Diagnostics and Dan O'Day has signaled very clearly that he wants to show up his flag here significantly above the market sales.</p>
          <p>On synergies we are fully on track. You have seen we have achieved the 300 million already in 2009, now we will have a build up to 800 million and also here again for these people just to preempt some questions, don't you see more, how does this going? Just to repeat what we always told you all that the half year call since we knew Genentech so well and since we had this integration planning really well advanced, we understand there are no surprises and everything is very much going along track.</p>
          <p>For the R&amp;D investment, this will be in absolute terms slightly below 2009 level. The Core EPS growth even on the background of this excellent 2009 result we have fully committed to deliver again a double-digit growth. Debt levels and I will address it of course a little bit more in my section absolutely no problems with the liquidity situation; on the contrary, as we told you we did the whole planning for the financing of this transaction without any single Swiss francs of Tamiflu sales and of course the 3.2 billion we realized has added quite some cash additional into our cash box. So that we can really look ahead of paying down our debt in a relatively relaxed mission.</p>
          <p>And as you can see we had absolutely no problem also to finance or to finance in two months a very, very attractive dividend. And that brings me also to a clear understanding because I get &#x2013; got a lot of questions around it. Of course we stay fully committed to the increase of the payout ratio as we did it now for two years also for 2010 we remain fully committed to increase the payout ratio at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>And I think I hope this has given you in a nutshell an overview where we stand as a group and now we can go into really the Core businesses, Pharma and Diagnostics and with this I hand over to Pascal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Erich. Good morning everybody and it's really a pleasure to report back to you on those really exciting 2009 results. We start on chart 20 and on this chart you see that in 2009 the Pharmaceuticals division grew by 11% in local currency. Of course we had a negative currency effect as you know we have a strong currency and it's good for investors who buy into strong currencies, but for us it is having an impact on our sales. But if you look at it in local currency plus 11% is very strong and we achieved a strong growth across all regions.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at those results, you may ask yourselves two questions. The first one would be how did you do excluding Tamiflu and the second one would be what about quarter four? So let me address the first question first. If you look at our growth rate excluding Tamiflu it drops to about 4% and I will come back to this, it was impacted by an adjustment of trade inventory that we went through in the quarter four. But we &#x2013; if you were to look at the IMS growth rate of Roche this is the market excluding Tamiflu, so if you exclude Tamiflu and you look at our growth rate reported by IMS, we outgrow the market in every single region, except the emerging region in Baltics and Asia Pacific. But we were above market everywhere else. And as of January 2010, we have new management in Asia Pacific and Latin America and certainly I look forward to strong growth in the emerging regions moving forward. So there is our results from a market viewpoint in IMS.</p>
          <p>Now, if I move on to slide 21 to try and explain a little bit what happened in quarter four, you see here that the, excluding Tamiflu, sales growth was minus 3.2%, so of course, it tends to scare everybody a little bit, but you have to dig in those numbers to understand the dynamics of what happened.</p>
          <p>The first thing is that, as Erich explained a minute ago, as we went through the integration of our manufacturing network, we looked at our supply chain in its totality all way down to the market. We realized we could lead in the marketplace with low inventory and we also realized that in this day when cash is king our patient, our customers, sorry, the wholesalers and the specialty distributors don't really want to have too much inventory because our products are very expensive and they don't want to have too much inventory of our products. So we organized an inventory policy of trade, inventory policy in the United States between Roche and Genentech. The two companies have different approaches to trade inventory management. We came up with a new policy with a view to reduce the trade inventory.</p>
          <p>Having done that in the United States, we also decided to look at it around the world and decided that we didn't want anywhere in the world more than a maximum of 30 days inventory in the trade. And in some countries for historical reasons, because at some stage many years ago the distribution network in the country had not been very efficient, we had inventory up to 40, 45, 50 days. And we had kept it like this because just by habit and historical reasons.</p>
          <p>And we thought now we can do better than this and we have reduced in all of those countries, China, Russia and others to 30 days. So we are now in a very healthy position moving forward starting 2010, because we have extremely low trade inventory in the U.S. and appropriate inventories around the world.</p>
          <p>So if you consider this and if you also consider the patent expiry of Herceptin and the removal of Raptiva and Accutane from the marketplace, essentially the recalculated growth rate is actually 5%, excluding Tamiflu and those adjustments. And we are actually doing this calculation not to tell you that if you exclude everything that goes badly then things go well, but essentially to tell you the fundamental business, the underlying business, if you exclude Tamiflu and the adjustments we did for very good reasons, if you exclude those then we have a very good trend which is reflected in the numbers you would see in IMS, very, very healthy and very exciting results in IMS in term of demand sales.</p>
          <p>So that's for what happened in quarter four. And I'll come back to this a little bit in a few slides, just to show you some in-market demand data of some of our products to kind of convince you further that in-market the demand is pretty good. Now if I look at the P&amp;L now, you see that again our sales grew 11% in local currency and on slide 22 and the profit &#x2013; the operating profit of the five divisions grew by 15%.</p>
          <p>We had a modest increase in the cost of sales, very strong assets there by our teams to manage the cost of manufacturing our goods effectively. We also had a modest increase in M&amp;D. We had a decline in G&amp;A costs. It's actually due to the synergies derived out of the Roche-Genentech merger. So we did very well there in term of managing our G&amp;A cost and a strong increase in R&amp;D, 13%.</p>
          <p>If you were to exclude the impairments, we impaired a couple of projects at the end of 2009 and also impairment cost us an incremental 200 million on the R&amp;D line versus prior year. But if you exclude those it's still a healthy 11% and we are very proud of our portfolio. We have a very strong pipeline and we have invested in it and it's starting to pay off &#x2013; the portfolio is really starting to mature and show some pretty good results so overall, operating profit growing faster than sales.</p>
          <p>So I move on to slide 23 to share with you some of our major Phase III outcomes because 2009 was a good year from a financial viewpoint, but it was also a very good year from the point of view of clinical data and trials and new applications of our drugs helping patients.</p>
          <p>You can see here a long list, I just mentioned the PRIMA study with Rituxan in maintenance. And this will be presented at the ASCO this year and filed this year too. We see this as a nice line extension that will make a true difference for patients to the way iNHL is interested &#x2013; the clinical results are really impressive. And it will of course drive sales of Rituxan. I also mentioned maybe Avastin gastric cancer because we just got a call from the EMEA this week and this will be a very strong new indication story. In particular Japan will be filing soon in Japan and there there is a very strong potential as well as in China, Korea and the rest of Asia.</p>
          <p>Let me just state also, good results with Actemra and of course our Taspoglutide program which is progressing quite well. All our studies so far have reached the end point. They've made the end point and so we are happily moving forward with the development of Taspoglutide and we started T-emerge 8 which is our cardiovascular safety study to satisfy the FDA on their safety requirements.</p>
          <p>So I move on to slide 24 now, looking at the major filings in 2009. Of course the biggest one is the filing of RIBBON-1, AVADO in the U.S. And RIBBON-1 in the EU, as you know AVADO was filed in the EU prior &#x2013; before and we have approval for it and essentially we are waiting to hear from the FDA &#x2013; sorry later this year on the outcome of our first line which is metastatic breast cancer application. But we have as you &#x2013; we had as you can see here a number of other filings in CLL for instance, we are expecting any day a final approval from the FDA in the United States. Gastric cancer, I have talked about with Avastin, as you can see a fairly busy year again in term of filing.</p>
          <p>So I move on to slide 25, this represents our oncology franchise that is growing by 8% and here a few key messages, we have, if I exclude Avastin for a minute and I will come back to Avastin in a couple of seconds. So excluding Avastin we have of course slower growth in Europe and in the U.S. from MabThera and the Herceptin, those products have very strong market penetrations already. But we do expect a lot of additional growth in the international region, not only for Herceptin but also with MabThera and I do believe that the PRIMA study are going to be absolutely pivotal in establishing the clinical value of Rituxan in &#x2013; and convincing payers around the world to pay for this drug.</p>
          <p>But overall for the next couple of years, Avastin is clearly going to be the growth driver for this Avastin franchise and if you look at slide 26, you can see that in 2009 Avastin grew by 21%, with 31% growth outside the U.S. and 14% in the U.S. MabThera also is growing factor outside the U.S. and so is Herceptin. The graph also shows you that as far as Herceptin, the non-U.S. part of the world represents 70% of our sales, only represents about 40 to 50% sorry of our sales for Avastin and MabThera which reflects the potential of growth we have outside the United States.</p>
          <p>I'd like to spend a minute on slide 27, in this period of transparency we decided to show you those graphs. Those are the so-called OUTs. We call them the OUTs graph and they really reflect the prescriptions pattern in the United States for four of our key products. And as you can see here even though Herceptin and Rituxan are admittedly on a slower growth path and this is clear because we have very high penetration.</p>
          <p>You can see though that there is no collapse of those products. I mean the consumption, the demand is not declining, if anything it is growing slowly but it is growing. You can see that Avastin is still on a steady growth trend. And you can see that Lucentis suddenly accelerated last year.</p>
          <p>So all in all I would say the demand is as we expected for all of those products and that is further reflected in slide 28 where you can see, here reported to you the reported sales growth in dollars in orange and in blue the prescription growth. And as you can see that though in Q4 for Avastin we recorded 3% value growth &#x2013; dollar growth impacted negatively by this inventory adjustment. In fact the volume of prescription growth was 11%. The demand grew by 11%. And for Rituxan even though sales declined 3% the demand &#x2013; the prescription grew by 1%. So as you can see here there is no nothing that should worry us specifically.</p>
          <p>On page 29, you will see that there are quite some news coming out in the next few months for Avastin in very critical new indications, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer. In ovarian cancer the GOG-0218 study, which is listed on that slide, is of particular importance because it will also look at Avastin six months treatment versus 15 months treatment. We are convinced &#x2013; we believe that longer treatment duration with Avastin will lead to better patient care and better clinical results. Hopefully that study will give us a glimpse of what longer treatment duration could potentially deliver. So we look forward to those results.</p>
          <p>And we also had in adjuvant colorectal cancer the AVANT study that should read out later in 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving onto MabThera, Rituxan on page 30. As you can see here had growth across the entire world and driven essentially by the international region. We believe that in Europe we still have growth potential with MabThera in iNHL. Maintenance, this application will go in this year and as soon as we can promote it we believe that the penetration can grow from the present 10% to much higher than this. So we think there is a potential there that is significant in Europe.</p>
          <p>We also have growth potential in CLL. In the United States, there is already some adoption in maintenance and CLL, so the impact will be a little less. But on top of it, we also have substantial growth potential in the non &#x2013; in the emerging regions, as I said a minute ago.</p>
          <p>And in rheumatoid arthritis, we will be looking at earlier use within the anti-TNF IR segment. At this point in time, in most countries in Europe we have about 30% of the TNF IR segment, up to 40% in the U.K. So we are very happy with these results, but we now move &#x2013; need to move to earlier lines of treatment.</p>
          <p>Slide 31, gives you some visibility as to what are the growth drivers moving forward for Avastin. We've communicated before peak sales potential of 8 or 9 billion Avastin on the basis of the existing indication and full indications. And now, we are looking forward to ovarian, prostate, gastric and those here could be smaller or bigger depending on the strengths of the clinical signal we get when &#x2013; so the clinical data we get when we read those studies. But the peak of 8-9 compared to 6.2 billion in 2009 was a 20% growth. So as you can see it is a fairly reasonable peak sales rate, 8-9 billion to achieve and on top of this we should be able to grow through prostate, ovarian and gastric which are going to be pretty substantial opportunities.</p>
          <p>MabThera, I said it before, CLL and iNHL ex-US will be driving the product and with Herceptin adjuvant breast cancer still has an enormous amount of progress in the emerging regions. And certainly I personally keep challenging our teams to drive this product as fast as we can, adjuvant breast cancer because patients actually need it.</p>
          <p>Slide 32 gives you an idea of our rheumatoid arthritis inflammation and transplantation portfolio. A quick note on CellCept even though the team did a very good job in the U.S. and we stabilized our prescriptions to 30% or so of the total market, it's still declining but stabilized. Despite all this good work we lost a lot of sales in the U.S. The CellCept was negatively impacted.</p>
          <p>We launched Actemra in the EU, I should say essentially in Germany because this was really the country that was reimbursed at the beginning of 2009, the other countries had to wait till later in the year. And we just got approval in the U.S. with what we believe is a good level.</p>
          <p>Slide 33 shows you what the global sales are. In Germany we've achieved in Q4 14% market share in the anti-TNF IR segment. Very interestingly when we look at the German results the growth of Actemra in the anti-TNF IR segment hasn't negatively impacted MabThera. MabThera has maintained its position and has the same share in Germany as elsewhere in Europe. And the product that has been impacted substantially in Germany by Actemra at this point is Orencia. So we are extremely happy with the development and in fact in Germany in the Bio-IR segment we own about 50% share in between MabThera and Actemra today.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. as I said we have a good level. We think it is a good level because we have REMS that is a rather moderate REM and quite frankly it could have been much more demanding REMS, not having the anti &#x2013; the <mark type="inaudible" /> indication I don't believe actually is an issue in the early stage. Because quite frankly when we look at the use of Actemra in Europe for instance where we do have the <mark type="inaudible" /> 31:22) indication improved, most of our use at this point in time is in the TNF IR segment. So that is where we will get the use of Actemra in the United States in the first place.</p>
          <p>It was really always planned like this in any case. Physicians in the U.S. tend to be more conservative in rheumatoid arthritis than in Europe. So we would not have had much use in <mark type="inaudible" /> in the early days. In fact you could also look at it as a positive because there's so much data for Actemra. We will have our sales force very, very focused on the TNF IR segment. I was with our sales team a couple of weeks ago for the launch of the lease agent and I can tell you they are all extremely motivated and not at all worried about the fact that we will be focusing on the TNF IR segment. So I am very optimistic with Actemra in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Slide 34, you see the Virology portfolio growth, essentially here we see the impact of Tamiflu, 3.2 billion sales last year. This is expected to drop to 1.2 billion in 2010. So of course we will have to absorb in 2010 this decline of 2 billion in our total Tamiflu sales.</p>
          <p>Slide 35, a quick note of a new disease area that we are preparing to launch into and it's diabetes. And our first product in that &#x2013; this area is Taspoglutide. This is a basic slide, but I just want to use it to tell you have a very broad program. And our program is addressing almost every indication &#x2013; use of Taspoglutide in Type 2 diabetes and also addressing every potential competitor.</p>
          <p>So we have a very broad program and most of those studies &#x2013; those that I've read out today &#x2013; all the studies that I've read out have hit their primary end point. So we are very satisfied. And some of you may wonder about the carcinogenicity studies and what we have seen in the carcinogenicity studies told us that we can carry on with our ongoing development plan. So we are full steam ahead.</p>
          <p>We started T-emerge 8 in January 2010 and we are working as fast and as hard as we can to recruit patients in that study, of course the recruitment and the events rate will determine when we can finally file this drug with the FDA and the EMEA in particular.</p>
          <p>Slide 36 shows you that the NMEs, the New Molecular Entities, we have in late-stage and I have to say that, of course, we all tend to be very proud of our own company, but I have say we do have a very, very strong portfolio that has matured in the last two to three years and a lot of these products are in already in Phase III. And a lot of these products, if you look at them, pertuzumab, T-DM1, those are first in class, and they deliver, from what we've seen so far, extremely strong clinical benefits. So you have a lot of products that are either first in class, or potentially best in class. Some are more risky than others, of course, but we have enough data so far to be confident that they will make it through Phase III and we are investing in those progressively &#x2013; and progressing them as quickly as we can.</p>
          <p>Just a quick note on &#x2013; dalcetrapib is moving very nicely and what you have here is a documentation of a cardiovascular study in ACS patients, it's a very large, 16,000 patient study, but we also have another study in atherosclerosis, which is important to keep in mind because if that study is positive, it will open up a much broader population of patients who have signs of atherosclerosis. So a very substantial opportunity there.</p>
          <p>In closing, use and looking at slide 37, I wanted to share with you what our 2010 objectives are for the five divisions. And you see here that &#x2013; well, we celebrate for five minutes on our 2009 great results and we already back on up for another race in 2010 because this is going to be a very busy year, a very exciting year, with a lot of good data that we read out, Avastin in gastric, prostate, ovarian &#x2013; really exciting study results with Hedgehog, Pertuzumab, Taspo. So as you can see very, very rich data flow and also the filing of some indications that will have very substantial potential, not only in terms of NME or <mark type="inaudible" /> but also line extensions for ovarian cancer for Avastin is &#x2013; the size of a &#x2013; of a product by itself in MabThera, PRIMA and iNHL maintenance has also a very strong potential.</p>
          <p>Overall for 2010, we see the output for the Pharma division, excluding Tamiflu, to be a growth rate of about mid single-digit and that excludes the impact of course of Tamiflu.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I will hand over to Dan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So good morning, ladies and gentlemen, it's a &#x2013; indeed a great pleasure to present to you the financial results for the Diagnostics division for 2009. And I have two key messages as I go into my slides. One is that to remind you that Roche is the worldwide leader in In-Vitro Diagnostics and as you will be able to see, we continued to increase our leadership position in 2009 by growing significantly faster than the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And the second key message is to articulate why I believe that Roche Diagnostics is uniquely positioned to continue to drive the future of In-Vitro Diagnostics and also uniquely positioned to support the Roche Group in terms of personalized healthcare.</p>
          <p>So if we turn our attention to slide 39, I will start with the sales results. And as you can see ,we've grown in 2009, in local currency rates, at 9% and that is more than two times the global IVD markets that is growing at around three to 4%. And that growth is driven, as you can see, across our businesses in Diagnostics and perhaps most substantially by our lead business in Professional Diagnostics growing at 9%, with impressive growth in Immunoassays segment in particular.</p>
          <p>Now turning our attention to slide 40, you can see that we were successful at increasing our operating profit by 12% and that growth was driven by, of course, the sales growth, but also active management of the cost lines and delivering upon our operational efficiencies. And you also see in the slide that the cost of sales line, growing at 12%, is affected by a couple of things.</p>
          <p>Number one, the strong instrument placement we had this year across our businesses and I have an example of that later. Certainly the cobas 8000 in our clinical chemistry Immunoassays business was a contributor to that and also we had some intangible assets that affected both our cost of sales line as well as our R&amp;D line.</p>
          <p>Now moving forward to slide number 41, you can see how this innovation breaks down by business area and what's driving this growth rate. As I have indicated in our Professional Diagnostics business, the Immunoassay, and particularly the launch of our HPV Assay, was a significant growth driver for us on the Professional Diagnostics side.</p>
          <p>On diabetes care, in a very competitive market environment, this being a consumer business affected by the economy to a large degree in different countries throughout the world. In a flat market, we were able to grow 6%, driven strongly by our Accu-Chek Aviva and Performa line, as well as new product entrants into that, in both diabetes monitoring and also with the pump business.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics also saw a growth this year in both blood screening and, importantly, the launch of our cobas 4800 system for HPV and CT/NG in Europe eventually to come in the United States. This system will also be the backbone of our platform in Molecular Diagnostics for oncology, Companion Diagnostics and also for our microbiology business.</p>
          <p>In Applied Science we saw growth driven by the placement of our platforms, but also being responsive to the market environment by providing a H1N1 swine flu test as a research use which was used throughout the world to monitor this virus development.</p>
          <p>And then finally, Tissue Diagnostics growing more than 29%. This as you remember is the Ventana acquisition which is very instrumental to us for two reasons. Number one, it provides a very significant technology for us on the Diagnostics side, tissue being the primary sample in oncology. And secondly, the growth driving ability that it has Ventana being predominantly a United States business until being incorporated into Roche and outside the United States, we've been successful in using the commercial infrastructure of Roche to grow that business more than 30%.</p>
          <p>Now turning our attention to 42, the strategy within Diagnostics remains the same and it's really a two pillar strategy. One is to increase our testing efficiency and that's really the benefit to our lab customers out there that continue to consolidate providing new automated platforms that allow us to produce results in a fast period of time for our clinicians out there in the marketplace. And that's really a prerequisite and one we've advanced in significantly and will continue to.</p>
          <p>Where I think we have a unique advantage within Roche and the diagnostics industry is our ability to provide novel content on to our instrument base out there. And this is where we leverage the strength of the Roche Group, the investment in the understanding of biomarkers, the investment in clinical trials, which are all critical to showing the clinical and economic value of our products moving forward. And something that I believe is the unique competitive barrier to entry for other companies out there in the marketplace moving forward.</p>
          <p>If you turn your attention to slide 43, we see really the rationale behind this, more than doubling the market growth rate in 2009. It was done by launching products both with significant testing efficiency in each one of our segments as well as attractive innovative menu and a broad menu across these platforms.</p>
          <p>And what I would like to point out here is we often talk about personalized healthcare and companion diagnostics as being something into the future. And it's certainly, it is a journey, but I would point out that even in 2009, we had several important milestones in our Assay launches from our Anti-CCP. That could be a factor in Rheumatoid arthritis identification and development to our KRAS mutation Assay which today is being used for the determination of several different oncology products in the marketplace, to our HER2 evolution with the SISH and the Gastric on our Ventana Benchmark Ultra.</p>
          <p>So in our portfolio today across Roche, we have more than 40 different Companion Diagnostics programs from exploratory stage to late stage that are in different stages of development and those include products like BRaf, products like EGFR and the HER2 products that I spoke about, which will be instrumental to identifying the patients most likely to respond to the therapeutics being produced within the Roche franchise.</p>
          <p>Now to give you two examples of this testing efficiency in medical value in the marketplace, I turn your attention to slide 44, and to remind you that the Diagnostics business is essentially a razor &#x2013; razor blade model. And therefore, our ability to have a large installed base of instruments out there, is critical to being competitive in the marketplace. And I use one example here, our Professional Diagnostics to show you that in the mid &#x2013; the low to mid to high throughput as represented here in the 4000, 6000 and 8000 cobas modules. We have a significant installed base out there and in 2009 we installed our 6000 &#x2013; cobas 6000 module and again the rollout of our cobas 8000 module. This is important in terms of our ability to be confident about growing faster than the market in the future as well, but also it's very important to our partnership with Pharma because at the end of the day having a broad base of tests out there that are close to the patients and have an ability to have a reproducible test is critical to making sure that Pharma access for medicines that are connected the with Companion Diagnostics are as successful.</p>
          <p>Turning the attention as one example within our portfolio is slide 45, we invest significantly as well in medical value, again a uniqueness to Roche in terms of our ability to leverage the science throughout the group. This is one example with HPV which is the largest single diagnostic test in the nucleic acid testing of our business.</p>
          <p>Molecular Diagnostics today growing very rapidly and with still a fairly low penetration throughout the world. We have launched the system in Europe that you see on the left hand side of this slide, the cobas 4800 and we've also very importantly completed the largest ever clinical diagnostic trial with &#x2013; by recruiting more than 40,000 women into a trial that will advance the care of identifying patients that could potentially develop to cervical cancer and the uniqueness of our Assay both from an automation standpoint and the medical value standpoint is that we'll be in a position to identify specifically HPV16 and 18 genotyping which is responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancer development.</p>
          <p>Two things it can significantly improve the ability to identity this disease in the marketplace and because of its specificity and uniqueness could take an annual Pap smear test that is done today because of its lower sensitivity and upon a negative result turn that into an every three year testing cycles. So there's also benefits from a healthcare standpoint that the test can provide in the future as one example.</p>
          <p>And in closing I'd turn your attention to slide 46, which indicates again what we expect in 2010 in terms of testing efficiency and medical value rollout and again with our strength in the marketplace with our broad base of technologies with our uniqueness in terms of driving medical value, I'm also confident we'll be able to grow significantly above the market in 2010 as well.</p>
          <p>So thank you for your attention and I turn this back over to Erich for the financial portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dan. So if we turn to chart 48, just some few highlights. I think at the end of such an important year with regards to largest transaction in the history of our company, it is important how do we come out of this year and as you will see if I go into the details we entered the year with a very strong financial and liquidity position and on the background that we did 52.8 billion transaction over the condition coming out of this year is quite strong.</p>
          <p>And the Genentech transaction was accretive from day one. We will come to this and we are as promised increasing the payout ratio. If we have a look at the P&amp;L on chart 49, of course you have, in such a transaction year, you have always the question where is the underlying business, because this big picture could be a little bit be blurred by the exceptional items, but we tried to be as helpful as possible. If we go into chart 50, the underlying P&amp;L, you will see and I think in the previous years there was always this question, how much back-wind did you get from one-time items? And this year I really can tell you. You will find if you dig into it and you have it for instance all in the financial report on page nine, you see that this year we had quite some headwinds against us in the one-time items especially in the income from disposal of products and others. There was a significant decrease this year against the year before.</p>
          <p>All the other elements of the cost structures I think have been explained by my colleague Dan, are a clear reflection of the ongoing activities in all fields for all our cost, from production cost, marketing distribution, also R&amp;D and especially also G&amp;A cost. We have now ongoing efficiency programs around the world, where we constantly benchmark ourselves not only to &#x2013; against our Pharma peers but against the best-in-class companies as a learning organization.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page 51, I think Pharma division can really be proud of having achieved margins which are definitely in the top quartile of the industry, but again here nobody is leaning back as Pascal has hinted. We see this excellent performance as a starting ground to do much better and the same is true for Diagnostics, where we especially also were impacted by the currencies.</p>
          <p>If we go to the exceptional items on chart 52, the good news is actually I don't have to add anything in comparison with the half year's media conference. And I think this hopefully shows you that the integration planning of Genentech was done very solidly, that we are knowing what we are doing, that we have a very clear roadmap, because the figures are very much the same as you have seen them already six months ago.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to change and that's on chart 53, is the development of the currencies against the strong Swiss Franc. In the first half year we had a little bit of help especially also from the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen. In the second year also the U.S. Dollar has weakened and the only stronger currency was the Japanese Yen.</p>
          <p>If we come to the financial income, on chart 54, there's of course a certain risk that just by the magnitude of this interest expenses related to the financing of the Genentech transaction that you get the impression since the other bars are so small in comparison, we would lose them out of focus. Very clear commitment, that's absolutely not the case.</p>
          <p>If we go to the interest and debt security income and pension plans, if you look back 12 months, I had to tell you that on the background of stock market collapsing, of course the assets as well in Roche treasury and in the pension funds has come down in absolute value, and therefore in a low interest rate environment, actually you just generate lower income. The good news I have to stress, we did not incur any major impairments of our assets. We have really navigated through this difficult financial crisis without being harmed at the asset base in our treasury assets by any kind of major losses there.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the Genentech interest expenses, I mean it is a substantial amount in absolute terms, but if you think that refinance this transaction in a quite difficult environment on an average interest expense pre-tax last year of 4.5% pre U.S. tax, then I think this was a good platform to build the future.</p>
          <p>What you also can see that the Forex management went very well with plus 98 and there were some other impacts here. Group tax rate and that's a little bit a complex thing if you want to dig into the detail, but just what is important for you the underlying business tax rate in 2008, as you can see on top of the page was 23.4%. And if you will compare apples-on-apples the tax rate 2009 was 21.5%, and this is at the lower bandwidth of the corridor we &#x2013; I have always given you, I think a reasonable modeling for the group tax rate of the Roche Group is in the 22 to 24 percentage corridor.</p>
          <p>What you can see is that in 2009 the tax rate on the exceptional items had an effect that the effective 2009 tax rate came considerably down to 16.8%. And if you go to chart 56, what really pleases us and what made this transaction quite unique. If you take the exceptional elements out, this transaction was accretive from day one for the Roche shareholders, as you can see the net income before exceptional items. And I think as we showed you already with this chart, which is now in the annex, at the half year conference in 2009. In 2010 we have also been able to absorb the remaining exceptional effect. So this was financially a very successful transaction, but also of course strategically highly important.</p>
          <p>If we now focus on the Group cash flow on chart 57, we started, as I said, the year with a strong 16.7 billion in our cash box. And then &#x2013; and here really respect to the operating businesses we added 15.7 operating free cash flow. For taxes, treasury and dividends, we had a payout of totally 6.8 which led us to a free cash flow of 8.9 billion, which I think in this difficult business environment is a very good figure.</p>
          <p>And then as mentioned we had the payout of 52.8 billion, changes in ownership and the transaction of Genentech and this leads to a net debt at the end of this year of 23.9 billion.</p>
          <p>If we now go into the future, take chart 58, you see that by the end of December 2009, we had 18.54 billion of liquid funds in our cash box. And we had short-term debt. And these are all the debts, as the bonds maturing after one year of 6.27.</p>
          <p>And what you now can see, we have absolutely as I told you at the beginning, no problems with the &#x2013; add existing liquidity to serve, to actually cancel the bonds which mature after one year. And then are of course, interest expenses which in some cases of our bonds are just payable once a year, so they will also become due just in the next four weeks and the dividend, but you can see a very solid situation there.</p>
          <p>If we go to equity on chart 59 and here I still have to point out to the accounting treatment of the transaction. Most of you may remember and if you want to have the details you can go back into the workshop with all the details which was done on June 12, 2009 which you find still on the Web page of Roche explaining that if you take a company, a dot company private on which you already had the maturity that there is no acquisition accounting, but that actually the accounting goes that what remains beyond the assets actually goes against equity.</p>
          <p>And therefore we have by this significant transaction we have consumed quite a significant part of our equity. But on the other hand you can see just between July &#x2013; June 2009 and December 2009, we have already rebuilt another 5 billion of equity on our balance sheet. And therefore with this very strong liquidity position and with the forward looking cash generating power and repay power of this group we see absolutely no problem even in challenging times to face the world with the balance sheet on page 60, with 13% equity.</p>
          <p>And this leads me to the history of dividends and I think we could go with this chart back actually now 22 years because for 22 years Roche every year has increased its divined and we stay as I said at the beginning committed to even after this very attractive rate of 20% of the dividend proposed to the Shareholder's Meeting on March 2nd that we are committed to our guidance we gave two years ago</p>
          <p>So again the outlook as I already have addressed it, but to summarize it here for you again. Sales growth for the group in Pharma excluding Tamiflu mid single-digit. Diagnostics significantly above market, the synergies to reach by the end of 2010, 800 million. You know that 300 million we have already delivered and we stick to our projection that by the end of 2011 it will be 1 billion.</p>
          <p>The R&amp;D investment in absolute terms will be slightly below 2009 levels. Core EPS growth in local currencies, we stay committed to double-digit growth for this year. And the debt situation as you now have seen, we have already reduced about 12% of our debt last September. We will reduce another 13% just within the next two, three months. So that 25% just one year after this transaction will have gone and we are committed to paying down debt level quickly and to come a net cash position at 2013 &#x2013; 2015, sorry. And we stay committed to the dividend payout growth program, which we announced two years ago. So which would be the last year then for the payout based on the net income of the year 2010.</p>
          <p>I hope ladies and gentlemen this was helpful to go through these results as a team and now we have 30 minutes to try to answer your questions. And as I pointed out at the beginning, we will be available this afternoon in London in workshops, in big sessions, once you have the possibility to go a little bit deeper into these figures. So, open for questions, may we have the first question now?</p>

          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Tim Anderson, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have four questions, but they are I think short ones. On the de-stocking, just to be clear we shouldn't be expecting any re-stocking in Q1 or any of the other quarters in 2010. I'm guessing this was just a one-time reset?</p>
          <p>Second question on your Diagnostics guidance being above market, can you tell us what you think the market growth rate will be please? Third question on Herceptin, timing expectations for some of the trials that let the shorter duration use, I think there is Smog III trial that finished up recently? And then the last question on Taspoglutide, it looks like the filing might have slipped from 2010 to 2011 and I'm wondering what drove that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tim for the question. The first one I can just take myself and your interpretation is absolutely correct. This was a one-time effect which will not have any rebound. It was really readjusting the global supply chain and from now on you will see a continuous trend. So with this, the Diagnostics question I pass on to Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. For the Diagnostics market growth rate, of course we are looking at the major companies reporting in, we have seen <mark type="inaudible" /> so far reporting around 2 to 2.5%, 3% with no major increases in the fourth quarter. So I think we would expect a pick-up on the growth rate compared to 2009, but not that significantly as we go into 2010. And we're confident with our launches in both the platform side and also the reagent side and the fact that we're in the middle of many of those launches as we switch calendar years that we will be able to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I ask Pascal to take the Herceptin and Taspo questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. Absolutely, Erich. Maybe <mark type="inaudible" /> let me just reinforce what you said about de-stocking, it was a one-time effect and it's a policy change. So there is no restocking to expect. And we really tried to be a good steward of the cash flow we are managing and reducing our inventory as much as we can. So with Herceptin there is the famous <mark type="inaudible" /> study, which is a study run out of France that is exploring shorter treatment duration and we expect results by about 2012.</p>
          <p>Our own study as you know, here are two study that will look at two year treatment, we will also read in 2012. So we expect to get a lot of data by 2012. You will know that remember the Scene Hair study didn't really support the contention that shorter treatment duration with Herceptin would work. And we still strongly believe that in fact longer treatment duration will deliver better patient care. So, we'll see in 2012 who is right.</p>
          <p>For Taspoglutide, we indeed &#x2013; we file in 2011 and this is depending on the speed of recruitment and the event rate in T-emerge 8, the cardiovascular safety study. As you know we are often challenged to be a good steward of this R&amp;D budget that is relatively large. And so we tried to do that and in that instance, we first of all, had to comply with new requirements that the FDA came up with not so long ago. And secondly, before fully launching T-emerge 8 we really &#x2013; we wanted to see what the previous, the existing studies looked like. We wanted to get a read out of those studies, and get a signal.</p>
          <p>As I said before, they all met their primary endpoint. We are satisfied with what we saw. And so we launched fully T-emerge 8. So the exact timing of this filing will really depend on how quickly we enroll patients and the event rate, but we are working hard on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Tim I can add something on the Herceptin. We had a cost begin here. We had presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer meeting, the five years follow-up on Herceptin. And actually on the concomitant, we have really set a new standard. But there was an absolute improvement of 5% against that what we had seen before, and I think anything what is coming now being it now shorter treatment or whatever really has to compare to this new standard which was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer meeting. So I would really encourage you Tim to also look at this data in order to see and put any kind of treatment duration into perspective to this let's say new data which have been presented there.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question, just a few for me. On the inventory de-stock, it looks to be around 350 to 400 million on my estimates. Are there any particular products that are being affected there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the R&amp;D spend very kindly alluded to a decline of spend for 2010. Just wondering if you can give us just some color as to how to think about this on a long-term basis, given your percentage of spend is above industry average, dependent on where efficiency measures are going, and what additional products you're bringing through the pipeline?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on Taspoglutide, again alluded to the carcinogenicity data, just wondered if you were willing to comment on potential for differentiation in black box or REMS has given you've got visibility on what the competitor now looks like? And then my &#x2013; just my final question on Rituxan in the U.S., just wanted to understand that U.S. prescription chart you presented, which roughly showed flat growth just to understand the difference in growth dynamics oncology versus RA. Also you are seeing growth in RA, does that imply the oncology base is declining just to clarify that? Thank you.</p>

The &#x2013; your estimate of about 400 million is roughly correct, in the order of 400 to 450 million. And so you are absolutely spot on there, good estimate. The other aspect of this is that it affects all products. There are some viabilities, because the reduction of inventory in the United States was greater for the so-called legacy Roche products than it was for the Genentech products.</p>
          <p>We harmonized on both fronts, but the reduction on the Genentech &#x2013; on the Roche products, sorry was greater. So, you might not see the stronger impact globally on products like Pegasys, Xeloda and some others. But generally speaking, it's really across the board, because it is a policy change. It doesn't really affect any specific product.</p>
          <p>On the Taspo question, well the only thing that we've agreed with our partner to communicate is that the carcinogenicity data we saw basically told us that we could move forward with our product in late stage development. I just take advantage of signaling to you that the safety margin with Taspo is larger than it is with Liraglutide, and I will probably leave it at that.</p>
          <p>Your MabThera question in the United States, I should say your Rituxan question in the United States. In fact, in our estimates &#x2013; and I say estimates because, as you can imagine, working out the spilt between oncology and rheumatoid arthritis is not necessarily that simple. It's not completely scientific. It's just our estimate. But anyway, so our estimate is that oncology was flat and didn't decline, it was flat. And rheumatoid arthritis grew. So the growth you see in Rituxan in the U.S. is actually driven by rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>And last question I think was to do with R&amp;D spend, right? And I think the question is, are we comfortable we can manage the 2010 budget? With the 2010 budget, the thing is that the Avastin program peaked out this year &#x2013; or last year, sorry, in 2009. So from now on, we certainly expect lower, declining investment in life cycle management. As you know, the programs are extremely large and we are not going to start many many new ones of the magnitude we started before, so it's going to decline.</p>
          <p>On the metabolic side, <mark type="inaudible" /> is at &#x2013; it's on its normal pace, I guess, in terms of spend. So &#x2013; and essentially what we save on the Avastin side, we will invest in starting new programs. So we also have, on the functional cost side of the R&amp;D, we have synergy savings. With synergy savings at the functional level, we also have savings closing Palo Alto in California. So we've got a number of areas where we are certainly generating cost savings, productivity improvement in between the two companies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just a quick follow-up on the R&amp;D, the R&amp;D question is more beyond 2010. If you have visibility on efficiency and cost-saving measures which could continue the downward trend in R&amp;D? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to answer this point actually Sachin, I think the question will be a question of, for sure we will see additional productivity improvement, et cetera, but on the other hand, it will also depend on how many new products pass this barrier and move into Phase III. Clearly, our model is about innovation and it's about innovation makes a difference for patients. So we are raising the bar in term of our requirements for a product to move into Phase III. But how many products will progress into Phase III, that will be a key driver of our investment in R&amp;D of course.</p>

          <p>Sachin, we try to be helpful for 2010 here and as we hinted out on March 18 at the Roche Investor Day, that's the meeting where we'll look into the medium, long-term future. And I think there, you will also get more hints how this development could go on into the future.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome. Can we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ms. Luisa Hector, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd just like to follow-up on the R&amp;D situation. Just wanted to confirm the size of the impairment that you took in the R&amp;D line and to check that, even if we strip out that impairment, you are still looking for a decline in the underlying R&amp;D? And then if you could just confirm what the income was from divestments for the full-year '09?</p>
          <p>And then a final question on the other sales line, it's about 4 billion each year and that's declining, I think maybe about minus seven to minus 10% decline in 2009; just some color on that? The reasons for the decline, is it price pressure, is it impact in emerging markets? Any color you can give us on that and the outlook for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the question. I would suggest that, Pascal, you take the first one and then the accounting experts take the second part and the third part, is this okay? So Pascal on the R&amp;D impairment situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to be sure I completely captured the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was &#x2013; you see, the question was, we showed R&amp;D impairment expenses for 2009 and the question was, now is this ramped down on the underlying element or including in absolute amounts, including the impairments, and maybe I can also give you an answer here Luisa. You see it's so difficult to plan for impairments. I am very sorry to say so, this has nothing to do with trying to be helpful, but you know the accounting forces us, and we are very open to actually select intellectual property from outside the company and we put this on our balance sheet and once an event happens, we are just forced to impair it.</p>
          <p>So we cannot actually plan this ahead. But what is important for you, we are really committed to, and you see a certain peak in 2009 and also this is a qualitative chart in 2010. You also see a commitment of the key behind to bring R&amp;D down overall. And again, closing a full-fledged R&amp;D site like Palo Alto eliminates several hundred millions, maybe, of fixed cost on a permanent basis.</p>
          <p>And if I &#x2013; as I told you, there are ongoing efficiency programs also on the other side, I think we can be confident. And for you it has to be important, are these guys sacrificing on any programs, are they pushing the timelines out, and that's just clearly not the case. We are trying still to bring the best pipeline ahead very aggressively at the best timelines, but at the same time, deliver a better result on all cost elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one thing I could add <mark type="inaudible" /> in the R&amp;D, you have several segment &#x2013; segments. You've got the research and early development. Just so you have that at Roche, you have it at the Genentech research and early development center. And then you have the late stage pipeline. So out of this slightly declining total R&amp;D picture, what you have here is an increase in research and early development, essentially at Genentech. We actually thought that it is important to keep investing in the center there, because we have great scientists, great projects. So, there is an increase there.</p>
          <p>At Roche, we are also increasing, but we are saving money by closing Palo Alto, so net-net it's probably less of an increase on the Roche side of the research equation. And we are actually managing better our late stage portfolio by prioritizing our projects, by the fact that divesting is declining. The specific answer to your question is, the impairment are really not so much driving the decline. It's more the underlying investment that is driving the decline. And again, essentially driven out of better performance of all our teams, prioritizing our portfolio and driving synergies out of the functional costs. So there's one question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the divestments? Yes? No? That's good. Divestments I think. In the interest of time, I would like to address as many questions as possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, on the divestments, I'd refer you to the financial review. We had &#x2013; in 2007 actually, we had 259 million income from product divestments in Pharma. 2008 was a bit of high year of CHF494 million and then if you have a look to 2010, 2009 &#x2013; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was <mark type="audio gap" /> 226 so you saw that sort of 2008 is a bit of high year. These are one-time, inasmuch as they are each individual transactions, however there are a regular number of one-time events each year and in any particular half-year, there are some bigger ones and some smaller ones. It is part of the business of the Pharma division to actually divest sales products and maximize the income that comes from those. And that's part of the generation to actually reinvest in future in-licensing deals.</p>
          <p>So, will there be more next year? Yes, there will &#x2013; what will the number be &#x2013; it depends. But certainly 2008 was a bit of a high year for that and therefore that explains the drop in 2009 to a more regular level compared to 2007 and before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In reference to your last question, Luisa, will other products decline? Well first of all, these other products were impacted by the inventory reduction, just like all of the products. Again, I'd just like to repeat it, it's a policy decision, it didn't impact one or the other product, it impacted everything. Second, as Ian was describing, we're of course going through a regular divestment program. And the divestment program's goal really is about streamlining, it's about better managing our manufacturing cost, but also better managing our infrastructure cost, regulatory cost, et cetera and kind of getting rid of small products that really generate overhead as opposed to helping us. And finally, there is of course an effect of the general market on these products. So the future rate of decline, first of all, you will have &#x2013; we will not have the inventory effect again and then it will depend on the rate of divestments, which we will adjust on a year-by-year basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Again a question on this intangibles charge in R&amp;D. So, I understand there is 300 million roughly charges of intangibles. Was that in the second half, purely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It does &#x2013; this is also linked to a certain extent, of the two teams between Genentech and Roche also sitting together, and having an open look at the overall portfolio. And out of this there came a certain prioritization and you are totally right, this affected the &#x2013; almost all of this was in the second half of 2009, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Since you don't disclose any specific major products here, this looks like pretty much a deliberate action that you could also have taken at a later stage. If I then take a look at your marketing and distribution costs, with an acceleration after 5% to 7% in the second half of the year, that as well looks to me as a little bit of cost fund loading. And then last not least, obviously we are compared to consensus, we're simply replacing 600 million of products that we would have expected, highly profitable marginal units. You're replacing them by less profitable Tamiflu. So, how would you discuss, regarding a question that you may have been massively low-balling your results in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Marcel step-by-step, as I mentioned, R&amp;D intangibles are linked to third party corporations, and this is not at will, that Roche can do just what we want. In many of these cases, and by the way, if you followed our communication very closely, you have seen all these announcements because in many cases, even if it's not material for Roche as a company, these kind of terminations of corporations are very material for our smaller partners. And if you followed what happened very closely in the last quarter of the year, there were several public announcements that Roche has terminated certain corporations and of course it was obvious that this would be linked to actually impairments. And as I said, this has absolutely nothing to do with optimizing the results 2009, but to build the future solid portfolio with a joint Genentech and Roche team. With regards to marketing and distribution cost, I think I hand over to Pascal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Erich. The marketing and distribution costs, they are always higher in the second half of the year. So there is no specific pattern this year, and it really is linked to the reason along commercial activities in the field around the world of congresses and marketing activities. I don't &#x2013; there is no specific pattern here in terms of cost, you might say cost loading. Also, we'd like to highlight the fact that these days, you can't do this anyway because anything we do has to pass through this test and I can tell you it's almost impossible really so. So it's really reflecting the kind of a rhythm of our business.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D side, by the way, we have documented &#x2013; I think you have in the appendices, the list of projects that <mark type="inaudible" /> you can look at them and as Erich said, this is something that we don't decide by ourselves; often we have partners. The other thing is that it took us a little while also to work through the research &#x2013; the Roche and the Genentech portfolio and simplify it and just a simple example. We had &#x2013; we had two <mark type="inaudible" /> and then we only kept one out of the two in between Roche and Genentech and we kept &#x2013; we stopped a couple of projects that didn't meet their endpoint or didn't have the high level &#x2013; didn't meet the high bar that we are setting ourselves. So just that &#x2013; good business, good management.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And maybe two points from my side then, Marcel, very clear. Yes there was a build up of Roche Extendra R&amp;D in the United States, but that's very obvious. We were confident that we would get the approval for our Extendra and of course the sales force had to be ready. This was prepared and I think we are very proud that just &#x2013; what, it's five days, said Pascal, after the approval actually the product was launched, because everything was ready.</p>
          <p>And the second element, Tamiflu, wouldn't you agree that we would have been stupid to play around with government orders of Tamiflu in such a competitive environment? We just fulfilled whatever we could and I tell you frankly, all our contracts do not have &#x2013; to governments, do not have any take back or cancellation right. So, I think, we were not driven by any kind calendar year thinking in Tamiflu, but to bring out as much as Tamiflu as possible to the customers to help fight the flu. Can we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I have four questions, actually. Firstly on the dividend. Can you just help me how to really calculate the payout ratio properly? It looks like it's calculated off EPS for continuing businesses before exceptionals. Just wanted to confirm that and if yes, whether the increase of the payout ratio was really 4% this year and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First, I'm nodding, so you can cross this one off, yes you are right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So and is that 4% any sort of indication for the increase you are going to see next year, or is it going to be not a guide? I don't know whether you want to comment on that. On Lucentis acceleration in the second half, you mentioned in the press release there was some easier reimbursement, but could you just give us some color what is really easier or whether what we are seeing is actually some emerging off-label using REO and DME?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, Tamiflu, of the 1.2 billion you're guiding for this year, how much of that is pandemic? And then I just have another question on the R&amp;D guidance and basically, Erich, you referred to a change in trend and I was wondering whether this is just also a change in attitude or a change in the way, how you manage the budget? I was wondering whether it is just that you have higher hurdle rates or more a rigorous approach to when you approach certain milestones?</p>
          <p>I think Pascal mentioned, for instance, on the T-emerge 8, you wanted to get enough data from the others before you actually launch into that program fully? Or is that really &#x2013; given that you had the terminations and I know you prefer to talk about functional synergies, but were there actually really some portfolio synergies as well, because you just had duplications here and that those costs are going away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will try to start with the dividend. I hope you are pleased with the dividend for this year. With the calculation of the payout ratio, you were spot on. And now you have of course two clear elements to model the dividend for next year. You have a clear commitment of a double-digit Core EPS growth. And you have the commitment of increasing the payout ratio. So I think this gives you a very nice bandwidth for a minimum dividend you could assume, barring unforeseen events. For Lucentis and Tamiflu, I'll hand over to Pascal, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Thanks, Alexandra for this question. Lucentis, first of all, we had an acceleration as you saw in the OUTs graph I described a bit earlier and that was related to a change in reimbursement by CMS of Avastin at the end of the last year. And doctors were really antagonized by that change. And as you know, the use in AMD today is 50% Avastin, 50% Lucentis in the United States. And then there was a big shift towards using Lucentis as opposed to Avastin. Now that created a bit of a political backlash and quite rapidly CMS had to backpedal and they reinstituted the previous investment scheme. So, therefore we expect that the effect on Lucentis to level off. But we also expect to kind of keep &#x2013; to keep some of the ground we've gained in the last few months of 2009. Tamiflu, the answer to your question is that pandemic is about 55% of the total Tamiflu sales of 1.2 billion of last year and on the guidance....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I was actually asking for the guidance &#x2013; for the 1.2 billion guidance for 2010, how much of that is pandemic business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so sorry, so that's what I was answering, the guidance.....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>55 &#x2013; it's 55, sorry I understood it was '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 55%, or about 55%, is pandemic out of the 1.2 billion. R&amp;D guidance well the answer is that there is a bit of a mixture really. A couple of projects, but not many really that we are in double, they were duplicated and we kept only one. But essentially the combination is related to projects that didn't meet their endpoint or alternatively didn't meet the high bar that we set for ourselves. Our IGF-1 is a good example of this. Maybe in different times or maybe a different company might have progressed at compound. We decided not to &#x2013; we really are very much in a business looking at products that will make a true difference for patients in the marketplace. And we are forced like to prioritizing our portfolio, our resources and putting resources behind those products that will really truly make a difference.</p>
