        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diego. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Teva's first quarter 2009 earnings call. We hope you've had a chance to review our earnings press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com.

          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased to report that the year is off to a strong start for Teva. In fact, we exceeded even our own expectations, and we did so despite the negative foreign exchange effect of approximately $200 million on our top line. And as you will hear in a moment, this has had no impact on our operating income. The year is also off to a strong start strategically. We are making great progress on the Barr integration, and we continue to run ahead of schedule as we work to combine our two companies.</p>
          <p>Teva's net sales in Q1 reached a record $3.1 billion with gross margins of 58.4%. Our operating profit was $826 million, with net income of $634 million. And all of this ultimately brought us to EPS of $0.71. Our results in Q1 were driven by increased sales in all of our major businesses and across our many geographies, as well as by excellent progress we have made in the Barr integration.</p>
          <p>Once again in Q1, all of our global units continued to grow. In North America, we had very good quarter, with sales up 36% over Q1 '08, led both by sales of our branded products and by our U.S. generics unit, which achieved total sales of approximately $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Despite the absence of any major product launches in the first three months of 2009, we enjoyed strong sales of products from Teva's and Barr's portfolios. And the progress we have made in the integration enabled us to leverage Teva's marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities to further enhance sales of Barr's products and files.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that the comparable quarter, Q1 '08, was an exceptional quarter, during which we delivered the balance of 2007's pantoprazole launch, introduced Alendronate, and sold the balance of our Oxycodone quota, all major products. I would also like to note that we are especially pleased with the initial results of our recent launch of generic Adderall XR, which will be reflected in our Q2 results. In just four weeks, Teva has already captured 47% of the market share of this important product, and we anticipate growing our share significantly.</p>
          <p>In Europe, sales were up by 24% on a local currency basis over Q1 '08. I am speaking in terms of local currencies, because we believe that this is the proper way to measure business performance these days. When currencies are so volatile, it is difficult to get a true picture of operating results, which are naturally measured in local environments and in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Despite the slowdown in market growth in certain European markets such as France, Italy, and Spain, we managed to increase our market share in major markets. We increased our leading market share in the UK; in the important markets of France, Spain, and Poland, where we are now the number three player; and in Germany, where we are making significant progress.</p>
          <p>This was an outstanding quarter for our international business, which grew by 25% in local currencies, supported by especially strong results in Latin America, in our generics business in Russia, in Israel, and in Croatia, a new market for Teva. As you know, PLIVA is Croatia's largest pharmaceutical company, and sales in that country are quite substantial.</p>
          <p>Teva's innovative business began the year on an especially strong note, as in-market global sales of Copaxone grew 15% over the first quarter of 2008. In the U.S., in-market sales increased by 38%, and Copaxone's market share reached over 27%, further widening the gap between Copaxone and the number two product. In terms of NRx, our market share reached 37%, and our TRx market share reached a new record high of just over 37%. Outside the U.S., despite continued unit growth, the foreign exchange effect resulted in a decline of 17% in in-market sales compared to Q1 '08. We view this decline outside the U.S. as an anomaly and expect Copaxone to continue to outpace the market's growth and perform extremely well.</p>
          <p>In early March, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Copaxone to include the treatment of patients who had experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS. The FDA's approval follows a similar decision by the MHRA in Europe, under which 24 EU member states have mutually recognized an expanded label for Copaxone.</p>
          <p>Based on the success of the Copaxone brand, we are continuing to advance our research to ensure its position as the first-line, gold standard MS therapy well into the future. I am pleased to announce that Teva is developing a number of product enhancements aimed at improving the administration of Copaxone for our patients. Our latest formulation contains 20 milligrams of glatiramer acetate in much smaller injection volume. In June, we will begin a study to assess whether decreasing the injection volume can improve the injection experience for patients.</p>
          <p>This was also a strong quarter for Azilect, in-market sales of which grew 50% over Q1 '08, with growth in the U.S. over 90%. We are very optimistic about Azilect's future and are excited about the promising results of the ADAGIO and Tyramine studies, which may lead to Azilect's label being modified and allow it to be more broadly prescribed.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our global respiratory business, sales reached $185 million, up 9% over Q1 '08. The increase was driven primarily by strong sales of ProAir in the U.S., while the conversion from CFC- to HFA-based inhalers is now complete. ProAir maintained around 60% market share in Q1. Meanwhile, our second respiratory brand in the U.S., QVAR, increased market share and has now moved into the number two position in the inhaled corticosteroid market.</p>
          <p>As you know, we expanded our specialty pharma portfolio through the additional of Barr Women's Health business, where in Q1 sales grew 39% to reach $97 million. We believe that this unit has excellent prospects for growth and have set our sights on growing it into a $1 billion business and becoming the leader in women's health in the U.S.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing to run ahead of schedule in integrating Barr. With each of Teva's acquisitions, we have become more and more effective at integration, so that when it came time to integrate Barr, we were able to hit the ground running. The integration has been going so well that after only one quarter, we are operating as one unified organization in key markets such as the U.S., Germany, Poland, Russia, and Croatia. As I told you in February, we now expect to realize cross-synergies from this acquisition of over $400 million in the third year, and we expect the acquisition to become accretive to GAAP earnings in the third quarter of this year, three quarters after closing.</p>
          <p>Based on our strong start to the year, I am very optimistic about our results for 2009 and 2010. We expect net sales in 2009 to be between 14.1 and $14.6 billion, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.20 to $3.40. We expect the second half of 2009 to be stronger than the first half, with quarterly net sales and EPS results improving sequentially.</p>
          <p>Looking to 2010, we believe that EPS will increase 30 to 35% over our 2009 projected EPS on the strength of Venlafaxine; our generic version of Effexor XR launch, as well as additional launches in the U.S.; the completion of the take-back of Copaxone from Sanofi-Aventis in North America; and synergies from Barr integration, both sales and cross-synergies.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to turn the call over to Eyal for a more detailed financial review. Eyal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you've had the opportunity to review the press release we issued this morning.</p>
          <p>We are indeed off to a good start for the year. In fact, the results are better than our original expectations. We presented strong sales and GAAP as well as non-GAAP earnings. The results were driven by a good product mix, excellent expense control, and major progress made with our integration of Barr, which is ahead of plan and schedule. We once again witnessed Teva's tremendous capability to identify an acquisition target, execute on our plans, and drive added value from this acquisition faster than expected.</p>
          <p>The devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar reduced our top line by approximately $200 million compared to Q1 2008 and by approximately $70 million compared to Q4 2008. However, unlike most of 2008, foreign currencies' effects were neutral to operating income, which benefited from a very good currency balance.</p>
          <p>I would like to reiterate what we initially said about Q1 and 2009 in general. We did not expect this to be a linear year. Sales and synergies from the Barr integration are expected to improve from one quarter to the next, with most of the new product launches planned for the second half. In light of this, we are very pleased with our good start of 2009.</p>
          <p>Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter. In our non-GAAP presentation, we have excluded the following items this quarter, which are primarily related to our acquisition of Barr, which was completed towards the end of December: $220 million of inventory step-up; amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling $54 million, divided between cost of goods sold, $46 million, and remaining $8 million in sales and marketing expenses; and $14 million in restructuring and impairment charges; in addition, the related tax effects of $105 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results in the first quarter of 2008 are not identical to those in the current quarter. As in Q1 2008, we excluded in-process R&amp;D resulting from the acquisition of CoGenesys and the write-down of auction rate securities that did not appear this quarter. As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show you how we as management and our Board look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>Before going into some more details, let me highlight two major elements that affected our results this quarter: foreign exchange differences and our North American distribution of Copaxone.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange differences continue to play a significant role throughout this quarter, impacting sales and our balance sheet but not operating profit. Similar to Q4 last year, foreign currency differences continued to adversely affect sales this quarter by approximately 8% or $200 million, as the dollar strengthened against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the British pound, the Hungarian forint, the Canadian dollar, and the Russian ruble, compared to the first quarter of 2008. When we eliminate the foreign currency impact for the quarter, consolidated sales actually grew by 30%, with sales in Europe growing 24% in real terms and sales in our international markets growing by 25%. We manage the countries in the local functional currencies and measure their sales and profits accordingly.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, on the other hand, was not impacted this quarter by foreign currencies. As we mentioned in the past, Teva's diverse geographical presence continues to provide us with good natural hedge that mitigates much of the risk involved in currency fluctuations and minimizes the impact on our bottom line. Our well-balanced currency structure is also a part of our long-term managerial view of creating a balanced business model, which protects our operating results.</p>
          <p>Now, as for Copaxone, similar to the past three quarters, the change we made in the distribution of Copaxone in North America increased sales in this quarter compared to Q1 last year by $200 million, and was practically neutral to operating income.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our consolidated results. Sales totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% compared to Q1 last year. Exclusive of the items detailed above, non-GAAP net income was strong, up 4% compared to Q1 2008, despite higher finance expenses and higher tax rates, as planned, both resulting from the acquisition of Barr.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating income was up 14% compared to Q1 2008 and benefited from strong gross margin and tight expense controls. Non-GAAP gross profit margin, which excludes amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up, was 58.4% in the reported quarter, compared to 54.9% in the comparable quarter of 2008. The improvement in gross profit margin is attributable to many parts of our business. But mostly higher Copaxone sales, partially resulting from the fact that we now record 100% of Copaxone sales in North America; higher respiratory sales, especially ProAir; and the addition of Barr, whose generics gross margin this quarter is a bit higher.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses reached $219 million or 7% of sales, up 22% compared to Q1 last year. As you know, the higher spending rate on R&amp;D is consistent with our strategic plan to double R&amp;D output. And in Q1 2009, we already more than doubled the number of our submissions.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing expenses, excluding amortization of intangible assets, totaled $596 million this quarter, or 19% of sales, compared with 13% of sales in Q1 2008. These higher sales and marketing expenses are in line with our plan and resulted primarily from the termination of our distribution agreement with Sanofi-Aventis regarding Copaxone in North America, as of April 1, 2008. The net impact of the termination of the distribution agreement on sales and marketing totaled $196 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We recorded $63 million of financial expenses in our Q1 2009 result, compared with $14 million of non-GAAP financial expenses in the comparable quarter of 2008. The higher finance expenses resulted from debt incurred in connection with the Barr acquisition.</p>
          <p>In Q1 this year, we adopted Staff Position number ABP 14-1. Under this rule, we are required to bifurcate the equity from the debt component within some of our convertible debentures. This results in an increase in financial expenses but with no impact to fully diluted earnings per share. The tax rate provided for in Q1 2009 was 17% of pre-tax, non-GAAP income. This represents our current estimate of the annual tax rate for 2009 compared with a rate of 10% for the entire 2008. The increase in tax rate resulted primarily from the fact that Barr's corporate tax is higher than Teva's.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our cash flow. Cash generated from operation amounted to $733 million. Our free cash flow &#x2013; which includes $23 million received this quarter in connection with the sale of our veterinary business in Israel, less capital expenditure of $159 million, and cash dividends of $127 million &#x2013; amounted to a total of $470 million in free cash flow.</p>
          <p>On March 31, we had $2.5 billion in cash and financial investments. Our total loans &#x2013; bonds and convertible debenture &#x2013; stood at $8.4 billion, similar to December 31, 2008. During the quarter, we paid down our bridge financing loan by approximately $350 million and at the same time borrowed a six-year, $200 million loan from the European Investment Bank as part of our effort to extend maturity of our borrowing portfolio. During the second quarter, we plan to continue to pay down the bridge loan and other short-term borrowing by close to $1 billion. Some of this has already happened.</p>
          <p>DSO or days sales outstanding amounted to 51 days this quarter, unchanged from December and down from 52 days in Q1 2008. We have calculated the DSO as we always do after netting out from the receivable the sales reserve and allowances, so-called SR&amp;A. Whereas our accounts receivable and SR&amp;A did not materially change, the decline in DSO resulted primarily from higher sales.</p>
          <p>Inventory days were 191, down from 206 in December 2008. Part of the decline is due to the sales of products, which included inventory step-up from the Barr acquisition. Capital expenditures reached $159 million this quarter, down from 181 million in Q1 2008, as the acquisition of Barr reduces our needs to invest in plants and equipment.</p>
          <p>And last, dividends. Yesterday, Teva's Board approved a quarterly dividend amounting to approximately $120 million. On a per share basis, our dividend, which is declared in Israeli shekels, was 0.6 shekels. Based on the rate of exchange of May 4, 2008 (sic) [2009] , of the shekel to the U.S. dollar, this translates into approximately $0.144 per share.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today, and now we'll be glad to take your questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Randall &#x2013; our first question from Randall Stanicky from Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, guys. Just a couple of questions. First, more of a housekeeping. Eyal, should we think about the components of the guidance being generally intact as we think about gross margin, SG&amp;A, and R&amp;D? And the thought here is that the gross margin performed so obviously above trend, and it looks like there's some recent launches that could support that going forward. So how do we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Margins on the high end -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the high end. Yeah, if you remember last quarter we said that the gross margin for the year &#x2013; or the guidance we get for the year would be somewhere between 56 to 58%. We started the year with the high end of that range. Let's not forget that there's a full year ahead of us. I think that the range that we gave &#x2013; and if you look at all the numbers, they are all more or less around that &#x2013; our range. That's &#x2013; same thing for SG&amp;A, sales and marketing is a little higher than that &#x2013; than what we've guided. But again, there's a full year and more revenues to be gained. That impacts the margins. So I think that that structure is well in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then secondly, just &#x2013; as we look at European sales, can you help us think about the constant currency organic growth? I assume, obviously Bentley's in that number, and I assume you have some PLIVA &#x2013; at least Germany, if not some other countries, in there. So as we think about the 24% constant currency growth, if we were to think about that number on an organic basis, where would that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, maybe you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say it again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. How do we think about the organic constant currency growth for Europe? Obviously Bentley is in that number, that 24% growth number, and I assume that there's some PLIVA contribution allocated to that. So if we were to think about the Teva legacy business over there, can you talk maybe about growth trends in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in general what you could say, of course it's been an on and off strategy to be acquisitive, so to a certain extent, whether it's organic or acquisitive, it's part of our strategy of growth in Europe anyway, so that's the first point of course.</p>
          <p>Second point is, if you look at underlying growth outside of the markets where we have acquired sales through Bentley or PLIVA, we're showing some nice performances as well in local currencies, whether you take UK or France or other markets like Italy, we're doing relatively well. The market in these places of course has been less buoyant compared to last year. That is probably related to the economic pressure that's on the governments and on the payers. But within that concept, we are doing quite well and we &#x2013; without exception we're growing faster in those markets than the underlying market growth. So we're gaining share in virtually every market in the EU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you growing across each country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, some places. Some places we'll grow very, very little, and some others we're growing very well. As I said, it's related to the dynamics of the market. And as I said, there is no market in Europe today in the first quarter where we have not been able to follow the dynamics of the market or beat it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the last question. Can you give us a relative split on how much of the PLIVA business in terms of revenue allocation went into EU versus international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Maybe I can take that. PLIVA basically added say, by and large, to four countries. Croatia and Russia as part of our international business. Germany and Poland are part of our European business. Croatia we had no &#x2013; virtually no presence before, so this is almost full. And in addition, in the other countries, there is organic growth in addition to the PLIVA additions in the three other countries, which Gerard had mentioned before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randall, let me follow on that, because I know where you're heading, and actually it's very difficult now to do this kind of analysis due to the fact that, as I said in my part, we are now operating as one organization. And it's very difficult to see what was contributed by Teva or by PLIVA or what's because of the synergies between the two. And we have many nice examples so that all of you worked for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I have can provide you with some numbers that will show you part of the contribution of the PLIVA part to Teva operations in the international and in the European regions. But first of all, I would like to touch base on the bottom line. PLIVA, as you well know, as a public company was a losing-money company. After the first quarter, we actually did a turnaround, and now the bottom line on PLIVA is a positive by $27 million. The growth contribution in each countries where we had a previous Teva organization and a PLIVA is better than it used to be before.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, guys. Earlier this quarter you mentioned that in your branded franchise you're interested in maybe looking at the pain area. So wanted to know what steps you're taking right now at this point to expand that effort, or if you've started to expand that effort? Or would we be thinking about maybe acquisitions? And the follow-up on that would be also just from an R&amp;D perspective, your R&amp;D looks roughly as if it's flat quarter-over-quarter, and Barr was running about 60 to 70 million in R&amp;D spending per quarter. So wanted to understand how you could have gotten that much leverage that quickly. And what should we be thinking about that line moving forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you want to take that? Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hey, how are you, Ken? Just a couple of quick points. We are constantly evaluating different divisions. One of the divisions that we talked about, as we talk about branching out our specialty pharma, and as Shlomo broke out, the Women's Health performed very well this quarter. And we're looking to grow that business to a $1 billion business here. We are looking at other areas, such as pain management, such as oncology. All of those will come into review as we begin to think about acquisitions again.</p>
          <p>Right now, though, of course, the main emphasis for Teva will be looking essentially at getting Barr integrated as quickly as possible, and as Shlomo has said, it's &#x2013; we're doing such a good job, it's beginning to be difficult to decide what was Barr and what is Teva.</p>
          <p>With respect to the R&amp;D spend, I think you can look at that very pragmatically. As we get going and we start to integrate with Barr, the first thing you look at is the R&amp;D, and you kind of have to freeze it a bit for a while until you can decide which files to push forward, because you have a certain amount of overlap in the R&amp;D. So I think you'll see the R&amp;D numbers ramp up and normalize over time. So I just think that this is a bit of an anomaly right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just following up from Shlomo's comments about &#x2013; or Eyal comments in terms of guidance, if you take this Q1 revenue run-rate here and take your low end of your range, it looks like a recovery to about 3.6 to 3.7 on the top line, if I'm doing my math correctly. And wanted to understand the components of that. Is it going to be U.S.-centric, or is it going to be European, international-centric, or should we think kind of equal growth in both? And what from a European standpoint or international standpoint would drive such a dramatic recovery in the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, yeah, we said this, if you remember, we said it already when we provided guidance for 2009 about three months ago. We said exactly the same thing. Most of the large launches for the year, particularly in the U.S. generic market but also in European and international markets, which are &#x2013; they're smaller by definition than a very large <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S. are targeted to Q3 and Q4. And Bill maybe could add some information to that to give you some clarity and visibility of why the second half is going to be so much stronger than the first. But remember that Q2 should be better than Q1. There is also some sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. Bill, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just to follow up on that. Although in the first quarter, we launched nine products, none were really significant. The largest ones were Sumatriptan and Solodyn. But we're still looking at the potential to launch approximately 30 more additional products yet this year with innovator value of about 25 billion.</p>
          <p>You know we've got a number of cases outstanding or we're waiting for decisions, everything from Donepezil to Montelukast, but we're also very excited about Oxaliplatin, Raloxifene's still out there, Temodar, Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. There's a number of cases that are still awaiting decisions. So we see quite a bit of opportunity, especially though around the back half. And don't forget we are still talking about &#x2013; there's still the discussion around Enoxaparin. And regardless of what happens, Prevacid will launch in November, and that we expect to be a rather large market, along with the &#x2013; again, that's lansoprazole &#x2013; and the ODT will launch as well.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the respiratory, really we didn't see it as an issue at all. It's actually performing quite well. Don't forget that you have two aspects with respect to respiratory. You have a seasonality aspect, and we had the conversion happening in the fourth quarter. So we saw some real buying that occurred in the fourth quarter, as most people didn't want to miss this conversion. They wanted to make sure that they didn't dispense CFC. So there was quite a bit of purchasing there. So the quarters look good. Our share's sitting at almost 60%, although for the longer run I think that that's a bit aggressive, but we're doing very well with respiratory, and we're very pleased with the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one follow-up, which is back onto the gross margin. So can you maybe help us here? It appears to us that perhaps the euro to Hungarian forint exchange rate played a role in the cost of goods, and maybe that had some outsized impact on gross margin improvement from a cost of goods standpoint. Can you help us out a little bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah. Yes, it's Eyal. Absolutely. It's not just Hungarian forint; it's also the Israeli shekel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also the Israeli shekel, yes, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Between Israel and Hungary, that's more than half of our pharmaceutical and API production in the company, and definitely two countries where we spend more than we sell, and the weakness of these two currencies had an impact on gross margins, as well as R&amp;D expenses. One of the earlier questions talked about expenses in R&amp;D; don't forget that we also have R&amp;D in these two countries, and the weakness of the currencies when you convert it to dollars also reduce R&amp;D expenses. But you can find it mostly in the cost of sales and R&amp;D. And these two currencies were major on reducing expenses.</p>
          <p>I want to read to you numbers. I mean, this is &#x2013; it looks like magic, but the numbers are exactly identical. There are $200 million of reduction in sales and $200 million in reduction of expenses, both resulting from currency. So it was exactly identical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Eyal, if that's the case &#x2013; Eyal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, if it remains constant, then shouldn't we assume that later in the year you have these launches, which are presumably higher-margin products because they're new, couldn't we expect the gross margin to actually exceed that guidance range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you promise me that it remains constant?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I'm just saying that if it did, obviously you're looking for margin improvement, all else equal, because of the new product introductions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Moshe. As we said, we are starting the low-volume formulation with the objective to improve the injection experience for patients. As we know, it's very important for Copaxone, being a daily injection. We are planning to embark &#x2013; or start a study in June and actually to conclude the study by year-end. And based on the findings, we'll take it from there, based on the finding of the study, how to go about the data and the findings of these new formulation results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Greg. Yeah, I mean, I think that patent legislation is still a real hot issue in D.C. That said, you're now running into the Obama administration trying to move on health care. And so, although the FTC really wants this and there's a lot of talk about it, I'm just not so sure with all the &#x2013; with what needs to be done, what the Obama administration wants to do around health care &#x2013; whether it's really going to get traction or not this year. And as I've said before, Greg, the way that this has had a chilling effect on settlements, I'm not so sure that I would be afraid of a settlement bill at this point in time. Because at least it would define I think in the context of how a bill should be done, certain safe harbors for us to be able to settle. And we think that settlements between branded companies and generic companies, like in all other businesses, should be allowed.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just maybe following on to the kind of D.C. environment. Could you talk a little bit about where you see the state of follow-on biologic legislation in the U.S. now with this broader health care reform discussion we've seen kind of emerge this quarter? From your perspective, does that accelerate the timing of follow-on biologics, or is there risk this type of legislation either gets kind of delayed or lost in the mix with these broader health care reform discussions? And if I can just get a quick follow up from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris. I think this is something that actually might get tagged on to some other larger health care legislation. Remember, it is a saver, and I think that most of the legislation designed around health care will &#x2013; could very likely become costers, or so or actually cost the system, and I think the administration will be looking for areas to save money. So I think it's very likely or very possible that this bill gets tagged on to something along a broader health care discussion in the back half of the year. And we're hopeful that health care can pass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And then just a follow-up on Copaxone ex-U.S., can you elaborate a little bit more on the sales timing issue that you referenced in the press release? Maybe first how large of an impact was that in the quarter? And will this timing issue, does that have any bump for second quarter sales, or was that just purely a first quarter issue? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Moshe. As we said, there are two effects. One is the foreign exchange, and the other is the sales in some of the international markets that are not equally spread across the year, due to the nature of the purchasing. All in all, if you look at that, we see a solid growth in units. And based on the result and the trend in the market, we believe that the Copaxone outside the U.S. will continue to grow in '09.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Just wanted to get a sense of what you guys are thinking about managing the risk exposure profile to potential damages. Clearly Solodyn was settled.

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, Scott, thanks for the question. I think that we've always taken risk with a very pragmatic approach. We take a very stringent review of a product before we launch, and as you know, we previously have not launched where we believe that there would be an adverse court decision. And so even in the case of pantoprazole, the one you called out, we did &#x2013; I wouldn't say win. A PI was not put in place, and we felt that that of course gives us the kind of coverage we need to go into the market, which is what we did. All that aside, we have always reminded the market that we carry P4 insurance, and that is something that we think is very important for us to be able to continue this strategy.</p>

          <p>As opposed to the fentanyl patch. Fentanyl patch is doing quite well, but we're &#x2013; we're still up to 6% of the market, and we're growing, and we're doing it the way we had said we would do it, which would be the slower Teva way.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Shlomo, your $1 billion Women's Health care goal, is that just for the branded Women's Health care, or does that include the generic side of the business? And does that also include acquisitions, or do you think you can hit that organically? And then I have a follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to answer this question with practicalities. I would say that we recognize the potential of this branded segment, and we believe that part of our future growth could be heavily related on some of the specialties, which is a very interesting segment in the pharmaceutical business. And once we acquire the very interesting franchise, which is doing very well, which is the Women's Health franchise, we believe that we could make it into a $1 billion market. And of course, we will have to draw out plans and that will be probably a part of almost every tool that we are using when we would like to grow our business, mainly organic, and of course if there is a relevant acquisition, we would consider it as well.</p>

And also if possible, if you could give us some idea of where you're seeing the greatest usage of the product, whether it's monotherapy or combination therapy. And then with respect to the ADAGIO study, can you update us on the timing of the ANDA submission for potential expanded indication? And what should we think about that, if in fact you're successful in getting that approved, in terms of what it really does for the market potential of that product? Would it be essentially opening up more newly diagnosed patients, or would you expect to see greater utilization across the spectrum of all indications, if you were able to get that label expansion?

          <p>This is Moshe. I'd like to answer your questions. Based on the results of the indication of the when we announced the results of the ADAGIO, we already saw the trend, both in mono and both in adjunct indications. Naturally, the ADAGIO is supporting the mono indication more than the adjunct, but definitely we see the spillover for both the adjunct and the mono. We believe that the result of ADAGIO, as well as the other activities that we are doing with Azilect, will continue to grow the business, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>As far as the ADAGIO study and result, we have to remember this result is taking us into a new area. And when I say us, it means Teva and the FDA, and we are discussing that with the FDA as we need to combine the data that we have from the ADAGIO study, as well the data from the TEMPO study on the mono. And based on the result of the discussion with the FDA, we'll make a decision about the submission of the ADAGIO result to the authorities.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, I guess my &#x2013; in trying to get to bottom. Is this -- you see more usage in adjunct therapy or you think greater usage as a monotherapy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All in all, I think it's on average I could say that it's around the 50/50 between mono and adjunct. Definitely, it varies market by market, depends on the prescription pattern in every market. But the growth, we definitely see the growth in both indications, mono and adjunct as well.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of clarifications. Today in your comments about synergies looking &#x2013; from the Barr acquisition &#x2013; looking better, are you indicating that you now believe that synergies will be above 400 million, or are you reiterating the 400 million number, higher than the original 300 that you first commented on a few months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say it in this way. First of all, we reiterate the number that you &#x2013; gave you in February. But it's my strong belief, even if I'm not providing you a new number, that the more we deepen into this integration, the better the number is going to be. And I believe that maybe next time we would come with another number, which probably would be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And in terms of the FX impact, I guess as I look at the differences between, say, Copaxone international &#x2013; or excuse me, Copaxone in Europe and generic business Europe, the FX impact seemed to be greater on the generic business. Am I looking at that correctly? And is there a currency explanation for that, or is the explanation more the underlying constant currency performance of those different businesses, different products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the truth is that we didn't analyze this from that angle, whether the currency &#x2013; an adverse currency impact both on Copaxone and on generic business in Europe. Of course they're not sold in the same percentages in the same countries. So it varies based on different countries. Again, this is not an educated answer based on a thorough analysis, but I think it were a very similar input.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just slip in one more. Are you seeing &#x2013; you indicate that the economy is having some effect, but the pursuit of generics is perhaps offsetting that. Can you put any color around economic effects on patients filling prescriptions? And are there differences in that by geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To a certain degree there are some impact of the current economy situation. But before I'll elaborate on that, generally speaking, as you well know, demand for pharmaceuticals are relatively stable. People probably have to use their medicine, and this is probably one of the last things, besides food, they would give up. But having said all that, in some European countries, we see that the market has actually flattened, or even to a certain degree we saw some decrease in consumption. For example, France, to a certain degree, there is a cultural issue involved here as well. But exactly as I mentioned in my part, we managed to grow our market share in this decreasing or declining market, so to speak.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on your &#x2013; you mentioned 200 million in expense reduction offsetting the revenue hit. Could you give us an idea of how much of that was attributable to COGS and how much of that was attributable to R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely the impact on COGS in terms of dollars and cents was higher because it's a much bigger expense. But it wasn't just attributable to COGS and to R&amp;D. It was &#x2013; you can also find this in G&amp;A and sales and marketing. Approximately 60% of our expenses are in non-dollar environments. Exactly the opposite picture of our revenues, as you've seen from the press release. 60% of the revenues are in dollars; the 40% are in other currencies. On expenses it's the opposite. And it's across all line items. I don't think this is the right place to break it down by every line item. We have it of course analyzed. But it's across all line items.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a quick follow-up on the Copaxone line extension product. The study that you're starting in June and expect to complete in December, what is the endpoint or what are you looking for there? And can it reasonably be done in six months?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; as we said, it's a lower-volume formulation. And I guess that due to kind of reasons, competitive reasons, I don't think that we need to get into more details at this point of time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Tim. Actually, it doesn't seem to be affecting at all our share at this point in time. I mean, we're four weeks in and we have 47% share. As you know, this is a controlled-release medication, generally used for children, obviously. And sometimes you won't see quite as much penetration as this. We had only modeled this out to be a peak of around 75% or so. But we're three-quarters of the way there already.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you remember right, Tim, Solodyn was a launch and a settlement. So we put a certain amount of product into the environment, into the market, and then we stopped and settled with Medisys for a later launch date.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. On Adderall XR, would you expect the CP to remain in place after the first six months of the launch? And if it does, would you expect just one additional competitor by the end of the year or possibly two? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John. Just &#x2013; with respect to the XR, we know the citizen's petition is out there. We know the citizen's petition doesn't affect us. Beyond that, it's hard for us to say. We would like to think that the FDA, or in this case OGD, is going to resolve the citizen's petition; that will open up the market. But we don't know whether that will happen or not and how that's related to other products, such as Concerta. If they answer XR, how are they going to deal with not answering Concerta and others? Or maybe they'll answer them all at one time. I don't know.</p>
          <p>So as a concerned generic company, we would definitely like to see them obviously answer this citizen's petition. To the extent that they don't, we don't know what will happen. I mean, I can't tell what happens with impacts or whether Shire puts in another product. Those things are not part of an agreement that I would have details on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the gross margin improvement year-over-year of about 350 bips, can you just help us understand what percent of that improvement came from mix versus FX? And then on Copaxone, the lower-volume formulation, I don't think I heard you mention anything about any intellectual property or patent that you might have on that formulation. If you can just give some commentary there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gross margin improvement, now &#x2013; again, not exact formulated numbers that you guys are always expecting to see, but the FX impact on that was about 1.3%. And Q1 last year exchange rate was 1.3% less. So that was one major part. We have of course the change in Copaxone that had an impact on that, and then product mix. This quarter we had more in terms of percentage. We had more branded and innovative products in generics, and they come with higher gross margin. But just on the FX, was exactly 1.3% impact.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Couple questions on your multiple sclerosis business. With regards to Copaxone, you've obviously had torrid growth in the U.S., in part supported by ample pricing. And I was wondering if you think this type of pricing flexibility will continue going forward as you've had in recent past? And then secondly, in the near term there'll be a couple filings for new oral medications, cladribine from Merck KgA and one from Novartis. And I was just wondering if you thought these new products if approved would have any impact on your Copaxone business, and if so, what type of impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bill, would you take the pricing issue and then we'll talk from here on, on the oral product for MS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David. Good morning. With respect to the pricing environment here, pricing has continued to climb. We believe that there obviously is a ceiling here at some point in time. We have just tried to keep what is the leading therapy in the market. We have a 37% share, and in fact our 37.3% share this quarter was a new record high. We feel that a product that is the leader in the market, what we believe is the standard of care, shouldn't be at the bottom of the pricing rung. And so we've had to take action to effect that. Most of the pricing has been driven by our competitors. So from this point, again, I share the concern that pricing can't continue to go up like this. But I've been saying that for quite a while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the future competitive arena, I think if you look at the &#x2013; some of the oral product that's being developed now, one thing that you can see that is a lot of questions to see what is the right balance between the extra benefit, mainly on the convenience versus the safety issue and concern. So as it looks now, I'm not sure that this product will actually take a large share in the market going forward. This of course is too early to determine, as there are a few products still in development.</p>
          <p>As far as Copaxone, I think what Copaxone is offering for the patient is really a good combination of efficacy and safety. We believe it's extremely important and will be a major factor going forward as well.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. Specifically in the European and EMEA markets, a large number of acquisition targets have come available over the last year of more sizable opportunity than has been around historically. Do you see any of these targets &#x2013; and obviously without going to specifics &#x2013; as attractive strategically to get inorganic growth rather than more greenfield progression? And the pricing of those targets, have they become more realistic? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Teva, as you well know, as a global company with a long record of acquisitions, is always exploring and scrutinizing the market opportunities. So generally speaking, we are always looking for opportunities, including the current time. And as you said, it's about opportunity, which part of it of course is whether it's a fit to our strategic needs, or part of our global strategic growth program. And in addition of course what are the economies of the &#x2013; economics, sorry &#x2013; of the potential acquisition? And here, as you well stated it, we believe that under the current market situation, definitely prices, exactly as a company's prices should be go down, and the right opportunity definitely will be there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As a follow-up to that, obviously large-cap pharma companies have also expressed interest in strategically accelerating their pathway into some of the emerging markets. Does that put timing pressure on you guys, or do you see yours -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Large-cap pharma has obviously expressed a recent interest also in the emerging markets, and at least branded generics fields. Do you see their new drive into the marketplace as accelerating your need to get into some of those, or strengthen your position in some of those markets, or do you see their strategic pathway as discretely different to yours in the EMEA market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the big pharma companies or the innovative pharma companies showed or expressed their interest both in generics and emerging markets for many years. I don't think it's a new phenomenon. We believe that there is room for many companies to act in this interesting emerging markets and in generic as well. As a matter of fact, to be a generic company as long as &#x2013; as far as we can say from our experience or from our humble point of view &#x2013; it's a different model; it's even &#x2013; mostly it's a different culture. But as you well know, there are some examples of innovative pharma companies of having also some generic arms or at least try to get into this business. So I don't see anything as changed in the longer-term history in this regard.</p>
