        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2008 has proven to be a difficult year for businesses and consumers globally. In this environment, our company produced another quarter of solid growth and bottom-line growth. Our revenue management initiatives across Latin America supported by our multi-segmentation strategies combined with our new avenues of growth drove our top and bottom line results.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues reached MXN22.8 billion or close to 24% from the fourth quarter 2007. Packing and volume growth accounted for more than 40% of incremental revenues. The consolidation of Remil in Brazil contribute approximately 35% of incremental revenues and a positive exchange rate translation effect provided the balance.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated sales volume rose 7.4% year-over-year. Excluding Remil, our consolidated sales volume increased 1.8% during the quarter mainly driven by brand Coca-Cola, still beverages and our water business including jug water. For the full year, our consolidated sales volume excluding Remil grew 2.6%. Our gross profit increased 16.1% in the fourth quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Higher revenues partially compensated for higher cost of good sold, mainly due to the effect of devaluation of our local currencies as applied to our U.S. Dollar-denominated raw material cost, higher year-over-year sweetener cost outside of Mexico division and lower profitability from the Jugos Del Valle line of business as expected during this year. Our gross margin decline 310 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Consolidated operating income improved more than 25% to MXN4 billion during the fourth quarter. This increase was mainly due to the operating leverage we achieved through higher revenues combined with lower administrative and marketing expenses.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated operating margin expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 17.8% for the quarter. Our consolidated EBITDA rose more than 26% to MXN5 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our consolidated EBITDA grew close to 19% to MXN17 billion.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our majority net income decreased 70% to MXN585 million mainly due to a significant impact of the devaluation of the Mexico pesos versus the U.S. Dollar as applied to our Dollar denominated debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and a write-off of some fixed assets in our Mexico division.</p>
          <p>Now, let me explain on our operations, our Mexico division delivered 3.9% volume growth for the quarter. Incremental volumes were mainly driven by the Jugos Del Valle line of beverages and our water business including the integration of our Los Angeles jug water operation in the Valley of Mexico. The sparkling beverage category, brand Coca-Cola multiserve presentations help us to partially offset lower volumes of flavor sparkling beverages.</p>
          <p>Our average price per unit case increased 0.5% during the quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the average price increases that we undertook during the quarter in our Coca-Cola portfolio combined with higher average prices per unit case of the Jugos Del Valle line of business.</p>
          <p>These increases were partially offset by a shift in mix to multiserve presentations across our sparkling beverage portfolio and the upscaling of some of our corn flavor sparkling beverages in multiserve presentations to make them more competitive.</p>
          <p>In 2008, our sales volume of sparkling beverages remained almost flat. Growth of our brand Coca-Cola portfolio was offset by a mid single-digit decline in flavor sparkling beverages. Integration of more than 150 new home delivery routes in the Valley of Mexico from Agua de los Angeles jug water business allows to deliver 30% volume growth in our jug water portfolio for the quarter.</p>
          <p>This acquisition has helped us to capitalize in the potential of this new channel and foster our learning experience to home deliver other products. In the still beverage category, the Jugos Del Valle beverage portfolio continued to exceed our expectations. We sold more than 10 million unit cases from this line of products during the fourth quarter, increasing more than 60% volume we sold compared with the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Innovation continues to play an important role in our growth in this category. For example, during the fourth quarter, we launched Nestea, green tea to complement our offer in this category. In addition, we continue to rollout our Vallefrut, Orangeade and Vallefrut with high content of fruit pulp line of products with great results, selling more than 6 billion unit cases of this product during the quarter, representing more than 60% of the incremental volumes of the still beverage category compared with the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Our Mexican operations' total revenues increased 4.5%. Incremental volumes accounted for the majority of our total incremental revenues with volume growth for the Jugos Del Valle beverage portfolio and our bottled water business.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, the lower cost of sugar year-over-year help us to mitigate short-term cost pressure from higher resin and high fructose corn syrup cost when comparing to local product, mainly driven by the devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. Dollar.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit reached MXN4.3 billion, a 1.6% decline compared with the fourth quarter 2007. Our gross margin in Mexico decreased 310 basis points. On a quarterly basis, we have seen resin prices decline more than 10% in Dollar terms, falling short of compensating the large effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the US Dollar.</p>
          <p>Operating income grew 7% to MXN1.8 billion, mainly driven by higher revenues and lower selling expenses which more than compensated for cost pressures coming from our U.S. Dollar-denominated raw materials. As a result, our operating margin increased 50 basis points to 21.8%. Our EBITDA increased 10.1% compared with the same quarter of last year reaching MXN2.3 billion.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we expect economic activity in Mexico to show a continuous slowdown and consumers being more prudent with their disposable income. Our portfolio brands and package is wider and improved than ever before. Our multi-segmentation strategies along with our revenue management initiatives allow us to offer many different price points for our consumers.</p>
          <p>Our innovation in still beverages combined with more competitive flavors, sparkling multiserve packages and our rate turnover base in brand Coca-Cola will help us to provide valuable offering for our consumers under the current environment.</p>
          <p>Our Latin central division recorded a 2.6% decline in sales volume mainly driven by lower sparkling beverage sales volume in Venezuela where we faced operating disruptions during December. This decline was partially offset by sales volume growth of more than 3.6% in Columbia and 1% in Central America, mainly due to the successful rollout of the Jugos Del Valle line of products in those territories, as well as the positive performance of our sparkling beverage segment in Columbia.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Jugos Del Valle line of beverage in Columbia and Central America continue to grow significantly helping us to expand our still beverage category in those countries by more than 80%. Our Latin central divisions' total revenues grew more than 34% year-over-year to MXN7.6 billion. Higher average prices per unit case accounted for more than 40% of incremental revenues and a positive translation effect represented the balance.</p>
          <p>On the profitability front, higher revenues partially compensated for higher cost of goods sold mainly driven by the devaluation of the local currencies as applied to our Dollar-denominated packaging cost and to the higher cost of seniors across the division. This produced a gross margin decline of 350 basis points compared with the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>However, our gross profit increased more than 23% to MXN3.1 billion in this division. Our operating income grew 43% to MXN1 billion due to the operating leverage achieved through our higher revenues combined with lower marketing expenses, which more than compensated for higher level cost in Venezuela. As a result, our operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 13% as compared with the same period of last year. Our EBITDA grew 41% to MXN1.3 billion and our EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we significantly advanced our strategy to build a more comprehensive offering for the Latin central. In the second quarter of this year, we launched Coca-Cola Zero in Colombia, introducing a three-year older strategy in the market. At the end of the year, we also initiated the rollout of Coca-Cola Zero in Costa Rica.</p>
          <p>Through our Jugos Del Valle joint venture with the Coca-Cola Company, we launched a wide line of products in Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua. We believe 2009 will give us the opportunity to continue leveraging our broad portfolio. Moreover, our joint acquisition with the Coca-Cola Company of the Brisa water brand in Colombia with respect to <mark type="inaudible" /> will further advance our overall beverage strategy.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our Mercosur division. Our Mercosur division net revenues grew 44.7% to MXN6.6 billion in the fourth quarter, excluding beer, which accounted for MXN646 million. We increased net revenues 44.1% to MXN6 billion. Remil accounted for more than 70% of this growth. Higher average prices per unit case and volume growth provided the balance.</p>
          <p>Our Mercosur division volume grew more than 24% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales volume, excluding Remil and beer improved 2.2%, mainly driven by Sparkling beverage sales volume of brand Coca Cola, which accounted for close to 50% of incremental volume, bottled water in Brazil and still beverages in Argentina provided the balance.</p>
          <p>The still beverage categories grew by more than 25 &#x2013; 35% mainly driven by the successful launch of Agua in Argentina. On the profitability front, our Mercosur division's gross profit increased more than 43% to MXN3.1 billion. Higher revenues partially compensated for higher cost of goods sold mainly driven by the devaluation of local currencies as applied to our U.S. dollar-denominated raw material cost, combined with higher sweetener cost in Brazil. Our gross margin decreased 50 basis points to reach 45.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 15.4% to MXN1.2 billion. Operating leverage achieved by higher revenues more than compensated for higher expenses, resulting from the introduction of coolers and the replacement of our distribution fleet in Brazil, in conjunction with higher labor and freight costs in Argentina. Our operating margin reached 18.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008, expanding 60 basis points. Our EBITDA grew close to 48% to MXN1.4 billion and our EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 20.5%.</p>
          <p>In 2008, our Mercosur division has passed significantly on it's path of growth from the integration of Remil to important new growth launches in the still beverage category such as Agua in Argentina and our revolutionary lemon flavor aqua tonic product in Brazil called <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We are in the process to start generating important innovation under the coolers and <mark type="inaudible" /> the current base of juice drinks offering under the Jugos <mark type="inaudible" /> brand. We believe this platform will significantly enhance the result of our Mercosur division across the <mark type="inaudible" /> allowing us to replicate the success we have achieved in other territories with this product.</p>
          <p>Now, let me walk you through our financial performance for the quarter and the full year. 2008 was a very good year for everyone. We witnessed increased volatility in the lower markets that affected the balance sheet and cash flow generation of businesses. In this environment, our operations generated an important cash flow which allows to finance important acquisitions and meet our business plans. These acquisitions have diversified our sources of cash and at the same time prepared our company to capture additional growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>As of December 31, 2008, we had a cash balance of MXN6.2 billion, a decrease of MXN1.3 billion compared with year-end 2007. This decrease was mainly due to the cash we used to finance the acquisition of Remil in Brazil and our Los Angeles jug water business in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Our total debt decreased MXN242 million compared with year-end 2007 mainly driven by the maturities of our Certificados Burs&#xE1;tiles that was paid in April and July of 2008. As a result of the above mentioned factors, our net debt increased MXN1 billion during 2008. Our short-term bank debt as of December 31 was MXN6.1 million and our long-term debt was MXN12.4 billion.</p>
          <p>At the end of January 2009, we successfully issued a 13 month Mexican peso bond in the amount of MXN2 billion, and a yield of a 28-day TIIE plus 80 basis points. This debt issuance underscores our company's fundamental investment grade credit rating and ability to assess local markets at attractive rates. The proceeds from this issuance, which we have in our cash balances, will give our company the additional flexibility to pay the approximately US$400 million maturity coming due in July of 2009. The majority of our remaining debt matures from 2012 onward.</p>
          <p>Our debt maturity profile underscores the flexibility we have to manage our cash sources on this. As on February 24, 2008, we had in our cash balances the equivalent of US$651 million, more than 50% of this balance is already denominated in US dollars. These funds are more than enough to pay our maturities coming due in July of this year.</p>
          <p>As of December 31, 2008, our net-debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio was 0.7 times, and our EBITDA-to-net-interest coverage ratio was close to 10 times, highlighting the strength of our balance sheet. Our company has one of the highest credit ratings among Latin American companies.</p>
          <p>Our liability structure is comprised of a balanced mix of currencies. Approximately 50% of our debt is dollar-denominated and the remaining 50% is comprised of local currency denominated debt, mainly Mexican peso. Our total debt balance includes dollar-denominated debt in the amount of $712 million. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 30% of our debt have fixed interest rate.</p>
          <p>The effect of foreign exchange fluctuation between the Mexican peso and the US dollars as applied to our dollar denominated debt is reflected in two lines on our consolidated income statement. On our debt that was contracted in dollars, the effect shows off on the foreign exchange loss line. On our debt that was contracted in pesos and swapped to dollars, the effect shows off on the market value loss and in effective derivative instruments line.</p>
          <p>As you may already know, on February 6, 2009, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Company received approval from the Colombian anti-trust authorities to acquire jointly the Brisa bottled water business from Bavaria, a subsidiary of SABMiller. This transaction, which we expect to close very soon, will complement our balanced portfolio and increase our presence in the country's water business. Brisa sold 47 million unit cases in Colombia during 2008.</p>
          <p>On several occasions, and generated by different factors, our operations have experienced difficult economic conditions in Latin America during the last 10 years. We have learned to operate under challenging environments, based on our talented team of professionals and the strong innovation capabilities to fortify the inventiveness of our industry and the brand equity of our products.</p>
          <p>2009 will certainly bring challenges for everyone. We remain vigilant to adapt our business to changes in the macro economic conditions in our market territories. During the first half of 2009, we will continue to benefit from our acquisitions along with the stable resource of our underlying operations. We will continue working relentlessly and focus to capitalize on our company's strong fundamentals and extend our path of solid results for our stakeholders and investors.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued trust and support. Now, I would like to open the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. H&#xE9;ctor, I hope &#x2013; you mentioned in your prepared remarks about offering better value to consumers, particularly in Mexico this year and I was hoping you could talk a little bit about more that with respect to pricing objectives. I mean from a package standpoint, thinking about mix opportunities for pricing, how do you get through an environment that's just going to get tougher as the year goes on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very good morning. What we have experienced in Mexico is pretty similar to what we have commented, during the third quarter. We have, as you know, increased the price points of some of our Cola brands throughout the fourth quarter. Most of our competitors follow these increases. As we have mentioned in the past, Jarritos with the flavored products and also with red Cola stay with the same price points of basically around MXN10 for a two liter presentation. And both Pepsi Cola and Big Cola and some of the other competitors also increased their prices. Basically given the effect that everyone does receive in terms of dollar denominated material that have increased significantly because of devaluation of Mexican peso.</p>
          <p>I think that's one of the advantages that we have during &#x2013; coming into 2009 is that we basically have from MXN4 which is the &#x2013; what we call the mini can or small size can, the 8 ounce cans, all the way to MXN20 for 10 liter representation. We have basically a price point for every product within all that range with Coca-Cola products. So basically the effort that we have that we are doing with our people here in terms &#x2013; with respect to pricing has to do with monitoring what our competitors are doing, and putting the right package at the right geographic locations depending on the competition that we have in those place. And certainly return of presentations will play &#x2013; we believe that return of presentations will play a very key role during 2009 given the affordability that these presentations give to the consumer.</p>
          <p>On the flavor side, we have seen strange movements. We have seen upscaling of our products to basically moving from 2.5 &#x2013; 2 liters to 2.5 liters and from 2.5 liters to 3 liters and without moving the prices, therefore substantially reducing our price per ounce on flavored sparkling waters &#x2013; sparkling drinks. And even though, we have been doing that the volumes of our sparkling beverages as I mentioned during the months have come down in single digits in Mexico. What is strange enough, we continue to gain a little bit of share on those &#x2013; on that segment.</p>
          <p>What is happening is that, now the consumer has a lot of different offerings, especially non-carbonated products that are similar in flavor without the gas like the Vallefrut, Orangeade that we are launching. And honestly, our competitors are moving in that direction also. So in a way, I think that the environment for next year continues &#x2013; I believe continues to be &#x2013; environment with respect to pricing continues to be similar to what we have disclosed in the &#x2013; during the last quarter. It's a tough environment. Raw material pressure that we believe will get us to increase some of the price points in the future. And the great <mark type="inaudible" /> (27.22) are going to do. As you know, and as we have mentioned &#x2013; before in conferences, because they're with this ten peso price points for the last four or five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, in the fourth quarter you said, you took prices -- on what percent of your volume in Mexico, did you take those prices? And I guess it's too early to tell this here. But thoughts about maybe rethinking or taking more of those types of increases later this year, is that kind of in the book and scheduled to happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you split the soft drinks portfolio, we basically increased prices. Well, if you look at the Cola, around 8% in Cola. If you look at the flavor, sparkling categories within our territories, we have a reduction between 3 or 4% because of the upscaling that we did in the fourth quarter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning everybody. H&#xE9;ctor, I was particularly impressed with the SG&amp;A reduction in Mexico. It looks like it's down about 362 basis points year-on-year, and I was &#x2013; you compare against the &#x2013; I think you took them of course, if I am not mistaken last year in terms of the extended utilized depreciation. So, the basis of the comparison is that when you look at that component of your overall SG&amp;A as well. Can you expand this to what's happening, is this, is this savings or this coke showing you a little bit of love, is this the combination of a series of initiatives to drive further efficiency or combination of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bob. Certainly, we'll be starting the environment deteriorating around through the stuff trying to extract as much as possible cost out of the seat belt in every aspect of the season and not only in cost, but also we cut some expenditures because we need to sure that said what, what you are investing for that you continue to grow that you are anticipating. So, we have become very cautious on how we spend our dollars and that's a way also preserving cash flows. But with respect to the SG&amp;A, with separate relation on difference things but we have one into restructuring some of our organization. We are using some cost and cutting back in some of the workforce and reorganizing with different &#x2013; wanted number of management, top management people in some of the key areas.</p>
          <p>But the most important element here well is, the adjustment that we have done to the marketing expense. We have clearly in the past speak about Mexico standing close to 4.5 sometimes all the way to 5% of revenues in the marketing line, and we were basically also anticipating, somewhat similar the 4, 4.5% for the full year. We ended off 2008 with a 2.6% basically marketing to sales ratio, which was mainly reflective in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>What I am trying to say is, we anticipated a larger market on expenses at the start of the year. Once we closed the year, given lot of the efforts to get cut in some of the marketing expenses. We adjusted the fourth quarter to the level that brings the full year more or less as I mentioned 2.6, 2.7% of marketing to sales revenue. And through to the next question is how applicable is that going forward? I think that the name of the game and what we have disclosed with the Coca-Cola Company very often partners here is that we need to preserve flexibility for these years. We need to be very flexible and strong with our cash flows and avoid committing for long-term periods like for one year media sector without the flexibility of maybe adjusting that to a higher number, which is appropriate or to a lower number if things are not working out. So, obviously the composition with the Coca-Cola Company there we are &#x2013; we both are in agreement that flexibility is important. And it's difficult to judge what is a good number for 2009, I'll take that, check a little below 4.5, 5% that we were spending in previous years were broadly larger than the 3.6, it's a possibility. Some of the opportunities because our competitors are not investing in the marketplace and the opportunities to capture value there. We will probably go for that and we think we've done so on those investments there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And H&#xE9;ctor just to make sure I understood this properly, so in the first nine months, you're reserving at about 4.5 to 5% rate in terms of your marketing spend. Full year comes in lower, so then you recognize the savings in Mexico and teams like to similar extent like in Latincentro as well and maybe to a lesser extent in the Mercosur division, that's what's accounting for the bulk of the improvement in the cost structure in some way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we were and that's correct. We were basically anticipating especially in the first and second quarter, higher amount of marketing expenses as we see the environment moving, we obviously started to reduce our marketing expense and activity. None is that immediate when we spend in the marketplace, in terms of marginal activity, placement, et cetera. And to a certain extent third quarter was a little bit lower and then we obviously needed our jobs with our auditors with the fourth quarter to the amount that was actually spent during the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all right. That is basically Mexico and Latincentro; Mercosur was to a better strategy directly put to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then H&#xE9;ctor, I guess you mentioned that despite the weakness in flavors and the upscaling, you believe you are taking market shares. So this suggests that the brand equity investments that you're making may not be inappropriate, even if they're reduced. You still feel comfortable with the brand equity in this &#x2013; in the business. It's just a macroeconomic issue where perhaps the consumers is trading through, downwards through these, these other opening price points that you have on your radar screen. Is that fair?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. I think that's the reason with the macroeconomic activity and I think it's also albeit the full shortage or you should say that you have been in the marketplace with approach like buy a fruit orange which is in a way it is cannibalizing some of these flavors. And, as you know, our competitors have seen that process also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me look at that with a little bit more detail. I don't have the number with me. We certainly need to increase a little bit more the prices to maintain margins. As we mentioned rising prices are coming down between 8 and 10% versus the previous quarter in dollar terms. But I cannot make the &#x2013; I don't have the have the number at the top of my head.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just one clarification first from the comments upfront, did you say that on February 24 of this year, do you have the corporate of US$651 million in your cash account?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Lore, we have &#x2013; yes, we wanted to study cash balances and a little bit more than capital credit as dollar denominates. We &#x2013; as you know in July of this year, we have to repay close to $270 million, the remaining Yankee Bond that we have from the financial positions towards Yankee Bond finance position. So right now we have dollars in our cash balances to pay towards that Yankee Bond. We have some other maturities that are in local currencies that are mainly in pesos that we don't have any problem of comparing currency.</p>
          <p>So the message that I want to send right now is that as of &#x2013; as of the end of February, we have the dollar amounts to repay the Yankee Bonds, which are the only dollar denominated intended that we have during this year. We don't have year to finance to complete this refinance part of this repayment neither we need to buy more dollars to be able to repay that loan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And in terms of just raw materials can you review for us what your views are right now in terms of PET and sweetener cost in '09 versus '08. I know it varies by market, but if you could just give us your perspective in general? And then, if you could also comment on &#x2013; in Mexico your flexibility to move your mix back to sugar given the FX effect on the high-fructose, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Lore, what we've been seeing is, as you said in each country it varies with &#x2013; let me start with the big cost. In terms of resin prices, we think that we will see a continuation of the prices that we have during this fourth quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter 2008, first quarter 2009, which are substantially lower than what we have had substantially &#x2013; allow me to do a quick computation. We are basically saying close to 20, 25% below in dollar terms. Obviously, we've the impact of that dollar denominated front and we need to adjust to each country FX movement appropriately.</p>
          <p>With respect to sweeteners, we continue to see some pressure on the &#x2013; downward pressure on prices on sugar, high-fructose is adjusted the prices in dollar terms, but the effect of FX is not compensating &#x2013; the price reduction is not compensating the effect of foreign exchange. And basically with respect to the second part of your question in Mexico, last year we were using close to 50-50 mix of sweetener, sugar versus high-fructose, our plants goals were closer to 70% sugar, 30% high-fructose during this year and it will continue to see prices, this price differential between sugar and high-fructose in Mexican pesos. But we will continue to move the mix towards more sugar.</p>
          <p>Right now, what we can anticipate during this year, with respect to the flexibility that you are asking is that we can move the mix from 50-50 to basically 70-30 in 2009. In other countries like Brazil, it's very close to international prices that we have basically we are &#x2013; we are around 0.11, $0.12 per pound and that's basically what we have because of the sugar, and then some of the old markets like Colombia and Venezuela, usually other buyers play an important role because of vendors scarcity of sweeteners and then we see higher prices as we experienced in 2008 in Colombia and Venezuela.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, H&#xE9;ctor. H&#xE9;ctor, I was hoping you could expand on the 50-50 JVs for noncarbs, maybe you can update us what elements that you think are working, now that you've been in for a while, which elements making improvement. But more specifically, also on the outlook for '09 for noncarbs, could you expand on what you are looking at in both Mexico and Brazil and the plan for whether it's innovation packaging or expansion et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carlos. The 50-50 joint venture is &#x2013; we have &#x2013; basically we have been working with that basically for a year. We had lot of learnings during the process Carlos that you might imagine. We &#x2013; I think that we have different models in different countries, because for example in Brazil and Mexico we are sharing with other partners, in Colombia and Venezuela and some of the Latin America &#x2013; some of the Central American countries we are along in the countries so it's easier to have a different model. We have different models according to tax regulation in each of the countries, there are also bring some complication or some potential deficiencies that translate into complications at the time of building the agreements with the Coco-Cola company. But, we are basically &#x2013; now I can say that we are basically 100% number with all the details being cleared out with the Coco-Cola company.</p>
          <p>The very difficult part was getting into an agreement on what is the &#x2013; how do you allocate the fixed cost that you have in the soft drink operation, how do you allocate cost for distribution to sharing the top, the coolers, administration and all of that. And we have cleared most of that discussion with the Coco-Cola company, obviously from their point of view they will love to see these as a marginal activity. What we are having in the original cost, but from our point of view we are using assets that are owned by Coca-Cola FEMSA to do or to distribute and to manage and to produce sometimes in our plans throughout our &#x2013; that belong to a joint venture which is 50-50 with the Coca-Cola company, and we need to have the appropriate allocation of those processes. Thereafter 2009 that was &#x2013; 2008 excuse me, that was basically dedicated with a lot of the time to clear those understandings, I think that we are basically there and whole companies are now focused on how it will increase the volume and the revenue from this category.</p>
          <p>I think that we have plenty of opportunities that's why we are seeing double-digit growth far behind quarter, a lot of innovation this growth that I was commenting, there is some company relation, our flavors per category was basically an idea was we went up together with the Coca-Cola company and Coca-Cola FEMSA for Mexico. And during the fourth quarter of 2008 we saw more than five million unit basis of that growth, for a growth that was nonexistent the quarter before. So I think that we have opportunities to innovation and launching new approach and new packages to capture additional growth if desired.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; and this is very clear that acquisition of Jugos Del Valle in Mexico and Brazil were pretty much covered. Where we have space still to grow and this is what we have been doing now in Columbia and some of the Central American countries is to start launching Jugos Del Valle to create a brand to grow on this opportunity. So I am very hopeful that all the noncarb and this 50-50 joint venture will work in our favor in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually you think you're going to be able to sustain strong double-digit volume growth rate over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on that category, yes. And I think that one other important element that I think is important to clarify especially for Mexico. Mexico as we have said we are not reflecting any profitability from the Jugos Del Valle line of business during this year and that's also a reason why our gross margin is coming down and I think it's important to clarify that one. When you have because of tax considerations and because of the rebatement that is needed in Jugos Del Valle, it needs to be profits in joint venture, but it is manufacturing joint venture that we have in Mexico. Then you end up with a gross margin that is well below what we have in historic reasons in Mexico.</p>
          <p>So, we expect now starting 2009 that most of the profitability will stay with each of the bottlers and the Jugos Del Valle manufacturing joint venture will or have basically a minimum margin more as our total manufacturing kind of business for 2009 and we expect that this trend also progresses and also towards a really more positive results for this years. Danger basically what we have is through the equity method in other income before the operating line, we have a participation in the net income that Jugos Del Valle reported for 2008. So, we're basically reporting or projecting MXN180 million in other income which is basically 20% of the net income that Jugos Del Valle report. Next year, I hope that these lines closer to zero and that in our operating line in terms of revenue across that operating income will be reflected on a more reasonable margin for the Jugos Del Valle operation.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alan Alanis with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, H&#xE9;ctor, how are you. Quick question, to the extent that you can tell us how fast are you seeing a shift from non-returnable to returnable presentations across your territories and from the modern channel to the traditional channel? And more importantly H&#xE9;ctor, how should we think about the changes in profitability given that shift and changes in working capital given that during the last few years your working capital indicators have been pretty much stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Alan. I think that if you look at third versus &#x2013; fourth quarter versus third quarter, we haven't seen a significant shift in returnable versus non-returnable in the markets where we have grown a little bit more in Brazil, and Mexico is currently a little bit more stable.</p>
          <p>Because of the experience that we have had in the past, we believe that this trend will accelerate in the future, suffice to remind everyone that when we have Argentina during the 2000, 2001, 2002 crisis, McDonalds were basically non-existent, I think it came off to 25 to 30%. By the same token, what we expect and we haven't seen yet in markets like Mexico and Brazil that in moments of economic situation, you see a trend where the consumer starts going more and more to the corner store to buy the daily needs as opposed to doing a big bundle of every week or every two weeks on a supermarket. So, we haven't noticed that yet. While also speaking about experiences that we have in Mexico in the past and Argentina in this large crisis, we see a big shift from super markets to mom-and-pops as consumer try to spend less on a daily basis as opposed to big tickets at the end of the week. We haven't seen those trends yet, but then I need to clarify that that's where we will stay in the next, I don't know, 18 months or maybe 24 months.</p>
          <p>Working capital, I think that if we see a trend worse as we are expecting for us, it's more in mom-and-pops. Our working capital, which is not a problem for us, is certainly positive as we collect most of our revenues in cash. But we broadly did because basically credit is given to the large supermarkets and convenient stores.</p>
          <p>With respect to margins, we have been working on part of the reorganizations that I mentioned that are taking place each to try to improve our capabilities in each of these markets and dividing the very small mom-and-pops that is the first differentiated service because they &#x2013; maybe sometimes they don't cover cooler and they cannot afford a cooler because of the liquidity deals and how to serve those markets and how to differentiate that from a very customized client that is more like a large convenient chain or a supermarket where you have a lot of electronic transfer of information, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, we are learning because we believe that long-term even though the short-term trend will be broadened towards more mom-and-pop, long-term we expect that the key accounts or large supermarkets will continue to grow in importance. And it's important that we have better or similar profitability as one which &#x2013; as what we have within mom-and-pops. And I think that we're getting very close to that with a specialized distribution troughs, doing very large trough sizes, telemarketing and also electronic transfer of data. And a lot of areas of opportunity that are more accomplished that you increase the number of SKUs, for example one is that we think we are learning with Jugos Del Valle is that when someone takes three or four different packages of different flavors.</p>
          <p>Sometimes in the supermarket, the cashier will ring one and then put six of the same, and they are not the same because they are different flavors. So, you have a lot of learning and adopting that we need to do together where the care comes so that we have the appropriate feedback target in place when &#x2013; and the proper chart presentation. So, there are a lot of learning's in that area that we believe will be more &#x2013; two years from now that we need to be various supermarkets if we need to go.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I've got a couple of questions. One is a follow-up to something that was asked earlier. With respect to Jugos del Valle can you talk a little bit about more specifically the opportunity &#x2013; market opportunities and the competitive dynamics in Latin Centro? You talked a little bit about how you rolled out and starting to help incremental volume growth, but can you talk to us about the structure of the market, who you're up against, what sort of medium-term goals might be realistic in terms of market share and size of market things like that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Celso. In Latin Centro, I think that one of the main opportunity of growth is obviously Columbia and Venezuela because of the sites. We have strong competitors in Central America, especially with the brewers and the soft drink producers there that we're also involved with juices in those areas. But those are markets that are not insignificant but are much more smaller compared to Columbia and Venezuela. Obviously, our competitors are the same juices and soft drinks first of all, and <mark type="inaudible" /> in Venezuela. And I don't have right now an estimate of market shares, objectives, and things like that. But, as we continue to improve, maybe we can start sharing some of that information. I mean, we are just starting in the industry retails and growing very fast, but from a nonexistent participation at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Maybe I could follow offline with some of the bigger picture market values and so forth. And then also with respect to the systemic approach in Mexico now in the Coke system, that is, we heard Coke last week at CAGNY talk about not wasting this crisis, and they're referring obviously not to the global situation but specifically to Mexico. Can you talk about some of the initiatives in terms of shifting returnables and things like that, that you've done in the past?</p>
          <p>Can you talk about other initiatives, even at the system level or even at the Coke specific level, that we might not be thinking of it as obviously that are different from how you entered crisis in the past, whether it was Mexico in '95 or Argentina in 2001, anything that you might be doing differently as a system now that you think puts you in a better situation than you have in the past? I guess one of the things that comes to mind is you've discussed a little bit, some of the virtues that were specific mom and pop channel types in terms of helping them get their store and drive traffic and so forth. If you could elaborate on that please, that'd be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Again, I think that different than the last different crisis that we have with Argentina and Mexico and what a number of what we had seen in Brazil a long time ago, I think that at that moment we were not finding a rear door to be defined well with the Coca-Cola Company strategy to compete with low price consumers. And all this concept of value protection brands and blankers and all of that, we've spent a lot of time discussing those issues with the Coca-Cola Company. So, I think that currently we have done our presentations in place, having some fighter brands like <mark type="inaudible" /> in the marketplace. It's one area that I think that would be much flexible and flat than we had in the past.</p>
          <p>Second element here, it's important to bring to your attention, both the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA are placing big bets on the race. And for that, Jugos del Valle and the whole mom-carbonated approach is an opportunity in an area that we need to cross. Third element is that, as I mentioned, we spent less number of marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of this year or during the full year when compared to 2007. But we should not mistake this. That doesn't mean that we will not continue to diversify the brand. I think that main costs, advertisement, media will continue similar to &#x2013; to similar levels.</p>
          <p>We need to adjust this. A bigger portion of the marketing expense, which is all of this that is spend in the marketplace, with <mark type="inaudible" /> with cooler placement and go to &#x2013; given the cooler placement that we have, and the macroeconomic situation, we need to evaluate really how much profitable it is to invest in an extra cooler in the marketplace. So, we agreed with the Coca-Cola Company that we need to take opportunities during this crisis, and because of that, we will continue to invest behind the brands. But the total marketing expense is what we need to maintain in this mix really.</p>
          <p>So, these two elements I think is important. The agreements and all the discussions that we have had in the past with respect to return of value protection brands, all of that. I think that we are more rapid to respond to that. Innovation and everything with regards to Jugos del Valle, the retention of categories and the flexibility that we have agreed to carry marketing expenses knowing that we need to invest behind the brands in publicity and media.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Alex Robarts with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks everybody. I wanted to go back just to Mexico, please, on the OpEx and marketing expense issues. I definitely appreciate you guys flagging that marketing expense issue to us a few months ago, and I wanted to make a clarification. So, in the end, can we assume that as we get into, let's just say first quarter, the marketing spend will go back or be higher at an absolute expense than it was in the fourth quarter? And as you think about adjusting that 4.5% level of marketing spend vis-&#xE0;-vis your sales in Mexico, is the negotiations or terms of the thinking so much to change the absolute level or to perhaps change the mix on who contributes in terms of you versus the Coke system? Because it seems to me as we come in, the trading down risk in Mexico is higher right now because of the economy you've had, did Cola come out with new products like Big Aqua recently, I mean, there is a lot of innovation among the brands, and that marketing expense kind of key? So, if you could give us your thinking on that, that'd be great.</p>
          <p>And the second question is just going back also to the Jugos del Valle question. The double digit growth is clear. But there is a change here which is that a couple conference calls ago you mentioned that cost would be able to recognize EBITDA from this around May '09, and now you are saying that you're going to recognize EBITDA in 2010. So, but has that changed because you've seen that there is more plough back necessary or that infrastructure build out to hot field lines and such, is more expense happening longer, or is it a market dynamic that has made you postpone your expectation for getting and booking that EBITDA for Jugos del Valle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the first question. On marketing, it's certainly a negotiation. We go through our budget process with the Coca-Cola company where we review media expenses, as well as on what we call the operating marketing expenses, and in those conversations that we had over the end of last year, both companies agreed that it is important to maintain this flexibility.</p>
          <p>First quarter of 2009, marketing expense probably will be higher than what we had in the fourth quarter because fourth quarter was kind of as I've mentioned an improvement for the full year. But it is important to mention as a general trend that as a percentage of revenues, normally, we have said 4.5 to 5%. Last year, was more &#x2013; slightly below the 4%, around 3.6 to 3.7%. My expectation is that 2009, somewhere around 4% would be a good number. So, it's lower than what we had in the previous year, but probably higher than what we have in 2008.</p>
          <p>But again, it's important that we understand that we have embedded in our budget for the first time flexibility that we &#x2013; that we never needed for in these negotiation process with the Coca-Cola company. So, if things start getting very tough, then we may end up around 3.6% of quantitative to revenues or even lower.</p>
          <p>Again, maintaining <mark type="inaudible" /> because what you say is important although Big Aqua not irrelevant for the size of the market so far. But there are competitors and there will be brands and <mark type="inaudible" /> is an important player, and Big Cola and red Cola. We need to continue to invest in the Brazil market.</p>
          <p>With respect to the second question, Alex, maybe I will express myself. When I was referring to this year, I was referring 2008. 2008 will reflect any profit of our margins for Jugos del Valle numbers. We are expecting that starting 2009 we will start to reflect EBITDA. So, if we continue with the idea during 2009 EBITDA from Jugos del Valle value will be reflected in the Coca-Cola FEMSA.</p>

          <p>Hi good morning. Probably, just a clarification of your earlier comment in your prepared remarks about how much volumes were down so far in the year, I just didn't catch on what categories or what's the total and what countries? And then, my second question is related obviously and we're talking about flexibility about lowering marketing expenses because perhaps you need to preserve margins and so forth. But, no body has talked about, I mean, how much of a volume decline are you willing to take for the year in the name of preserving margins? And, I mean, I guess will be interested in how you guys are thinking about that because with sharply higher prices in Colas, lower marketing expenses, I would look into at least 5-6% decline in volume similar to what the Coke System seeing in the U.S. I mean, is that base case that you guys are working with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Jose, good morning. We certainly, are not expecting 6% declines in bots. And it's difficult to understand what the macroeconomic situation will bring us to each of the different markets. It's important also to mention that &#x2013; what I'm saying about flexibility, I'm not necessarily speaking that we will reduce marketing expenses as long as I mention that as a percentage of revenues it would probably be a little bit higher than 2008.</p>
          <p>And what we need to preserve is this flexibility that is extinct. There is more and we see our competitors not investing behind the brands or our marketing dollars don't bring in revenues and top line growth that expect. We might be adjusting those numbers during 2009 and I think that important concept that I'm introducing here is that in these negotiation process with the Coca-Cola company the budget for the year, this is the first time that I see flexibility embedded on both parties agree on this flexibility in this quarter. I think it's an important element that is looked.</p>
          <p>Now, in Coca-Cola brand, where we have a substantial leadership in terms of brand preference and we've indicated that will continue to lead us to a thinking that we continue to improve those indicators of preference, and other &#x2013; these indicators that the marketing guys bring.</p>
          <p>We would continue to invest, this is an important brand, and certainly we will not abandon brand Coca-Cola. Probably it's important for us to understand that part of our marketing expenses are very important, part has to do with fuller placement and a lot of the marketing activities that we'll have in the market place. You have models that are supermarket, shop linked products or where they have wines, where people will shop for products. Things like that, that we need to be adjusting just to have the appropriate level of marketing of returns that we feel are appropriate.</p>
          <p>So I feel that it's important for us that we keep those elements online. We might reduce these marketing expenses because it has some of the flavor brands, but continuing with that brand Coca-Cola. And, &#x2013; those issues are obviously shared with the Coca-Cola company so they are in-charge of all the main first advertisement behind the brand. But first of all, I'm not saying that we will reduce marketing expenses. I think that we will need to spend more than 2008, it's important to capture the opportunity that these prices will bring, and the element of flexibility that I mentioned is also sort of important relevance you know.</p>
          <p>With respect to the reporting trend that I think is was referring to your first question, when you look at the tables that we have, the last page of the &#x2013; or previous to last page of our press release, you will have a very detailed volume numbers for sparkling, water, and bottled water. General trends, I'll say here these were slight or slightly negative in most of the sectors when you exclude acquisitions, especially revenues. Jugos del Valle brings a lot of growth to the non-carbonated products in category and water, we have a positive effect of Agua in the cycle is that even without that you show some growth.</p>
          <p>Those are the general trends with respect to volume. When we step in 2009, I think that, as I mentioned, it's kind of a crystal ball to understand how volumes will react in this macroeconomic situation, and a lot of that has to do with the pricing formula that we have with our &#x2013; for our stores. What I think that with old portfolio, especially would run Coca-Cola, where we have every price point from MXN4 to MXN20 covered. It's us having the intelligence from the marketplace to see where we place each product; it means a strategic customer or geographic location according to the competitive intensity and timings of each of the marketplace.</p>
