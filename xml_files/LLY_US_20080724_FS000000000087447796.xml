          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to your 2008 Second Quarter Earnings Call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference over to the Executive Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Phil Johnson.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly &amp; Company's second quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  I'm Phil Johnson, Executive Director, Investor Relations.  I'm joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; and Jim Greffet and <mark type="inaudible" /> from the IR department.</p>
          <p>You can access the earnings press release and supporting materials, a live webcast, an Internet-based replay, and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com.  The replay, the supporting materials, and the podcast will be available on our website through August 22, 2008.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors.  For example, our results may be affected by competitive developments, the timing and success of new product launches, regulatory and legal matters, patent disputes, government investigations, governmental actions regarding pricing, importation and reimbursement, changes in tax law, acquisitions, business development transactions, and the impact of exchange rates.  For additional information about the factors that affect our business, refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q.</p>
          <p>In addition, the information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community.  It is not intended to be promotional, and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil.</p>
          <p>Continuing the approach I started on our first quarter call, let me begin with an update of progress on my top priorities.  My number one priority is to speed up the flow of innovative new products through our development pipeline. Slide 2 shows great results through the first half of the year.  Through the end of June, seven new molecular entities have entered Phase 1 testing, and we're on track toward our goal of 15 NMEs entering the clinic this year.  In addition, through our Fit Net  strategy, we have reactivated two other compounds in our Phase 1 portfolio. Also, four NMEs have advanced into Phase 2 testing, and one compound, the gamma secretase inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, has moved into Phase 3.</p>
          <p>We also continue to supplement our own innovation with collaborations.  Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition, subject to shareholder approval, of SGX Pharmaceuticals.  This acquisition will provide Lilly with cutting-edge capabilities with X-ray crystallography and structural biology.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we also announced a licensing and development agreement with TransPharma Medical related to TransPharma's ViaDerm-human PTH (1-34) product for the treatment of osteoporosis, currently in Phase 2 testing.  Earlier in the year, we announced a licensing deal with Transition Therapeutics, and closed the BioMS deal.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, during the second quarter, we've had a number of successes on the regulatory fronts.  The FDA approves Cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia.  The European CHMP issued a positive opinion on Cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. We submitted Cymbalta for management of chronic pain to the FDA.  The FDA approved Strattera for maintenance treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in children and adolescents.  And the FDA and European regulators approved the next-generation pen for Forteo.</p>
          <p>In other developments, on the prasugrel front, we were informed by the FDA that the review period for the ACS/PCI indication would be extended by three months, with a new FDA action date of September 26, 2008.  Also, along with our partner Daiichi Sankyo, we began patient enrollment in the TRILOGY ACS study, which will compare the effects of prasugrel against PLAVIX in patients with acute coronary syndromes who are medically managed.</p>
          <p>We submitted the complete response to the not-approvable letter from the FDA for Zyprexa Long-Acting Injection.  This complete response included proposals to manage the risk of excessive sedation events, and did not require new clinical trial data.</p>
          <p>Finally, along with our partner Amylin, in the second quarter we had our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA for exenatide once-weekly.  Following this meeting, we believe the DURATION-1 study we reported last year provides the necessary safety and efficacy data for the submission.  We are still guiding to a submission by the end of first half of next year, but we are focused on moving the submission date forward.  The key factor to submission timing is showing comparability between the commercial material manufactured at the facility in Ohio and the intermediate-scale material used in clinical studies.  We'll provide updates as this process continues.</p>
          <p>Slide 3 shows a snapshot of our clinical pipeline as of early July and the flow for the first half of this year.  You can see that we now have 50 new molecular entities in development.  This slide also shows the flow through the pipeline.  As I mentioned earlier, seven molecules have entered the clinic this year, targeting diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis.</p>
          <p>One aspect of drug development to be expected is attrition, and we have terminated development of five new molecular entities so far this year.  We've previously indicated that a toxicology finding had been observed in long-term animal studies with our Factor Xa inhibitor.  After completing a thorough review of the data, we have decided to halt clinical development of this compound.  Beyond Factor Xa, four NMEs in Phase 1 or 2 clinical testing have not met critical success factors to continue their development, and have been terminated.</p>
          <p>We're committed to make new timely go/no go decisions and terminating molecules quickly that do not show promise.  Importantly, the net flow so far this year is positive.  More compounds have entered the portfolio than have been removed from it.  Beyond the new molecular entities, we have a large number of new indications and line extensions in development.  A number of these are significant opportunities, including Alimta for first-line non-small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer maintenance; Cialis for BPH; Cymbalta for chronic pain; and prasugrel for medical management of ACS, among others.</p>
          <p>I am confident in the strength of the pipeline and the flow we are generating.  This pipeline along with our business development efforts places Lilly in a solid position to deal with the patent expiry challenges for the next decade, and to deliver on our goal of launching two NMEs per year starting in 2011.</p>
          <p>As a final item relating to the pipeline, on slide 4, I'd like to share with you an update on our lead programs for Alzheimer's disease, the gamma secretase inhibitor and A Beta antibody.  Recall that there are several unique aspects to this disease.  First, while Alzheimer's disease is a tremendous unmet medical need, it's a particular risky area for drug development.  The prevailing hypothesis of the pathology of the disease, the Amyloid Hypothesis, is yet to be proven.  Furthermore, unlike traditional proof-of-concept approaches, in which small studies can be done in Phase 2 to show clinical efficacy, Alzheimer's disease trials require large numbers of patients to be treated for extended periods of time to show a meaningful clinical effect.  Consequently, decisions we make to advance to large Phase 3 trials will be based on biomarker data, a proxy for clinical outcomes.</p>
          <p>Second, Lilly is embarking on an aggressive development plan for our two lead molecules that will involve multiple major trials.  We've already begun the first Phase 3 trial for the gamma secretase inhibitor, and we expect to begin a second Phase 3 study later this year.  We plan to follow a similar development path for the antibody.  Third, this is an area of extensive research, and there are a number of compounds in development.  Competition for patients is high, and success in site and patient recruitment will be key.</p>
          <p>To help address these issues, we have established an innovative arrangement for our two lead molecules.  Lilly will share the development cost of our gamma secretase inhibitor and A Beta antibody with TPG-Axon Capital and NovaQuest, the partnering group of Quintiles Transnational. In exchange for their funding, TPG-Axon and NovaQuest will receive success-based milestones and mid to high single-digit royalties contingent on the successful development of these molecules.  This arrangement is a sensible approach for several reasons.  NovaQuest is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Quintiles, the CRO conducting our Alzheimer's disease trials.  Thus, both parties' incentives are clearly aligned to maximize the speed, efficiency, and quality of this important clinical program.  TPG-Axon's and NovaQuest's return on investment is dependent upon the successful commercialization of these therapies. Our agreement effectively provides Lilly with a hedge as we enter new and uncharted territory.  Finally, consistent with our Fit Net strategy, this will provide Lilly with greater flexibility to direct internal resources to advance additional molecules in our pipeline portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 5, my second priority is more effectively engaging our customers, patients, healthcare providers, and payers.  Of course, the ultimate measure of our success is the performance of our products in the marketplace.  The strong performance of our two oncology products, Alimta and Gemzar, reflects a number of innovations and advances we have made in our customer interactions.</p>
          <p>First, all of our sales representatives are now using interactive tools to facilitate discussions.  This enables improved dialogue on the topics of highest importance to each individual physician.  Second, we continue to leverage the very successful "Complex Cases" series to show situations in which Alimta or Gemzar are particularly effective agents.  This series has been used quite effectively with Alimta in thoracic cancers and with Gemzar in ovarian cancer. This is an example of our increasing use of programs in which treating physicians learn from other experts in the field.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on gaining customer insights so that we can address the issues most important to the doctor.  To facilitate this, we've done extensive research across our portfolio, including our insulins, Byetta, and our oncology products.  Here's how we're putting our learning into practice.</p>
          <p>With insulins, we have focused on perceptions about mealtime insulin overall, before addressing the attributes of Humalog specifically. With Byetta, we've honed in on the importance of reinforcing the outstanding efficacy, reductions in HbA1c with weight loss, that Byetta has shown, while proactively addressing any barriers to prescribing, such as reimbursement concerns, particularly with PCPs.  With Alimta and Gemzar, we've gained insight into the spectrum of attitudes and beliefs across different physician groups.  This insight provides our ability to demonstrate how Alimta and Gemzar can meet their respective needs.</p>
          <p>I continue to push the importance of these priorities throughout Lilly, along with continuous improvement in quality and productivity, and the development of a new generation of leaders.  I recently completed a series of meetings in which I addressed our top 1,000 leaders worldwide.  These sessions were a venue from me to impart a sense of urgency throughout the organization, and to obtain explicitly the commitment from our leadership to win in these challenging times, and I am confident that we can do so.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review the performance for the quarter. Jim?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John.</p>
          <p>At a macro level, the Q2 results met our expectations and we are tracking to our EPS guidance for the year, taking into account significant items.  Let's first address our EPS performance in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 6 shows our reported EPS, as well as significant items affecting net income and earnings per share.  These items include: first, an $89 million restructuring charge primarily associated with previously-announced exit activities in certain manufacturing operations.  This charge decreased earnings per share by $0.05.</p>
          <p>Second, asset impairments totaling $57 million associated with certain manufacturing operations.  Please note that this charge is included in cost of sales on the income statement. It decreased earnings per share by $0.04.</p>
          <p>And third, a $35 million charge related to acquired in-process R&amp;D associated with the TransPharma Medical in-licensing transaction.  This charge decreased earnings per share by $0.02.</p>
          <p>You can see the impact of these items on earnings per share for this quarter in the table.  The table also shows the impact of similar items from 2007 for comparison purposes.  Without the impact of these significant items, earnings per share were $0.99 in the second quarter of this year, representing growth of 10% over 2007.  Also, note that since we owned ICOS for the entirety of the second quarter in both 2008 and 2007, there is no need for pro forma adjustments.</p>
          <p>Let's start our more detailed review of second quarter results on Slide 7 with sales volume trends for the quarter.  In the second quarter, worldwide sales increased 11% to $5.15 billion.  This slide summarizes price and volume trends back to the year 2000.  The 11% growth in sales in Q2 is comprised of 6% from exchange rates and 5% from volume.  Price was not a contributor to overall sales growth.  The volume growth of 5% in Q2 continues solid volume performance.  This volume growth was achieved despite the drag from the entry of generic versions of Zyprexa in Canada and Germany, and generic Actos in Canada.</p>
          <p>Furthermore on Slide 8, you can see how our major products contribute to worldwide volume growth.  Led by Cymbalta, all of our growth products are contributing positively to volume growth.  You'll notice that Zyprexa shows a volume decline, again reflecting the impact of generic entries in Canada and Germany.</p>
          <p>We'll now review the sales performance of selected products, and then discuss the other lines of the income statement. Slide 9 shows worldwide Zyprexa sales increased 2%, to 1.24 billion.  Sales in the U.S. were flat at 564 million.  The impact of both net selling prices and volume was negligible.  International sales increased 4% to 676 million, due to the favorable impact of exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices and decreased demand.  Demand outside the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by generic competition in Canada and Germany, offset by solid growth in Japan and several European markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 10, Cymbalta sales in the second quarter were 654 million, up 26% compared with the second quarter 2007.  U.S. sales increased 19% to 543 million, primarily due to increased demand, international sales totaled 112 million, an increase of 80% over the prior year, driven primarily by higher demand, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  Higher demand outside the U.S. reflects both increased demand in established markets, as well as recent launches in new markets.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows worldwide Byetta sales for the quarter were 195 million, a 25% increase.  Lilly reports half of the gross margin from U.S. sales of Byetta, plus sales of pens to Amylin, and 100% of international sales.  Total Byetta revenue recognized in Lilly's income statement was 101 million, a 27% increase.</p>
          <p>On Slide 12, Humalog sales grew 22% to 438 million.  U.S. sales increased 17% to 250 million, driven by higher demand and increased prices.  The positive demand trend reflects the numerous efforts to reaccelerate Humalog in the U.S., including the recent launch of the Humalog KwikPen.  As a leading indicator to overall prescription growth, we track endocrinologists starting new patients on mealtime insulin. Continuing a trend since the launch of Humalog KwikPen, for the first time, in May, endocrinologists prescribed more Lilly pens than Novo pens for new patients starting mealtime insulin.  We view this as a positive sign for our reacceleration efforts.</p>
          <p>Sales of Humalog outside the U.S. increased 30% to 188 million, driven by strong demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower prices.  On Slide 13, Humulin sales for the quarter were up 12% to 271 million.  U.S. sales increased 4% to 92 million, driven by higher prices.  International sales increased 16% to 180 million, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows Cialis sales, which were up 24% in the quarter, reaching 362 million.  Sales in the U.S. were up 17% to 128 million, due to higher prices and increased demand, while sales outside the U.S. increased 28% to 234 million, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 15, Alimta sales in the second quarter were 275 million, an increase of 33% over Q2 2007.  U.S. sales increased 21% to 130 million, due primarily to increased demand.  Sales outside the U.S. were up 46% to 145 million, due to increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows quarterly Forteo sales of 207 million, up 17% over Q2 of last year.  U.S. sales were up 5% to 129 million, due to higher prices, partially offset by decreased demand.  International sales of Forteo were up 44% to 77 million, due to higher demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows the revenues from the products Lilly has launched this decade: Alimta, Byetta, Cialis, Cymbalta, Forteo, Strattera, Symbyax, Xigris, and Yentreve.  These products collectively grew 21%, reaching 1.8 billion, or 35% of our sales.</p>
          <p>Before looking at the rest of the income statement, let's look at the impact of price, exchange rates, and volume on sales results.  As mentioned earlier, for the quarter, Lilly sales growth of 11% was driven by a favorable impact of 6% from exchange rates, and a volume impact of 5%.  Changes in net selling prices did not impact overall sales growth.  You can see the breakdown of this price/rate/volume total by geography on Slide 18.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 shows the income statement. Gross margin as a percentage of sales in the second quarter was 76.7%, a decrease of 1.7 percentage points, compared to Q2 of last year.  This decrease was due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and the inclusion in cost of sales of the $57 million asset impairment charge I mentioned earlier.  These negative impacts were offset in part by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Excluding the asset impairment charge, gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased by 60 basis points, to 77.8%.</p>
          <p>The total of marketing, selling, and administrative, and research and development expenses increased 11% in the quarter, in line with sales growth.  Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses were up 12%, to 1.7 billion.  The increase was primarily driven by the impact of foreign exchange rates and increased marketing expenses, including: direct-to-consumer advertising for Evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction; pre-launch and marketing costs associated with Cymbalta outside the U.S., and the U.S. launch for fibromyalgia; launch efforts for Alimta front-line non-small-cell lung cancer outside the U.S.; continued launches of Byetta outside the U.S.; and pre-launch expenses for prasugrel.  Higher litigation expenses also pushed up the growth rate in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expense grew 11%, to 952 million or 18% of sales.  The increase resulted from a $47 million expense for a milestone payment made to MacroGenics, Incorporated, related to progress in the clinical trials of teplizumab and increased discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs, offset by lower prasugrel clinical trial costs.</p>
          <p>Other significant items in Q2 of this year totaled 124 million as I discussed earlier.  This is a decrease from 328 million in Q2 of 2007.  For your reference, the 2007 amount represents a charge related to acquired in-process R&amp;D associated with the acquisitions of Hypnion and Ivy Animal Health.</p>
          <p>The Q2 2008 effective income tax rate was 20.5%, down from 28.4% in the second quarter of 2007.  The decline is due to the non-deductibility of in-process R&amp;D charge for the Hypnion acquisition in the second quarter of last year, as well as the deductibility of the asset impairment and restructuring charges in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows second quarter other income and deductions, which increased by 30.5 million to 32.3 million, primarily due to lower interest expense and gains from the sale of securities, offset by lower out-licensing income.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to Derica to update you on our financial guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim.</p>
          <p>As shown on Slide 21, our 2008 earnings guidance on a reported or GAAP basis is now 3.79 to 3.94 per share.  The change from earlier guidance of 3.90 to 4.05 results from the second quarter significant items totaling $0.11 per share that Jim described. This slide shows all of the significant items for Q1 and Q2 that affect our guidance.  Note that this guidance does not reflect potential charges related to the acquisition of SGX Pharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>We are also revising other aspects of 2008 full-year financial guidance.  These revisions are primarily driven by the continued strength of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Stronger foreign currencies result in higher growth rates for sales, as well as for marketing, selling, and administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent, research and development expenses.  In addition, in the short term, stronger foreign currencies result in a decrease to gross margin as a percent of sales.</p>
          <p>Having described the foreign currency impact, let's turn to Slide 22 and our updated line-item financial guidance.  Pro forma sales are now expected to grow in the high single to low double digits, an increase from the previous guidance of growth in the mid to high single digits.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of the second quarter 2008 asset impairment charges, we still expect modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales.  Including the second quarter 2008 asset impairment charges, we expect gross margin as a percent of sales to be essentially flat.</p>
          <p>Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are now expected to grow in the high single digits, and increase from the previous guidance of growth in the low single digits.  In addition to the impact of foreign exchange rate, these expenses are now expected to be higher due to increased litigation-related expenses and higher pre-launch investment in prasugrel. We still expect research and development expenses to grow in the high single to low double digits.  The sum of marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and R&amp;D expenses are now expected to grow in the high single digits, and increase from the previous guidance of growth in the mid single digits.  Other income and deductions are still expected to contribute less than $100 million.</p>
          <p>Excluding the effect of the resolution of the IRS tax audit in the first quarter of 2008, the effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%.</p>
          <p>Finally, we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>This concludes our view for the second quarter, and we will now be happy to take your questions.  Operator, first caller, please?</p>

          <p>Great.  Thank you, and good morning.  My first question &#x2013; my question really has to do with &#x2013; and thank you for the comments on the Alzheimer's program, John, but &#x2013; and I know that you're going to have some more to share with us next week, but is anything you could do to help frame a little bit more about the clinical trials? You said there'd be multiple Phase 3 clinical trials going on. Any thoughts around timing, and also any thoughts around, what are the important similarities or differences between your compounds, especially in the A Beta antibody versus others that are in the clinic?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I'd be happy to take your question.  First of all, we started &#x2013; right now what we've got going is one Phase 3 study with the gamma secretase inhibitor. We expect to start a second Phase 3 study, in other words, a parallel trial, with that molecule later this year.  We would expect in the future, we haven't given a specific time, to also initiate Phase 3 studies for the A Beta antibodies, and I would expect you'd probably be looking at two trials also for that molecule.  I think the &#x2013; on the gamma secretase, the period of treatment is 21 months, so you're looking at a multi-year sort of timeframe for enrollment &#x2013; all the way from initial enrollment to completions.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the data we're going to share at ICAD is really biomarker-related data.  We think this is a very good lead into these studies, but obviously we don't have the kind of data one would typically expect to see in Phase 2 as we start Phase 3.</p>
          <p>So we think the arrangement that we have with TPG-Axon and with Quintiles, for all the reasons I've talked about, will not only support the successful completion of the studies, but it provides us with an important hedge and obviously an opportunity to use &#x2013; to take the funds that in essence are being provided by the financial partner and make other investments in our own pipeline as well, outside of these two programs.</p>

          <p>Jim, it's Jim Greffet, I think you'd also asked about a compare and contrast on our antibody versus bapineuzumab. I think we'll all learn more next week, both on some data on our antibody, and the broader data set out of the &#x2013; of the bap molecule.</p>
          <p>What we do know is this: that the binding properties of the two antibodies is different. Our antibody binds to the mid region of the A Beta peptide. Our understanding is that bapineuzumab binds to more of an end region.  And that's a meaningful difference by the way we see it.  Our antibody only binds to soluble A Beta.  We think that will provide perhaps a larger therapeutic margin. We haven't seen anything like a vasogenic edema or any leakage or bleeding that perhaps we'd seen with bapineuzumab.  So we think that's an important safety difference. Of course, we'll learn more next week.  But there are salient differences in the two antibodies, and we think we've got a pretty good one in ours.</p>

          <p>Sure.  Thank you.  Couple of questions. First on prasugrel, just wondering if there's any indication as yet from the FDA of the potential for an advisory committee meeting for September?</p>
          <p>And then separately, on exenatide LAR, in the unexpected event that the commercial-scale material fails to show comparability to that used in the trials, can you give us a sense for what the implications are and what the impact may be on timelines?  Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yeah, I think I can handle both of these.  On prasugrel, we have no &#x2013;  still no indication that this is going to be the subject of a &#x2013; an advisory committee meeting.  Obviously we've been prepared for an advisory committee since before we filed, back late in 2007.  But we have no indication there's going to be an advisory committee, and at this point, we're not planning on one.</p>
          <p>With respect to LAR, we have a high degree of confidence that we can establish comparability between the at-scale material and the material manufactured at what we've termed intermediate scale going forward.  Clearly we haven't changed our guidance in terms of the timing of that filing. We've said not later than the end of the first half of next year. If and as we get more information or more direction from the FDA in such a way that it might accelerate that, we'll certainly communicate it.</p>

I know you're aware of this, but just in any case there are any callers on the line that are not aware of this, the FDA did formally remove the tentatively scheduled cardiorenal advisory committee meeting for August the 19th and 20th from its schedule.  So the &#x2013; I think the only other tentatively scheduled meeting for the year is out in the December timeframe.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple of questions.  I guess I'm surprised by your comments on prasugrel pre-launch spending as being one reason why SG&amp;A would go higher, because if anything, the launch of that has been pushed out later in the year by the PDUFA date slipping by three months.  So I'm wondering, what changed here? Or what does this say about maybe your original expectations on the product versus what you think now?</p>
          <p>Second question is on your gamma secretase.  There seems to be a lot of folks, in even clinical trial investigators, that are fairly cautious on that molecule, and I'm wondering what you think these folks are missing? Maybe talk about the concerns you hear and what you think the answer to those concerns are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Tim. I'll go ahead and have Derica handle the first question on the prasugrel investment.  We'll have Jim go ahead and take the question for the gamma secretase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tim, this is Derica.  In regards to prasugrel and the impact on the SG&amp;A, given at the time, that we did not know what the FDA would decide in terms of the original PDUFA action date, we pulled forward our preparation for a potential launch and we were prepared to go as early as the second quarter.  And so, now that we've put those resources in place, obviously we will continue to incur those expenses until we get a final response on the September 26 PDUFA date.  And so you'll see us making those kinds of bets in regards to our SG&amp;A expense, to be prepared to maximize our top-line opportunities, including Evista.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tim, it's Jim Greffet. On the gamma secretase inhibitor, so maybe &#x2013; let me answer this in two parts.  One, as John described in the prepared remarks, there is an inherent risk in this disease state anyway.  We're making some decisions based on biomarker.  So that adds a certain level of uncertainty and risk in this disease state in general.</p>
          <p>Relative to the gamma secretase inhibitor, the &#x2013; probably the prevailing concern with inhibition of gamma secretase is the undesired ripple effect to notch processing.  What we've seen in the Phase 2 study that we've already done &#x2013; and we'll have additional data coming out next week at ICAD on our gamma secretase inhibitor.  What we've seen is that we can lower levels of A Beta in the blood and not have deleterious effect on notch processing.  So we haven't seen side effects that would be unacceptable, and that was part of what made our decision to move into the Phase 3 trial that's ongoing right now.</p>
          <p>Some additional data there, on the half-life of our molecule is about 2.5 hours in the blood, and what our scientists tell us is that that window may offer us enough time to inhibit the synthesis of A Beta, but that it &#x2013; the half-life still allows enough notch processing, for about 12 hours or so through the day, that prevents the undesired effects there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I have a couple of questions.  First of all, with respect to the prasugrel submission of additional information, my question is, did Lilly submit a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy as part of the major amendment submission? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Second, with respect to fibromyalgia, it doesn't seem to have helped Cymbalta trends.  Should we just assume that there was a lot of off-label prescribing originally?</p>
          <p>And then third, on the Xa, if you could just walk us through the evolution of that program? I think there was a point in time a few years ago in which Lilly was considering out-licensing or partnering the product, and then I believe that at your December Analyst Meeting last year, you suggested that you were going to get back on track and develop it internally, and then today you've announced that you're dropping the program. And obviously this is one of many, many programs, so I'm not trying to focus on a negative, but it's just been an interesting series of events over the last couple of years.  So if you could just explain that further, that would be helpful.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Phil. I'll handle your first two questions, and then have Jim provide the commentary for the Factor Xa.</p>
          <p>In terms of prasugrel submission, as you know, we've not commented specifically on the discussions with FDA.  Clearly, this issue that's been raised by many investors around bleeding, is one that we would definitely want to ensure, and have ensured, that we've provided sufficient data, we believe, for them to go ahead and evaluate that risk with the efficacy benefits that prasugrel provides.</p>
          <p>I would also highlight that when we went ahead and had discussions on the launch of the TRILOGY trial for the ACS medically-managed patient population, we did mention that we have had discussions with FDA about how to structure that trial. They provided feedback that was incorporated.  We did in fact essentially have their sign-off, if you will, on a kind of design that included, for example, the use of the 5-milligram dose for the patient population of the over 75 years of age and less than 132 pounds.</p>
          <p>For fibro, we're very excited about this opportunity and looking forward to building out the pain profile for Cymbalta.  We only received the approval in mid-June, so it is very early, and we would not expect yet to see the results in our Q2 numbers.</p>
          <p>Jim, for the Factor Xa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Not to take you on an entire trip down memory lane, but there are probably a couple of salient facts here.  Going back in time, remember that we've had kind of a &#x2013; a wealth of riches and many three-tickets ride &#x2013; three-ticket rides, as Steve Paul likes to say, with pretty expensive Phase 3 programs, and it was that dynamic that led us to look for partnering arrangements.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, in seeing that how that space developed, we decided to advance that molecule ourselves, and we actually announced that earlier than our Analyst Meeting last year.  So it was probably the middle of last year that we made that decision.</p>
          <p>And remember also that we had done Phase 2 work in VTE prevention, very short-term studies, and we had done the corresponding tox work to support that.  After we advanced the molecule and decided to re- or, reinitiate development internally, the necessary to go into the longer-term studies for VTE treatment are ultimately &#x2013; atrial fibrillation required longer-term tox studies.  It was in doing those longer-term tox studies that we had this finding, and made the decision that we did.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, that's part of drug development, as John has said. We had some things fall out. Fortunately, we found this before we spent a lot of money on the molecule, and we've got 50 other things in the pipeline that we're eagerly pursuing.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you.  Just two quick questions.  Just give a quick update on the Gemzar patent case following the expiration of the 30-month stay?  Have you received any notification from Teva, an intention to launch, and can you just remind us of the process, if that were to occur?</p>
          <p>And then going back to the A Beta antibody, I know you have some different binding characteristics from your competitor, but do you plan to segment patient populations in your Phase 3, as you've seen with your competitor here, specifically on ApoE-4 carriers?</p>
          <p>And again, sorry if I missed it.  Could you just give us a quick update on when you're targeting to move the A Beta into Phase 3?  Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The quick answer to your question is no, we have not received a 90-day notice from Sicor or Teva in regards to planning on launching, but to give some additional information about that, there was &#x2013; we &#x2013; our 30-month stay expired for both presentations earlier in July, and we did go through the judge and ask for an extension of the 30-month stay, which was and then denied.  The plan from the judge is that, within that 90 day period we'd be able to both, put that trial into place, hear it and rule on it before anybody would launch any <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>For the antibodies, there's nothing we've seen in the clinical data we've generated, the pre-clinical or clinical data to date, that indicates to us that we need this segment on ApoE-4 carrier status or frankly any other status, at this point in time.  And then, we've not actually provided any more specific timing on start of the Phase 3 for the antibodies, and stay tuned for further notice.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much.  The &#x2013; what I would consider reacceleration of Humalog seems to be, quite frankly, under way, and I was curious if you might be able to bifurcate the notion of how demand has changed with KwikPen versus price? And moreover, from a non-U.S. perspective, if you've actually launched KwikPen internationally? And then how that's actually played out, demand-wise, versus FX?</p>
          <p>The second question's a prasugrel question, and Phil, I've heard you make some commentary around this. Obviously the large Phase 3 trial which you've completed and filed was with a 10 milligram dose. But I have had heard you make analogy to other products where other doses have actually been approved on bioequivalence-type of trials.  Could you comment on, or remind me of those other products that had been approved without actually having them as part of that &#x2013; a large-scale Phase 3 like TRITON?  Thanks again.</p>

          <p>Tony, the only country where we've launched the KwikPen to date is the U.S.  We do have plans in upcoming months to launch the product in other countries, including Japan and Europe.  In both the U.S. and international, there's a good dose of volume growth under those numbers. Obviously, in addition, international has the positive impact of exchange rates, the U.S. has some benefit from price.</p>
          <p>Based on the data we've collected since we launched the KwikPen in the first quarter, it's definitely having an impact on sales, and I think you heard us mention in the call text that we're now seeing more of our pens prescribed for starter mealtime insulin than the other leading brand.</p>

          <p>On prasugrel, a couple of the examples from our own portfolio where we have doses that are approved that were not fully studied in a registration trial, I believe there's one of our doses of Zyprexa, there's also one of Cialis. It's also my understanding, Tony, there may be a similar situation for a couple of the doses that are indicated for sub-populations for Januvia as well.

          <p>Okay, Bert, on your question on Evista.  First of all, I think we've learned with direct-to-consumer that there is such a thing as staying power, and I think we're going to have to see &#x2013; continue to see how this plays out, because the response of consumers to the ad has been very positive.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind, in addition to motivating a consumer to go ask a question of her healthcare provider based on the ad, we've got to have real good follow-through in the office setting, to make sure that the physician who's prescribing will respond to that question or that request.  So we're looking across the whole spectrum of activities with Evista.  We're pleased to have a second indication obviously and we're hoping to see improvement in the months ahead.</p>
          <p>With respect to Dirucotide, we have an interim analysis, I believe, on 200 patients from the ongoing Phase 3 study for secondary progressive disease that should read out sometime this summer.</p>

So, good news on that, and we hope to continue that forward with the line that we now have with our partner on these -- this molecule.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I have four brief questions.  First, why was there a decrease in demand for Forteo in the U.S?</p>
          <p>Second, could you provide more detail regarding the pre-clinical tox seen with your Factor Xa?</p>
          <p>Third, could you update us on how enrollment for TRILOGY is going, and when is the earliest we could get data?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, is the additional data submitted on prasugrel considered a major amendment?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Steve, I'll go ahead and handle these, and ask the group to chime in if they've got some additional details.  I'm going to actually handle these in reverse order.</p>
          <p>So yes, technically when the FDA extended the review time for prasugrel, that was in the form of a major amendment, and they had the authority basically to pick any time up to 180 days for that extension.  They chose a three-month period, which we think is sufficient for them to complete their review.</p>
          <p>For TRILOGY, we had first patient visit, essentially, at the end of June, so it's really too early to give an update on how the enrollment is going there.</p>
          <p>The pre-clinical tox on the Factor Xa, we're not in a position to share the exact tox finding. What we can say, however, is we have not seen any of these similar kinds of tox issues in any of the human data and the human exposures, that we had with the molecule.</p>
          <p>Demand for Forteo, I'm going to need to follow up with you, unless there's one of the panel here that's got some more details on the &#x2013; the year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, it's Jim.  I think I can add a little bit.  And since we talked with the team, there are a couple of dynamics on Forteo that we continue to address.  One is &#x2013; is the patient population. A lot of them are provided coverage through Medicare, and so we do see some folks getting into the doughnut hole.  As you know, we've put in a lot of programs to help those who need assistance through the Lilly Medicare Answers Program and the like.  But nonetheless, if you have folks that are in the doughnut hole and aren't able to get coverage otherwise, a lot of times they'll discontinue therapy.  So we try to strive for that, since it's the only product group in the  <mark type="inaudible" />. I think about 40%, in fact, of Forteo sales goes through that Medicare channel.</p>
          <p>The other thing that we're doing to really help in that area is, really two things.  One, the elderly population that this serves, there is a lot of difficulty with providing an injection, so we've done a lot with specialty pharmacies, with providing phone support, and giving the patients as many resources as they can have, to help make sure they understand how to use the pen, how to stay on therapy, and to answer questions they have.</p>
          <p>And so final point, as John mentioned, we got approval for the Forteo second-generation pen.  It's substantially easier to use. We think it'll be a meaningful improvement, rather than &#x2013; in fact, we got a demo just the other day.  Several pages worth of text. It's a one-pager with about four pictures on it, about two steps, it takes about 30 seconds to get ready for an injection.  As we get that, the manufacturing finished, have enough to supply the channel, we think that's another meaningful event for Forteo to keep this first-and-only-in-class product available to patients.</p>

          <p>Hello. Thanks very much.  I just actually had one question, specifically about the mGlu2/3 prodrug.  Can you just offer us an update on the pre-clinical toxicology, specifically as it relates to seizures, and if you have officially completed whether or not seizures have occurred or are occurring with the prodrug, and if it has occurred or has not occurred, if you can just provide us with an update there and when we might see an initiation of Phase 3 clinical studies?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Seamus.  I'll go ahead and handle the question.  We essentially would be looking to have by no later than, I think, than our Analyst Meeting this December an update for you on the outcome of this one-year tox study that you're mentioning, which we know is a pivotal milestone for us to achieve in the further development of the molecule.  At this point in time, that we don't have a definitive read-out to share with you at this call.</p>
          <p>Next caller, please?</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the question.  Just purely on Effient, the question relates to basically three parts. As part of any risk evaluation or mitigation strategy that the FDA might ask you for, would it have included a controlled distribution plan, and have you provided the FDA with any controlled distribution, and how you view the commercial opportunity if that's put in place initially?</p>
          <p>Secondly, has your manufacturing facility been inspected in Indianapolis?</p>
          <p>And third, are you in label negotiations yet with DDMAC on the brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, John.  I think we've got the three you're looking for.  Jim, you want to crack at these, so the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So it's a similar theme, that we continue to have the dialogue with the agency, John.  So a lot of back and forth in the review of the package, answering our questions, and so on.  Relative to specific facets of a risk evaluation and management plan, again, we're going to let that conversation play out with the agency, and once we have an answer, on September 26, and have resolved the review and completed all the necessaries, then we'll be in a position to talk about what the conclusions are, rather than give the play-by-play as the discussion takes place.</p>
          <p>We remain confident, as we sound like a broken record. The 19% relative risk reduction against an active comparative. We think Effient offers a lot of important benefits, should it be approved.</p>
          <p>Pre-approval inspection in Indianapolis has not happened.  Again, as we said earlier, that facility has been visited by the FDA in 2008. We haven't been notified that they'll need to take another specific look at it. If they do, we'll certainly keep you apprised, but they haven't said that that's a necessary requirement.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a reminder, John, that the &#x2013; our boat facility <mark type="inaudible" /> in Japan has already been inspected, and it &#x2013; was approved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, this is Phil.  Finally, as far as the label negotiations, that is part of the play-by-play that we are not sharing externally.  One point to consider on your first question, however, when you do look at things like the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies that are called for the FDA guidelines, there are the elements that you're mentioning, things like specific patient &#x2013; I'm sorry, physician or pharmacist training, controlled distribution. There are also things that qualify for a REM, like a patient package insert, that are much simpler and much less difficult to comply with.  So I think if you're thinking of REMs for this product, I'd look &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> you to look at the whole range of possibilities of how you might manage risk associated with prasugrel.</p>
          <p>I understand we have no further calls on the line, so I'll turn it over to John to conclude the call.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Phil, and thanks to each of you for your time this morning.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize a few of our key points.  We're on track to deliver on our pipeline goals for the year, and we've made significant progress in the first six months, with solid movement into and through our pipeline.  Our next key pipeline event is the FDA action date for prasugrel on September 26.  We are working productively with the agency.  We're confident in our data package and the value this medicine could bring to patients.</p>
          <p>Improving productivity remains a key focus, and we still expect to deliver operating leverage for the year, growing sales faster than our costs and expenses.  We will continue to reduce our head count, and we'll use a variety of actions to reduce our expenses.  At the same time, we will continue to invest to maximize the range and value of indications on important growth products such as Alimta, Cymbalta, Cialis, and Byetta, not to mention prasugrel.  As we make such investments, we're also becoming more flexible in our approach.  We're deploying resources in ways that can be adjusted and redirected quickly to respond to changing market conditions.</p>
          <p>At Lilly, we have a sense of urgency to deliver strong results today while also reshaping our company to win for the benefit of patients and shareholders alike.  Thank you all for joining us this morning, and I look forward to continuing my interactions with our investors.</p>
