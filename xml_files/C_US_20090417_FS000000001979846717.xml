          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Citi's first quarter 2009 earnings review featuring Citi Chief Financial Officer Ned Kelly. The call will be hosted by Scott Freidenrich, Head of Investor Relations. We ask you to hold all comments until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>Mr. Freidenrich, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2009 earnings review. On our call this morning, Citi's Chief Financial Officer Ned Kelly will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, Citigroup.com. Afterward, we'll be happy to take questions. Please limit follow-up questions to one.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements. Citi's financial results may differ materially from those statements, so please refer to our SEC filings for descriptions of the factors that would cause our actual results to differ from expectations.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over to Ned.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. I wanted to start if I could by thanking Gary Crittenden for the tremendous contributions he has made to Citi during his time as CFO and I'm sure he will continue to make in his new role. His work on reengineering and centralizing treasury functions and streamlining the finance organization are but a few examples of the contributions he has made, to say nothing of navigating the firm through very difficult times. He has been gracious enough to agree to help me through the transition. And perhaps most importantly, he has left behind a finance team which is terrific and has been enormously patient with me and also extraordinarily helpful.</p>
          <p>Turning to the quarter, this is the strongest quarter we've had in well over a year on many measures, perhaps most vividly reflected in positive net income. Overall revenues were strong, driven by the performance of the Institutional Clients Group, which offset declines in other areas. Expenses and head count continue to trend downward. Together, the higher revenues and lower expenses generated a strong operating margin.</p>
          <p>Assets also continued their decline, and we continue to reduce exposure to the riskiest assets. Net revenue marks declined substantially during the quarter. With all that said, we still face challenges as general market conditions remain uncertain and credit conditions in Consumer continue to deteriorate.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide one to begin the earnings discussion. Slide one shows our consolidated results for the quarter. We reported revenues of 24.8 billion. That's nearly double year over year and 19.2 billion higher sequentially. Reported expenses were down 23% year over year when adjusted for the effect of certain charges and items that we disclosed in the press release. Expenses were down 19% year over year and 4% sequentially. Credit costs were up by 4.4 billion over last year, primarily due to higher net credit losses of 3.6 billion and a $754 million incremental net charge to increase loan loss reserves. Sequentially, credit costs were down 2.4 billion due to loan loss reserve builds that were lower by 3.3 billion, offset partially by a $1.1 billion increase in net credit losses. These factors drove net income of 1.6 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide two shows the earnings per share calculation for the quarter which included one unusual item. EPS was negative $0.18. EPS was affected by preferred dividends of 1.3 billion. As we confirmed in a separate press release this morning, we intend to continue to pay dividends on outstanding preferred shares until the closing of the previously announced exchange offers.</p>
          <p>Additionally, EPS includes a one-time $1.3 billion reduction related to the impact of a conversion price reset on 12.5 billion of convertible securities we issued in the first quarter of last year. That reset has no impact on net income, equity, or the capital ratios, but it did result in a reclassification from retained earnings to additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet to reflect the benefit to preferred shareholders. Excluding the impact of the one-time reset, income available to common shareholders would have been positive on both a basic and fully diluted basis.</p>
          <p>Slide three shows the sequential revenue trend over the last nine quarters adjusted for net revenue marks in the Securities and Banking business. On a reported basis, as I said, revenues for the quarter of 24.8 billion were in line with the record quarters of early 2007, when the balance sheet was larger by about $0.5 trillion.</p>
          <p>As shown on the dotted lines on the page, total disclosed net marks for the quarter were 2.2 billion. There are three items we added to our traditionally disclosed marks this quarter, which amounted to 4.2 billion, and which are detailed in the appendix on slide 26. These additional items started with on the mark side, $1.2 billion in private equity losses. And then these items were offset partially by a $2.7 billion net benefit from CVA on our non-monoline derivative positions and a $541 million benefit in revenue accretion on non-credit marks on certain securities and banking assets that we had moved from mark-to-market to accrual accounts last quarter. All the historical numbers on the slide are adjusted to reflect these items. And excluding these net marks, revenues for the quarter were 26.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide four shows revenues in each of our major businesses. Within ICG, revenues in Securities and Banking were 7.2 billion, up 14.5 billion versus last year, driven by a number of factors. Disclosed net marks at 2.2 billion were nearly $11 billion lower than last year and $13 billion lower than last quarter, most of which are included in the fixed income markets business. The S&amp;B revenue results reflect an unusually favorable trading environment driven by customer flows and market volatility. Clients remained actively engaged with us through the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Equity and Fixed Income markets businesses together generated 6.6 billion in revenues. In fixed income, interest rates, currencies, and credit products were particularly strong. In equity markets, equity derivatives and trading were the key drivers of revenues. Trading assets in the balance sheet declined by 243 billion from the prior-year period. These businesses, as we've discussed in the past, have been significantly derisked and delevered but are still generating substantial revenues.</p>
          <p>In Investment Banking, we generated 1.2 billion in net revenues, primarily from debt underwriting. In equity underwriting, after two quarters of consecutive declines, we saw a rebound in the quarter. And finally, Advisory revenues of 230 million were in line with last quarter.</p>
          <p>In Consumer Banking, revenues fell 18% versus last year to 6.4 billion and increased 5% sequentially. In the US, the key drivers in the year-over-year decline were lower loan volumes and spread compression, due largely to higher non-accrual loans and lower interest rates and loan modifications. The sequential increase in the US was driven by higher gains on sale, on higher origination volumes, and improving spreads. Outside the US, foreign exchanges and lower investment sales due to weaker equity market conditions drove the decline.</p>
          <p>In global Cards, revenues fell 10% versus last year to 5.8 billion, driven primarily by higher credit losses flowing through the securitization trusts but also due to the impact of FX. Managed revenues increased 3%. Global card revenues were up 25% sequentially, driven by a $1.1 billion gain on the sale of ReadyCARD shares in the current quarter. I'd note that last year's first quarter also included an aggregate gain of 1.1 billion from the sales of ReadyCARD and Visa shares at the time.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management revenues declined both sequentially and year over year to 2.6 billion, affected by declining asset valuations across all regions, lower capital markets driven revenues, lower management fees, and broker attrition.</p>
          <p>Transaction Services revenues were 2.3 billion and were down 1% from last year, although it was up 8% excluding the effect of foreign exchange. Treasury and Trade Solutions had another strong quarter, though we expect economic conditions could slow the rate of growth in the shorter term. Security Services continues to operate in a difficult environment as asset value declines pressured fee-based revenue and interest revenues fell with declining liability balances. That said, Transaction Services had record net income in the quarter. In summary, the business has demonstrated revenue generation capability in the midst of difficult conditions.</p>
          <p>Slide five is a chart similar to the one that we showed last quarter which shows the movement in corporate credit spreads since the end of 2007. During the quarter, our bond spreads widened and we recorded a $180 million net gain on the value of our own debt for which we've elected the fair-value option.</p>
          <p>On our non-monoline derivative positions, counterparty CDS spreads actually narrowed slightly, which created a small gain on our derivative asset positions. Our own CDS spreads widened significantly, which created a substantial gain on our derivative liability positions. This resulted in a 2.7 billion net mark-to-market gain. We've shown on the slide the five-year bond spreads for illustrative purposes, CVA on our own fair-value debt is calculated by weighting the spread movements of various bond tenors corresponding to the average tenors of debt maturities in our debt portfolio. The debt portfolio for which we've elected the fair-value options is more heavily weighted towards shorter tenors.</p>
          <p>Slide six which I've referred to in the introduction shows the reduction of key risk assets in the Securities and Banking business over a six-quarter period. For each quarter, you can see the split between assets held in fair-value accounts and those held in accrual accounts. We've reduced our total key risk exposure since the fourth quarter of 2007; and this quarter they're well below half the level they were in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>We also, as you know, moved a substantial portion of the fair-value assets into accrual accounts during the fourth quarter of 2008 as we believe that pricing levels at the time made them attractive opportunities. While this accounting change doesn't reduce the risks associated with the portfolios, it has reduced the earnings volatility associated with them. Moreover, during the quarter we recorded a $541 million benefit related to the revenue accretion on the non-credit marks on these assets.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows the substantial asset reductions in seven of the categories that comprise the majority of the marks each quarter. We showed you this slide last quarter and are including it again to illustrate the continued decline in key risk categories. As of the end of March, 71% of these assets were accounted for on an accrual basis versus 15% last year.</p>
          <p>Slide eight shows the trend of our expenses. Expenses were 12.1 billion and fell 23% versus last year. This quarter's expenses were down by 4 billion from our peak expense level of 16.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In the prior-year period and in the current quarter, there were several items that affected expenses that we detail in today's press release. Taken together, they accounted for 626 million of charges in the first quarter of 2008 and a $253 million benefit this quarter. Adjusting for these items, expenses would have declined 19%. If you exclude the impact of FX, expenses would have declined 18% since last year's first quarter. Excluding last quarter's 9.6 billion goodwill impairment charge and a number of press release disclosed items, expenses would have declined 4% sequentially. We're pleased with the progress in our expense reductions and remain on track to achieve our expense target of approximately 50 to 52 billion for the full year. Our goal is to commit to achieve the lower end of that aspiration.</p>
          <p>Slide nine highlights the progress we continue to make in reducing head count. March was the 17th consecutive month in which head count has come down. We were down approximately 13,000 or 4% from last quarter and down 65,000 or 17% from the peak at the end of 2007. This reflects a mix of RIFs [Reductions In Force], divestitures, and attrition, partially offset by hires we also made during the quarter. We have said that we expect to reach our target head count of 300,000 by midyear and we're well on our way to achieving that goal.</p>
          <p>Slide ten shows the trend of our consumer credit costs over the last nine quarters on top and the reduction in consumer loans along with key credit ratios at the bottom. As the top graph shows, both net credit losses and reserve builds have increased substantially since early 2007. The total allowance for credit losses in our Consumer portfolio stands at 24.3 billion. You can see from the line in the top graph that we've held months of coverage in our consumer businesses fairly consistent at between 12 and 13 months. That reflects our current outlook for losses embedded in the portfolio. Reserve levels in the Consumer business have increased substantially.</p>
          <p>In Global Cards, we built 1.1 billion in reserves during the quarter versus 1.3 billion last quarter. That build was in line with the sequential increase in NCLs on an annualized basis. A number of inputs are considered to determine appropriate reserve levels in any quarter. One example is 30-day delinquencies, which tend to be an early indicator of potential losses.</p>
          <p>In North America Cards, we saw a moderation in the rate of increase of loans 30 days past due relative to last quarter. That said, this is a single metric and one quarter's results are not conclusive.</p>
          <p>Similarly in North America Consumer Banking, where we added nearly $1 billion of reserves in the quarter, we also saw a moderation in the growth of loans 30 days past due. The sequential increase in net credit losses results was also much smaller than the sequential increase last quarter. This is partly due to some seasonality which was reflected both in net credit losses and in reserve builds.</p>
          <p>The graph on the bottom of the page shows that the Consumer NCL ratio has been consistently rising since early 2007, particularly over the past year. While that's largely due to higher credit costs, the ratios themselves are exacerbated by lower loan levels, as shown in the blue bars at the bottom. As a percentage of total loans, reserves have increased from 2.4% at the end of first quarter of 2008 to 5% this quarter, reflecting both continued reserve building and lower loan levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 is a variation on a slide we've shown for several quarters. It charts the net credit loss ratios in our North American Cards and first mortgage portfolios as well as the unemployment rate during the current recession. You can see from the 10.18% cards NCL rate that losses seem to be breaking historic correlation with unemployment. The combination of high unemployment and unprecedented declines in home values seems to be driving Cards with net credit losses to new highs. Here also a continued decline in loans due to fewer balance acquisitions, lower sales volumes, and risk mitigation efforts is having an adverse denominator effect on the NCL ratio. Average managed loans in North America are down by 7 billion or 4% versus last year.</p>
          <p>As we said in the past, we expect that NCLs will increase with the unemployment rate, which so far shows no signs of moderating. Looking to the yellow box at the top of the page, the NCL ratio and yields are much higher in retail partner cards than in Citi branded cards. That is consistent with past quarters. We note that the retail partner portfolio will be part of the Citi Holding segment where the business will be managed to optimize its value.</p>
          <p>Turning to the first mortgage net credit loss ratio, there is a denominator effect on the ratio similar to the effect in Cards. Here average loans are down by 19 billion or 12% versus last year. Still even after normalizing for loan balances, the ratio continues to increase.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows our corporate loan loss reserve ratio at the top and it shows historical corporate reserve builds at the bottom. In this, investment grade and non-investment grade defaults have continued to trend upwards. The vast majority of our corporate lending exposure is in the form of investment grade loans. We continue to build general reserves, which are shown in the blue box, and that reflects an overall weakening in the corporate credit environment.</p>
          <p>Looking at a sequential quarter comparison, our incremental net loan loss reserve build fell 2.1 billion, driven by two factors. First as you know, last quarter's specific build included 1.2 billion for LyondellBasell. This quarter, our net credit losses included $1.4 billion of losses related to specific counterparties, primarily Lyondell, for which we'd previously established FAS 114 reserves. The specific reserves established for those exposures were released this quarter, and this release was netted against a gross build of 1.7 billion, which yields us a net build which is shown on the chart.</p>
          <p>Our current loan loss reserve balance for funded corporate loans is about 7.4 billion or 4.4% of total loans.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows the Tier 1 capital ratio on the left side and tangible common equity on the right. The Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 11.8%, which was down slightly from last quarter. That slight decline in the Tier 1 ratio was due to the consolidation of credit card related securitization assets for regulatory capital purposes. Risk weighted assets increased approximately 82 billion due to the consolidation, which caused a reduction in the Tier 1 ratio of about 100 basis points. This deterioration is almost completely offset by higher Tier 1 capital and a reduction in other risk weighted assets reflecting the overall reduction in the balance sheet. Looking ahead, Tier 1 will benefit from an expected gain from the Smith Barney transaction, which may close in the second quarter or we believe at the latest the third.</p>
          <p>We finished the quarter with tangible common equity of 29.7 billion, which is flat from last quarter. And then looking at the factors we've already announced that could potentially benefit tangible equity, first there's the Smith Barney transaction which I mentioned, which has a benefit of about 6.5 billion. Second, we expect up to approximately 51 billion from the exchange offer depending on the participation rate. As we've announced this morning and as I will discuss further in a minute, the offer will not launch until after the completion of the stress test. Third, we're expecting 7.5 billion from the conversion of the ADIA mandatory convert. The first tranche in the amount of 1.9 billion is scheduled for conversion in March of 2010 and then converts throughout 2010 and 2011, March/September, March/September.</p>
          <p>The deferred tax asset at quarter end was essentially unchanged at approximately 43 billion. That was down about 1 billion from the year-end level. We did not record a valuation allowance in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows the split between our US and international deposits. As the red line on the top of the page shows, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange, total deposits were essentially flat on a sequential basis. The blue bar shows deposits in the US which were up 8 billion on a linked quarter basis. The gray bars show international deposits which declined 19 billion sequentially. More than half of that decline was due to FX adjustments. Internationally, slight growth in retail deposits was offset by a decline in GTS [Global Transaction Services] deposits, particularly in EMEA on an FX to adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>To wrap up on slide 15, we've clearly made substantial progress on many fronts. We have completed 24 divestitures since the end of 2007. That has allowed us to focus on the core business and to generate capital benefits. We've worked to delever the company and de-risk the balance sheet. From the third quarter of 2007 to March 2009, assets have fallen by more than $0.5 trillion.</p>
          <p>In our Securities and Banking business key risk assets have fallen by more than 50% since the end of 2007. Expenses and head count have continued to decline.</p>
          <p>As you know, last quarter we announced a reorganization into two operating units, Citicorp and Citi Holdings. That new construct will allow us to focus on the core business activities in Citicorp while allowing us to manage, optimize, and run off certain segments of Citi Holdings. We'll begin reporting under that new structure in the second quarter. We'll make sure you have historical financials in advance of the second quarter earnings.</p>
          <p>While we've made progress, the environment continues to be challenging, so I thought I might give you a few thoughts on the remainder of the year. First on revenues, reported revenues of nearly 25 billion were strong. They reflect the revenue generation capability of the franchise. Revenues for the remainder of the year, it goes without saying will continue to be dependent on general economic and market conditions.</p>
          <p>While continued volatility in the markets could create an environment that's conducive to trading gains, it's obviously highly unpredictable. Additionally, there's a seasonal element to the ICG business where the first quarter has historically been the strongest in the year. Revenue growth outside ICG could be affected by lower asset levels as we manage down our balance sheet to reduce risk positions. In the current environment, we believe this is a prudent strategy and one that will benefit us if the current environment in particular continues to deteriorate.</p>
          <p>On the other side, helping revenues in 2009 would be a number of factors, first the impact of the repricing of the credit card portfolio. We began to see the benefit of these actions in the first quarter. We've done a thorough analysis of the portfolio and have made pricing adjustments which are expected to mitigate credit costs in the business.</p>
          <p>Second, as I've noted, we've moved certain of our assets to accrual accounts as we believe that current levels of pricing make them attractive opportunities. We expect to see continued revenue accretion on the non-credit marks on these assets over time. Offsetting these positive factors could be continuing marks on certain exposures which as you know while substantially reduced still exist.</p>
          <p>Moving on to expenses, we said in the fourth quarter that we were targeting a full-year 2009 expense base of between 50 and 52 billion. As I said earlier, this quarter's results demonstrate that we've made substantial progress and we hope to bring it in at the lower end of that range. Credit costs are clearly going to remain a headwind during 2009. I think that has been a pretty consistent theme. This quarter, the net credit losses for our Consumer businesses actually came in approximately $1 billion better than we had previously indicated during the third quarter of '08, I believe. This was primarily due to foreign exchange adjustments and better than expected losses across many of the products. There was no concentration essentially with spread across the products.</p>
          <p>Looking to the second quarter, we expect an increase in line with what we previously indicated last year. In other words, we expect total Consumer NCLs in the second quarter of 2009 to be in the range of $1 billion higher than this quarter. That would bring it into line with what we discussed in the latter part of last year in terms of what it was that we expected.</p>
          <p>There are two key factors that are driving that expectation. First, the rate at which customers became delinquent in our North American real estate business rose steadily in the second half of 2008 and it peaked in November of 2008. Since then, this rate has steadily declined but that late 2008 peak and early bucket delinquencies is expected to result in higher net credit losses next quarter versus this quarter. Second, in some of the international consumer portfolios, we continue to see rising delinquencies as general economic conditions continue to weaken globally.</p>
          <p>On consumer loan loss reserves, we expect to continue to add to our reserves until the end of 2009, and should see the end of significant additions by then. Corporate credit, as you know, is inherently difficult to predict. It would be reasonable to assume as corporate default rates increase, we'll continue to add to reserves. And likely we'll see higher net credit losses, although both the recognition of those credit losses and the building of reserves will be somewhat episodic.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we're pleased with this quarter's performance. We certainly remain focused on the risks that continue to face the company.</p>
          <p>Before opening it up to Q&amp;A, I'd like to make two more comments. First, as many of you may have seen, we announced this morning that we're continuing to work on finalizing the exchange offer. But because of the proximity of the government stress test results announcements, we're not going to launch the exchange offer until the conclusion of the test. We've continued to work with both the SEC in completing the customary review process and with the government in finalizing documents for the government exchange.</p>
          <p>When we first filed, we realized we'd have to complete the SEC process, execute definitive documents with the Treasury, and get regulatory approvals. While all of these have proceeded without any substantive issues, it's not a huge surprise that it has taken longer than we might have expected. When you add that extension of time to the fact that the results of the stress test are expected in the near term, this led us to the natural conclusion that it made sense to delay the launch of the exchange offer until we could tell the market exactly what the results of the stress test are. It's going to be a source of considerable interest irrespective of the outcome, and we thought the prudent thing to do under the circumstances was simply to delay.</p>
          <p>Just as a footnote to that, I can't, and we cannot currently envision circumstances under which we would change either the implied $3.25 conversion price or the announced tender prices for the preferred stock being sought. But I wanted to add that to the press release that we had issued this morning given the market's interest in the exchange offer.</p>
          <p>Second, as many of you are aware, we're making some changes in our Investor Relations area. Scott Freidenrich, who has been running our IR group, is moving over to new responsibilities at Citi, and I'd like to thank him as I know all of us would for his work in IR. I'm happy to announce that John Andrews, known to many of you, has joined Citi as the new head of IR. I've worked with John over the last couple of weeks, and he and I look forward to working with all of you.</p>
          <p>I'd be happy to open it to Q&amp;A. As you might imagine, I've gone through an immersion experience over the past few weeks. I'll be the first to tell you if I don't know, but I will do my level best to answer whatever questions you may have, and I am ably assisted by a number of people around the table who will make up I am sure for whatever deficits I might suffer. But with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>

          <p>The first question I have for you is, I know you went through the discussion of 30-day delinquencies and how that helped you decide what your loss provisions would be, but all we see is the 90-day numbers. And I guess the question is how do you reconcile the fact that the reserve build portion of the Consumer loss provision declined by about half from the fourth quarter when your 90-day delinquencies in the US rose by about 90 basis points and globally by something like 80?</p>

          <p>As Guy, you might imagine, I've spent a fair amount of time during the past couple of weeks talking about that, and we talked about it a fair amount internally. The things I focus on are threefold in that discussion. One is as you know, we have a 24 billion rough numbers allowance in the Consumer side. The second piece of it is that we maintain more or less a consistent months of coverage ratio with respect to those consumer loans. As you know, it has been between 12 and 13. And then if you look at the sequential quarter increase, which I think is rough numbers 500 million on the consumer side from 5.2 to 5.7, the reserve build is I think rough numbers 2.4 billion if I'm not mistaken, something in that neighborhood, which as you know is more than four times that sequential increase.</p>
          <p>I think if you look back at the fourth quarter, and this is related to some of the comments I made, I think towards the latter part of last year, we were expecting actually a higher credit loss in the first and second quarter of this year, which may have informed the reserve build in the fourth quarter. We've actually now looked at it. And as I mentioned with respect to the first quarter, it had come in about 1 billion less than where we thought we would be. So when you take all those factors together, we've implemented the reserve build that we did. As I mentioned, we have not ruled out the possibility and in fact expect that it may go back up next quarter. But my own view is given the months of coverage and given the level of the allowance overall, I think we believe that we are still very well positioned.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. My follow-up question is on commercial real estate finance. Could you speak to what your mark-to-market on Commercial Real Estate finance and credit reserving was during the quarter in Securities and Banking and anywhere else in the firm where there might be exposure? And also tell us how much commercial real estate exposure did you move into accrual accounting in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, there would have been very little that would have in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess the question then more broadly is how much CRE finance did you move into held-to-maturity or into accrual accounting last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd have to check. As you know, on slide seven basically in the S&amp;B risk categories, we've got CRE there. As you know, at 3/31/09 the risk exposure was 36 billion versus the year earlier. And then obviously, at fair value accounting, we're down to 5.7 billion. I don't have the specific breakout in terms of what it is that we moved actually &#x2013; somebody fortunately has just handed it to me. The trading account from fourth quarter to first quarter actually went down 100 million. Held-to-maturity actually went down interestingly enough, 26.9 to 25.8, 1.1 billion. And the equity method essentially was just a minor change of 100 million.</p>
          <p>On the other piece of it, my recollection is that the marks or the reserves that we took against the commercial portfolio downtown this quarter were relatively minor. And as you know, a bunch of our commercial real estate is actually embedded in Consumer. And in fact on page 26 of the appendix, you can see that we've got the write-downs on CRE which confirms my recollection of about 186 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I just want to clarify a couple of things that you mentioned. Did I hear you right that Consumer NCL should be about 1 billion higher next quarter versus this quarter due to the early stage delinquencies that peaked in November '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, going back to it, as I think and obviously I was not here, but I am told that in the third quarter of '08, I believe we suggested &#x2013; or in the fourth quarter rather, we suggested we expected net credit losses in the Consumer side to be 2 billion higher in each of the first and second quarters than they had been in the third quarter. And at this stage, as you know, we were actually 1 billion short of that in the first quarter. What we are doing is essentially reverting to the discussion that we had at the end of last year, getting back to a number that's 2 billion higher than it was in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The rate of delinquency since November, as you know, has in fact gone down. It peaked in November, and as it works its way through the buckets, we expect obviously if you will, the elephant to make its way through the python at that stage, but it hasn't, as I said. The rates of delinquency have declined since then but we're anticipating that November peak to play its way through in the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a broader question on Card in general, obviously a major card player, unemployment, jobless claims continue to stress portfolios here. And we have not only UDAP [Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices] that's expected to go into place July 2010, but the possibility that it gets put into place sooner given actions that Congress is taking. Can you help us understand how you're managing your portfolio domestically as well as internationally with regard to outstandings and how you balance the profitability question versus the size question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is we're managing very carefully, as you might imagine, with due regard obviously to the environment that you've described and the fact that we have experienced substantial losses in that portfolio. I think it's fair to say that the bias has shifted, if you will, from growth to risk management, and that's reflected in a variety of things in terms of our risk mitigation efforts, looking at lines very carefully where we've taken some actions recently to try to reduce those lines, and we are clearly trying to work through to reduce the losses to the extent that we can.</p>
          <p>Frankly, there's little to choose between the US and internationally in the Cards business. The trends are broadly similar. You see that in terms of consumers drawing back and declines in sales which ultimately leads as you know to declining balances. The net credit losses by and large are pretty similar. I think we have a chart in the appendix that reflects that. The US business, as you know, has got the securitized cards in it, which is reflected as you know in the delinquency ratios in the retail partner side which are higher than they are in the branded cards. So it's a tough environment.</p>
          <p>I think we don't expect that there's going to be any marked pickup in the near term and that growth opportunities by way of acquisitions or balance transfers or whatever it might be should be limited by prudence. So we're trying to risk manage our way through the cycle, mitigate the losses, and make sure that we're well positioned to participate in a recovery. But as I said, my suspicion is that there is a shift in bias. It is from one of historical growth now to trying to manage the portfolio as prudently as we can.</p>

          <p>On the second point, I will let you be the judge of whether there are any style changes. I can tell you that I have immense regard for Gary. He has become a very good friend in addition to being a very highly valued colleague. I am very sensitive to the fact I have big shoes to fill. I'm doing my best.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To be a little more concrete, I'm looking at just the big picture measure, reserves to non-performing assets, which that ratio is down a lot in the last year. And when you add mercantile, you're a lot more conservative with reserves to NPAs. And so to the extent that you're cautious on the outlook for credit quality, you said you might be increasing the level of the reserve build next quarter. What's a reasonable level to shoot for in terms of reserves to NPAs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Mike, two things, one is obviously &#x2013; one of the things that I've gone through as you point out in the transition from my former life to the current one with, as you know, an intermediate stop is to understand the reserving policies which as you know are different in the context of a firm of this nature with the consumer exposures that it has and obviously with the large investment grade corporate exposures it has.</p>
          <p>There are a couple of differences from what I'm accustomed to. The team has been great in terms of taking me through those. But as I said earlier, when you look at the absolute allowance level relative to Consumer, I think it's fair to say that 24 billion, my view is and it's obviously one shared by the team and the firm, is actually in pretty good shape. Secondly, we focus on those coverage ratios, as you know, in terms of months of coverage, and they remain fairly constant. To one of the points that I made earlier in terms of what it was that we were thinking about during the fourth quarter of last year, you could argue that we were conservative in our reserving against the Consumer portfolio at that stage given our expectations. As I said, it came in a little lighter than we thought, but we're not getting overly optimistic and suspect it may track back up in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, when you look at the corporate loan portfolio, I think our reserve there is about 4.4% if I recall, which strikes me as pretty solid. The fact is that that's going to be given the nature of the portfolio lumpy and episodic, less predictable. But having said that, I think we feel in pretty good shape on that front. The thing that we're bracing ourselves for, as I think everybody is, is what is in fact going to happen to the economy and what's going to happen to the consumer. We're tracking that very closely. We'll do what it is that we think makes sense in the reserving front as those losses flow through. But I think we have maintained a consistent methodology, consistently applied, and that is how we will continue to pursue it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last short follow-up, how much more should we expect the reserve build to be next quarter relative to this quarter? Do you have any sense yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because obviously that's going to be highly contingent on whether we're right. We've been wrong, obviously, as we were in the fourth quarter in terms of predicting what the first and second would look like. I'm sure that I run the hazard of being wrong with respect to the second quarter. That was just our effort to give you some sense of where we thought it would be. But ultimately the reserve level would be determined by results during the course of the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's pretty broad based. In other words, if you look at the revenue distribution across Securities and Banking, Fixed Income was strong. Equities were strong. Investment Banking was relatively strong, obviously down from historical levels. Rates and currencies as you know was particularly strong within the fixed income business, and I suspect that in part reflects that. So I think as I said, Fixed Income was the largest part of the revenues. I don't want to understate the performance of Equities or Investment Banking, but I think it's attributable to fixed income performance.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my last question is strategic question. On Citi Holdings, can you review your runoff versus disposition strategy within that portfolio, and then maybe talk about some of the things that are going on, not name specific, but some of the conversations that you're having with deal volumes picking up, interest in those assets are picking up, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, Meredith, when we announced it in January, and fortunately I was involved in that. When we announced it in January, essentially we placed the assets in Citi Holdings into three broad buckets. One was Brokerage and Asset Management. The second was essentially the Consumer business, which as you know as I mentioned earlier includes the retail partners' card portfolio. And the third was what we described as special assets.</p>
          <p>When we announced that, we said that basically we'll have three strategies in connection with those assets. One and the overarching one was to optimize value with respect to them. The second was to manage those assets that we could not optimize in the near term as effectively as we could across the cycle in order to mitigate risk and maximize returns. And the third is in the special asset portfolio, those are obviously assets in wind down. I think it's safe to say that none of that has changed.</p>
          <p>As you know, as part of that, we went into the Morgan Stanley/Smith Barney joint venture, which I think we've said is typical or a prototype for the types of deals we'd like to do in terms of upfront cash payment, capital generation, retention of the upside for the future when the markets might improve. That's not going to be easy to replicate but we're thinking about that concept in connection with a number of businesses on the Holdings side. We're going to continue to pursue that. I think it's also fair to say that if opportunities emerge that allow us to return capital to the firm as a whole on a basis where it makes sense and where we believe that can be redeployed better than the way it's deployed today, we will in fact pursue those. And I'm sure it wouldn't come as any surprise to you that we continue to actively consider what our alternatives might be in the context of achieving that optimization of value that we laid out in January.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks. You had a pretty big chunk of assets in the fall that you moved out of trading and into held-for-sale and/or held-to-maturity. Can you comment on how the cash flows on those assets are tracking relative to the levels they're marked at? And over time, would you expect to accrete net interest income from those assets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, as I think I had mentioned earlier, one of the adjustments that we made to revenues was the $541 million worth of accretion associated with the assets that we had transferred from mark-to-market to held-to-maturity. As I think I mentioned, obviously recognizing that life is uncertain, we expect that accretion to continue because we believe when we moved those assets, they were marked at attractive prices and that value should accrete over time. As I said, it was a $541 million benefit in the first quarter. We would expect to enjoy that benefit going forward. And as a result, as you know, we've included it in those four adjustments that we make to revenues up front.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you give any more color on the drivers for the consolidated net interest margin and the improvement this quarter and what might be sustainable from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, at the end of the day, part of it is obviously going to depend on the pricing of assets. So I think the principal driver not surprisingly was liabilities. I mean, we are liability sensitive. Given the fact that rates are as low as they are, it's not surprising that net interest margin would pick up. I think it was up eight basis points if I'm not mistaken on a linked quarter basis, from 322 to 330.</p>
          <p>In part, it's going to depend whether I'm right. And this may take some time to play out that over time if everybody manages to get through this, this could be a very good period for banks insofar as credit becomes regarded as less of a commodity and more of a precious asset, which may lead to some secular repricing. Because I think if I look back on it based on my past life, I think the fact is there was mispricing of risk and there was a mispricing of credit generally. To the extent that it reverts to more historical norms and assuming there's no real spike in rates, that should enhance margins over time. I think the industry as a whole is hoping that's the case. Obviously and NIM at this stage is being supported by very low rates because there's an offset as you well know on the other side just in terms of non-accrual assets. But having said that, once we get through it, I suspect that there's a chance that margins may in fact go back up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last question. Could you give us some comments on international consumer credit? It's very hard for us to analyze that, and just where are your greatest concerns in terms of the international consumer credit deterioration. Maybe specifically comment on EMEA and Latin America, where the trajectories are moving up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have in my own review over the past couple of weeks, I think it's fair to say the countries of greatest concern are the UK, Spain, Greece, Mexico, India; so I have spanned the globe with those countries. If you look at the international versus the North American business, and I actually have been through that analysis as well; and not to be flip about it, but there's not much to choose between the two. I think the trends that you see among consumers and with respect to credit losses are broadly very similar. I think it's probably fair to say that there has been slightly more of an acceleration in terms of credit deterioration internationally versus the US over the past couple of months. Having said that, they're reaching basically the same nominal levels.</p>
          <p>And the interesting thing is that there does not seem to be in one respect any relief from what clearly is a global economic condition which is affecting consumers not only here but also outside the United States. As I said, there's very little to choose between the two. If you look at it in terms of loss rates and net credit loss ratios, obviously we are thinking about reserving broadly both in connection with North America and with respect to internationally. But interestingly enough even if I were extremely pressed and you said take your choice, it would be a toss-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and that also reflects differences in underwriting or risk layering that you may have done in international versus domestic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's one confounding factor if you will in domestic, which of course is the securitization trusts on the credit card side. As you know, the retail cards obviously have a higher loss ratio than the branded cards. So that is one thing that at least on a nominal basis drives North America higher. We are continually focused as you might well imagine on risk mitigation efforts generally. Those risk mitigation efforts are not only in the United States but around the world.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I don't think there's really much to choose in terms of the growth rates either. By and large, it has been pretty consistent across the board.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just have a couple of questions. The first is I just want to clarify that there has been no change in the way in which you're either recognizing or reporting non-performing assets on the $300 billion of assets that are in the risk sharing agreement with the government.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So those are just flowing through non-performing assets in a normal way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, including losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the second question is just going back to the exchange offering for the preferred. If you don't think that the stress test is going to have an impact on the offering, why are you delaying it? What's the reason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've been careful not to say anything about the stress test, principally because we've been instructed rather expressly by the regulators not to say anything. But just to take your question and its premise, irrespective of what the outcome is, positive, negative, indifferent, that's going to be a source of great interest to the market.</p>
          <p>And I guess the way I thought about this, and I'd be the first to admit that I was the one who suggested it, if you were about to do, putting the government to one side a $27 billion equity offering, and you are weeks, not months away from the revelation of information that is likely to be of great interest to the market, it makes perfect sense to delay that offering to allow for the digestion of that information. It's really as simple as that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine. I just wanted to clarify that. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. The one thing I noticed as a pleasant surprise was that corporate non-accruals were up only about 12%, something like that. And most of the other reporting banks that I've seen were up more in the 20 to 30% range. And I was just wondering, is that just a timing difference? Did you have accelerated recognition in the fourth quarter? Is there any reason to think that your corporate credit would exhibit different characteristics than what we see in the industry at large? And also I wonder if you could comment on some of the key trouble spots like the auto industry and your exposure there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I had said earlier, Chris, our loan portfolio by and large &#x2013; obviously there are going to be exceptions, is essentially large global corporates. There are exceptions. You would expect in that context, in the absence of severe economic distress, for that portfolio to perform reasonably well. It's obviously going to be driven by the economy, but it should perform reasonably well.</p>
          <p>As you know, the losses that we've had in the past in some respects have been driven as you know by highly leveraged transactions. And in fact, we've seen a couple of examples of that over the past couple of years. So I am not surprised in one respect that we wouldn't show the immediate impact in terms of non-performers because the other factor is that our losses and our non-performers tend to be relatively lumpy in that business just given the nature of our business. The corporate NPA did go up during the fourth quarter as you well know, and we went through that in one of the slides. We obviously crystallized one of the losses in the first quarter, which I mentioned I think by name, and we're continuing to watch it closely.</p>
          <p>With respect to the autos, obviously we do have exposure to the auto and related industries, including suppliers. We feel that we are well secured and/or adequately reserved in connection with those exposures. Assuming that there is some orderly resolution of the situation, as I said having spent a fair amount of time with our risk people in discussions with the business guys downtown, I think we feel as if we're pretty well positioned.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't. As I said, I'd be the first to tell you if I didn't know. I'm not sure that we have sized it, but it may be that you could follow up with John on that question. It looks as if somebody has just written me a note that essentially the benefit was 2 billion plus annualized? Yes, annualized.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 2 billion annualized in this quarter, and you expect it to be &#x2013; to continue to increase or to be 2 billion at an annual rate during 2009. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, it should level out. In other words, there's going to be a point at which it begins to pick up and then it normalizes then flattens out. But as I said, that's not something I've looked at, so we'll have to get back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. My question has to do with the operating expense run rate. It looked like taking this quarter's operating expense run rate and annualizing it, you're already a little bit below your full year run rate target in the low &#x2013; you're at the 48 to 49 billion range annualized this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adjusted, it would be 49.2, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yet this obviously seems like a quarter especially with the trading revenue where your revenue performance might have come in a little bit higher than expected. So I'm looking for you to rationalize that a bit. Should we expect expenses to potentially go up in future quarters from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you heard me say was that we had established a goal of 50 to 52. I said we were hoping to bring it in at the lower end of that. So frankly we have 800 million of hedge in it, if you will. We're obviously very focused on expenses. We're going to try and get them to be as reasonable as they can, consistent with not starving the businesses or our employees. But we're certainly aiming to do better than 50. Whether we do or not, I'm not sure, but that is our goal as I had suggested.</p>
          <p>The one thing I do know that in one respect we can control is expenses. What we can't, what we have some influence over but no ultimate control is revenues, and that's where we're very intently focused to make sure that we can sustain the revenue momentum. But to your point, and this may be the ultimate import of it, Vikram had said that we're very much interested, not surprisingly, in generating the strongest operating margin we can so that we're in a position to absorb the inevitable credit losses that will flow through. In this quarter, if you look at it on a reported basis, our operating margin was 12.7 billion. That obviously put us in a position to absorb 10.3 billion in credit losses in the report net income. The challenge for us going forward is to make sure that we have an operating margin, revenues versus expenses, that is adequate to deal with what inevitably are going to be losses during the course of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we think about the current quarter as I guess I would have thought maybe there would have been a little bit higher expense rate because &#x2013; related to incentive compensation because of the strong trading revenue and some of the strong banking results. Is there any way to think about that from an incentive comp accrual standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can think about it as one quarter. Not to be flip about it, but at the end of the day as you know, we don't pay based on the quarter. We pay based on the year. Clearly, we have room to go up on the incentive comp front. Having said that, it was one quarter.</p>

          <p>Regarding the press, you have the three buckets, the government, the privates, and the publics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you did consider or reconsider the idea of raising the strike price to let's say 4.50, you'd cut the dilution on your equity by about 6%, and it wouldn't affect the probability of getting your TCE up to $81 billion. So considering that, I don't really understand why you wouldn't do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have certainly considered that dynamic. As you know, we have agreements with the privates, and we have an agreement with the government at 3.25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the fact is that that leaves the 15 billion of public. Having considered the pros and cons as you suggest, I'd stand by the earlier statement which is at this stage, we can't envision changing either the stock price or the conversion ratio, understanding your point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What's the downside for doing that &#x2013; sorry, for not increasing the strike price?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we have an agreement with the privates. We have an agreement with the government.

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vivek, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions following on the &#x2013; following up on the preferred.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things, when you talked about &#x2013; your balance sheet still needs to shrink. How should we think about that, Ned? Is there room to do that further? Are there plans to do that for one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vivek, as you know, I think if I looked at it, this is just rough numbers. GAAP assets I think shrank 120 billion on a linked quarter basis, if I'm not mistaken. And risk assets, as you know, were up marginally, but that was because of the consolidation of the credit card trusts.</p>
          <p>When I think about the balance sheet, and I think Vikram has been clear about this, we've been focused since he arrived on trying to reduce legacy assets. We're still very much focused on that. As you can see from that chart on page six or seven or whatever it is, we still have 101 billion of key risk assets, 29 billion of which are now in mark-to-market. Having said that, over time we would clearly like to exit some of those assets given the losses that they've generated in the past and our interest in reducing the risk profile.</p>
          <p>The second piece is that we put a bunch of assets into Holdings, as you know, which as I went through before, we've described as the objective being either to optimize, manage, or wind down. There are substantial parts of the assets in Holdings that we have described as special assets that we'd be interested in winding down. So if you ask me to just project out over the future and not netting any growth, which obviously we would inevitably hope to have, I think it's still fair to say that there are hundreds of billions of assets that we would think about exiting over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then, Ned, looking at the backstop assets, are you going to continue to build reserves for those until you get to your $29 billion amount that you have to bear? Or you talked about in previous quarters about the fact that when you announced this backstop agreement that nothing was going to change. Is that still the plan so that's part of your reserve build that's going in there, or is anything changing on that, in that bucket?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is nothing changing. Vivek, as you know, as I think I said earlier, the losses there are flowing through as well, so obviously the reserves to the extent that there are losses associated with that would flow through. So to the extent we have losses in the first quarter, essentially they showed up in the numbers that you see. So they are not any more insulated than as a construct in terms of the government insurance program. They're still part of our balance sheet and we're still treating them as if &#x2013; accordingly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of net charge-offs, Ned, can you give us a little more color in terms of on your home equity portfolios, what you're seeing as you think about first mortgage versus second mortgage? You've given us some breakout in the appendices. But as you look out, any sense of where you expect them to peak at this point given that unemployment has risen so sharply in the last six months and particularly in the last three months, where do you think you're headed to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we see them headed up; there's no question about that. Having said that in that respect, your guess is probably as good as mine in terms of predicting what's likely to happen. I think it's probably fair to say that we think the housing price decline hopefully is going to bottom out here at some point, which presumably as you know is probably the biggest factor driving the seconds just in terms of home values and so forth. But I don't know that we've seen much to choose frankly between the two. In other words, there have obviously been defaults in non-performers with respect to primaries and seconds, and I think it's just part of the generalized environment in terms of unemployment and falling home prices.</p>
          <p>I wish I could predict where they're going to end up. We certainly hope they're going to moderate. But having said that, we're not confused by the fact that they may very well deteriorate over the coming quarters. As I said, we're hoping by the end of the year, we might be in a position to see some daylight and to begin to reduce reserve builds that otherwise we were going to incur during the first part of the year, but that's the wild card. I think it's the wild card that everybody faces, and that's why we're as intent as we are in trying to generate that operating margin that I described earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the second mortgages, the net charge-offs on the over-90 bucket, you've given us the DPD, any sense of where the net charge-offs were on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the seconds, I don't know, but we could probably get back to you on that. I don't know off the top of my head.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Again with regard to the preferred exchange, you stated that you are delaying to allow the preferred holders to digest the stress test results. Is it fair to say that this factor alone is 100% responsible for your decision to delay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; I missed the last part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that you were delaying to allow pref holders to digest the stress test.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I said that, but in any event go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say that this factor alone is 100% responsible for your decision to delay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I described what was 100% responsible for my decision to delay, which was that irrespective of the outcome of the stress test, which I've been careful not to comment on, that's going to be information that's relevant not just to preferred holders but presumably to the market as a whole. And as a result, we thought the sensible thing to do was to wait to launch the offer until we had the results of the test. It's no more complicated than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so there were no other factors then involved in deciding to delay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and the reason I say that with some confidence is that I'm the one that came up with the idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, you mentioned that the company discussed whether to change the strike but decided not to or considered or floated the idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were no active discussions of it. The fact is not surprisingly that's one of the factors that you would look at given what has happened to the stock price. We had pre-existing agreements. Obviously, we have thought about it. We have concluded as I said we can envision circumstances under which we would change it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, do you think it's conceivable that the preferred offer would be cancelled at any point?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Michael Schwartz with Redwood Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a question about the Geithner plan and whether you guys are going to partake in the PPIP [Public-Private Investment Partnership].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I think two things. One is, as I think Vikram has said, we applaud the government's effort and the Treasury Department's in particular to support the banking system and the economy. I've actually been through the PPIP plan in some detail. I can't say that I've done it in the past week or so. But certainly when it came out, I went through it. As you know, there are an awful lot of details to emerge with respect to the PPIP, which as you know the market has been very much focused on.</p>
          <p>We're going to follow it closely as it evolves. One of the critical issues is going to be whether it makes economic sense given how that program is structured, given the amount of leverage provided, given the market tenor at that stage, as to whether it makes sense for us economically to participate. That's how we plan to analyze it in terms of thinking whether it makes sense to do it or not.</p>
          <p>The one thing that I would point out which you're acutely aware of is that we do have this $300 billion ring fence, which we paid the government $7 billion for in terms of protecting the tail on those assets. It's perfectly conceivable that that might affect our analysis at least with respect to that 300 billion, whether we were to participate or not. But I think the basic message not surprisingly is we're watching it closely. We think it's an interesting idea conceptually. There are a lot of details that will be forthcoming that we'll have to analyze in the context of what makes sense economically for us at the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And I have one follow-up question about the timing of the exchange offer for the preferreds. How many days after the stress test is out there will you think it's enough before you launch the deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My own judgment at this stage and Lord knows I have been wrong in the past, is that it should not be many. Having said that, there will be some logistical issues around crossing T's and dotting I's, not only with the commission, but with respect to the disclosure, if any, that is necessary. But we would expect it to be forthcoming shortly after.</p>
