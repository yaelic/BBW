          <p>Good morning. My name is David, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Teleconference.</p>
          <p>Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; and Head of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Patrick Olson.</p>
          <p>All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Mr. Olson, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining BlackRock's fourth quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I want to point out that during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We called your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports which list some of the factors which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements. Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann Marie to discuss our financial results. Ann Marie?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I know it's a busy earnings morning out there today. I want to take you through the financial results for the quarter and the full year which were quite positive given the extraordinary global market volatility.</p>
          <p>BlackRock delivered strong financial results this year with full-year EPS up 8%. This performance highlights the strength of the company, the breadth of our product set and our global footprint. Combined with our risk tools, these strengths uniquely position us to meet the diverse needs of clients in this challenging environment.</p>
          <p>While flows for the quarter were strong relative to the industry, we were not immune to the impact of the current markets on our revenue. Still, we maintained strong margins by balancing beta-driven revenue effects with expense management. We also took actions to position the business well going into 2012.</p>
          <p>The business generated operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year, allowing us to fund a large return of cash to shareholders. This includes the repurchase of 618,000 shares costing about $100 million in the fourth quarter. Larry's going to be talking more about the market environment generally and our focus areas for 2012.</p>
          <p>The key takeaway for me is that in the turbulent markets we've been seeing, BlackRock demonstrated that our product and geographic diversification is working. We are built to help clients in markets like these, and we can perform well despite global headwinds and macro uncertainties.</p>
          <p>With that, let me quickly walk you through the results. As I make my comments, I'll be referring to the supplement. You can find it on our website. And as usual, I'll be talking about primarily as adjusted results.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide one of the supplement, we announced full-year earnings of $11.85, again, reflecting a year-over-year growth in EPS of 8%. This was driven by a 7% increase in operating earnings and supported by our share buyback activity. Operating earnings growth was driven by both revenue growth and margin improvement.</p>
          <p>On slide two, you can see that our full-year operating margin improved from 39.3% in 2010 to 39.7% in 2011, and this margin improvement despite, again, the market environment. Our compensation to revenue ratio of 34.7% was consistent with 2010 which was 34.8%, and really the range we've been running in for the last several years of 35%. So, nothing's changed there.</p>
          <p>Slide three shows the extent of market volatility in the fourth quarter. Given the majority of our equity assets priced daily, focusing on average rather than period end markets, U.S. markets fared relatively well, ending the year with a strong recovery. But world markets, emerging markets, energy and mining fared poorly, driven in part by European uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Compared to prior periods, world markets were down around 5%, and emerging markets were down in the double digits. Volatility and global market declines affected investors' sentiment. And since about half of our equity AUM is tied to non-U.S. markets, this obviously impacted our revenues. We generated business that buffers some of these market effects as we saw net new business, clients favored index, EPS and multi-asset products in the face of this uncertainty. These products saw inflows in what was otherwise generally a negative flow environment.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to walk through a comparison of fourth quarter results compared to a year ago, then discuss our results compared to the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>On slide five, you can see that earnings per share of $3.06 included $3.14 of operating earnings and $0.08 of non-operating expense. EPS was negatively impacted by lower performance fees but benefited from our share repurchase program. While we've recorded positive marks on our investment portfolio, the marks were just not as positive as a year ago. The fourth quarter as adjusted tax rate was 32%. We've been running in this area for the last few quarters. All things being equal, I think this is a reasonable rate to think about as we enter 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six, year-over-year operating earnings of $841 million reflected revenue diversity, organic growth and expense control partially offsetting the market-related effects on revenues.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, you can see how our business model benefits from diverse revenue sources. Fourth quarter revenues were $2.2 billion. This includes $1.9 billion of base fees, $147 million of performance fees and a record $149 million of BRS revenues. In the fourth quarter, we generated $364 million of revenue. That's 16% of the total from sources other than base fees. In 2011, we benefited from increases in revenue across numerous sources that included a full-year $72 million increase in sec lending revenue &#x2013; that's a 22% year-over-year increase &#x2013; and a $50 million increase in BRS revenues, an 11% year-over-year increase. So, you can see we have components of revenues growing at double-digit rates.</p>
          <p>Almost 60% of our hedge funds outperformed the relative HFRI indices over the past 12 months. Despite that fact, fourth quarter performance fees of $147 million were down $179 million compared to a year ago. As with many hedge funds across the industry, several of our own hedge funds ended the year below high-water marks.</p>
          <p>Our performance varies by fund, but as we begin 2012, the gap to high-water marks for the funds that have been our most material performance fee drivers are only below high-water marks in the low-single digits. So, while performance was down, this feels much different and much better than 2008. At the same time, we continued to benefit from strong performance on our traditional products where we generated $100 million of performance fees in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues reached a record high for the quarter of $149 million as well as a full-year record high. Growth continued in our core Aladdin business as clients sought out sophisticated tools to manage risk in the face of volatility. The revenues also reflect the completion of a major advisory assignment in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On a full-year basis, nearly 80% of the growth in BRS revenues came from ongoing Aladdin assignments which will continue to benefit revenue base in 2012 and beyond because these are  very long-lived relationships. Much of the growth came from international clients and that's transforming BRS from a predominantly U.S. business to one which is truly global.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter base fees of $1.9 billion as you can see on slide eight are down $88 million from 2010. This primarily reflects the volatile and negative world equity markets. The decline in our equity-related revenues was offset partially by flight of new business into ETFs and other index products, as well as the flows into multi-asset class products.</p>
          <p>The diversity of our long-dated offerings across active and passive products serving multiple client types and multiple regions is one of our key strengths that helps us maintain strong revenues relative to the challenging external environment. Compared to a year ago, we also saw the revenue effect of the exit from low-yielding cash products. So, we did see some reversal of that trend with clients coming back into cash products in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide nine, you can see that our expense controls contributed to a 9% decrease in as adjusted expenses which totaled $1.4 billion, as well as contributed to our strong margin. We reported a $32 million one-time charge in the fourth quarter related to several restructuring opportunities that will benefit us beginning this year. These opportunities were associated primarily with the continued integration of iShares, a more global integrated approach to marketing and additional efficiencies in technology and operations associated with further progress towards a single, global operating platform. We excluded this charge from as adjusted results.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we continue to invest in our business. We added net over 900 people to the firm in 2011. Just last week, we announced the acquisition of a Canadian ETF platform, and we continue our commitment to our brand. These are all things Larry's going to talk more about. These are important investments for the long term.</p>
          <p>Moving on to sequential quarter results, operating results were relatively stable, which I know everyone really focuses on how we're doing sequentially while non-operating results benefited from the favorable movements in markets right at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, you can see sequentially EPS improved by $0.23. That included $0.21 associated with improved marks on our co- and seed investments. And I'll talk a little bit more about non-operating in a minute.</p>
          <p>Stable operating income of $841 million, seen on slide 12, was supported by stability in revenues and stability in expenses.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 13, a $56 million increase in performance fees and a $32 million increase in BRS revenues were offset by market-related decreases in base fees which you can see on slide 14.</p>
          <p>The pressure on base fees related to the effect of unfavorable markets on equity and AUM which overwhelmed what was really a good quarter for strong net new business. As I mentioned earlier, we've continued our expense discipline. As you can see on slide 15, expenses were stable across most categories. Expenses did include in the quarter $8 million of fund launch costs associated with the $300 million closed-end fund investing in utilities and infrastructure; I think a good example of the type of income-oriented products we're trying to offer our clients.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 shows non-operating expense of $21 million, which included $18 million of positive marks primarily on our co-investments and private equity. On a full-year basis, our marks were positive $26 million, and net interest expense for the quarter has been stable. The value of the investment portfolio was up about 10% this quarter, closed the year at about $1.2 billion or $1.1 billion when you exclude investments that represent hedges or which were hedged.</p>
          <p>The growth relative to prior quarter related primary to the seeding of several new retail alternative products, all of them, we think, important opportunities for our clients. And just to give you the examples, there was a long/short credit fund, a commodity fund and a renminbi bond fund. As a reminder, we've got no proprietary investments. We invest alongside our clients. We seed new product as required for the base business. Our investments are aligned with the interest of our clients.</p>
          <p>Really, when you think of our whole business model, our revenues and business are predicated on acting as fiduciaries on behalf of our clients, and we receive a fee for providing those services. So we're not a balance sheet company. In fact, when we look at our entire balance sheet, it is really small. We have less than $8 billion of economic tangible assets on the balance sheet. And when you look at what these are, its cash of over $3 billion, $2 billion of receivables, and the $1 billion portfolio we just talked about.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 18, our operating cash flow was about $2.7 billion last year, up about $100 million from 2010. And as I mentioned previously, we continued our share repurchase of 618,000 shares in the fourth quarter. Our full-year payout ratio was 48%, and that included both our dividend and our core repurchase. When you include our repurchase of BankAmerica's ownership stake, our payout ratio was 157%.</p>
          <p>We still have 3.6 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that our cash flow generation allows us ample opportunity to reward shareholders consistently.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, despite volatile markets, we delivered a healthy margin, generated substantial cash flow and returned a large amount of cash to shareholders. Looking ahead, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we have to work with our clients in 2012 and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue helping them navigate this challenging environment.</p>
          <p>We've entered the year more confident than ever in our business model and are intensely focused on executing the growth opportunities we see across our business.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Larry who will discuss the market environment, what we're seeing with our clients, and the ideas and products that can help them navigate the current market.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Ann Marie. Happy New Year to everyone. I'm going to have a little more exhaustive review of the world today, and I'll try to put that in the context of BlackRock and try to describe from our vantage point what our clients are seeing and what type of questions they're asking us.</p>
          <p>Let me just review really quickly 2011 which I think by any course of the imagination, it was a challenging market environment for a lot of people. We have the sovereign credit crisis in the &#x2013; in Europe, destabilization of the Middle East, continued economic uncertainty worldwide, renewed economic uncertainty in the emerging market area, a lot of tragedy in Japan with the tsunami and the earthquake, and the United States politically disappointing us in terms of the deficit ceilings, and the persistent problems of unemployment in the United States, a persistent problem in housing in the United States, and by any long-term measure, muted growth.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, for 2012, it's not going to get that much better economically. And yet, I'm quite bullish as I was in 2011 on the direction of the global equity markets. But 2012 will represent a continuation of volatility. We have a very important election in France. I don't think the market appreciates the importance of that election. From my vantage point, if Sarkozy does lose an election, it would move obviously France more to the left, and I don't under &#x2013; I have a hard time understanding the union between France and Germany in that circumstance.</p>
          <p>And so, I think we have more political uncertainty in Europe than we normally do on top of all this economic uncertainty. Obviously, in our country, in the United States, we have another election which is going to lead to a lot of political gridlock and greater uncertainty.</p>
          <p>We have leadership changes in the latter part of this year in China, which could lead to different policy changes. We have threats from Iran, continued unrest in the Middle East and continued sovereign debt crisis in Europe. We will persistently have a muted housing market. I still think it's going to have another two years to truly stabilize housing in America. We continue to have an unsustainable level of deficits in this country. And we continue to have muted growth.</p>
          <p>So, markets are going to be influenced a lot by these events driven by government and politics. Yet, at the same time, balance sheets are improving worldwide. Corporations in the United States and many cases in Europe have never been stronger. Cash balances have never been bigger. And the amount of de-risking that has been done worldwide leads me to have, despite all this uncertainty, a more positive overview.</p>
          <p>And one of the big challenges for all investors worldwide is to stop looking at the blogs, the immediacy of news and focus on long-term challenges and how to manage your long-term liabilities over those long-term challenges. This is not being done as much as it should be. This is why we've seen such a de-risking. But it is my belief for those investors who have the ability to overcome the challenges of the short-term news events and start focusing on their own internal challenges and their own internal liabilities and trying to design portfolios and returns that will navigate higher returns over 5- and 10-year cycles. Those investors are going to be benefited much more than those who were continuing to focus on the immediacy of the moment.</p>
          <p>And so, I believe, overall, we are going to have a positive trending market over the course of 2012. And yet, there's going to be a lot of volatility within that time. It is very &#x2013; it is not surprising to me that watching how Europe has stabilized at the same time that you're seeing the ECB do their own form of quantitative easing, and they can do that through a three-year term debt repo which is giving a lot of purchasing power, not unlike what happened in the United States when our Federal Reserve did the quantitative easing. So, you're starting to see aggressive options now in sovereign credits in Europe. Let's hope those continue. But this is as a result of the ECB actions. And I don't believe the ECB has been given enough credit for their actions.</p>
          <p>Mario Draghi also has one more major tool in his tool kit that our Federal Reserve does not have, short-term rates in Europe are 1%. So, there's a great opportunity if necessary to lower rates also in Europe to produce a more steep yield curve which will invent &#x2013; ultimately create better opportunities in buying longer-term credit.</p>
          <p>So, I think we're going to have this mix-and-match going forward in 2012 but I have, like I did in 2011, a bias towards focusing on long-term investing.</p>
          <p>These challenges, though, really create real difficulties for a lot of our investors, and I'm pleased to say BlackRock is well-positioned to work with our clients. And I'm not just talking about institutional clients. I'm not talking about just U.S. clients but global institutional clients, our retail clients are all looking for advice. Most investors in the pension funds are looking for a lot, returns of 7%-plus. Very hard to achieve that when you own bonds that are yielding 2%.</p>
          <p>And so, the dialogs we need to have with our investors are very different than the dialogs we had five and seven and 10 years ago when you had significant opportunities in yield and bonds to make those type of returns. Dialogs today require talking about many more aspects of investing today. And no firm in the world is as well-positioned to have that more complete dialog talking to our investors' challenges.</p>
          <p>Earlier or late last year, we did have an institutional conference with our clients. And the theme of the conference was investors are &#x2013; no longer have the ability to find low-hanging fruit. But they're going to have to spend more time in finding that high-hanging fruit. And I think that's going to be the theme for 2012.</p>
          <p>The other big issue, and no one else has this platform, clients have to spend more time focusing on their own specific solutions. And the way we are positioned &#x2013; and I'm going to talk about some of the major themes for 2012, how we're positioning to help our clients on the solutions. But I just need to also as I do every time we talk about it, is the overlay of what our BlackRock Solutions Risk Management Aladdin platform allows us to do in navigating these types of solution-based conversations with our clients.</p>
          <p>So, if I had to just reflect on the fourth quarter as we think about now going into 2012, the diversity of our business model has substantially dampened the impact of volatile markets. Ann Marie spoke about the growth of the solutions, the beta products versus alpha products. And I'm going to go into more granular detail about defined contribution, about multi-asset strategies.</p>
          <p>But it's the diversity of products that is allowing us to have more complex conversation with clients, more stable earnings and a more powerful future, especially in this low-rate environment that I don't believe people truly understand the impact on many asset managers, the impact on our clients of this persistent low-rate environment.</p>
          <p>So, let me talk about our growth areas for 2012 in these uncertain markets that I just discussed. Also, I have to overlay not just this uncertain market as we enter 2012, we are going to have a persistent issue related to the aging populations worldwide and the need for better retirement solutions. It's interesting for me to watch the global dialog of the U.S. and Europe about deficits. And yet there's such a small dialog about retirement. It is my opinion the retirement crisis or the lack of monies necessary to meet our aging population and our &#x2013; and a population worldwide that's going to live longer. The biggest crisis is not just going to be a sovereign credit crisis. But the biggest crisis we're going to face in the coming years is a retirement crisis, having the appropriateness of money to live the lifestyle that you're accustomed to during your retirement ages. This is not being discussed. This is a severe issue. And the persistence of low rates aggravate the problem much greater.</p>
          <p>So, with those ideas, I want to talk about where we believe for BlackRock are five key opportunities for making, obviously, our clients in a better position but in doing so, obviously, making BlackRock a better stock to own.</p>
          <p>Part one, we do believe very strongly as people start looking at risk budgeting. The use of indexing in ETFs becomes a larger component of your framework, and we are very much a part of that dialog despite some negative flows in alpha products which was industry-wide. We benefited as a firm because of our strong position in the beta products, both in the index funds and the ETF products. We believe this will carry on.</p>
          <p>And when you think about risk budgeting, we believe &#x2013; and we just started seeing the trend. We're going to see more and more investors move out of active types of strategies and some &#x2013; and some, not all, fixed income strategies to go into more indexing. We believe they're going to see as a result of it, more of a barbelling. A lot of investors and fixed income  go into the high yield area, maybe the bank loan area. There's great opportunities in other products like munis. They're obviously going to go into emerging market debt.</p>
          <p>But in terms of treasuries and maybe mortgages, you're going to see a lot more need in the risk-budgeting component, indexation or ETFs. And then you're going to allow these institutions to start thinking about taking greater alpha risk in other products, whether it is high yield or any other types of yielding product. And it may mean a greater allocation which will be the first time in many years and back into equities in the form of dividends, stocks and other things like that.</p>
          <p>Our first position is indexing and ETFs. Our second area of growth for 2012 and beyond, as we have been investing aggressively, as Ann Marie spoke about, and that is alternatives, where we believe clients are going to use indexing or ETFs at one side of the barbell, and they're going to be more aggressive in terms of alternatives. We expect the alternative paydays to start coming out as we are building more and more teams, and we will continue to build out more and more products and teams in the various alternative space. We are in the markets right now in many types of products, whether it's alternative energy, private equity and other forms of alternative space. We are in the market of raising money right now.</p>
          <p>But I would also say we see great opportunities in many alpha products at BlackRock. We had outflows in our scientific-active equity area last year, but our performance was great. The dialog with our clients is beginning to have a turnaround, and we think we will see by the end of 2012 inflows into this product. As I mentioned earlier before, we are continuing to have great dialog about high yield. Emerging market debt, today we won a very important assignment today, at about $350 million in emerging market debt fund. So, we are starting to see clients start navigating, and not just in alternatives, but in other types of what I would call higher-alpha opportunity, long-holding products. We are seeing clients focus on model-driven fixed income. We are seeing clients saying after a lot of negative noise early last year, the clients who entered the muni market last year had some of the great returns of anyone as we witnessed state and local governments navigating down their deficit issues and becoming a little more responsible. And the muni market responded very, very nicely on that. So, we are seeing not just opportunities in the beta products but then also in the specialized alpha products, which leads me to our multi-asset strategy solution.</p>
          <p>More and more clients are looking for more of a fiduciary relationship with firms like BlackRock. Other firms are participating very nicely in this. But clients are coming to us who are more &#x2013; they're looking for more complete solutions. They're looking for a more complex, more comprehensive relationship with us. And most importantly, they're looking for a deeper dialogue. And in the fourth quarter, when I go over some of the highlights of some of the wins, this is an area that we're continuing to see growth. We're continuing to add more employees in this area and building a broader depth of people.</p>
          <p>The third area is &#x2013; excuse me, the fourth area is retirement and income. As I said, I can't think of a more important area that we all have to focus on. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon. This is going to be a worldwide phenomenon. Aging population worldwide is creating much greater need for better retirement solutions. And I think at BlackRock, we are trying to navigate products into these solutions. We're showing up more and more of the defined contribution business where we added $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter of net new business. And we added $31 billion of net new assets in our DC business for the year, which represented for us about a 10% organic growth area in this area.</p>
          <p>And as I think I said in other quarterly earnings, there's only less than a dozen firms that are in this area of defined contribution. And so, we're seeing seismic changes in the asset management business. Defined contribution &#x2013; movement out of defined benefit into defined contribution is a very good example of that. Obviously, the movement out of active into indexing is another good example. The utilization of ETFs is another good example.</p>
          <p>The fifth area that we're focusing as a theme for 2012 is income. Investors worldwide have to rethink about income in this low-rate, volatile environment. Clients are looking for more products that can provide  obviously, less volatility in fewer equities. But they are &#x2013; but they can't afford to own bonds yielding 2%. And so, they are looking for solutions that, as I've discussed before, that may have high-yield elements to it and may have preferred stock, preferred bond elements to it. And most importantly, it's going to be heavily oriented towards dividend stocks that have lower beta tracking than the normal equity markets.</p>
          <p>But once again, to have a dialog with our clients about these products, perhaps showing how these types of products can have low track &#x2013; lower beta than the market but higher return than bonds requires a comprehensive dialog with our clients.</p>
          <p>Let me just overlay all that, as I said earlier, which differentiates us and that's BlackRock Solutions which clearly had an exceptional year and quarter. The momentum into 2012 continues. As Ann Marie spoke about it, this was predominantly a U.S. business that is becoming a very global business for us.</p>
          <p>This year we expanded, as I said in Europe and Asia. We added two more Aladdin clients in Japan. We saw a huge increase in our advisory relationships and assignments in Europe to work with governments and financial institutions, navigate their circumstances. And we reach now in terms of the Aladdin system utilization, we now have $10.2 trillion onto our risk analytic platform that we help clients in navigating risk. Our pipeline for Aladdin and Aladdin implementation has never been stronger. We are only weakened in that platform because of the utilization of people and time. And I believe 2012 will be even more robust for us than 2011.</p>
          <p>Before I go into some specific details, I also have to just say our number one responsibility is producing returns. And that's true for tracking error in our beta products where we exhibited some very weak tracking error in one of our products in 2010. We turned that around, and we have very positive flows in our emerging market ETF product. We have to have very strong alpha where I would say in 2011, some of our products underperformed. Some of our products did very well. But overall, we did well.</p>
          <p>I am not happy with where we are. I want it to be even better than well in terms of the alpha products. We know our clients are not just hiring us for advice. They're hiring us for performance, and every client and every employee understands that.</p>
          <p>In 2011, to build this momentum, we're continuing to invest in our people and our brand. Going into 2012, we are going to build our brand awareness worldwide. It'll be a major strategic effort for us, and as Ann Marie discussed as a statement of growth, we added close to 900 people worldwide as we continue to build on our platform.</p>
          <p>One other thing I wanted to just talk about the returning of value to our shareholders. Obviously 2011, we did quite a bit of that. It is my expectation that we are going to continue to use an enormous, large free cash flow combination of dividends, stock repurchases, and a little later I'll talk about some possible M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let me go into the details of the different products really quickly, and then we'll open up for questions because I know a lot of you are going to jump off and get onto the other institutions who had calls today. Overall, in the ETF market, our iShares product really picked up momentum from, I would say, a slow start in the first quarter to a very strong finish.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased to say that our flows into 2012 continue to be quite aggressive where we are already year-to-date in our ETF products, have close to $4.4 billion of new flows into our products. For the year, last year we had about $53 billion of flows, and it really picked up a lot of the momentum in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to say that we recaptured the number one share in net flows in the United States where, as I said earlier in the year, we really did not do as well as we expected. I think I said in our last third quarter report that I expected much more from our team and we are starting to see that.</p>
          <p>And we continue to have a large international dominance in our ETF platform worldwide. We continue to try to build that dominance. As Ann Marie announced &#x2013; noted, that we did buy Claymore Securities, an ETF platform in Canada. And while that was important for us because we have a huge market in Canada right now and we're very happy with our position in Canada,</p>
          <p>our presence in Canada was predominantly institutional. Claymore has a very strong retail presence where we did not have that type of strong presence. They had some very strong products like the Canadian dollar gold fund. Very simplistic products and it's those simplistic products that are the best. So, I don't mean that in a negative way. I mean that in a very positive way. And so, it really fit very nicely into our product mix and our client profile mix. And so, we look forward to doing that and I do believe, just as a footnote, there are going to be many more opportunities for us to fill in our ETF presence worldwide if and when other companies come up for sale.</p>
          <p>On the retail side, I'm particularly pleased with our North American results in 2011. And I think we're in a very good position for 2012. As I discussed earlier, we picked up market share in U.S. retail. There were huge outflows in the U.S. mutual fund business, ex. ETFs, and we had inflows.</p>
          <p>I unfortunately believe you're going to continue to see outflows in traditional and mutual funds in the United States as clients are trying to diversify and look for different products. But this trend is not going to be arrested anytime soon in the industry, and I do believe BlackRock will continue to take net market share. As I said over the last few years, this is a big priority for us to continue to build out our presence in the U.S. mutual fund business.</p>
          <p>When I spoke about one of our priorities in 2012, to continue to build our brand and put a big effort, we believe it's really important for us as we build out our presence in U.S. and international retail that our brand presence has to be a much stronger result.</p>
          <p>In international retail, however, we had outflows like the industry. And it's a function of the massive de-risking that is going on in Europe. We're sitting here thinking about how difficult Europe is. Imagine if you're sitting there with your pension fund sitting in some form of a long-term investment, many people have capitulated and frozen, and the whole industry have seen, most recently, outflows in international retail.</p>
          <p>And most of this money is just sitting in cash. And so, it's not like this money is running away and permanently gone. People are looking for greater stability to get back into the marketplace. At the moment though, I don't see a turnaround in any short period of time in international retail or in industry. It's going to &#x2013; it will continue to have what I would call mediocre flows until we see more stability in the continent.</p>
          <p>Institutionally, same idea. As we have all this uncertainty and the persistence of low rates, we're seeing more and more institutions de-risk. And they de-risk in the form of moving from active to passive. Fortunately, our business model allows us to take advantage of that, and I believe we are going to continue to take advantage of that. It is our hope as we continue to build out our alternative products, we will continue to benefit from that and we will see that. So, in the fourth quarter, in institutional, we did have positive flows in our index products. And I must say we are continuing to see clients seeking probably more passive strategies on the institutional side.</p>
          <p>I do believe, like we've seen in many other years, this reminds me of the first quarter of '09, when we discussed to all of you at the end of what happened with '08 how clients capitulated, clients paused, clients looked for advice. And then, starting the second and third quarter, we started seeing clients doing much more active strategies. I do believe that will be the same process, and I can tell you the types of conversations we're having with investors now in the first quarter are much more dynamic than we had last year. And clients are looking for this solution-based relationship.</p>
          <p>So, I'm very pleased about how we are being positioned. But I don't want to say that we are seeing a massive turnaround in behavior from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. But this is the time pension funds, retirement funds, endowments, insurance companies ask themselves how are they going to position themselves in the future. They will be going to their respective boards and talking about strategies, risk budgeting, and that's where we're having a dialog, and I believe we're playing a bigger role in helping our clients play that role. So, I am looking here to be that &#x2013; I look to the same themes that we saw in '09 on the institutional side.</p>
          <p>Let me just talk &#x2013; touch on a few things and it's getting time to open it up for questions. As I said earlier, our defined contribution business continued to be strong with about 6 &#x2013; over $6 billion of inflows in the quarter. Our multi-asset strategy, once again, the solution-based stuff that I'm talking about, we had $3.2 billion of net new business, and clients are looking for more customized solutions.</p>
          <p>One of the good, creative products we created last year, and I think I mentioned it in the third quarter, and this is a product that we did a wrapper using annuity products in some of our glide path products with MetLife. We launched this product in May, and we continue to generate strong inflows. This is something that we budgeted, about a $1 billion product. We are now at $2.4 billion in size, of which $1.1 billion was raised in the fourth quarter alone. So, when you're innovative, when you've designed products that fit the client's needs, we see the benefits.</p>
          <p>In terms of alternatives, we had outflows in a product that was more currency and commodity-based and that we're going to see big inflows and outflows that was more currency overlay-type of product. But we've continued to have more dialog with more investors worldwide in our alternative products &#x2013; Ann Marie talked about some of the performance and stuff &#x2013; than we've ever had before. And we believe we're going to see real inflows in 2012 as we used 2011 as the year in really building these products.</p>
          <p>In cash, we've seen &#x2013; in the fourth quarter, we saw inflows for the first time in, I think, six quarters. And we'll see where the cash management business goes in this low-rate environment. But the one thing that I could say related to cash management that's somewhat connected, that's in security lending. That produced some very good returns for us and our clients in 2012, especially in the fourth quarter. We're seeing more hedge funds, looking to utilize stocks again, especially in the fourth quarter. And so, now, if I could talk about cash management for a second, that was a very big, pleasant surprise for us. And we continue to see utilization rates going up. And there is a &#x2013; despite how low rates are, there is a steep yield curve between 1-day and 90-day money. And so, that's been helpful.</p>
          <p>On the BlackRock Advisory business where we are advising money for large clients, some of our very well-known clients, we continue to be &#x2013; and I'm pleased to say, we're continuing to liquidate some of these portfolios as our clients are achieving the objectives they needed to achieve in terms of giving us these advisory assignments.  And now, they're starting to wind these down. So, we're going to continue to see that side of our AUM going down. As you know, this is a very, very low-fee basis. We are very pleased with the role that we have played in some of these large-scale public advisory assignments.  And I do believe when there's a need for us to play those roles, we will be back playing those roles again.</p>
          <p>Let me just touch on two other things. That's the M&amp;A environment. I have never seen a more asymmetric market, massive sellers in the asset management business. Obviously, the trends are very hostile for a lot of asset managers. And two, you're seeing because of Basel III and capital in these  many institutions that are affiliated with financial institutions that are looking to decouple their asset management businesses.</p>
          <p>As I said in the third quarter, and I'll say it again, we are not looking at any large platform purchase at all worldwide. There's rumors that we are involved in some large-scale platforms. I will deny that now. We are not. But we are very active in looking at fill-in products. We see some very unique opportunities now. And we are very excited about the opportunities we will have in terms of fill-in products, either an end product or a fill-in in country. And we are in the presence of some active dialogs right now. But they're not these large-scale platforms. And we do not believe those will be fitting for BlackRock. And so, I'll leave it at that related to M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The regulatory environment will be upon us sometime this year. We still have &#x2013; this is very fluid. This will impact all of us in financial institution land. It will have an impact on our clients. It will have an impact on BlackRock and other things. So, we will see how all this plays out. We were very excited about the CFTC announcement and vote last week. This is a great example whereby a regulator did the right thing for investors in assurance that we're going to have segregation of our collateral. So, when people talk about regulation, some regulation is good for all of us. And I will be &#x2013; we'll be very out front in regulation, making sure that in the regulation, as it's being formulated, that it's good for our investors. And we will be vocal when it is. And so, they're a regulation that everyone should be proud of, that we are building a sounder, safer financial community. There is some regulation though that I'm not going to get into that I'm worried about and could have an impact on cost of doing business. And we will quietly discuss that with the regulators and how to minimize those costs to our clients.</p>
          <p>Overall, I would say 2011 was a good year. I'm very, very bullish on our positioning for 2012. I don't believe we have ever been in a position to take advantage of our business platform in dealing with clients in navigating these troubled marketplaces to give us a larger presence, a larger opportunity and obviously great growth opportunities for earnings for all of us, for all of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me open it for questions, and let me wish everyone a very healthy 2012.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&amp;A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think the one thing you didn't really talk about much in your prepared remarks was the pipeline this quarter which I think now for the second quarter in a row has declined. So, hoping that you could give us a little bit more detail on the sales cycle and what else contributed to that. Obviously there was some pass in inflows this quarter and maybe you can touch a little bit upon what the mix is in terms of the business that you're seeing that could come on line? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not purposely talk about the pipeline. Not that I'm trying to hide it, I'm trying to deemphasize it. As our business becomes more and more &#x2013; with more and more flows in retail, when we talk pipeline it was, A, it was  only institutional. It was &#x2013; because we have no pipeline retail. And so, we're trying to deemphasize how one thinks about it.</p>
          <p>Two, in the pipeline, there was a lot of noise related to indexing which confuses people. And so, we have &#x2013; we purposely did not discuss it. We are still seeing, as I said in my prepared remarks, a great deal of interest in index types of products. We are in more dialog with more clients, as I said, institutionally right now for strategies but there's nothing translating into a pipeline yet. So, the pipeline is about 50-odd billion dollars. And then you have this one outflow that we telegraphed in the third quarter which a client is insourcing a bunch of indexing product.</p>
          <p>But I don't think our pipeline, by the way, is any different in terms of the feel, in terms of the flows, that is announced, than it is any other times. It's just what we are witnessing now, the pipeline is a very noisy statistic. And so, that's why I did not discuss it in my prepared remarks. But we are not seeing any real massive change in the flow, in the style. But we are seeing it in the mix as you suggested. We continue to see more interest temporarily in index-like products. I talked about the $4.5 billion of flows in iShares year-to-date. I talked about we just won a $350 million flow in emerging fixed income today. So, we are seeing a large breath of inflows. We actually have a great pipeline in alternatives but obviously in the sheer number, that's quite small. And so, I don't think there's much tonality difference, Alex, than other quarters. It's just noisier because of the ins and outs of index business.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Then just real quick, one of the things that you highlighted for this year was the whole defined contribution &#x2013; retirement opportunity. Now there's some regulatory changes coming up on the DC side. I know you're not a big DC player in terms of record keeping or anything like that, but are there opportunities for you to capitalize on that? Do you think it's going to be a non-event, that it's really going to go...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We continue to pick up large &#x2013; I would say, we're benefiting from the consolidation of ETF &#x2013; excuse me, DC players. And related to the regulatory issues you discussed because we're investment-only, it's a big advantage for us. We're &#x2013; because we're investment-only, because we are &#x2013; we only manufacture and we don't compete with our distribution partners, we have advantages of working with many distribution platforms, and that has allowed us to continue to have, what I would say, double-digit growth rates for DC which we think we will continue to do this year.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, in terms of your capital, if you could maybe talk about what a targeted payout ratio between the dividends and buybacks, and then, obviously, bucketing in the talk around the fill-in products or potential acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Ann Marie talk about it for a second but let me just talk about dividend policy as I think about it. I think a dividend policy should hover between 40% and 50% payout ratio. I've said this for the last few years. We are not changing that. Depending on what we see in M&amp;A opportunities or what we design, the relative ability to buy stock back, we will navigate in that range. But we will continue to be active in stock repurchases.</p>
          <p>We continue to have growing cash flow, and I will continue to say I hate having a large balance sheet. I do not want to ever &#x2013; we will never compete with our clients. And so, the best thing for our investors is having a very active, constructive process of using our free cash flow for dividend, for stock repurchase, and if we see unique opportunities on the M&amp;A side, we will do it that way. I will not buy a company if I think stock repurchase is so much more superior. Obviously, we are a revenue growth story, so we're going to look for opportunities. And hopefully, we can find opportunities in companies where it is revenue-positive and accretive at the same time. And that's what we're going to continue to do.</p>
          <p>And so, Ann Marie, do you have any other commentary on this?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Then, I guess the follow-up on &#x2013; in terms of the head count reductions that were talked about for the fourth quarter and then I think there was also some commentary about ongoing focus to lower cost regions. I mean, how should we think about that with regards to 2012 expenses and potential margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have nothing &#x2013; we are &#x2013; the downsizing was done last year with the purpose of making sure we go into 2012 straight on. We have nothing in the plans in terms of any types of head count reduction, in terms of expenses. We are navigating our expenses very aggressively. We are &#x2013; we still have growth opportunities. We will still have some head count growth in 2012. And one should assume, as I said in other quarters, it is our intention &#x2013; and this is subject to markets and opportunities. We want to have margins above 40%. But it's going to be a balance over &#x2013; versus all these other issues. And maybe offline, Ann Marie could give you more color, or Patrick and team in terms of how we look at that.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Larry, I'm sort of curious. You sort of talked about the low rate backdrop and sort of the barbell on a couple different businesses and sort of trends overall, both U.S. and non-U.S. You mentioned earlier about sort of the share erosion for U.S. treasury and mutual fund companies. What do you think happens with the economics of the business? I mean will there be a sort of a collective reaction at some point in time to try and stunt some of the growth in the ETF business? Or how do you sort of see the pricing element of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would still say the majority, 75% of ETF growth is not cannibalizing mutual funds. I still think most of it is cannibalizing stock purchases, still a very institutional product, where as I said, cannibalizes stock purchases. I think the biggest culprit of mutual fund outflows in the U.S. was underperformance and just overall de-risking.</p>
          <p>So, I'm not &#x2013; but there's no question there's going to have to be some form of reckoning with the mutual fund industry if there's a persistent underperformance to really rebuild confidence with those managers. One should expect lower fees of some sort because unquestionably, whether people believe me or not where ETF flows are being generated from, there is a perception that ETF flows are cannibalizing active equity management. And so, the knee-jerk reaction for some people maybe that we're going to have to stop that and maybe you're going to see an industry trend to lower your fees.</p>
          <p>I will tell you mutual fund boards are going to have to start asking those types of questions across all the different complexes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is and maybe you sort of talked about it in your comments about sort of dealing with the regulators behind the scenes. But you didn't really discuss the money market reforms. Sort of curious, where your thoughts are today and what you think the most likely outcome will be for the industry given some of the dialog between floating rate and NAV, capital buffers and redemption restrictions, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really fluid. We've had conversations with different regulators. And I don't think there's a consistent view from all the different regulators at the moment. But there is a consistent view that there must be some change, so I don't want to &#x2013; I think every regulator says we need to find ways to stabilize society from the risk of money market funds. And we can't have the same risk that we exhibited in 2008.</p>
          <p>How you implement, whether as you suggested, a variable NAV or capital or some form of restrictions, I would say, they're biases by the different regulators. So, I don't know where it's going to come out. We have been a strong advocate of having capital put aside for it. We believe &#x2013; no different than the Basel standards whereby you have multi-years above your capital standard. From our vantage point, the regulator should have allowed managers to build capital associated with the money market fund business over many years, maybe reserving a component of the fees to build that capital buffer. I think it will make the money market fund industry a stronger one.</p>
          <p>And so, we have been, for two, three years, a strong advocate of that. As you know, at this moment, FASB does not allow us to retain any of our fees for our capital buffer. So, it is right now under accounting standards, we can't do that. So, we need changes and not only regulatory, but we need changes in accounting to get that done. And we have been fighting our &#x2013; this is one of the issues that I've always had with the Accounting Standard Board related to why can't we have capital buffers. But we have not been permitted. So, we'll see, Bill. I really don't have a final view, but we are advocating for change.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. So, as you pointed out the iShares market share stabilized in the fourth quarter. Are you thinking that this is sustainable from here? And then in terms of seasonality, fourth quarter is stronger. Typically, first quarter, weaker. Obviously, you're not necessarily seeing that. But any thoughts on that potential trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our weakness in the latter part of 2010 and the early part of 2011 in terms of our flows in our North American ETF platform, a lot of it was self-inflicted, as I said. We had &#x2013; our largest outflow product was our emerging market ETF product, and we &#x2013; as I think about the second quarter of last year, we stabilized it, and we actually have had very, very good and positive tracking. And we saw $4 billion of positive inflows in that fund as a result of that. Once again, it validates our view that tracking is a very important component of how people look at ETFs. And our experience of that really validated that. And so this is why we are so forceful in terms of making sure we perform in terms of what the index is that we're going to perform as the index, or in many cases hopefully outperform.</p>
          <p>But I do believe we will continue to have a strong position in the industry going forward. So, I do like our position in the industry. I continue to believe we have great opportunities there both in North America and in Europe. So, whether it's sustainable, my bias would say yes. But it's a function of the whims of the marketplace. Clearly, if there's a view that everyone's going to be re-risking, you may see more flows in the Q, Q, Qs or more flows into a S&amp;P product. So, if you &#x2013; it really depends on where the market is and if we are the strongest most liquid product in those areas, a positive side about how we're positioned. We have more breadth than any other ETF player in the market.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks. So, Larry, you mentioned that you have strong dialog in the alternative space. So, just curious, which clients are &#x2013; you're having the most discussions with and how diverse the strategies they're looking for and when do you think that could actually start to take hold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're having, as I said, more dialog than ever before. We actually have a lot of pipeline of small little wins. We've had a couple of number wins so far this year. We are in some finals of some very large wins. We see at the moment interest globally, U.S. and Asia and Europe. So, we are &#x2013; I know a number of big dialogs that we have internationally right now. We have had in one of our products that we're trying to wrap up a close. We have strong interest in Europe, and we're just trying to wind it up. So, it's not concentrated in one region. It's certainly not concentrated in one style of client.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just a little bit more color on multi-asset, too. Obviously, you have a big stake in that space rapidly growing. Are there any products that you're not currently offering or additional strategies that you think you can branch out into that would help you grow even faster in that space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, look, we are strong &#x2013; we need to continue to build out our reputation in LDI, in fiduciary. These are the areas where you're seeing a lot of growth, in the two product areas. Those are probably the two biggest growth areas especially in Europe. Our view is we're going to see more fiduciary in the United States. That's one of our big bets. We've had one or two wins in the fiduciary business in the United States. We are having a lot of conversation. And we believe this is where &#x2013; there's going to be some changes. It's very expensive for a lot of small pension funds to run their pension fund. And so, we are in a lot, quite a bit of dialog in the fiduciary stuff. And the two areas that I would say that we &#x2013; in my mind, we have a strong presence, that's the global allocation products where we still have a strong position, and the area which interfaces not only in multi-strategy, multi-asset, but also in respect with the defined contribution business. And that's the target date products that has really fuelled our growth and will continue to fuel our growth in 2012.</p>

          <p>Hi, Michael.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How you doing? One follow-up on the pipeline. It seems like from a conversation standpoint, you guys have been pretty active. So, when you look at the environment and then maybe any seasonality, is there anything unusual when you look at the level of the pipeline versus how active you feel, maybe in terms of the conversations with clients and like the momentum going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, when we talk about the barbell, I would say if one trend is you're seeing more barbelling, you're seeing more indexing and more conversations on alternatives. I think that's an industry trend and that you're seeing that in the flows, whether it flows with us or flows with every other asset manager. A lot of people are still de-risking despite &#x2013; no one listens to me, or not no one. But I mean, I really do believe people should be taking on risks, and I've been saying this for months.</p>
          <p>But our pipeline by asset class is generally the same, but our alternatives, we're starting to get some momentum. And a lot of is just the investments we made in 2011 in terms of having our client team focusing more alternatives and building up the alternative manufacturing platform. But it does feel like more barbelling's going on. So, it's consistent with my theme that I discussed it. I'm very &#x2013; I wish more investors started focusing on long-term strategies because I think some of the de-risking is going to &#x2013; could be long-term very harmful for these institutions, that they're focusing on the next &#x2013; the new cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. That makes sense. And then, maybe just on the &#x2013; a little bit on the regulatory side too. You guys, I think, get the trading platform coming up some time maybe over the next couple months or quarters. But just when you look at the regulation, you said there's some areas that you might be concerned about obviously for at least on the broker side or the sell side, the Volcker Rule continues to be some uncertainty around that. When you guys look at it in terms of what you can offer on the trading platform versus how that ultimately gets implemented, are there scenarios where you're concerned in terms of the liquidity in the fixed income markets and how that can impact pricing in the markets for your investors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been very noisy about the Volcker Rule. We think the Volcker Rule is not just bad for the sell side. We think it's bad for all investors. As you suggested, it's going to reduce liquidity worldwide. And I mean, when I travel overseas, I hear more and more institutions complain about the possible impact in the Volcker Rule. Without getting into any detail, let me just be very clear. We are creating this trading platform or hope to create this trading platform because we're frightened of the Volcker Rule and the impact on liquidity and the impact of bid-ask spreads. We are doing this only for the betterment of our clients, reduce friction costs and trading costs in doing this. When we create this, this is not meant to be &#x2013; we're not meant to be us becoming a broker-dealer and competing with Wall Street. It's meant for us to be a better fiduciary for our clients.</p>
          <p>My greatest hope that we don't have to do this, that the liquidity in Wall Street is greater than ever before, the bid-ask spread is tighter than ever before, and I'm spending a lot of money for nothing. Obviously, I'm spending a lot of money because we're more frightened about the impact of this and the impact on all investors worldwide. And as a result of it, we're creating this as the mechanism so we can offer a better solution to our investors who invest with us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Robert.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. How you doing? This question may be more for Ann Marie. But I guess one of the issues, unfortunately, some investors have with ETFs and betas, kind of the growth &#x2013; the fee structure and maybe not giving as much focus on the higher margins there. Is there any way of getting a sense of &#x2013; to the extent you guys have been very successful in improving your margins over the past year, is there any kind of analysis you've done or color you can give us on how much of that may be driven by somewhat of a mix shift towards what may be lower fee but higher-margin products like index and ETFs or anything you can provide on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say it's been balanced because we've had strong flows into all different types of index products, the lower fee, institutional, as well as our good liquid ETFs that carry with them other benefits, liquidity and tax efficiency. So, I think we don't try and digest it quite the way you've said, is it the mix of business benefiting the margin because we run the platform and the support to support the whole business, not just one segment. So, I really feel like it's been margin improvement coming from the underlying way we're running the firm rather than the mix of business, per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And maybe one question for Larry. Obviously, a lot of regulatory uncertainty out there and &#x2013; and just kind of any update you can provide on the &#x2013; your thoughts or your &#x2013; based on your conversations with the Treasury about the SIFI designation and if you think that's really not going to be much of an issue for &#x2013; not going to be an overhang for you or your latest thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My latest thoughts, I know nothing more today than I did four months ago. I don't believe &#x2013; I think the regulators asked for a comment &#x2013; asked for comments related to asset managers and SIFI designation. I think that was delayed, if I'm correct, in terms of submitting our letter. I don't believe regulators have come to terms as to how they should think about asset managers for SIFI designation. And so, I don't think there has been much movement towards that. And so, we are waiting to work and have a dialog with our regulators about how they should think about all asset managers or, specifically, BlackRock should be included or not included in the definition of SIFI regulations. So, without digging myself into a deep hole, I'm going to conclude it with that.</p>
