          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome everyone to today's third quarter 2011 (sic) [2010] DIRECTV earnings conference call. My name is Ann and I'll be your conference operator for today. [Operator Instructions]</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator, and thank to everyone, for joining us for our third quarter of 2010 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Larry Hunter, General Counsel; Pat Doyle, CFO; and Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Mike, Bruce, and Pat for some introductory remarks. But first, I'll read to you the following.</p>
          <p>On this call, we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in each of DIRECTV's and DIRECTV U.S.'s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures directly to the comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures, which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our website at DIRECTV.com.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm pleased to introduce Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with a few high level comments about our quarter and then I'll turn the call over to Pat and Bruce, as is customary, for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American businesses.</p>
          <p>Overall, though, I thought our third quarter results were certainly the best of the year as we gained market share in both regions, North America and South America, while also maintaining very strong margins. My main takeaways from the quarter are: first, DIRECTV and Skylite America's strong brands and differentiated content continue to drive greater consumer demand for our services, both in the United States and across Latin America. In addition to gaining share, our customers also are purchasing more HD, DVR, and premium services, which contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for our company.</p>
          <p>Second, we're continuing to manage our costs effectively, capturing efficiencies and productivity improvements. Despite a 13% increase in consolidated gross additions and related increase in acquisition costs, we still achieved double-digit OPBDA [Operating Profit Before Depreciation and Amortization] growth and grew our earnings per share by 49% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And third, we made significant progress toward strengthening our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders by issuing $3 billion in debt and repurchasing $1.37 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date buybacks to $3.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's first look at the DIRECTV U.S. business. I'm particularly pleased to see that as our year progressed, our subscriber momentum continues to build. In fact, our third quarter was the first time in six quarters where both our gross adds and our churn were better than prior year's period, resulting in a 28% increase in net additions to 174,000.</p>
          <p>Consumer demand for DIRECTV services remains extremely strong for a couple reasons. It's clear that some of our new products are resonating well with our customers. For instance, I mentioned at an investor conference a few weeks ago that our take rate for Whole-Home DVR services was running around 25% of gross adds. And recently we've seen that number reach as high as 40% of new subscribers. We intend to keep that momentum going in the fourth quarter with continued focus on our multi-room viewing product, as well as relaunching our enhanced DIRECTV CINEMA service and more aggressively connecting our most valuable subscribers' receivers to the Internet. We continue to believe that a set-top box connected to the Internet provides our customers with significantly more features and services, which in turn will drive greater ARPU and lower churn.</p>
          <p>Another reason behind the strong demand we saw in the quarter is the popularity of our offers including Free HD and the NFL Sunday Ticket promotion. Continuing the trends that we discussed on our last earnings call, the Free HD offer seems to be particularly appealing to our target market, namely higher income households that have high definition televisions. In the quarter, we reached yet another record as over 75% of gross adds were activated with advanced services. However, our biggest jump came in customers signing up for both HD and DVR services, as that number grew to almost half of all new customers in the quarter compared to only 30% a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to targeting and attaining higher quality new subscribers, I think we're also doing a better job keeping our existing customers happy. We now approach churn management in a much more proactive and highly targeted manner. Our customer service agents have better information and tools to more effectively respond to our customers' needs and desires.</p>
          <p>In addition, I believe that all parts of our operations under Mike Palkovic, from the initial installation to equipment reliability to our loyalty program and overall customer service, are all performing at improved levels and are contributing to our lower churn rates. More effective call center operations are also playing a key role in our ARPU growth, as our call agents are now much better equipped to upsell customers to higher packages or premium services.</p>
          <p>Now in addition to the strong HD and DVR trends I cited earlier, our ARPU was also boosted by the second consecutive quarter in which we increased our overall buy rates for both premium and pay-per-view movies. Also contributing to our strong ARPU growth was another quarter of excellent growth in advertising sales. In terms of our margins and the bottom line, Pat will go into much more detail, but overall I was very pleased with our results.</p>
          <p>Our SAC continues to run at around that $800 level. But I'm confident that the vast majority of the increase, and we've looked at this quite carefully, is related to investments in advanced equipment that drives either incremental revenue streams or an improved television experience, resulting in lower churn rates, but regardless has a substantially higher return on investment. And our DIRECTV U.S. pre-SAC margin speaks for itself, as it grew on a year-over-year basis for the fifth consecutive quarter while reaching the highest level ever for a third quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me turn briefly to DIRECTV Latin America. Clearly the highlight there in the quarter was the continued subscriber momentum that we're seeing across the region. As I told you on our prior call, one concern we had was whether we could sustain the strong subscriber growth following the World Cup. I think our third quarter results answer that question loud and clear as we saw an impressive 36% increase in gross additions over prior year.</p>
          <p>Consistent with recent trends, the majority of our growth came from Brazil. In fact, Sky Brazil set yet another record by growing gross additions nearly 60% to 255,000 while topping the record they had just established in the prior quarter in the run-up to the World Cup. But I also should point out we saw strong demand in several other countries as well, including Argentina, Ecuador, and even in Venezuela where we've implemented what's essentially a virtually no-growth strategy due to foreign exchange limitations. In addition, our subscriber growth across the region continues to be diversified, with approximately 20% of new customers signing up for HD or DVR services and about 20% choosing prepaid services.</p>
          <p>Now we also have some concern about churn potentially spiking after the World Cup. And as predicted, we did see, and as planned I might add, we did see an uptick in prepaid churn. But most importantly, postpaid churn in Latin America remained relatively flat from a year ago at 1.54%.</p>
          <p>Our ARPU was also solid in the quarter, particularly when you consider the 40% ARPU decline in Venezuela related to the devaluation of its currency earlier this year. Most importantly, in local currency terms, our ARPU was up around 4% in the quarter, as we continue to benefit from price increases and strong demand for advanced services.</p>
          <p>And even with a significant increase in gross additions, DIRECTV Latin America's operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded by seven percentage points to 34%, due mostly to lower cash repatriation costs in Venezuela, but also from improved programming margins and very solid cost management.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I think it's clear from our results that both our U.S. and Latin American businesses have unique and sustainable competitive advantages that have positioned us well to continue increasing value for our shareholders by generating industry leading top line and bottom line growth. We are maintaining, in many cases increasing, both market share and margins while using our underleveraged balance sheet and strong free cash flow to aggressively repurchase DIRECTV shares.</p>
          <p>Perhaps even more exciting are the many new growth opportunities that we see and hope to share with you at our December Investor Day. I speak for the entire executive management team when I tell you that we're very much looking forward to sharing with you our strategies for turning these growth opportunities into higher cash flow for all of our shareholders when we see you at our Investor Day on December 2nd.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill to talk a bit more about Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Mike. Again, as Mike said, overall I thought we delivered another strong quarter, particularly coming off a series of record quarters that led up to the World Cup in June and July earlier this year.</p>
          <p>The 525,000 gross additions are second only to the levels immediately preceding the World Cup earlier this year and 36% higher than they were in Q3 of 2009. In fact, Sky Brazil reached record levels of gross additions, growing almost 60% versus the prior year; while PanAmericana grew about 20%, with Argentina and Ecuador delivering particularly strong year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing well balanced growth across each of the product market segments. In particular, about 20% of new customers signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter. In absolute terms, the number of gross additions taking advanced products was almost 45% higher than Q3 of 2009. With these results, about 25% of our 5.4 million subscribers have advanced products.</p>
          <p>And we continue to be successful in offering innovative products targeted to the to the more middle market segments. In Brazil, our Skylite package is very popular, and we have high expectations for our recently launched Sky Fit package as well. Both are affordably priced, entry-level postpaid products that allow the subscriber to add selected additional products and services on top. One year ago, our lowest priced postpaid package in Brazil was priced at 79.9 reais versus Sky Fit today which sells for 49.9 reais or roughly 35% less. And yet, our programming margin on Sky Fit is consistent with our other packages, and I believe it is a testament to our ability to profitably serve the middle market segment.</p>
          <p>Prepaid gross additions represented 18% of our 525,000 gross adds in the quarter or 31% greater than last year. Cumulatively, prepaid subscribers make up approximately 10% of our 5.4 million consolidated subscribers.</p>
          <p>I was also pleased that our postpaid churn for the quarter of 1.54% met our expectations while remaining relatively flat compared with the prior year. With regard to our prepaid services, as expected, we did see a decline in our recharge rates following the end of the World Cup. But as we have discussed before, we believe that giving this segment of consumers the option to sign up for pay TV when they can afford it is still a good business for us, given the low net subscriber acquisition costs associated with this group. We expect many of them will come back on in the months ahead now that we have passed the natural lull of the post-World Cup period.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with 206,000 of net adds. While this figure does not match the record we set last quarter in the run-up to the World Cup, it wasn't all that long ago that 206,000 net adds would have been a record. In fact, this is only the fourth time in our history that we have exceeded 200,000 net adds in the quarter, and it is still almost 30% better than we did last year.</p>
          <p>We also had excellent financial results in the quarter. Driven by strong subscriber growth, revenues increased to 22%. ARPU was down modestly in dollars due mostly to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU would have increased around 4%, driven by price increases and higher penetration of advanced products.</p>
          <p>OPBDA and cash flow before interest and taxes were even stronger as they grew 57% and 85% respectively over last year's results. The majority of this growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs associated with the increase in gross adds.</p>
          <p>Regarding Venezuela, as many of you know, beginning in May the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of the so-called parallel market for converting bolivars to U.S. dollars. This situation restricts our ability to repatriate dollars, which explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. As of September 30th, we had approximately $120 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official 4.30 bolivars per U.S. dollar that is currently not available for repatriation. The currency control situation in Venezuela remains fluid and obviously one we will continue to monitor closely. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to make a few comments about the results of Sky Mexico, which are not consolidated in our results. As some of you may already know, Sky Mexico continues to post extremely strong results following the World Cup, adding more than 300,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared to 23,000 a year ago. Including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 8.2 million subscribers. Financial results at Sky Mexico were equally strong as revenue and OPBDA grew 20% and 34% respectively.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had another very solid quarter with continued strong subscriber growth across all three platforms, the diversified mix of product sales, and strong financial results across the board. As a result, I remain confident that we're on track to meet the full-year guidance we provided in our last earnings call.</p>
          <p>Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. Much like Latin America, DIRECTV U.S. also had a very solid quarter. And in many ways, I thought our results were perhaps the strongest of the year as our subscriber growth accelerated from levels seen earlier in the year; while at the same time, we continued generating strong margins.</p>
          <p>Starting first with subscribers, we reversed a five quarter trend of declining year-over-year net additions by growing 28% to 174,000 net new customers, as both our gross additions and churn rate were better than prior year. Gross additions of 1.14 million were particularly strong and represented the best third quarter in six years. As Mike mentioned earlier, we attribute this strong demand to a combination of factors, including the introduction of new services such as the Whole-Home DVR, popular offers such as Free HD and more targeted incentives designed to exploit competitor weaknesses while capitalizing on DIRECTV's strengths.</p>
          <p>The strength of our direct sales and retail channels continue to more than offset the declining contribution from our telco partners. Even with the addition Of CenturyLink, telco's contribution has gradually declined over the past year and is currently only about 15% of total gross additions compared to a high of 25% in the first half of last year. This decline is mostly related to the continued rollout of FiOS and U-verse as well as the number of land lines, which results in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at the telco call centers.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased with our average monthly churn rate of 1.7%, which for the first time in six quarters was lower on a year-over-year basis. We saw favorable trends in both voluntary and involuntary churn. The main reason for the improvement is that we're managing churn in a more proactive, segmented, and targeted fashion. We now have an improved customer relationship management system, where our agents have better tools and information to communicate more effectively with our customers.</p>
          <p>We also have more intelligence on the front end, including a sophisticated predictive model, which provides us with the ability to identify those customers who are most likely to churn, so that we can implement action plans to mitigate losses.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're constantly looking for ways to further tighten our credit standards or introduce new tactics to reduce involuntarily churn. For example, in order for our customers to receive the Free HD offer, they have to sign up for Auto Bill pay, which historically has been associated with lower churn rates.</p>
          <p>Turning now to ARPU, the 4.3% growth was double last year's third quarter and consistent with our internal targets. As predicted, the rate was modestly below our first half growth, mostly due to all-around tougher comparisons with the prior year as well as a couple of one-time events, including an extra NFL game and acceleration of our price increase by one month.</p>
          <p>Consistent with trends seen in recent quarters, premiums, pay-per-view movies, and advertising sales remained strong in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, year-over-year buy rates increased for premium and pay-per-view movies for the second consecutive quarter. Our subscriber VOD movie revenues remain about half as much as cable, so I'm happy to see we're making progress in this area even before we ramp up marketing for our enhanced DIRECTV CINEMA service.</p>
          <p>Also contributing nicely to ARPU growth is the increase in demand, from both new and existing customers for advanced services. You heard earlier that about 75% of new customers are activating with advanced services. Even though many of these customers are receiving HD for free, virtually all of them are signing up for DVR services for an extra $7 per month, and many are taking our Whole-Home DVR service for an extra $3 per month. We're seeing many of these same trends with existing customers, which help explain the modest increase in our third quarter upgrade and retention costs.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the bottom line, pre-SAC margin grew year over year for the fifth consecutive quarter, but EBITDA margin declined by about a percentage point to 24% in the quarter, primarily due to higher gross additions and related increase in subscriber acquisition costs. As we've seen all year, our programming, subscriber services, and broadcast operations costs were contained and well managed.</p>
          <p>I just explained the reason for our higher upgrade and retention costs, so I'd like to spend a minute discussing SAC. Of the $108 year-over-year increase in SAC, approximately 90% of that increase is related to the increased demand for advanced products. Included in this percentage are the higher relative cost of HD and DVR boxes, the additional equipment and installation costs related to the advanced dish, and also the extra commissions we pay dealers to acquire higher quality HD and DVR customers. There will likely be continued upward pressure on SAC related to our strategy to more aggressively connect customers' set-top boxes to the Internet beginning here in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>It's important to point out that we make these investments only after completing a very rigorous analysis that concludes with a relatively high level of confidence that we will attain an attractive return on our investment. I believe this analytical process has a pretty good track record over the past few years of identifying areas where we can generate healthy financial returns by upgrading customers with advanced equipment. In fact, customers who have HD and DVR services continue to generate roughly twice the returns of basic customers due to the significantly better ARPU and churn. More broadly, we believe that investing in advanced equipment for higher quality customers is the best use of our free cash flow to generate superior returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Looking quickly at DIRECTV U.S. cash flow in the quarter, the same things you heard earlier apply here, where the higher gross adds and demand for advanced equipment resulted in higher capital expenditures and lower cash flow.</p>
          <p>I'd like to wrap up with a few comments about our fourth quarter outlook. You just heard Bruce reaffirm DIRECTV Latin America's full-year outlook, so these comments apply to our U.S. business.</p>
          <p>In many ways, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're anticipating revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter as gross and net additions are again expected to be better than prior year. Pre-SAC margin is expected to have its usual sequential decline from the third to the fourth quarter related to the NFL Sunday Ticket costs. And SAC is expected to see continued upward pressure as I discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>In terms of DIRECTV's consolidated free cash flow, we expect to exceed our initial full-year estimate of mid-single-digit growth. We're estimating that we'll receive a benefit of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter related to the most recent economic stimulus program that extended the accelerated write-off of equipment for another year.</p>
          <p>Also, keep in mind that we are expecting to make a payment for the acquisition of an additional 19% ownership in Sky Brazil from Globo in the fourth quarter. This will be reported under investing activities and therefore not included in our reported free cash flow metric.</p>
          <p>Regarding our balance sheet and strategy for returning capital to shareholders, we made good progress in the quarter toward our goal of reaching 2.5 times leverage target by the end of next year. With the 3 billion raised in the third quarter, our leverage ratio of total debt to DIRECTV U.S. OPBDA now stands at about two times. This ratio also reflects the 1.2 billion repayment of all of our remaining secured debt in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, through yesterday we have repurchased approximately 680 million out of our current 2 billion share repurchase authorization. Year to date, we've repurchased about 4.2 billion while reducing our shares outstanding by some 12%. Cumulatively, we've now reduced DIRECTV shares by about 40% since we began our buyback program in 2006.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn the call back to Jon so he can begin our Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pat. And before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either directly or in substance other than the representatives of DIRECTV. In addition, we are webcasting this call live on the Internet and an archived copy will be kept on our website.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. If you could talk regarding the U.S., both Time Warner Cable and Comcast have mentioned that they've seen subscriber trends improving thus far in the quarter, and certainly indicates that you guys are going to be up year on year. But are you seeing similar trends? Should we look at this as a market-wide thing, or is there something share driven going on there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, regarding both Latin America and the U.S., I understand you've been kicking the tires on some mobile data options in Latin America, and if you could talk a little bit about that and to what degree you see the need to have some sort of either operational or ownership participation in mobile networks in Latin America and the U.S. as part of the overall mobile video strategy versus just having an app? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, James. First, I think we've started the quarter well. I think we have a lot of things going on in October that I wouldn't generalize from for the full quarter. But as Pat said, our expectation is to see continued trends on pretty much all fronts, both growth in net subscribers, churn improvements, and financial management, probably directionally consistent with Q3 in Q4. But we're off a good start for the fourth quarter, but I think it's hard to generalize on four weeks; and frankly, we had a good third quarter. So it's hard for me to see some secular change going out there for the industry as a whole that I could comment on one way or the other. I can only say, look, our trends continue to be good.</p>
          <p>On the question on mobile networks, Bruce, you want to comment on Latin America and our thinking there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I guess our view is that from a life cycle, product life cycle point of view, Latin America is obviously a bit far behind the U.S. You don't have the fixed-line speeds that you have today here in the U.S. And it is a world which is much more mobile based, if you will. There are many more mobile telephones than there are fixed-line telephones. And so therefore, given that it's earlier days, there might be an opportunity for us to participate in some way in that arena since it seems to be a somewhat logical adjacent product for us.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think in all likelihood it's something we would do with partners, we would not do alone. It's not an area of expertise for us and there's a lot of different ways that partnerships could be constructed. So it's something we're looking at just because of where we are in that development cycle. At the same time, to your question, is it something I need? I certainly do not need it today. I don't think we're in a world where having mobile &#x2013; video delivered over mobile devices is a big market, so it's not something I'm missing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking my question. My question is about your gross add success. As you think about where your subscribers are coming from, I guess the first question would be is, what kind of sources of growth adds do you think &#x2013; where do you think they're coming from primarily? Is this DISH subs, a combination of cable and DISH? And then maybe you could talk a little about why subscribers are choosing your service over other services longer term. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. We do a fair amount of analysis. I would tell you we're picking up subs pretty much across the board from both satellite as well as cable as well as telco opportunities. So I think we're seeing it come pretty broad based across our footprint.</p>
          <p>I would certainly tell you and I think I commented on this on the call, I think the big news is, in my mind, there is a segment of consumers out there. In our case, it's the ones we target. It's a bit upper income, the premia that pay for the premium service that are investing in their home entertainment system, if you will. They're investing with advanced products. They're investing with our MRV [Multi-Room Viewing] system, which we had almost 290,000 new customers taking MRV in the quarter. They're investing with HD DVR in a huge way. Almost 50% of our gross adds took HD DVR. That's way up from where it was a year ago. They're also investing by buying pay-per-view movies. Our pay-per-view movie business was up over 30% as well as premium business which is up, and the take rates, penetration rates on that are up as well.</p>
          <p>So I think we're certainly seeing a general interest in the overall quality entertainment experience that DIRECTV can provide our customers. I think that's really been a key part of our success, I would say, coupled with our NFL Sunday Ticket and Free HD promotion that we had in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Mike or Pat or both, I was wondering if you could talk about how you're balancing investment in these new products relative to the demand you're seeing. Clearly the MRV success is there. You have a couple of other products coming out and obviously connected set-tops include a lot of investment in the home around installation work. Are you going to throttle this at all or do you look at this and say, where we are in the cost curve, it still makes sense to sell these to whoever wants them, both in the installed base and in terms of gross adds, and so if the demand is there we're going to move it? Or are you going to look to moderate this and balance near term financial profits? I'd love to just understand how you're thinking about that.</p>
          <p>And then on the Sunday Ticket offer, just qualitatively, how did you guys do with the offer at the beginning of the season? The reason I ask is the NFL has done a pretty good job of making a lot of money everywhere they can in different windows. There's a lot of advertising with Verizon Wireless, and RedZone channels available in a lot of places. The NFL Network is getting more distribution. Some people would argue that Sunday Ticket is being diluted by all this other stuff. But I know you had a very good year last year and you've changed pricing around this year, so I'm just curious how Sunday Ticket is going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, happy to, Ben. Let me just make an opening comment, turn it to Pat and then I'll take the Sunday Ticket question after that. I think on the first question, we looked very carefully. The nature of our business model, as you know, Ben, you have to constantly be looking at &#x2013; we almost look at our investment in SAC like it's a CapEx, like it's a capital expenditure because it is. It has a certain revenue stream that we can model for our customers and certain churn projections based on whether they're advanced services and all kinds of things. We have a very sophisticated modeling approach to that.</p>
          <p>I can assure you, we look very carefully at our ROI on all of these advanced products. And as Pat said in his remarks, the ROI is more than double what it is for a basic subscriber. I don't think, however, that means, therefore SAC can go to infinity. We've looked very carefully at it. We're very disciplined in how we manage it. But again, we've got a product that consumers want right now and it has a terrific ROI to it. Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, Ben, looking at MRV, which we launched in June, in all honesty, we were a little bit surprised by the demand that we got. We expected it to be an attractive product, but it really resonated with our customers. So on the new customer side, it's a pretty easy proposition. And I think with the incremental revenue we get there and the experience and churn, that's an easy one.</p>
          <p>We continue to monitor existing customers that want to upgrade to MRV because again, depending on the technology in their home, that could be a different proposition where it just doesn't make sense for some people to upgrade to MRV. But that one, again, we're very comfortable on gross add, very good return on that one. Because again, you remember there, that person is getting an HD DVR that has probably got an HD box in the other room, and so is paying us the $7, maybe the $10 for HD and the $3 for MRV. So the returns are very good there.</p>
          <p>Going into the fourth quarter, where we're stressing broadband connectivity, I think as a team here we're very bullish on the advantages of connecting boxes to the Internet. Again, this will be, we're offering it free for our very best customers. We're starting out in that way. We'll certainly monitor it, check our financial projections on what we think that's going to drive as far as incremental revenue and a stickier customer. But I think again, we feel like this is a must; that it's important for you are customers to have that total experience of being hooked up to broadband. But right now we're very comfortable on these investments and the kind of returns they're going to generate for us</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind that with the relaunch of DIRECTV CINEMA, the typical DIRECTV customer even that's not connected goes from 25 pay-per-view movie choices to 400. But if we connect you to the Internet, it's 10,000.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our VOD, the way we look at the connecting to the Internet as a strategy, and we'll talk about that in December, is it really unlocks for us an area we've been disadvantaged versus the cable guys for years. Our VOD on demand revenues per sub are less than half of what an average cable company gets. We think that's a big opportunity, a big incremental revenue opportunity and profit opportunity for us in the years ahead as we pursue that strategy.</p>
          <p>On the NFL Sunday Ticket, let's keep in mind, first of all, it is a very important partnership that we have had with the NFL for many, many years. We value that partnership. And the branding of NFL Sunday Ticket and its role in our DIRECTV service is a very important role from an overarching branding standpoint. Having said that, I would say that our NFL Sunday Ticket results were acceptable in the quarter; they weren't outstanding by any stretch of the imagination. I would say we saw some modest fall-off in renewals, but we had strong gross adds in the quarter and about 25% of our gross adds took the Ticket.</p>
          <p>We had a good experience, I think, with our NFL Mobile offering, where we had almost 350,000 customers in the quarter. And I think we're getting a lot of learning about that as we look in the years ahead. But I would say we're satisfied with the performance in the quarter of where we ended up.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. I guess you pretty thoroughly addressed the increase in investment with your customers, so I wanted to focus on Latin America. Pat, I'm sorry I haven't seen the disclosure in the 10-Q, but did you update the purchase price you expect for Globo or do you want to tell us what the purchase of the stake from Globo will be?</p>
          <p>And then, Bruce, the growth in Latin America continues to obviously be pretty excellent, so two things happen when you grow this fast this long, right? First, you start to &#x2013; we all start to get concerned that the strong growth will suggest to competitors that this is a bigger market than they thought and they start to ramp efforts to get into the market. And second, you start to segment the customer base to continue to improve penetration, which you've obviously done quite well. So that starts to suggest that maybe you flushed out a lot of the growth and growth will start to slow. So the question is, are competitors ramping efforts in video in Latin America, and can you sustain this level of growth? And if so, how do you do that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Doug, so I guess on the first part, as you're probably aware, we first started with the two bankers, one for each side, coming up with their valuations, so they were far enough apart that now we're into the process of a third banker to resolve it. So again, it's still up in the air. But if you look at the range, it's probably &#x2013; for the 19% interest, it's probably something 500 million to probably at the high end would be $800 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question of the market dynamics, I guess first of all, I would make the point that the market is pretty competitive today already, and we seem to do pretty well. In every market, we compete against generally one large cable company that in some cases is owned by a company for example like Telmex or Telef&#xF3;nica. In other cases it's an independent cable company, so it's not as if the competition isn't already there. And in fact in the case of Brazil, for example, several of the telcos have launched fairly modest DTH [Direct-to-Home] platforms.</p>
          <p>So I'm aware of the competition. I think we continue to compete very well, and I think it goes back to a point that I've made probably over and over again on some of these calls that some of you may be tired of hearing me say it, which is the key advantage we have is our product is just better. We have the advantage of taking all the products and the R&amp;D that is developed for the benefit of DIRECTV in the U.S., which is the world's most competitive pay-TV market, and we're able to bring it to Latin America sooner, better, and cheaper than everybody else. So I'm very confident that from a competitive point of view we will continue to do more than hold our own.</p>
          <p>On the second point about market growth, I think that you have to keep in mind a couple of things. One, you're correct about our ability to get into new segments, and they're particularly more middle market segments, which I talked about. I think the other thing that you have to remember is, in some markets, in many markets, particularly Brazil, for example, there is a macroeconomic phenomenon going on where a lot of people are rising from more lower or more mass market segments into middle market segments, so people moving from D and E class holes into C and D. So the actual pie that all of us in this market, in this business are going after is increasing. So it is not like the United States, where you have very high penetration and you're really fighting for share. The pay-TV penetration is up in Latin America, but it's still in the mid to high 20s percentage points. It's not anything close to the saturation point. So assuming continued relatively favorable macroeconomic conditions, I think there's still a lot of running room to grow.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. Time Warner Cable on their call earlier today talked about doing some tiering on the video side, and I seem to remember earlier this quarter reading about a select package that you guys were offering, 120 channels for $45 a month, a regional trial in some smaller markets. Can you give us a sense for your view on maybe first how that trial has been going and what kind of popularity or market acceptance you may have seen around that? And is this the direction you think that the market's going, especially considering the fears we've seen from over the top?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think look; it's very, very early days, so I really wouldn't comment on where we're going go with that kind of a package or not. I think what's clear when you look at the overall macroeconomics in the U.S. is it's almost like a two track economy. There are those that have a college degree where unemployment is 4% or 5%, and those that have less than a college degree were unemployment is over 20%, and consumers are hurting. So I think certainly, our strong belief is that we need greater package flexibility for price sensitive customers in our industry.</p>
          <p>We continue to have those discussions with our programming partners, and we continue to look for ways to do that, just as we're doing in Latin America. Frankly, I think we're probably learning as much in this case from Latin America for our U.S. business as Bruce gets advantage from the U.S. business on other things. But certainly the idea of more segmentation and more package flexibility I believe certainly is important for us, for the entire ecosystem to be able to service shall we say the bottom of the pyramid in the United States.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a quick question. Even though your SAC costs have moved higher, at least when we try and calculate your marginal return on the incremental gross add, it looks incredibly high and relatively stable. And then when I look at your stock price over the last year, it has doubled and you're hitting new, fresh highs. And so my question is, are you still quite confident that for the marginal dollar of capital that you have to return that it doesn't make more sense to invest in SAC and subscriber growth as opposed to your equity? I know the 800 SAC is a &#x2013; it seems like a headline number that's alarming, but it's really not when you go through the math, and so any comment on that front would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd be happy to, Jason, thanks. I think the answer is no. I think we can do both. But I think certainly the nature of our business model, it's a very well balanced model that has self-corrections built into it. In other words, we have to be able to execute well our advanced products in the home. That also means we need a supply chain that can flex to the growth that we're seeing in advanced products, which we've had some challenges with this year, but we're getting there.</p>
          <p>I've got to say, certainly I think from our standpoint we're very disciplined and very rigorous in making the choice that we made to accept higher SAC. We looked very carefully at what was actually going on because in point of fact it's not an apple and an apple, as you pointed out. If you look at our customer base a year ago versus what's happening with our customer base this year, it's quite different. The quality of subscriber is better, and the quality of service that the subscriber is demanding from us is better as well. Pat, do you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. I think that as we look at how to deploy our cash flow, we're very comfortable that investing in the home and investing in technology in the home provides us a great opportunity. At the same time with where we're sitting today, I think we can do things where we can both return cash to shareholders and at the same time have plenty of capital left to invest in the consumer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not holding back in terms of our investments in advanced products in the home, nor would we hold back if it ever came to that. But frankly we're executing our share buyback program exactly in line with what we said we were going to do and expect to continue to do that. And our focus on the home, I think again, one of the things I've learned over the last year is I believe DIRECTV has the best engineers and the best technology in the industry. We continue to invest in improving that technology because nothing stands still in the world, and I think we've got some great things to share with you at our December meeting in that regard.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I have two questions. First, Pat, if you can correct me, I think there was some restriction on the buyback capacity due to the Reverse Morris Trust structure of the Liberty transaction. I think that ends about now. Can you give us an update on what the restrictions were and what you can do now going forward?</p>
          <p>And second, I wanted to talk about the accounting for the NFL Sunday Ticket into the new year, into the new contract because I know the way you've been recording that in the past. Can you address that on how that will impact programming costs in 2011? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first one, Vijay, yes; I think what we've said publicly, there are some restrictions that came out from the Reverse Morris Trust. They're not black and white. We've made the decision to be right down the middle on the fairway on dealing with that. So I think the authorization that we got in August for share repurchase is our intent to use that to get us through the end of the year and maybe a little bit into January before we do something more with share repurchase, so yes and no. There's nothing black and white, but we've taken a fairly conservative view, and that's how we're approaching our share repurchase right now.</p>
          <p>On the accounting, yes, you're right. We're finishing up one of the contracts with the NFL Sunday Ticket this season. As it turned out, at the end of that contract we ended up reporting a modest margin on the program as a whole. Next year we won't have that margin to report in addition to an increase, year-over-year increase in the cost of the NFL Sunday Ticket. So we're looking at next year as probably something around a 200 million increase from 2010 to 2011 as we look at the NFL Sunday Ticket costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. Forgive me if you've already answered this, but I don't recall that you've publicly said if there were a failure to reach a collective bargaining agreement for the NFL, how would you respond and does your contract require that you would still have to make payments to the NFL anyway, even if games weren't being televised?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Craig. Pat, why don't you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Craig, I think the way the contract works, without getting into too much in specifics, obviously if there's just a game or two that's not played, then we just get a pro rata reduction in the normal payments that we would make to the NFL. If there's a complete loss of the season, we do have a requirement to make minimum payments to the NFL. In return for that, we get to add another season, some reduced payments going forward. And then some of the payment that we make in 2011 would get credited against the next season. So I wouldn't really want to get into too much more detail, but that's the general framework of a strike season.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, good morning. Just following up on your recent comments on Latin America and the growth of that market, as we think about ARPU, again up about 4% and I guess FX neutral in the quarter, can you give us a sense of where you think ARPU can go over the next couple of years, particularly as you continue to have success adding subscribers that are taking advanced services? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. Yes, I'm not going to get into trying to prognosticate about two years forward-looking ARPU. But I guess in general, we base our plans on not significant increases in ARPU because there's the competing pressure between obviously we're selling more advanced products and that is helping ARPU with certain segments, but also our desire to serve more of the middle market segment that I talked about before, and for meaningful &#x2013; for pay-TV penetration to increase in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>In other words, to get well above that 25% number that I quoted earlier, we are going to have to penetrate some of those &#x2013; a good part of that market. And as I think I mentioned in my comments, we now have a package at 49.90 reais in Brazil, which is roughly $28 or so. That's not to say that people just get that because they can also buy some other services on top of that, but that's obviously lower than where we are today.</p>
          <p>So I think if you're going to look at revenue growth, my guess is it's going to be driven more by subscriber growth and ARPU growth, without getting too specific about either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we toggle it back and forth. I think our premium service I think we would expect to continue to see ARPU grow for the premium service. But what we constantly look at is how many new subscribers are you bringing in. And when you've got an industry like Brazil where you've got less than 15% of the customers that take pay-TV in general, you've got an enormous opportunity to explode the base of the pyramid. What we want to be is very disciplined as we look at these lower priced packages and make sure there's a good return on them.</p>
          <p>And so we'll talk about next year when we get around to talking about next year. But I think it's a balance you've got to keep in mind, as Bruce said, between a lot more subscribers that will come in, in these lower priced packages or prepaid versus the premium service, which is also growing.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. I just had a couple questions on Latin America. I guess first, if you could help us quantify the exposure to Venezuela just in terms of the percentage of the sub base and revenue and EBITDA relative to total Latin America? And then just if you repatriated cash hypothetically in Venezuela this quarter, how much would those charges have been? Is the $9 million from last quarter a good number? I'm just trying to understand the recurring margin impact if you assumed you repatriated all the free cash flow on a regular basis.</p>
          <p>And then just lastly on the margins in Latin America, aside from the lack of repatriation charges, do you think this new margin level is something that's more or less sustainable? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to Venezuela, we have about 1 million subscribers in Venezuela. I think as Mike alluded to earlier, given the repatriation constraints that we have there, our basic strategy is to hold on to that base. The market is not growing a ton. But nevertheless, we prefer to focus on our existing base. And to the extent we have subscribers we can upgrade with advanced services, we'll do that etcetera, as opposed to necessarily selling more in the middle market. I don't want to get really involved in the individual P&amp;Ls of the countries.</p>
          <p>The cash, I mentioned earlier about the 120 million of cash at the official rate in Venezuela. We obviously wouldn't repatriate all of that. We do have ongoing liabilities in Venezuela, costs associated. We pay programming in local currency. We have obviously employees there, etcetera. So it's hard for me to estimate what the impact would have been, because it's also hard to estimate what the parallel rate would be. But if you were to look at it historically, it might be a $20 million number probably that we could &#x2013; had we been able to, we might have been able &#x2013; we might have incurred a number like that. It's not again a huge meaningful number in the overall context of DIRECTV Latin America or DIRECTV.</p>
          <p>And the third question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the margins and the sustainability of this new level of margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we're &#x2013; I see no reason why they would change substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, thank you. And just on the &#x2013; I know you don't want to get into any more detail on Venezuela, but is the proportion of revenue, say, that much different than the proportion of subs, like there has been a disproportionate relationship there, I assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The proportion of revenue would be lower because Brazil is obviously a very big part of our business.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And the currency value in Brazil is much higher. So off the top of my head, I don't know the answer to that question, but it's not representative on a subscriber-for-subscriber basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, just a couple. I guess to your point on the dual track economy, we've obviously heard that from a lot of folks. Can you offer more granularity on your average subscriber that would really help support your positioning up-market? And maybe what income bracket does the average subscriber sit in or what's the average credit score across your base; and then perhaps more importantly, how either one of those has been changing over the last couple years?</p>
          <p>And then second question, just with the buyback maybe from a longer term perspective, the 2.5 turns U.S. target was set obviously a while ago under a less accommodating leverage environment and with a more complicated ownership structure in place. I'm wondering what's the opportunity in your mind to potentially revisit that and move it higher, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the dual track, we look at our quality of the subscribers that are coming on all the time. And I wouldn't want to get into too much detail about income levels, but we're very comfortable. If you look at the credit scores of our customers that have come in, we continue to see the vast majority of them as what we would consider to be low credit risk customers. And that didn't switch at all; as a matter of fact, it improved when we went to Free HD. We were a little concerned that you might get some people taking advantage of that. But what we found was it was really the higher end customers that were interested in the $10 off. But we do look at &#x2013; I mean we look at everything from income levels to home ownership and all of that data.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It all turns out to be very good. On the buyback, I think that obviously we'll continue to monitor that. We've got a lot of work just to get the U.S. business at 2.5 times leverage. Right now, the Latin American business isn't in the credit and isn't leveraged, so we've got that opportunity as well. So would we consider looking at it again? Sure, we would. But right now, that's a ways off because we've got a lot of work to do to get it just up to the target.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is actually Tim Schlock for Marci Ryvicker. I've just got one question. We've been hearing from a lot of local broadcasters saying that as they have to start paying the networks a programming fee, they're going to pass that on to the video distributors. I just want to get your comments on what you think of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I've talked about programming costs before. I think programming cost is a significant challenge for the entire industry. And it's clear that the new dual revenue model for the broadcast business is here to stay, and that is going to drive up the cost of everyone's programming, as well as I think driving up the consumer's pay-TV bill each month.</p>
          <p>In our case, we have been paying some retrans on the non-owned and operated stations in the past. That's not to say there won't be meaningful increases. There will be. But it's not like we're starting from zero, which some of our cable competitors are. But I think this whole arena is why really you're going to see several things. All of us are having to take very, very tough measures on channels that we deem to either be less popular or new channels for that matter that not everybody can go up in price, and value for money is going to be critical. We're going to be pushing hard for greater package flexibility, and I think you're going to see much greater scrutiny over MFN [Most Favored Nation] provisions on both packaging as well as price.</p>
          <p>And lastly, I think we're a distributor or a retailer, if you will. If our suppliers raise their cost of programming to us, we need to pass it on to our consumers, and we're going have to work hard to communicate that clearly to our consumers as those cost increases come through our P&amp;L in the years ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we have time for one final question. That will come from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two questions. One, when you look at the Anatel data out of Brazil, it looks like your satellite has picked up about 6% market share, and they've taken about 72% of the net adds, and that's not just a sliver as in the U.S. That's a market that's really going vertical. I know a lot of that is just the intro of the lower end satellite services, Oi Brazil and all that. Is there a similar dynamic in the other Latin markets? And do you feel that you can grow a similar dynamic satellite relative to cable? Do you feel that you could grow as fast at the overall pay-TV market, getting your premium end concentration? Or if you go in the bottom end of the pyramid, could you grow even faster?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, one of your real beautiful points is just a gift for marketing in the commercials in the U.S., whether you're mocking either the Russians or Texans, when you look at the DTV CINEMA, it looks like you're very well positioned to take on Netflix. You can't do the all-you-can-eat proposition. Do you feel like you're getting pretty good Q-scores on the incremental marketing campaign? I'm sure you'll be talking a lot about the new user interface at your investor conference and all that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on Brazil, you're right. Satellite has taken share from cable. That's largely due I think to the number of new entrants. Oi launched; Embratel launched, so that's just &#x2013; there have been more competitors, more satellite competitors, so therefore satellite has taken more share.</p>
          <p>And I guess I would take a little issue with your position that we're purely a premium positioned product. We certainly are I think a premium product in the sense that we're somewhat aspirational and we're the product that people want to buy. But we've made a lot of headway in the last couple years moving into broader segments and into the middle market. So I do believe that we can continue to grow and that we can continue to grow faster than the market by continuing to take share, which is what we've done historically. And that goes back to my comment earlier about having better products and I think being well positioned with a great brand in the market. So as the market grows, I would look to continue to try and take share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are the other Latin markets behaving similar to Brazil in terms of satellite, just taking off, whether it be you addressing the lower end of the pyramid or whether it be comparable guys to Oi in other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somewhat because remember that two of the entrants in satellite are Telef&#xF3;nica and Telmex. Embratel is a Telmex entity. So yes, they are launching some of those services in other markets. What you don't have in some of the other markets is local telcos launching DTH so much, which is what Oi did. Now mind you, Oi uses Telef&#xF3;nica's background. It's just a turnkey service that Telef&#xF3;nica provides them. So you may see some of the local telcos doing that. But again, it's not a particularly well differentiated service. I think they view it more as an add-on, but you might see it. I haven't seen it so much yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, among other things they do well, I have to say Paul Guyardo and Jon Gieselman's marketing team I think is just world class, and they continue to come up with creative approaches to reach out to our consumers, and the whole giraffe thing became viral on the web in a huge way that I think created a good positive buzz for DIRECTV, and I expect we'll continue to see more of that in the year ahead. So we're pleased. I think it's one of the real strengths of DIRECTV and our brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How does that lace into the DIRECTV CINEMA relaunch though? Do you feel like you're getting a lot of mind share on that as an alternative to Netflix over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we plan to. But in fairness, our DIRECTV, I mean even though our pay-per-view movies are up over 30% in the quarter, you'd think we already relaunched DIRECTV CINEMA. Actually, the relaunch really happens in December; and so I would expect that you'll begin to see the impact of that more likely in the first quarter of next year when we really ramp up our advertising. We just put out some new ads that you may have seen that are specific on the whole movie thing, but they're like a week out as we finished up the NFL Sunday Ticket stuff in the quarter. So I'm very bullish about what we will be able to do with the consumer.</p>
          <p>And I certainly believe &#x2013; look, we recognize in our space we have to look very broadly at competitors and we have a lot of respect for what Netflix has done. But we intend to compete and to compete aggressively in that space. And I think you'll see a lot of that as we roll out our new DIRECTV CINEMA service in December of this year. I think that will give you a bit of a taste of where we're going. And I think the bigger metric to keep in mind is, as I said, our VOD per subscriber is less than half of what cable guys are today, much less where Netflix is, so we think it's a big revenue growth opportunity for our company.</p>
