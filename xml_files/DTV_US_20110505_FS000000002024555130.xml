          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is James and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to DIRECTV's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. It is now my pleasure to join the call over to your host, Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2011 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today are Mike White, President and CFO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, General Counsel. In a moment, I'll handle the call over to Bruce, Mike, Pat, and &#x2013; for introductory remarks but first I'll read to you the following.</p>
          <p>On this call, we'll make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in each of the DIRECTV and DIRECTV U.S.'s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC which are available at www.sec.gov. Examples of forward-looking statement include but are not limited to statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for 2011 financial results, liquidity and capital resources.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our website at DIRECTV.com.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm pleased to introduce Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this Cinco de Mayo. DIRECTV is off to a very solid start I think in 2011 as we delivered another strong quarter of operating and financial results, extending our position as the world's largest video service, while also increasing market share and profitability in both our U.S. and Latin American businesses.</p>
          <p>I suppose from my perspective, there were three main takeaways from the quarter. First, the strength of the DIRECTV brand along with our state of the art suite of products and services continues to drive strong consumer demand all across the Americas. Record-setting subscriber growth in Latin America this quarter exceeded our expectations, surpassing the previous highs set during the run-up to the World Cup last year. This considerable achievement along with solid customer gains in the U.S. culminated in a nearly doubling of consolidated net additions to 611,000, or 879,000 if you include Sky Mexico for the quarter. Strong subscriber and ARPU growth drove industry-leading top line revenue growth of 13%.</p>
          <p>Second, our disciplined approach to improving the efficiency and productivity of our operations continues to generate strong overall margins. Despite a 28% increase in consolidated gross additions and related increases in acquisition costs, we managed our expenses effectively, capturing double-digit growth in operating profit before depreciation and amortization of 12%. And third, the strength and continuing stability of our earnings and cash flow continue to create significant value for our shareholders. We improved our net income by 21% and we repurchased $1.4 billion of the $6 billion our Board authorized in February earlier this year, fueling a lift in earnings per share of 44% to $0.85 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn the call over to both Pat and Bruce for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American businesses, let me offer just a few other observations about both the U.S. and Latin America. Let me start with the DIRECTV U.S. Consumer demand for DIRECTV remained solid, as net additions exceeded expectations by increasing 84% from the prior year to 184,000. The value of new subscribers remains high, as nearly 80% of gross additions signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter. Revenues from both advanced services and market share gains were key contributors to our 8% revenue growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also contributing were two of the key initiatives that we identified as new growth opportunities as you'll recall at our Investor Day in December. We saw nearly 20% growth in commercial sales in the quarter, and DIRECTV CINEMA movie buys were at an all-time high. I'm also pleased with the way we managed our costs during the quarter. We generated the highest pre-SAC margin ever for a first quarter at 38.4%. Our OPBDA growth of 4% reflects the increase in gross additions and advanced products, and is consistent with our full year guidance. So overall, I think a very solid quarter for DIRECTV U.S. to start the new year.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn to Latin America though, let me just point out that as we exited the first quarter, we did see an uptick in the competitive landscape as new customer promotions offered by both cable and telcos were more aggressive. To the extent these trends continue, we will see a modest impact on churn and net adds for the year. However, an increase in competitive activity was fully contemplated when we put our 2011 guidance together, and we're still on track to hit our key metrics for the U.S. business.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Latin America, we knew that the economic, demographic and subscriber trends in Latin America were favorable, but I think it's fair to say the net additions of 427,000 far exceeded all of our expectations. Not only did we nearly double the net additions of a year ago, but we surpassed the historic customer growth recorded during the run-up to the FIFA World Cup last year. The distribution of wealth continues to shift towards the emerging middle class in Latin America, which happens to be the demographic sweet spot for any pay television service. We have a unique ability to sell superior offerings of our differentiated products and services on a continent-wide basis at a lower cost versus our competition.</p>
          <p>This is particularly true in Brazil, where it seems we report record growth almost every quarter. For a bit more perspective, the quarter by was by far Brazil's best ever as gross adds were more than double the level of a year ago, and 73% higher than we saw in the second quarter of 2010 when we were heading into the World Cup.</p>
          <p>In addition to Brazil, we're seeing solid growth in other countries as well, including Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Equally impressive was the 14 basis point reduction in DIRECTV Latin America's post-paid churn rate this quarter to 1.43%, a level even lower than we see here in the U.S. This is due in large part to the relatively stable macroeconomic conditions in the region along with the strength of both our brand and our service.</p>
          <p>With this strong subscriber growth and a nearly 12% increase in ARPU, revenue growth accelerated to 43% in the quarter. Importantly, this gain in market share did not come at the expense of profitability, as our OPBDA margin improved by 320 basis points, and operating profit before depreciation and amortization grew 57%. With this strong start, I'm even more bullish about our growth prospects in Latin America and in a few minutes, Bruce will provide you an update on our full year outlook for DTVLA.</p>
          <p>In summary, our first quarter results for DIRECTV reflect the continued execution of our financial and strategic initiatives that we outlined in December. Furthermore, the combination of both the DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America businesses provides the framework for what I think is a truly unique investment opportunity in our industry. By leveraging DIRECTV U.S., a business that provides solid and consistent returns in a more mature marketplace with DIRECTV Latin America, an asset that's outperforming all growth benchmarks, we offer a rare diversified growth opportunity for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The significant impact that DIRECTV Latin America is having on our consolidated results is particularly evident in our first quarter results where DTVLA was a key factor in driving DIRECTV's double-digit revenue and OPBDA growth rates. And at the same time, we're continuing to return cash through stock repurchases at an industry-leading clip. So with this strong start to the new year, we're well positioned to meet or exceed the full year guidance for all of our key metrics that provided at Investor Day.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll ask Bruce to review DTV Latin America's results and outlook, and then Pat will talk about the U.S. business. Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. As you can see from our results, 2011 has started off pretty much like last year ended. DIRECTV Latin America delivered yet another record quarter in both gross and net additions, and all our key metrics showed strong year-over-year improvement. Just a reminder, unless otherwise noted, our results exclude those of Sky Mexico, which we do not consolidate.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, gross additions of 765,000 were 55% higher than last year. In Brazil, Sky achieved record levels of gross additions, growing 123% compared to Q1 2010, mostly on the popularity of our middle market products. These products represented approximately 65% of our gross additions in Brazil for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In PanAmericana, gross additions were also strong, growing 16% compared to Q1 of 2010. While not as impressive as Brazil, you need to remember that in Q1 of last year &#x2013; or rather Q1 of last year included the beneficial effect of the FIFA World Cup and in 2011, we have been operating under a controlled growth strategy in Venezuela. If you exclude Venezuela, PanAmericana gross additions grew 23% versus last year, with Argentina in particular delivering strong year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>Pre-paid gross additions represented 16% of our 765,000 gross additions in the quarter. Cumulatively, pre-paid subscribers make up slightly more than 10%, or 6.2 million subscribers, and are predominantly in the PanAmericana region. Advanced products represented only about 18% of new customers, which is down significantly compared to last year. There are really two factors which explain this figure.</p>
          <p>First, take rates of advanced products in PanAmericana decreased 31% year-over-year, which reflects the fact that in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, we ran aggressive advanced product promotions and achieved take rates of approximately 30%. Second, as we continue to see sales growth in lower priced packages, by definition advanced products become a smaller part of the mix. For example, in Brazil, the number of advanced product sales increased almost threefold compared to last year, but as a percent of total sales, advanced products were roughly flat year-on-year because of the tremendous growth in the other products.</p>
          <p>Overall, approximately 26% of our 6.2 million consolidated subscribers now have advanced products, and they remain an important part of our product mix and something we remain very focused on selling. The growth of the middle market notwithstanding, we he have not lost sight of the fact that our traditional A and B households are our most profitable customers and the ones we work hard to get and keep.</p>
          <p>Turing to churn, I'm pleased with our post-paid churn for the quarter of 1.43%, which declined from the 1.57% from the same period last year. Much of this improvement came in Brazil due to improved proved customer segmentation, operational improvements, and the benefits of favorable macroeconomic trends. In addition, Venezuela contributed to our improved churn due to fewer sales and a renewed focus on churn in the context of the controlled growth strategy.</p>
          <p>With regard to our pre-paid services, our recharge rates are in line with Q1 of last year but down from Q4 of 2010, which traditionally includes aggressive seasonal recharge promotions and the benefit from many second homeowners who use pre-paid accounts during the Latin American summer holidays.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with 427,000 net additions, an increase of 93% compared to the same period last year, and an all-time record for DTVLA, surpassing the record of 415,000 net adds in Q2 of last year immediately preceding the World Cup.</p>
          <p>Turning now to financial results, I think it's fair to say that the numbers are equally impressive. Driven by strong subscriber growth, revenues increased 43% compared to last year and approximately 40% if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. ARPU was almost up almost 12%, principally reflecting higher pricing and penetration of premium packages. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU would have increased around 9%.</p>
          <p>OPBDA and cash flow before interest and taxes for the quarter were also stronger compared to last year. OPBDA increased $140 million or 58% over last year, mostly due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber acquisition costs related to the increase in gross additions. Cash flow before interest and taxes of $157 million increased $91 million, reflecting higher OPBDA partially offset by higher subscriber-related CapEx. In addition, we received a $43 million dividend from Sky Mexico in the quarter versus $16 million last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding Venezuela, the government continues to tightly regulate the repatriation of local profits out of the country. This situation restricts our ability to repatriate dollars which explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year compared to last. In fact, we incurred no repatriation charges from Venezuela this quarter. The modest funds that did come out of Venezuela this quarter came out at official rates through the official Central Bank process. As of March 31, we had approximately $197 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official rate of 4.3 bol&#xED;vars per U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>I never like to leave this call without reminding all of you to be sure to take note of the results of Sky Mexico that were released by Televisa a few weeks ago. Sky Mexico delivered another strong quarter, adding 268,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared to 238,000 a year ago, and financial results of Sky Mexico were equally strong as revenue and OPBDA grew 22% and 36% respectively.</p>
          <p>In total then, the DTVLA platforms combined, including Sky Mexico, now serve approximately 9.5 million subscribers in the region. We should comfortably surpass the 10 million mark by the middle of the year.</p>
          <p>And finally, in light of our record Q1 results, I would like to give you my updated perspective on the 2011 guidance I provided back in December at our Investor Day. Back in December, I gave you both a three-year outlook as well as some fairly specific guidance for how I thought 2011 would shape up. I'm not going to change my three-year outlook on just one quarter, but clearly the results year-to-date beg the question about what our view on the rest of 2011 is.</p>
          <p>Barring any unforeseen change in the general macroeconomic environment in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, and barring any large swings in foreign exchange rates, again particularly in Brazil, we now expect both full year revenue and OPBDA to grow closer to 30% year-on-year versus the 20% we indicated last December. As assumed last December, this OPBDA growth rate excludes the effect of any repatriation costs in Venezuela. We believe these numbers are achievable in light of the continued strong growth we are seeing in sales and the continued performance on churn.</p>
          <p>We now expect total net additions to be in the 1.250 million to 1.5 million range as opposed to the 1 million figure we indicated last December. As a result, there will be a modest increase in the total capital expenditures of $1 billion that we had stated previously. In short, we look forward to another exceptional year in Latin America.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Pat to comment on the U.S. Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. Overall, I thought DIRECTV U.S. had a very good quarter as we continued to generate strong subscriber growth while focusing on productivity and efficiencies to maintain solid margins. Looking first at subscribers, net additions exceeded our internal projection, delivering 184,000 new customers. This performance represents an 84% lift from last year's level and the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement.</p>
          <p>Gross additions were strong, up 14%, as every major sales channel had a greater contribution than the prior year period, except the telco channel. Particularly strong results were seen in our commercial and consumer electronics channels, which more than doubled this quarter compared to a year ago. Our percentage of gross additions taking advanced products was nearly 80% for the second consecutive quarter, and over two-thirds of these subscribers signed up for both HD and DVR services. Also about half of new subscribers signed up for Auto Bill Pay, or about double the rate of a year ago. Our data shows that customers with Auto Bill Pay tend to churn at lower rates.</p>
          <p>Churn in the quarter of 1.5% was up two basis points over last year due mostly to a slight increase in voluntary churn, reversing a trend we saw over the last three quarters. We attribute this slight uptick to a couple of factors. First, in the back half of the quarter, the marketing and promotional intensity from our competitors increased. We are seeing more aggressive cash back offers, triple play bundle promotions without contractual commitment, and lower entry price points. Second, we instituted a price increase in February that for the first time raised rates for both programming packages and our lease fees.</p>
          <p>As you've heard us say before, there's a close correlation between our upgrade and retention spending and churn rate, and this relationship is heavily influenced by both the economic and competitive conditions. We will continue to manage this trade-off in an economically prudent fashion. As such, we will continue to prioritize our best offers to our best customers, while proactively managing higher risk customers by utilizing specially trained customer service agents to effectively communicate the value of our differentiated products.</p>
          <p>Tuning now to the top line, our industry-leading revenue growth of 8% was solid and driven mostly by market share gains and ARPU growth of 3.9%. In addition to growth related to price increases, we had strong results in commercial sales as well as premium and pay-per-view movie sales. Commercial revenues grew almost 20%, while pay-per-view movie buys for DIRECTV CINEMA reached an all-time high this quarter, with revenues up nearly 30% year-over-year.  We had a solid quarter in the premium movie channel category as well, where for the fourth consecutive quarter, our buy rates per customer increased over the prior year.</p>
          <p>ARPU growth has also benefited from the increased penetration by both new and existing customers paying for advanced services, where approximately two-thirds of our customers now have advanced products. Partially offsetting these favorable trends in the quarter was lower sports ARPU, mainly related to the absence of the Mega March Madness package and the Pacquiao fight in the prior period.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at to the bottom line and in particular our pre-SAC margin of 38.4% which represented a new first quarter high and marked a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. The larger contributor to this increase was upgrade and retention marketing, which from a cash perspective was slightly lower than the prior year. Tying back to our earlier discussion about churn management, in retrospect, we probably should have spent a touch more in the quarter upgrading and retaining customers. As such, we are looking to modestly increase retention spending in subsequent quarters, assuming of course that the economics are favorable and the spending is targeted toward higher value subscribers.</p>
          <p>Also contributing to the higher margin was a one-time benefit recognized in G&amp;A related to an adjustment to our property taxes, which was larger than the one-time benefit gained a year ago due to a legal settlement. The G&amp;A cost category often includes these kinds of non-recurring items, making it difficult to predict cost trends. However, from a budgeting perspective, we establish targets so that G&amp;A costs will grow more slowly than revenues. The higher gross additions combined with the related increase in subscriber acquisition costs led to the decline in op today OPBDA margin. However, OPBDA growth of 4% was in line with our internal projections and full year guidance.</p>
          <p>Looking quickly at our quarterly consolidated results, net income grew 22% to $682 million and diluted earnings per share improved 44% to $0.85. Also in the quarter, we recognized a $16 million after-tax gain on the sale of a 5% interest in the Game Show Network, reducing our ownership stake to 60%. Additionally, it's worth noting that our tax provision in the quarter benefited from previously unrecognized foreign tax credits.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was down in the quarter due to higher working capital requirements, cash interest payments related to the increase in long-term debt, and higher cash tax payments. The increase in interest and tax payments is expected to continue throughout the year, but that is not the case for working capital which is expected to be a favorable source of cash in the second half of the year. The working capital increase in the quarter was primarily driven by higher inventory levels that meet consumer demand compared with the HD box shortage we experienced last year, as well as the timing of vendor payments. Said another way, we're expecting solid growth of roughly 10% in consolidated cash flow before interest and taxes this year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, this quarter we repurchased 32 million shares of DIRECTV stock for $1.41 billion, bringing cumulative repurchases to over $16 billion or 46% of shares outstanding. Additionally, we syndicated a $2 billion unsecured revolver to replace the expiring $500 million secured credit facility, issued $4 billion of investment grade notes, and tendered for $341 million of outstanding high yield notes. With these transactions, we ended the quarter with about $14 billion in total debt, while reaching our total debt to U.S. OPBDA leverage ratio target of two and a half times.</p>
          <p>Before wrapping up, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook. First and foremost, all the guidance that we provided at our Investor Day remains intact. For DIRECTV U.S., our revenue outlook of mid to high single-digit growth is expected to come in fairly evenly throughout the year. Please remember that the same cannot be said about our OPBDA margins, which we expect to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half, primarily due to higher programming costs. We continue to expect programming costs per subscriber growth in the high single digit-range this year, mainly due to higher costs related to the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, regional sports networks, and the new retrans agreements.</p>
          <p>Regarding subscriber growth, as you've heard earlier from Mike, we've seen an uptick in the competitive landscape and as such, we're expecting gross additions to be relatively flat to slightly down, and churn to be modestly higher for the remainder of the year. Both of these estimates are relative to the prior year results. I'd like to repeat that these estimates for DIRECTV U.S. are consistent with our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>The same cannot be said for DIRECTV Latin America which, as Bruce explained a few minutes ago, is even more bullish about its 2011 results. And as such, they are increasing their full year guidance for most of their key metrics.</p>
          <p>Finally, we will continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. We expect to continue repurchasing shares in the same $100 million plus per week range that you've seen in recent quarters. If we're successful in meeting all of these targets, we expect to continue leading the industry in double-digit revenue and OPBDA growth as well as returning capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Before moving on to the Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in a listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media, they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either, directly or in substance, other than the representatives of DIRECTV. In addition, we are broadcasting this on the Internet and an archive copy will be kept on our website.</p>
          <p>So with that, Operator, we're ready for the first question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually I have a few questions for Bruce given the strong performance down in Latin America. Does the guidance that you laid out, 30% revenue and EBITDA growth, include any repatriation expenses for the remainder of the year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to exclude it from last year as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then if I'm running your guidance right, it implies that ARPU barely grows the rest of the year after strong growth in the first quarter. So could you just talk about the ARPU flow and why the change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you look at the ARPU in this quarter versus last quarter, it actually hasn't grown that much probably other than the impact of some foreign exchange. There's been continued strengthening of the Brazilian <mark type="ph" /> reais (29:29). So I think as we've discussed &#x2013; you know, I discussed at the Investor Day and I've said a few times, I said in general, our long-term view on ARPU is that it is sort of flat to down just because as we sell more and more of these middle market packages, that offsets to some extent the benefit we're getting from higher ARPU and price penetration with our A and B households to whom we're selling advanced products. So I think that's sort of- if you look at it sequentially, I don't think the change is all that dramatic.</p>

          <p>Just on currency alone, Doug, by the time you get to the fourth quarter, you're lapping at different currencies. So you've got to model the currency stuff if you want to get that specific.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Because I was just taking the <mark type="ph" /> 60 and (30:15) moving it forward, and you still have easy comps the next couple quarters, but I got it. And then I guess the last is given the record at add growth, could you talk once again about the source of the sub growth? I think in the past you talked about gaining share from cable. Can you give us a split between share gains versus market growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to be too specific about that. I would say that it is true that in Brazil in this particular this last quarter, we had actually quite a bit of share gain. Those figures are actually publicly available. And if you look at &#x2013; because we're required to report them, but I believe something in the order of the DTH market in general took something like 90% of all the new subs in the market in the quarter, and that Sky took a disproportionate share of that, something like more than half. So definitely share gains is a big part of the story and I would say that's also true in Argentina.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, we'll make it two in a row. I have a question about Latin America for Bruce as well. As I think about this business growing scale so much more quickly than I think most of us had projected, how do I think about the long-term margins of this business? We don't really understand &#x2013; at least we personally don't really know the elements of the cost structure in Latin America quite as well as I do in the U.S. to say whether there are any material differences, and whether there might be some scale benefits in programming for example, as you get bigger and renegotiate? How do we think about those kind of margins longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, let me start and then I'll let Bruce kind of come in, Craig. Look, we have a remarkable business. Kind of the big scale benefit has been the run-up over the last five years as we came out of the bankruptcy. You know, we really have gained substantial scale, but we have very, very favorable margins today that are comparable or better than the U.S. all across the P&amp;L. So it's not like there's a big &#x2013; I would say kind of one item or whatever where we're going to cross some other scale threshold.</p>
          <p>I mean we're at scale now. We have &#x2013; programming costs just like in the U.S. tend to be more variable than fixed. So I'm not sure &#x2013; I mean with the kind of OPBDA margins that we already have down there, which are quite attractive and comparable to anything you'd see in the U.S., I'm not sure I'd see another big uptick there. But, Bruce, I don't know if you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I agree with that. And I think that the nature of the margin may be a little bit different in the &#x2013; first of all, on the programming side, we actually enjoyed better programming margins in Latin America than the U.S. We don't like have anything like for example, the SUNDAY TICKET that we have to absorb. That's &#x2013; at the moment we don't have anything like retrans. So on the programming side, we definitely have a stronger position and yes, there's probably some potential there to improve it a little bit, but we're topping out on a lot of these deals at the moment.</p>
          <p>I would say that the benefit we receive there is offset by the fact that we do operate in multiple different countries so we don't get a lot of the scale benefits from some of the other sides of the business that you see in the U.S., for example, into some of the other cost items. So that's why in the end, the margins are still maybe marginally better, but I would agree with Mike. I wouldn't see a big secular jump of any kind as we grow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask Mike about the connected box strategy. I don't think you discussed it in your prepared remarks. I think you had mentioned last quarter targeting something around 2 million subs this year and getting to 40% of the base down the road. And I wanted to just get an update on how that's going? And in the context of that, if you're seeing it come in cheaper than you thought? The subscriber acquisition cost per add this quarter was a little lower than we were expecting. Just trying to figure if that's related to that, and then I have one follow-up for Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Ben, I think that we're very pleased with the progress we're making. We crossed the million mark. Our goal is to get to 2 million. But we're getting some learnings kind of in terms of the operational aspects. You get to a home and maybe they think they have a router but they don't, or maybe we get there ahead of our telco partner, in which case we've got to make sure that everything gets kind of connected. So you know, we've had some learnings I would say in the first quarter, but we're on track to where we wanted to go, maybe a little bit shy of our 2 million goal for the year, but we've already crossed a million. I think we'll continue to accelerate that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost of the program, I don't know that I would say it's the cheaper at the moment. I mean we've got a number of things where we may get to some scale on some of the stuff later in the year, but I would say the &#x2013; I wouldn't necessarily say that the lower SAC was connected to our connected box strategy, frankly. I think it's other factors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And, Pat, I don't know if I should be parsing your words this finely, but your 10% free cash flow growth consolidated target and that's cash flow before interest and taxes, I think that would suggest your U.S. EBITDA growth is coming in towards the higher end of that low to mid growth rate? Just because of the comments about the Latin American CapEx, which I think offsets some of the Latin American EBITDA performance. I wanted to ask that and see if you could give us color at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ben, I think you're reading a little bit more into that. I think we're again comfortable with our guidance we gave for the U.S. which is EBITDA growth in the low to mid single-digit growth.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Maybe a couple of quantifications and then a bigger picture question. On the quantifications, you talked about some impacts to ARPU including March Madness and then the Pacquiao fight. If you could maybe just sort of break that out for us and how much that hit you by? And then second, on the upgrade and retention costs, you talked about it needing to move higher. I guess in your mind, how light were you in the quarter and what's sort of the run rate we get back to?</p>
          <p>And then I guess just bigger picture question, in the U.S., obviously sort of the content cost trajectory probably reinforces benefits of scale here. And considering recent events where we've seen the announcement of a big deal in U.S. wireless, so it was really I think previously perceived to be problematic from a regulatory standpoint, but it was announced and framed in the right way. Does this cause you to think differently about your either ability or desire to think about acquisitions of either satellite assets or subscribers in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I'll take those. Pat, you can chime in on the first two as I go through them. I think first on the ARPU, look, there were a bunch of puts and takes in the quarter and I don't know if it's true for our competitors or not, but 80% of our ARPU is kind of the core business and then there's 20% of other stuff, which is everything from torts to premiums to protection plan to commercial to you name it. Actually we had nice ARPU growth on our core business, consistent with the pricing that we took in the quarter that actually was north of 5%. So some of the other stuff, we didn't quite get the growth, ad sales, all the rest of that in the quarter that we're expecting to get kind of later in the year.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but I think our guidance on ARPU &#x2013; we haven't given guidance on ARPU, but we're comfortable with where we came out in the quarter. Yeah, there wasn't a pay-per-view event and there was a year ago, and March Madness also helped us on the cost side so &#x2013; you know, that change. But I think we're directionally in about the right place on ARPU. We're managing our pricing kind of very responsibly given the increase in programming costs. We took a fair amount pricing, more than I would have liked for our customers but frankly, less than the content costs that we're being hit with. So we're quite comfortable. I think we're taking a responsible approach to that.</p>
          <p>In terms of upgrade and retention, I think Pat said we were down slightly in the quarter, maybe we should have been up slightly in the quarter. I don't see it as a dramatic shift, but here at DIRECTV, we have tons of metrics. We are constantly looking at the dials and we want to make sure that if we're going to spend more money on retention, that we're spending it on high quality subs and not business that's not that profitable that we don't want to chase. The industry has become very promotional and we're trying to be very disciplined in how we do that. I don't know, Pat, if there's anything else you want to add on ARPU or upgrade retention, then I'll come back to the last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think on the two items that I mentioned in my notes, they were probably &#x2013; cost us about half a percentage point of growth just from those two items. And as Mike said, on upgrade and retention, we're constantly looking at our customer offers there, the quality of the customers we're offering, types of behavior that we're trying to encourage. So I think in the first quarter, we made some changes that we thought were the best for business in the way of value, some of them probably we got a little bit more of a reaction from them than we expected and then we react to that. So like Mike said, it's a constant, dynamic process of looking at our base, deciding what kind of behaviors we're trying to encourage, and then adjusting to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we're going to disciplined. We're not going to chase bad business. I think on the other question, look, we spent a day in December laying out I thought a very compelling strategy for DIRECTV, with a particular focus on things like how we address the bundle challenge, how we address TV Everywhere, how we just fixed our commercial &#x2013; our targeted advertising and our movies business, and we're on track with that strategy. I feel very good about our strategy.</p>
          <p>Obviously the external environment's always changing and so you're always kind of looking at the external environment and seeing if you have to make any tweaks. If we decide to make a big change in our strategy, we'll come talk to you about it. But I don't think it's productive for me to comment on acquisitions or rumors or whatever else.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. First just to follow up on the competitive question, is the increase in your competitive <mark type="ph" /> capture (42:17) you're seeing, is that more on a sort of regional basis or something you're seeing sort of broadly across the U.S.? And then at this point obviously you might not want to say much, but are there plans to respond to maintain the gross add that we saw in the first quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, you mentioned that the telco channel had not really improved. Can you explain maybe a little bit about some of the recent trends there? Is that something that it maybe didn't shape up as quite as effectively as you thought it would? Or is it just the sort of a normal course of business as these companies build out their own telco infrastructure, and maybe how you expect that to evolve over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I would say we analyze the kind of both churn and gross adds by region quite carefully and I wouldn't say there was one particular region. In fact, it looked like it was pretty across the board. I think a little bit more focused on bundles, whether they're telco bundles or cable bundles, but some of the pricing on that stuff has gotten pretty aggressive. But I wouldn't say it was one geography. I'd say it's pretty broad-based, particularly fiber territories where you've seen a bit more competitiveness.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross adds, our gross adds were fine in the quarter. I don't think our issue is gross adds. We've got plenty of people knocking on our door that want to take our service. I think our branding is strong. Our marketing is strong. So we're quite happy with the gross adds. It's just you look at the full year and you look at overlaps and everything else, we set a goal in December.</p>
          <p>I think we laid it out and said look, given the strength of the year we had last year and we had a great first quarter but I think as we look at the full year, we're on track to the guidance that we directed you to in terms of gross adds. So I don't see gross adds as something I've got to go chase. We feel quite comfortable with the marketing that we've got and the consumer demand for our service.</p>
          <p>The telco channel is right in line with our targets. There's nothing kind of there out of our plans. What's happening is &#x2013; as subs coming from Verizon or AT&amp;T fall off a bit, our growth with our partners, our new partners, Frontier and CenturyLink, has been quite strong. So net-net, it's a pretty mature channel I would say in total, but there's some shifts going on within the channel. But it's performing right in line with our expectations. Got anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think on gross adds, I mean just so you know, even in the first quarter and into the second quarter, we've also done some things that have put a little bit of a governor on gross adds as relates to quality. And as Mike said, when you've got a competitive environment and some of these heavy promotional offers, we find that there's certain segments of the population out there that if you give out those types of promotional offers, they'll really not give us a return that's acceptable. So even during that time, again, we love to have growth but we're also kind of trying to make sure it's really profitable growth.</p>
          <p>And then on telco, yeah, there's nothing unusual there. I think as we've said before, if you just look at the land lines of particularly Verizon and AT&amp;T, as they lose land lines, that's kind of how they sell out product. So this is nothing from telco. It's not like we're disappointed. I mean it's actually a very good channel and it does well. It just has some certain built-in issues there that we expect and we plan for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on two topics that we just discussed. On the telco channel, can you discuss where you are right now with your deals to sell fiber HSD and how that's working? And if it hasn't started, maybe you could talk about your optimism around selling a fiber-based HSD product with your core video product?</p>
          <p>And just with respect to the operating environment and the pricing environment, do you see the pricing or the promotional pricing that you are seeing right now as a <mark type="ph" /> C change (46:54)? I mean the competition ebbs and flows, but do you see the competition change, the nature of the change that you're seeing right now is more pronounced than in prior periods? In other words, do you see it as incrementally worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's kind of the same point. I mean I think competition does ebb and flow, which is why I always believe it's competitive out there and it's certainly competitive out there right now. I don't think we've seen something dramatically different than we've seen before. I think it was that way in December when I was ramping on to the DIRECTV team. So I mean look, it's always competitive out there. It seems like it's gotten a tad more competitive in the last few months but gosh, I don't remember a time where it's not been competitive.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't say there's anything dramatically different that folks are doing that we haven't seen before. We're  still getting great demand for our product, strong gross adds, it's really been more a little bit of a churn factor. And frankly, as I said, we're making a very careful kind of decision looking at the quality of the subs as to what we will &#x2013; what business we want to retain and what we won't. So &#x2013; and that's a constant kind of &#x2013; it's a constant effort here at DIRECTV is kind of tweaking the levers if you will, as it relates to churn.</p>
          <p>In terms of the question again on the telco channel was &#x2013; we're already selling &#x2013; I mean we're already capable of selling fiber, but the ability for our call centers to sell one bundle I think is in June. So we'll see how that goes as we ramp it up this year. I think it's an important element in our arsenal strategically for those consumers that want higher speed bundles, that they have access it to. So we're optimistic about that. But I would say it hasn't made a material impact up to this point in terms of our telco channel one way or the other. But I think you really won't see the impact of it until we get the full integrated bundle that our care or sales agent can sell, which will probably be Q3, and then we'll have a more compelling marketing story to go with it.</p>

          <p>Thanks, two questions. Pat, now that you've hit your target leverage ratio of two and a half times and it sounds like you took out some high yield debt, is there any change to your outlook as to when you can wrap Lat Am in to your overall leverage ratio? And then, Mike, any comments on premium VOD, preliminary thoughts you can share on take rates and the price point?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean on the leverage, yeah, we were very pleased with our last offering. We went probably a little bit bigger in size than we had anticipated going in, because the demand was high and the pricing was very good. So really it put us in a great position. We're now sitting with cash on hand that will clearly fund our share repurchase program for the rest of the year and maybe into 2012. So we're still &#x2013; got the Latin America on our roadmap of bringing into the credit. It's probably something kind of late 2011 when we address that as we start to think about kind of the next round of financing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry about that. Thanks for taking the question, one for Bruce and one for Pat, actually. Bruce, on the ARPU side, I was actually a little surprised at &#x2013; that the growth was 9% ex currency. That's strong given that you're going to middle markets and I would assume that would tend to be a downward drag on ARPU. Can you talk a little bit about how those moving pieces work in terms of how much impact the mix shift is having and also versus countries versus increases spend on a sort of apples-to-apples per customer basis?</p>
          <p>And Pat, for the U.S., similar to our ARPU conversation,  you talked a little bit about what if you're seeing &#x2013; and I know it's early, any sort of delta in terms of spend for customers who have connected boxes versus customers who have the same piece of hardware, the same setup, who don't have connected boxes? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll start. We talked a little bit about this earlier. I guess the first point I would make is when you're looking at prices, I think looking at Q1 of this year versus Q1 of last year tends to make you forget what happened in the interim. So if you look at Q4, the bump-up hasn't been that dramatic. And as discussed previously, you are right that the increased sales in middle market products does tend to have a dampening effect of ARPU growth.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we still obviously pretty actively manage overall ARPU. We do put through price increases at least once a year in pretty much every market. In high inflation markets, we tend to do it more often than that. So we're able to keep our prices up at least in &#x2013; at least with inflation if not slightly above that. And then we are still investing pretty heavily in advanced products, both in &#x2013; still in standard def DVRs in some markets, and HD and HD DVRs in Brazil and some of the other markets as well. So that's the countervailing effect to the middle market pressure.</p>
          <p>So longer term, I think our &#x2013; as I've said, my view is that the ARPU growth will be sort of flat, flat to down over time, but that just reflects more mix than anything else. And again, that's of course leaving aside any broad swings in foreign exchange.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then yeah, James, on the connected boxes, I think As Mike said, we're &#x2013; it's still kind of early into that process and learning a lot. You know, we've got now kind of two quarters where we've been aggressive at connecting. Yeah, we certainly have empirical data that shows us that we do get higher usage and more pay-per-view activity. But I think until we get a little bit more scale and size to be able to evaluate that, we won't be able to make any conclusion. But at least preliminarily it's doing what we had expected it to do.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you very much for taking the question. So I guess for Bruce, as I look at the dynamics of the Latin American market in terms of post-paid and pre-paid, it just seems like Brazil clearly has been gravitating to the post-paid, and as I recall, the economics of the pre-paid in PanAmericana is also pretty attractive. I guess the question is how do you see that divergence playing out? Do you have any kind of proactive targeted marketing to kind of shift the mix in some kind of desirable way? So that's number one.</p>
          <p>And separately, you guys haven't called out a 3D channel launch as of late. So is that a function of some kind of just overall slow takeoff in that technology? I know there's been a lot of noise on the CE front so any kind of update would be helpful. And I have a follow-up before I'm cut off. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just on the pre-paid versus post-paid, you're absolutely right. And actually in Brazil, as it turns out, even our lower priced packages are mostly in post-paid and that seems to be largely a phenomena of the market. We just really frankly haven't got a lot of traction with pre-paid even though we offer it in Brazil. And part of that is probably because Brazil happens to have one of the more sophisticated banking systems in all of Latin America and many consumers, even those just emerging into the middle class, have access to the banking system. And therefore, the idea of having a monthly subscription does appeal to them. And the benefit there is they have no up front costs or very &#x2013; lower up front costs to get into the service.</p>
          <p>So I think the way to think about pre-paid versus post-paid isn't necessarily a distinction between lower price and higher price packages. It's really just a method of payment and it's something we offer our consumers who have different tastes and I think they are different segments and people in different situations to whom either pre-paid or post-paid appeals. It happens &#x2013; it just so happens that in some of the other countries that happen to be in PanAmericana, particularly probably Venezuela, the pre-paid seems to be very appealing and &#x2013; for whatever reason. And a lot of it is just consumer-driven.</p>
          <p>As far as managing the mix, we don't &#x2013; I don't get too concerned about that because what we do up front is to make sure that the return on investment, whether it's a pre-paid product or a post-paid product, are equally attractive so that we're able to sell as much of either one as we can without having to worry that we're potentially damaging our margins or ultimately our returns on capital. So the nice advantage we have is that we can sell something that suits each individual consumer without having to get too hung up about how much post-paid versus pre-paid we sell.</p>

          <p>Yeah, the consumer electronics channel, we've had a terrific partnership with Best Buy in particular and we're very pleased. We've made some changes in how we sell in Best Buy stores with the staffing and it's paying off big time. So I think it's as much or more focus on that channel that's helped us out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean the CE channel has really performed well. They tend to be &#x2013; by the way, very, very high value customers, very high LTV customers as well that we are taking in from that channel. So we're real pleased with the performance. We made changes in how it worked together with Best Buy in particular and it's paying dividends for us.</p>
          <p>3D continues to be a part of the offering. We've got the n3D channel. And I think though you really need to see a lot more 3D television sets sold to build scale in that longer term, and it's still a relatively small percentage of our total subscribers that have 3D television sets.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just lastly, quick follow-up, Mike, there seems to be some perception out there rightly or wrongly, maybe you can clear this up and the minds of investors, that should be there an NFL lockout, that DIRECTV may in fact be by far and away the most exposed to this. So if you can address that? Any potential mitigating factors that you have in place, and without getting into details of the contract obviously, but any commentary that you can make along those lines would be helpful. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the NFL situation obviously is very fluid and I don't have a better crystal ball than anyone else. We have an excellent partnership with the NFL, we expect that partnership to continue. It's very hard &#x2013; I could give you 100 scenarios in terms of what may happen or not happen over the next three, six or nine months. I think we've talked about, Pat, in the past about what the contractual provisions are. Suffice it to say, I would say probably on our Q2 call we can talk a little more as we get into kind of toward Q3 what the impact may be.</p>
          <p>I mean clearly we are working on contingency plans for third quarter. We will have a marketing pitch in the event that we're not able to do our normal start of season, which we strategically do in third quarter. Last year I think out of the million odd gross adds we had in the third quarter, I don't know, 25% of them maybe took the NFL package in the quarter. So I think there's some risk, but we've always had strong promotions so I don't frankly expect you could take that number and say well, that's not &#x2013; we're going to lose that many gross adds in Q3. I think it's very premature.</p>
          <p>We've got a strong promotion that we've got set up. The truth is if the season is delayed, most of the stuff ends up pro rata. Maybe there's a little bit of an impact on our gross adds and our P&amp;L. But it's probably &#x2013; if it's kind of modestly delayed, it's not a big deal. If there's no season, it probably helps our P&amp;L, hurts our cash flow a little bit. But I don't know, Pat, if there's more you want to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's right. I think if it's a loss season because we wouldn't be reporting any NFL programming costs in 2011, it actually helps us and improves our P&amp;L as Mike said on the cash flow side. To the extent that the NFL asks for the optional payment, which is part of some of these court cases as well, cash flow is worse, not dramatically, but slightly worse than our internal plan today. So it's not &#x2013; nothing in there is dramatic. Like Mike said, the bigger issue is really just trying to get an offer out to customers with an uncertainty about the season is the thing that we're trying to...</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Tom Eagan with Collins Stewart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. With higher content and sports costs, any thoughts to investing in a regional sports network or investing more in a regional sports network? We're seeing Time Warner Cable do that in L.A. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom, I mean those two don't go hand in hand actually. I think the higher the sports cost, the less attractive the investment probably is to anybody except for the teams, the owners and the leagues. But I think &#x2013; look, we've said before, I think Derek [Chang] said it at our December meeting, sports costs are increasing in an unsustainable way. I mean I don't think you can get consumers to pay these increases that we're seeing. It's quite concerning.</p>
          <p>We have a terrific regional sports network team. We look at opportunities. We have looked at opportunities. Frankly for the most part, the pricing from a shareholder value standpoint has turned out into several things that we've looked at in the last year to not be attractive for our shareholders. But we'll continue to be opportunistic in looking at things. If there was an opportunity in terms of regional sports network city or team or whatever, we'll take a look at it.</p>
          <p>We'd love to expand our footprint from where we are, but we're going to do it in a disciplined way that has to create shareholder value for DIRECTV shareholders. And it seems at the moment, as I said, these sports costs are rising at an unsustainable rate from what I think customers are willing to pay, and that's a concern longer term.</p>

          <p>We have time for one final question. That will come from Michael McCormack with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks. Can you just sort of reconcile for us how you see sort of the elasticity demand given price increases? Obviously an uptick in churn, just wondering how much of that might be related to the price increase? And then secondly, just thinking about the investment SAC over the past several quarters, which is I'm guessing related mostly to the advanced services being installed in customers' homes. I'm trying to reconcile that against sort of higher voluntary churn. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, I mean I think clearly as kind of a &#x2013; television is an integral part of every home in America. So it tends to be a little less elastic than let's say, selling Pepsi or Fritos. But I think what &#x2013; I continue to be concerned about with the rising content costs, and with the kind of requirements that we bundle everything together including small channels, that there are consumers out there, the bottom 40% of America, that are going to have a harder and harder time for paying for pay television and that's not in anybody's interest.</p>
          <p>So I think certainly we've seen some elasticity, but our price increases were pretty consistent with most everybody else's. Now we've tried to kind of be disciplined on pricing over the years so it's not like we had a one-time step-up to kind of go after it because I think we've always felt that our pricing reflects the premium nature of our product. But we felt that we needed to be disciplined and that if content costs are going to rise at kind of those kinds of rates, that we have to be taking pricing because at the end of the day, if there's only the consumer out there to pay for this stuff, and that's what we did.</p>
          <p>In terms of the SAC, I wouldn't draw too much of a conclusion there. Keep in mind, there's kind of a time lapse here so when you start to see churn go up, those are probably longer-term customers that are churning. And so a lot of the increase in SAC that we've seen over the last year or two was in the two-year contracts that we have. So that's not really the issue. So I mean I don't &#x2013; frankly wouldn't draw any conclusion from that one way or the other.</p>
          <p>I think from the analysis that we've done, the competitiveness is across the board and we're reassessing all of our things just to make sure that we continue to be very smart and very disciplined, that &#x2013; maybe we need to, as Pat said, increase our retention spend a tad and we will do that if that's what we think is right. But we're not going to chase bad business either. We're going to stay disciplined.</p>
