          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. We distributed Baidu's Second Quarter 2008 earnings earlier today. You may find a copy of the press release on the Company's website as well as on newswire services. Today you'll hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will be joined by Peng Ye, Baidu's Chief Operating Officer, and Haoyu Shen, Baidu's Vice President of Business Operations, to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we continue, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under Safe Harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Baidu does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required under applicable law. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will be available on Baidu's Company website at ir.baidu.com.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report that in the second quarter of 2008 we exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance with 100% year-over-year growth. Operating profits showed even better progress, growing faster than revenue, and reflecting the scalability of our business model. We increased both the number of active online customers and spending per customer. Despite the devastating earthquake in mid-May, we were able to enjoy yet another extremely strong quarter.</p>
          <p>Since Baidu's inception, small and medium-sized enterprises have been our most loyal customer. Across China, those businesses were the first to understand and appreciate the value of paid search. Over the past few quarters, we have seen more large enterprises beginning to realize the value of paid search marketing. The entry of large enterprises into our customer mix has created a considerable pool of customers who can enjoy Baidu's bundled product. An expanding reliable customer base contributes to the strength and stability of our business. Our business has been privileged in the face of market turbulences such as the snowstorm of Q1 and the earthquake this past May.</p>
          <p>A new development this quarter has been the launch of My Marketing Center. Over the past few years, we have had requests from our customers for tools that will help them make better marketing decisions. My Marketing Center is a customized online platform that integrates industry information, market trends, and business and industry news. Every online marketing customer, regardless of size and spending, is given access to this platform. My Marketing Center combines Baidu's vast resources in online information to enable customers to improve their marketing strategies. So far, our customers have been quite pleased with the service.</p>
          <p>We're also always looking for ways to improve our sales and marketing strategies. One change we made in the second quarter was to consolidate three sales offices in Southern China. The set up of our Shenzhen office is progressing well and we are able to close nearby offices in Zhongshan and Foshan bringing the accounts served by those offices under the direction of Shenzhen office. We expect this will bring greater productivity to the region and better service to our customers in that area. We see this as a clear move towards greater operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>As always, at Baidu, we listen to our users and provide the product and services they demand. We recently created direct links from our home page to two of our increasingly popular services, Video Search and Hao123. Video Search directs users to video content through keyword search. Traffic to our Video Search portal has been growing rapidly. Hao123 is ending as our most popular Chinese web site and category that allow users to click through navigation to find design information.</p>
          <p>To many local Internet users, it is easier to find a design web site by click-through than typing a URL address or keyword. Hao123 is one of the most commonly used default home pages in China and is gaining traffic quickly. This site is an important supplement to our keyword search business and has contributed to improved user experience and increased of traffic.</p>
          <p>Turning now to some of our other important initiatives. Our C2C Platform is moving along as planned, and we expect a formal launch before the end of the year. We have posted some promotional activities in various test regions of China and we expect a successful launch.</p>
          <p>For Baidu's Japan operation, we continue to concentrate on product development. We anticipate this will be our focus for the remainder of 2008. Aside from the four products we have already launched in Japan, we are localizing additional products. We are happy with the progress of our Japan operations to date and look forward to further development ahead.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jennifer to go over this quarter's financial highlights with you. Jennifer, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and good evening. As you have heard from Robin, it has been an outstanding quarter for Baidu. I will now lead you through our second quarter results, highlighting a few areas with more detailed explanation.</p>
          <p>This quarter, despite some negative effects from the earthquake, we were able to generate total revenues of RMB 803 million, exceeding our top-end guidance and up 100% year-over-year. We increased our number of active online customers by approximately 41% year-over-year and increased revenue per active online marketing customer by 42% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition costs as a component of cost of revenue in the second quarter were RMB 102 million or 13% of total revenue, a small decrease from Q1 '08 and up from 11% a year ago. The increase over a year ago level reflects continued growth of our revenue contribution from Baidu Union, while the sequential minor decrease reflects normal fluctuation.</p>
          <p>Cost of revenue excluding tax were RMB 179 million representing 22% of total revenue, comparing to 25% in the corresponding period in '07. The decrease is mainly due to a decrease of benefit cost, depreciation, and operation cost as a percent of revenue reflecting improved usage of infrastructure and operational efficiency. Cost of revenue excluding tax before share-based compensation was RMB 178 million.</p>
          <p>Total operating expenses were RMB 245 million, a 95% increase from a year ago. Specifically, SG&amp;A expenses increased 86% over a year ago due to the expansion of our direct sales force and increase in customer service staff to serve our growing customer pool.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses increased 124% mainly due to an expansion in head count. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, SG&amp;A rose 75% year-over-year and R&amp;D expenses increased 123% year-over-year. As Robin mentioned, our Japan operation is progressing well. Baidu Japan incurred operating costs and expenses in the second quarter close to RMB 30 million.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have seen improved profitability this quarter, specifically adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure with RMB 377 million for the second quarter, 110% increase from a year ago period and operating profit was RMB 276 million, 114% increase over the first funding period in 2007. Both measures rose at a faster rate than revenue.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of '08, our income tax expense was approximately RMB 29 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 9.7%. Year to date, we have had effective tax rate of 8.7%. This increase in tax expense over last year is mainly due to higher taxes applied to some PRC-based subsidiaries after a tax holiday, either expired or partially elapsed.</p>
          <p>We estimate that for the remaining quarters of the year, the effective tax rate will likely be in the neighborhood of what we have seen year to date.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter was RMB 265 million, a 87% increase, year-over-year. Net income, excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was RMB 294 million, a 95% increase from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Basic and diluted EPS, excluding share-based compensation expense, were 8.6 to RMB 8.46, translating roughly $1.25 and $1.23, respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter of '08 with cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investment of RMB 1.9 billion or US $280 million.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow for the quarter was RMB 403 million, 46% increase year-over-year. Capital expenditure for the second quarter was around RMB 113 million. A portion of the capital expenditure was associated with the construction of the Baidu's new campus facility.</p>
          <p>We ended the second quarter with approximately 6,800 employees. This reflects a 2% increase over last quarter. Most of the head count increase during the quarter was in R&amp;D, while sales, marketing, and customer service staff head count remained relatively flat compared to the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>As Robin mentioned, we have consolidated two South China offices into Shenzhen office to increase efficiency. The transition to a direct sales model in Shenzhen is progressing well and we expect the productivity of local direct sales force to gradually improve in the coming quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you the topline guidance for the third quarter of '08. We currently expect the total revenues to be between 905 and RMB 935 million which would represent year-over-year growth of 82 to 88% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 13 to 16%.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, Beijing will host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. It is a big and exciting event for the country. We believe the Olympics will be beneficial in the long run to our business and the Internet industry as a whole. More people will turn to Internet to find information and more business in particular will come to appreciate the power of search in promoting their business.</p>
          <p>However, during the game period we expect that our users may spend comparatively more time watching the game and less time online to search for business-related topics. In addition, we expect that some business near Beijing will be affected and in some cases temporarily shut down. Many new regulations have been imposed to lessen traffic congestion, control pollution, and maintain tight security during the Olympics. To the extent business cannot be carried out as usual, we expect some customers will scale back their paid search marketing during the games.</p>
          <p>Due to potential altered user behavior and the possibility of scaled-back business operations, we expect modest growth in total revenues in the third quarter. We are confident, though, that are strong growth trajectory will quickly resume after the Olympics. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects by Baidu's current and preliminary view which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now turn back to the Operator to open the call to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congratulations. Obviously, you had to give your upbeat guidance just to maintain your estimates despite the fact &#x2013; or the Street estimates despite the fact that the headwind of the Olympics. Can you walk through a little bit more in detail of how you calculate or anticipate that headwind, how you factored that in? Maybe some more specifics into how that's actually calculated? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gene. This is Robin. As we mentioned in the prepared remark, we have never experienced an Olympic hosted in China, so there are some uncertainties. In the long run, I think it's going to be a huge plus to Baidu because as in for any major event, lots of people talk about information they get from online, or specifically from Baidu. So that's why more people to come to Baidu in the future.</p>
          <p>During the game time, it will probably affect about two months of a period of time starting from July 20 to September 20 where Beijing has traffic control. And even before that time, some of the factories in Beijing and the surrounding provinces and cities will shut down. And some customers do not feel the need to do online marketing during that time. Also, I think during the game period, the two-three weeks of game period, lots of people, consumers as well, spend more time watching TV and search for game-related information in weeks that work-related search volume will drop. By factoring in all of this kind of factors, we believe that Q3 guidance would be the numbers we just talked about.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning, and congrats on a good quarter. Just a question on the 3Q guidance as well, I wonder if you have seen any of the &#x2013; kind of the macro slow-down in China, some of the &#x2013; because we have been hearing news about credit tightening and SME shutting down, particularly in the Southern China region. And I don't know if you have factored any of those impacts on your guidance, and what were your view longer term in that respect and particularly any industries that you see impacted more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we understand the difficulties being in the Southern region for certain export and import related businesses, but the Baidu &#x2013; a search platform is suitable for all kinds of industries. We have a very diversified portfolio of customers plus the paid search market is still in its infancy as more and more companies realize that Baidu is the best way for them to promote their products and services. They come to us. So our Q3 guidance did not factor in any macro-economic condition for China. We believe that the strong growth of paid search in China will outweigh anything related to the macro-economy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning. Can you please discuss the progress of the developments in both Japan and C2C? I know that you discussed this briefly in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe discuss and elaborate a little bit more what kinds of products and what types of products you plan to introduce to Japan? What, if any, initial feedback has been? And could you also update us on the planned spend for the second half of '08? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. For Japan, I think our top priority is to really improve the quality of the existing four products. We have already gained good traction for our Image Search and our Video Search for Baidu.jp. And with our diligency &#x2013; working, improving the quality of our web search and blog search, I think it's going to take some time for us to really come out with a very competitive product in the mainstream Japanese search.</p>
          <p>We have shifted some of this &#x2013; the product marketing function from Tokyo to Beijing so that more people could work on those kind of &#x2013; on our products and services. We are going to open a research center in &#x2013; research and development center Shanghai later this year and initially we well &#x2013; the main purpose of that center will be to serve our Japan related search applications.</p>
          <p>Our C2C development is on track. As I mentioned, we are going to launch &#x2013; do a formal launch before the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" /> just to your question on the spend, expectation for the rest of the year for Japan year to date, we have incurred 8.6 million in total expenses. As Robin mentioned, we anticipate increased activities related to our Japan initiative, and our estimates &#x2013; original estimate of 20 to US $25 million expenditure for the year will continue to &#x2013; the expenses to fall within that range.</p>

          <p>Hi, Eddie. It's Haoyu. Your question is the percentage of our customers related to e-commerce, right? I think it's &#x2013; in general, Internet-related industry is a big component of our customer mix, not necessarily e-commerce related, be it C2C or P2P. They are &#x2013; some of those customers are big for us. But in general, as a percent of the total revenue, they don't count for a big number.</p>

          <p>Good. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Can you guys update us on how many large advertisers now are in your customer pool and what kind of changes have you observed after launching that My Marketing Center? Is there any other plan for implementing more products like My Marketing Center in the future? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the number of large advertisers, or we call brand advertisers, is in the hundreds every quarter and we are seeing stable growth of that number over time. As far as the My Marketing Center, that product we launched back in June, it does not specifically target large advertisers. We see a lot of value in that product for SMEs. And as far as that going forward, we're definitely looking at more new products serving the needs of different kinds of customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And more importantly, for any new product launch we will spend a lot more effort to improve the quality of that service. So, anytime we launch something, we will take some time to listen to the market and make necessary improvements going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi, Robin, Jennifer. Good morning. Question regarding some of your new initiative, especially in your new service, My Marketing Center &#x2013; sounds quite encouraging. Can you elaborate a little more on the type of value-added service that would include in My Marketing Center service? And what percentage of your customer are currently using that service? And when do we expect such service to contribute material revenue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. This is Haoyu. Yes, we launched this product for only a month and a little over a month. It targets the current SME customers. It's sort of a gateway for the customers there. When they sign in, they come to this page. They see information related to their accounts. They also see information related to their own business, information related to their industry, news, news alerts, or what have you. It's very self-designed. It can be designed by the customer themselves. So &#x2013; but as I said, the product is very new. We don't want to get into the details of how many have adopted these products. But as Robin mentioned, we are going to continue to monitor the progress of the product to keep improving it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. This is Robin. We do not expect any revenue for the My Marketing Center. It's more like a value-added service to our existing customer and it's going to serve as a marketing tool for our paid search services. As you know, Baidu has a dominant market share in Chinese search. We can actually have a very good sense of the industry trend based on the queries our users type in related to certain industries that our advertisers or customers are interested.</p>
          <p>So My Marketing, one of the most important features for My Marketing standard is that they can have a graph of their search log-on place, now the keyword they are interested in and time elapsed, so our customers will have a very good sense now on the consumer appetite trend for their targeted customers. That's one of the very unique things we can offer to our advertisers and customers.</p>

          <p>Hi, can you just talk about a little bit more color about how you guys plan to manage the sort of headwind uncertainty going into 3Q? Are you guys doing anything different in terms of launching your products possibly taking advantage of possible increase in Olympic-related keywords? Anything like that along that line will be very helpful. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Robin. Yes, we have made necessary preparation for the Olympic Games. As I mentioned before, every big event, nation-wide event, is a propeller for usage of Baidu, because more people will find information on Baidu and they will talk about it among their friends and family. So through word of mouth we get more users. This time is no exception.</p>
          <p>But see probably only the difference is that we have enough time to prepare for what's going to happen during the next couple months. We have lots of products and services that particularly suitable to users who are looking for this kind of information, specifically, Baidu Post Bar, our query-based community. Anything that arises all of a sudden, people cannot find enough information on the static web. So whenever they type in the same keyword, they are directed to a community or to a message board that they can exchange ideas and communicate with each other.</p>
          <p>Any time something happens, we saw traffic surge from those related Post Bars. And this time, I think, during the game time there will be lots of surprises in who's going to win what medal and those related people's bar will become very, very popular.</p>
          <p>We also have an Olympic Channel 2008 done by Baidu.com and we will report news and the related results for that channel.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You know, it looks like your gross margin has improved a lot this quarter, 500 basis points sequentially. And that seemed to come mainly from bandwidth costs and depreciation. I was wondering just how we should think about these costs going forward, whether this kind of margin is sustainable for the rest of the year? Or will we see some softness due to the headwinds in 3Q? And also, whether you guys are planning any promotional activities for promoting the Baidu brand during the Olympics? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Kar, it's Jennifer. Just to address your question, gross margin has indeed improved this quarter. Two main reason: one, is TAC rate, as obviously you can see, has been slightly decreased versus last quarter. In addition, you know, you add in depreciation costs, operation costs, and bandwidth costs as a percent of revenue coming down. As we continue to increase our own monetization methodologies, increasing the revenue base and optimizing our infrastructure usage, I expect &#x2013; and there's still &#x2013; see some room from a bandwidth cost and depreciation cost perspective to come down slightly from a total revenue perspective.</p>
          <p>Going forward from an Olympic Game perspective, I think Robin mentioned viewing the games we have our own product lines and the platform that will attract the users to come in and take advantage of the information hub that we &#x2013; Baidu currently have. Just exceptional high promotional expenses for the quarter, we currently do not anticipate much.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just continuing on the cost side, your traffic acquisition cost decreased, actually did break a long-term trend. I know that this decrease is due to that lower traffic contribution to your search or you are decreasing the payout ratio to your partners. And further, if I can confirm that you just said that the bandwidth cost and depreciation cost as a potential to revenue will further go down in the coming quarters? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll address the bandwidth and depreciation costs as a percent. You know, what I said is there is still room, we believe. As we can continue to grow our revenue base much faster, we can fully leverage the infrastructure base that we have and, therefore, to the extent our revenue continues to grow much stronger, there should be room for us to continue to decrease the percentage of revenue from a bandwidth cost and depreciation cost perspective.</p>
          <p>In addition, you know we have incurred 30 million also of Japan-related expenditures. And much &#x2013; a big portion of that expense is related to bandwidth and depreciation costs to the extent that we continue to hold steady and not &#x2013; that part of the expense. And while our main revenue base in the China domain continues to increase much faster, you can see that the total percentage, from a bandwidth and depreciation cost perspective as a percent of revenue, should continue to have room to improve.</p>
          <p>And I'll take that Haoyu to answer that TAC question.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, <mark type="inaudible" /> on TAC, TAC <mark type="inaudible" /> for a few quarters until last quarter to this quarter it's the first time we saw some slight decline. What I can assure you is it's not due to slower growth of revenue contribution from our union partners. And it's not due to the decline of <mark type="inaudible" /> ratio either. It's a pretty complicated business.</p>
          <p>In union, we have different kinds of business, we have different kinds of models. <mark type="inaudible" /> ratios are different. So the mix shift will cause the fluctuation of TAC ratio from time to time. As we talk about this, talked it many times in previous calls, we looked at our TAC ratio or our unit business on a revenue net of TAC basis. We control TAC ratio very closely, but when it makes sense, we do strike deals with partners when it makes strategic sense.</p>
          <p>So I think in long term, there may be some pressure for TAC ratio to go up, given our leadership position in the market. I don't see how any dramatic increase in the near future. Having said that, from quarter-to-quarter, I wouldn't be surprised to see fluctuation.</p>

          <p>Yes, I think just a follow-up on how you <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; so I guess in the longer term we still should expect TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue.

          <p>Hi. Just &#x2013; I want to ask a question about the brand advertising. Because I remember a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned that the growth on your brand advertising was up slightly faster than your organic web search growth. How has this situation been changed during the past quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it hasn't changed in the past quarter. We continue to see faster growth from revenues from brand advertisers, be it in search or display.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me clarify this. I think it's not really a distinction between brand advertising and web search advertising. It's more of a distinction between larger advertisers or larger companies who do business with us. They spend both on display ads and search ads. And during the past few quarters, we have seen a trend that more and more larger companies spend more on Baidu platforms, be it pay search or display ads.</p>

          <p>Hi, Robin, Haoyu, and Jennifer. Just want to ask a question regarding regulation. Recently, there was &#x2013; Beijing State Administration of Industry and Commerce has said it planned to require registration of small-medium enterprises starting from August 1. And how do you see that impacting your customers, or potential customers, especially given that Baidu is actually located in Beijing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, at this time, almost all of our customers are registered companies, so we do not see any immediate impact for those kind of things. It probably affects the C2C services, <mark type="inaudible" /> a bigger scale, because a lot of individual sellers could be asked to register. So in that regard, it's too early for us to say what kind of impact we will get later on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick final question regarding uncertainties in 3Q again. Is one possible option for you guys to get incremental revenue for the quarter would be maybe tweaking your monetization algorithm a little bit to maybe to improve that, to maybe drive additional revenue to offset the weakness? Is that one option that you guys are thinking of or is this not something you're considering at the meantime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have not building the Company for the next quarter, where we're building the Company for the next 10, 15 years. So it doesn't make sense for us to do such short-term tweaking in order to meet certain pre-set goals. I think what's more important for us is that the Olympic Games, it's a great opportunity for Baidu to attract new users. If we can provide good services to our existing users, they will spread around the word that Baidu has the best service. Baidu can help them to find the information they want. Then after the Game, we should see a good surge in trafficking new users, <mark type="inaudible" /> all that kind of thing. That would set a very solid foundation for the future growth of the Company.</p>
          <p>Having said that, improving the monetization capability and <mark type="inaudible" /> being our priority for quite a few quarters, we understand there are a few &#x2013; lots of room for us to grow here. Because if you look at some of the third-party research reports, you will see that our traffic share is much higher than our market share in terms of dollar amount.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. A few questions regarding your head count. So can you update us of your number of sales team and how does the sales efficiency tracking for the new sales person as well as the old, more experienced ones? And what's your plan for the rest of, maybe over the next 6-12 months in terms of increasing your sales team head count? Another &#x2013; also related to that, besides your Japan and C2C project, what are your top three strategic focuses for the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hailong to talk about the sales report first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there's always room for us to make improvement. So on the other hand, I cannot &#x2013; I don't see any big increase in terms of head count or sales operation in the near future or the following couple quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding to the priorities, I wouldn't say the new initiatives are top priorities. I think for Baidu the number one priority is always web search. We always need to come up with better services for the web search, you know, larger index size, better relevancy, fresher content &#x2013; that kind of thing.</p>
          <p>We are also hiring R&amp;D engineers very aggressively. Although we have quite a large team, we do feel we are short of engineers. There are lots and lots of things we can improve on the natural search system. And I would say the second highest priority would be our monetization capability. Or as I mentioned before, we still are not satisfied with &#x2013; with the monetization capability we have.</p>
          <p>Our traffic share is still quite higher than our market share. And we see lots of things to do here and we have a very good team working on this. It has gotten senior management attention for quite a while; although, we actually started late, much later than our natural search capability.</p>
          <p>I would say that the third priority would be a sales force related or customer acquisitions. We already have a very large new customer base, large and loyal customer base. But it's still a very small percentage of the total number of enterprises in China. In our mind, we think that every single business in China should use Baidu to promote their services and products. And we are still quite far away from there.</p>
          <p>So these are the top three priorities for Baidu.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. What is your CapEx outlook for the balance of the year? And just looking at the stock-base compensation, it's up fairly significantly year-over-year and sequentially. Should we assume that second quarter amount is the new run rate? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jennifer. From a CapEx standpoint, we obviously make investment to infrastructure, to network equipment, whenever there's a need and it makes sense for us to do. So we don't particularly set out for a certain target as to what CapEx expenditure we want to incur.</p>
          <p>On your second question related to SBC. As we mentioned in the earnings release, we did have a higher SBC compared to our prior quarters in this Q2. A big portion of that is an update of forfeiture rates. That's assumed in the SBC calculation. So there is a little bit of a catch-up that we were doing in Q2. The lower forfeiture rates that we have updated is reflecting lower turn-over rate of our employees. So this is a &#x2013; more like a one-quarter event. So going forward, it's not &#x2013; you can expect the SBC expenses isn't going to be as high as Q2.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Just two quick questions. One on revenue per customer growth, how much of that do you think was a function of traffic growth? Or was it &#x2013; did you guys do anything to try to increase minimum bids? Or as far as do you think it was more of a function of market-driven demand for keywords? And then was their any R&amp;D projects that were planned for second quarter that were pushed out into third quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two problems, let me give you a some color on that. The revenue growth is driven by both ARPU and number of customers. I think traffic, in general, would have a very nice growth from Q1 to Q2 due to the low base of first quarter where Chinese new year is located. And people would spend more if we can have more to sell or if we have more inventory. Lots of customers feel that Baidu is the best way &#x2013; provides the best ROI for their marketing dollar. So if we can provide more traffic, they will spend more on us.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned before, it also can be contributed to the improvement part to our monetization of ARPU. We are providing better targeted or more relevant paid search results to the consumers or to our users. Therefore, the monetization capability has been improved so that customers can spend more and more effectively.</p>
          <p>And the third factor is that, I also mentioned that before, that we've seen a trend that larger companies come to us to spend both on display and to search. They will drive up &#x2013; they have driven up the ARPU, too.</p>
          <p>Regarding to the R&amp;D project, I'm not sure why you asked this question. All of our projects are on schedule, on target. I don't see any changes because of our inventory or anything like that.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hey, Robin, I wanted to ask you a big-picture question about e-commerce in China. As you know, the consensus view is that the use of search in China is still to generate sales leads rather than leading to online transactions. So in your assessment, when do you think China's e-commerce will develop to a stage where search will lead to significant online transactions? And if that day arrives, do you think the top-line growth of Baidu will accelerate from currently 90 &#x2013; 90% or 100% to even a higher rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think people use Baidu's paid search for three reasons. The primary reason, as you correctly pointed out, is for sales leads. But there are companies that use Baidu to drive online transaction. And the third category of companies is to do some branding work, awareness. We've seen the trends that larger companies do offline advertisement and informing their audience to search certain keywords online. So advertise &#x2013; larger advertisers, branded advertisers have doing this to &#x2013; have been doing this to drive traffic to search sites so that their targeted audience or customers can have a better understanding of their product and services. So going forward, I think, branding-oriented customers and the transaction-oriented customers will both represent a larger percentage of our product mix.</p>
          <p>And back to the e-commerce question, we've seen the e-commerce market in China growing quite nicely over the past couple of years and that's why we are doing a C2C launch this year. But it's a gradual process. We haven't seen any sudden surge on that. And going forward, I think for our main business, the paid search business, there's three types of customer &#x2013; will all contribute significant percentage of our revenue.</p>

          <p>Hi, I have a follow-up question on the ARPU. Once again, we saw the revenue proactive online marketing customer increase very healthily on your &#x2013; largely in line with the increase as well in the active online customers. My question is also related to your previous state of priority of increasing your customers. How should we think about the revenue proactive customer considering that the Company is trying to bring in newer customers who may start out at a lower spend per customer? And also, is the increase in the average revenue, has that been driven more by an increased number of clicks driven by traffic or increase amounts paid for each keyword? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you more color. If you look at existing customers, what's driving the ARPU growth, obviously you have inventory or a number of queries and CPC, cost per click. So historically, traffic has been the bigger driver of ARPU growth. And on CPC, it has been growing very nicely as well over the quarters and the growth of CPC can be driven by either more bids for the same keyword because more customers come to appreciate the value of ROI. And also, it can be indirectly driven by our &#x2013; sometimes we do increase minimum bid. We &#x2013; from time to time, we do look at different sectors and we adjust minimum bid. So that's what's driving the ARPU growth of existing customers.</p>

          <p>Okay, I'll talk about the traffic trend and Jennifer will talk about the margin trends. For Baidu search traffic, as I've mentioned before, we've seen some very nice growth for certain types of our search-related services, such as Video Search and Hao123, during the past few quarter. The two have been growing quite rapidly. In terms of web search, the growth hasn't &#x2013; it's very predictable in the sense that comparing to the same time last year, we can actually do week-by-week comparison and that it's very consistent with what we have done in the past. Also, going into July, we have not seen anything that's abnormal. Jennifer?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the margin side, this quarter we did post a pretty healthy margin. It just demonstrates the stability of our business model and we believe the model does. We entirely, definitely have the ability. Haoyu mentioned earlier from an SG&amp;A perspective, we do not anticipate to add a whole lot of head count. We're increasing productivity and that's our focus.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D side, Robin mentioned people is our top priority and we continue to attract talent. And the summer time over that next couple of quarters is when the school year finishes and we'll see new graduates starting to be recruited and they join on board to Baidu.</p>
          <p>Overall, as I mentioned, we believe there is an inherent scalability in our model. Our margins should improve longer term. However, we have never in the past have set a margin target because we believe in investing the right opportunities as we have done in the past. And therefore, we believe, as I mentioned, longer-term operating margins should have room to improve.</p>

And I think, in the next quarter, at least by the end of the year, we're going to launch API 2.0 to offer more functionalities and better usability. So I just believe that will further drive the growth of spending from bigger advertisers we have.</p>

          <p>Yes, as always, we believe that the best day is ahead of us. China's Internet population continues to grow rapidly and it has surpassed the US to become the world's largest Internet market, as measured by number of users, Internet penetration, and still lower than the global average, is still in teens. This leaves a huge potential for further development. We look forward to continuing to provide the best online for search experience for our users and continuing to execute our strong growth strategies in the coming quarter and year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us today. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.</p>
