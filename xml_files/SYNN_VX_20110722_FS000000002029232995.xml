          <p>Good morning, and welcome to the call. I'm joined here in Basel by John Ramsay, CFO; and our CEO, Mike Mack, is dialing in from the West Coast of the United States.</p>
          <p>The slides to accompany today's presentation are on our website, syngenta.com, and I would first like to draw your attention to the cautionary statements contained at the beginning of the presentation.</p>
          <p>Having done that, I will hand you directly to Mike, who will begin the presentation, starting with Slide Number 4, first half 2011 overview.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Many of you will have attended our Capital Markets Day in June, at which time we talked extensively about our strategy and our portfolio. Today's presentation therefore will focus on first half results and performance with, of course, some comments on the short-term outlook.</p>
          <p>I'll start with an overview on Slide 4. We began the year with strong volume momentum, and I'm happy to say that this continued into the second quarter. Crop prices, although volatile, remained at high levels, stimulating investment by growers, notwithstanding some adverse weather conditions. The breadth of our business across many crop markets enabled us to accommodate, and in fact benefit from, shifts in planting and product usage.</p>
          <p>Encouragingly, the second quarter was not just a volume story. Prices in Crop Protection were unchanged, and we expect positive pricing in the second half. As you saw from our announcement this morning, we will be implementing price increases for the 2012 season.</p>
          <p>And in Seeds, we achieved another significant improvement in profitability. As we said in February when we launched our new strategy, in the interest of transparency, we continue to report financial performance of both the Crop Protection and Seeds businesses separately.</p>
          <p>But as we've already showed many of you at the Capital Markets Day, our strategy is squarely focused on the development of a fully integrated offer on a global crop basis. This will involve the single sales force marketing the entire portfolio. We've already completed the integration in three of the 19 territories; 17 schedule to be completed by the end of the year and the remaining two by mid-2012, a full six months ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>The global teams for our feed crops are fully operational and are already working alongside territory and regional management. We've presented integrated pipelines for seven of our crops, with a combined value of more than $17 billion post-2015.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to Slide 5, which provides a first half update by region. Let me start with North America, which saw a whole series of weather challenges; drought affecting wheat-growing states, followed by rain-induced delay to corn-plantings; and then finally, cold conditions which threatened crop progress.</p>
          <p>In the end though, corn acres are forecast to remain at a high level, with the attraction of $7-corn outweighing the difficulties growers have countered.</p>
          <p>Demand for feed corn continues to grow, and while there's been some uncertainty on corn use in ethanol following the proposed removal of the subsidies, it's clear that this segment of the market will continue to play an important role.</p>
          <p>Europe similarly experienced weather challenges, most notably a widespread drought in the second quarter. This caused an acreage shift in cereals into corn, although overall, as in North America, high commodity prices incentivized growers to invest.</p>
          <p>In the CIS, weather conditions were more favorable than in 2010, but we saw strong recovery in those countries.</p>
          <p>Turning to Asia Pacific. High rice and cotton prices accelerated the ongoing productivity drop. The need to improve yields and quality is present across all emerging markets in the region, although it's China which continues to have the greatest impact on world markets, with increasing imports not just of soybeans, but also now of corn.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the conclusion of last year's season clearly showed the positive impact of a high soybean price on acreage and on investment, with a consequently increased yield. Government focus on agriculture exports continues in the case of Brazil and Argentina, whilst in the smaller countries in the North and West self-sufficiency and economic development are the prime objectives.</p>
          <p>Slide 6 shows our integrated sales growth in the context of these regional developments. In Europe, Africa and the Middle East, we saw an exceptional performance. The strength of corn portfolio enabled us to fully benefit from the acreage shift, while in the CIS, our leadership in sunflower seeds was a major advantage in the improved environment I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>In North America, growth was led by Seeds and reflected our enhanced corn portfolio. Crop Protection sales were affected by lower pricing and by high opening channel inventories in Canada, although the second quarter saw significant improvement in the pricing dynamic versus the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, where prices were up, we saw strong growth, particularly in fungicides and insecticides, as well as an expansion of seed sales across the crops. In Asia Pacific, our established local teams are experiencing first-hand the eagerness of growers to embrace new technology and modernized farming practice.</p>
          <p>Right to the key area focus, we have a broad range of Crop Protection products, including Durivo, which is expanding rapidly and is now also available on Vegetables, which is another huge potential in the region. I'll now touch on some of highlights in the Northern Hemisphere regions, which represented two-thirds of the business in the first half.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 7. In Europe, Africa and the Middle East, we achieved strong growth in Western Europe, despite the adverse weather conditions there. In the largest market, France, sales were up by more than 15% with the successful launch of Axial on cereals and the expansion of Callisto and Cruiser on corn.</p>
          <p>In the CIS, sales increased by more than 50%, with further growth in sunflower as well as in other crops, and the expansion of the Crop Protection product range.</p>
          <p>We also saw double-digit growth in vegetables seeds, complemented by our excellent offer in CP. We are now building fully integrated offers in vegetables, such as Almeria pepper program in Spain, which includes beneficial insects from our Bioline business, enabling us to satisfy stringent value chain requirements.</p>
          <p>Our new partnership with Marrone Bio Innovations will take these offers a step further by allowing us to incorporate a biofungicide for the treatment of mildews and other diseases into our integrated crop management programs.</p>
          <p>Moving on to North America, Slide 8, where of course the spotlight is on corn and soybean. These crops were a key driver for azoxystrobin sales, where we not only saw spectacular volume growth, but we were also able to raise prices. Our confidence in the capacity expansion for azoxystrobin, completed just last year, is now clearly paying off.</p>
          <p>In corn and soybean seeds, our new trait, Viptera, was present in 20% of the portfolio and met a highly positive grower response. Overall, endorsement of our traits is increasing, giving rise to new licensing opportunities. We're proceeding towards the introduction of a full refuge reduction offer next year, having already received EPA approvals for our structured refuge products. And we've completed submissions for our refuge-in-a-bag.</p>
          <p>Our strategy will combine our leading seeds and chemical portfolios. On July 1, we brought together our North American sales force in order to implement our strategy, which means offering integrated programs through our distributor partners. As for our corn and soybean farmer dealer network, our ongoing investment in Seeds means an increasingly attractive offer to them as well.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me now hand you over to John for a review of the first half financial performance. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'm pleased to present today results which demonstrate a strong business performance, reflecting continued volume momentum and a marked improvement in Crop Protection pricing.</p>
          <p>Starting with Slide 10. Sales reached $7.7 billion; an increase of 14% or 12% at constant exchange rates. Volume was 12% higher across the business, with price only marginally negative.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, prices were stable for both Crop Protection and Seeds. The gross margin at constant exchange rates was slightly ahead of 2010 at 52.1%, reflecting a significantly improved Seeds margins, which more than offset the effect of lower Crop Protection prices in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>EBITDA increased by 10% at constant exchange rates to $2.15 billion. Driven by higher operating income, net income was up 14% at $1.4 billion, resulting in a 12% increase in earnings per share to $15.60. Higher income and a significant reduction in inventory levels resulted in a first half free cash flow of $249 million, ahead of 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the evolution of reported sales on Slide 11. You can see the currency had a positive effect on the topline of $186 million, over 2%, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar. The positive volume momentum in Crop Protection and Seeds contributed $567 million and $262 million, respectively.</p>
          <p>Almost 60% of this volume growth was from emerging markets. Given the growth in emerging markets over recent years, the seasonality aspect of our business has reduced, and we now generate a greater portion of our sales and income in the second half.</p>
          <p>The strong volume performance was marginally offset by lower prices. Pricing in the second quarter was flat, reflecting a marked improvement from recent quarters. And I will return to pricing in a moment.</p>
          <p>The next few slides cover in more detail the performance of our Crop Protection business. On Slide 12, we can see sales at constant exchange rates were 10% higher, at $5.6 billion, driven by volume growth of 12%. Prices were 2% lower for the half, reflecting the first quarter decline.</p>
          <p>Negative price variances related largely to herbicides in North America, and essentially reflect year-on-year movements rather than further price declines, although higher opening inventories in Canada due to adverse weather conditions did have some impact.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, volumes were overall 9% higher and prices were unchanged. EBITDA of $1.64 billion represented a margin of 29.3% at constant exchange rates; around 2% lower than last year.</p>
          <p>The majority of the reduced margin came from lower pricing seen in the first quarter, as well as continued investments for growth in areas such as emerging markets, and development expenses for new technologies like Plene on sugarcane and Tegra on rice.</p>
          <p>With improved pricing in the second half, I expect the full year EBITDA margin in Crop Protection to be above that of 2010 at constant exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows the pricing situation in Crop Protection has steadily improved over the last four quarters, reaching price stability in quarter two. Market sentiment remains positive, as evidenced in our volume numbers. We've seen volume growth across all regions and all product lines.</p>
          <p>High commodity prices continue to incentivize growers to maximize their yield. And whilst growth has been higher in emerging markets, developed markets have also delivered a strong performance. Latin America prices were already higher in the first half, and the outlook for the overall business for both volume and price in the second half is positive.</p>
          <p>As we announced this morning, we will put in place price increases across the business in the second half of the year, with the aim of achieving for 2012 an overall price increase in the range of mid-single digits.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the next slide, Slide 14, we can see the performance of our new products launched since 2006. R&amp;D investment in a strong chemical platform continues to be a key element of our strategy, and as our new product sales show, we've consistently delivered strong returns on this investment. Sales rose significantly in the first half, reaching $386 million, generating a compound annual growth rate of 47% over the five-year period.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. Avicta sales increased over 70% following its launch on soybean in the U.S., as well as extended use on cotton.</p>
          <p>The cereal herbicide Axial continued to show strong volume growth, due primarily to its launch in the major European cereal market of France, as well as in Iberia. Durivo continued its significant growth trajectory, with sales up 85%. The launch in China contributed significantly to growth, as did the expanded use of Durivo on fruits and vegetables in Brazil. The second half of 2011 will see Durivo launched in a further <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:57) countries.</p>
          <p>Sales of Revus were up 24%, driven by continued global expansion and a particularly strong first half on potatoes in Northern Europe. Seguris, the brand name for isopyrazam, saw first sales on wheat in the UK.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to Slide 15 to look at our Seeds business performance. Seeds sales increased 17% to $2.1 billion, representing over 25% of our total business in the first half. Volumes were up 15% and prices up 2%. Sales grew in all regions and all product lines. EBITDA increased significantly to $537 million, with the EBITDA margin increasing at constant exchange rates from 20% to 26.4%.</p>
          <p>The overall improvement in margin reflects the continued success of our corn portfolio and new product introductions, as well as higher licensing revenue. Strong product performance in North America, as well as new product registrations in Latin America, puts us in a positive position as we approach the main Latin American season in the second half.</p>
          <p>The continued excellent performance of our Sunflower and Vegetable businesses has also made a significant positive contribution to our improvement in EBITDA. Sunflower sales were up significantly in the CIS, reflecting increased demand for high-value sunflower hybrids.</p>
          <p>In Vegetables, favorable market conditions, as well as the high quality of our portfolio, drove strong growth. Looking forward for Seeds overall, I expect to achieve our 15% EBITDA margin target for this year with further margin expansion in future years.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows you the progression of our operating income, which increased 12% in absolute terms to $1.9 billion. As you can see, the operating income impact from volume growth was $429 million, with price marginally down $49 million.</p>
          <p>As we previously outlined, we will continue to make growth investments in our business as we implement our new strategy and continue to grow in emerging markets. First half expenditure of $110 million includes continued investments in research and development and emerging markets, as well as the new integrated offers.</p>
          <p>It also includes further investment in information technology systems to underpin the new operating model. Cost inflation increased $50 million, reflecting higher inflation levels in emerging markets. Within other business performance, there is an element of increased employee variable remuneration, reflecting our growth expectations for 2011.</p>
          <p>It is worth highlighting that currency had a negligible impact on our operating income in the first half, and Slide 17 looks in more detail at currency.</p>
          <p>As we all know, the Euro crisis and U.S. debt situation has created a very volatile and uncertain outlook. This has resulted in the first half year-on-year appreciation of the Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar, 15%. Our total cost base is approximately 15% Swiss franc denominated, with very little offset in sales revenue. An increase in Swiss franc costs linked to the weakening U.S. dollar was, however, mitigated by hedging gains. And we continue to hedge at around 75% of our overall exposure.</p>
          <p>Inevitably, based on exchange rate evolutions over the last year, we will begin to see an adverse effect on the second half linked to the movement in year-on-year hedging gains. For the full year, I expect in the region of $75 million negative currency impact at the EBITDA level. So this will be a bit more negative at the operating income level, reflecting the non-cash impact of currency on amortization and depreciation.</p>
          <p>In 2012, again due to year-on-year exchange rate movements, I would anticipate further negative currency impacts. However, with our cost savings and efficiencies starting to come through, I expect that these will offset the impact on EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the detail of our net income, which was 14% higher at $1.4 billion in the first half. Earnings per share increased 12% to $15.60. As you may remember, in February, we announced that we would report net income after restructuring, but continue to monitor earnings per share before restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>Net financial expense marginally increased to $67 million, and the overall tax rate is in line with last year at 19%. For the full year, I continue to expect a tax rate of around 20%.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to look at the effect of raw material price movements on our cost base. On Slide 19, you can see that our spend on Crop Protection raw materials is around $3.5 billion, all of which is managed through our global procurement organization.</p>
          <p>The structure of our raw material contracts are such that 75% of them are long-term agreements, and in any given year, we renegotiate around 20% of our raw material spend. Given the nature of our manufacturing activity, oil price movements impact our indexed price contracts with up to a 12-month lag. In 2011, our raw material pricing impact on EBITDA is broadly neutral, with negotiated raw material savings covering the initial impacts of increased oil costs.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to 2012, there will be some negative impact from higher oil prices on our raw material cost base. However, given the structure of our contract that I have just outlined and the efforts of our procurement organization, I expect the impact to be less than $100 million.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to Slide 20 to provide you with an update on the total benefits and costs related to our efficiency program, which is linked to the implementation of our new strategy. We expect to deliver $650 million of cost savings as a result of our new operating model. Since February, we have been working in detail on the implementation of the new model, and I can confirm that both the savings and the costs related to the implementation remain unchanged. We will deliver $300 million through the new integrated supply chain structures, and a further $200 million from indirect procurement benefits. Indirect procurement covers all non-raw material purchases. Our integrated commercial organization will contribute a further $150 million of savings.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to Slide 21, where we can see the detail of our cash flow movements. Free cash flow reached $249 million in the first half. Average working capital levels as a percentage of sales declined significantly versus last year, reflecting a very strong performance in inventories, and I'll come back to this shortly.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure was lower at $193 million following the completion of the major capacity expansion projects undertaken in prior years. Financing and tax outflows were $100 million, and acquisitions expenditure was low at $18 million. We expect strong cash generation to continue as an ongoing feature of our business, and I expect free cash flow in excess $1 billion for the full year in 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 highlights the benefits of our continued management of trade working capital. This has resulted in an excellent performance in the first half, with a 6% reduction in average trade working capital as a percentage of sales, bringing it down to 37%. The largest driver of the reduction was significantly improved inventory levels. Inventory fell to 30% of sales, reflecting the continued volume momentum in both Crop Protection and Seeds.</p>
          <p>Throughout this growth phase, we have continued to control both our receivables and payable levels. Our credit management activities have resulted in a reduction in average receivables as a percentage of sales, and at the same time, we've maintained the average accounts payable ratio in line with last year.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Slide 23 summarizes the key elements of our full year outlook. We expect to see continued volume momentum as we enter the second half of the year. Market sentiment remains favorable, and our performance in the first half gives us confidence that we'll see volume continued to grow as we enter the main Latin American season.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we will achieve stable pricing in Crop Protection on the basis of current pricing levels, and consequently, I would expect to see for Crop Protection, and for the Group as a whole, full year 2011 EBITDA margin improvement at constant exchange rates versus last year.</p>
          <p>As I've previously mentioned, we will be putting in place further price increases in the second half across all regions, targeting mid single-digit price increases in 2012. And as outlined earlier, I anticipate cash flow to remain strong and free cash flow to exceed $1 billion for the full year, enabling us to complete our $200 million share buyback, as well as having increased the dividend paid in May this year. And finally, I would expect cash flow return on investment to continue to be in excess of 12%.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to hand you back to Mike, who will provide you with some further highlights on the outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. Thank you. Please turn now to Slide 25 for a review of the outlook by region for the second half and into 2012.</p>
          <p>Starting with North America. As you can deduce from the growth in azoxystrobin sales I showed earlier, corn fungicide usage is increasing. And we expect to see a significant increase in the penetration rate as applications continue in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In Canada, herbicide inventories at the end of the first half were lower, which is a positive sign for 2012. In the North American Seeds market, very good indications that higher production costs are going to be able to be passed along in the form of higher prices next season.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the 2011 season is now largely over, with the exception of winter oilseed rape, where an acreage increase is still expected. And towards the end of the second half, growers will be making the planting decisions for winter wheat. We're not making any predictions on the wheat price here today, other than that global supply remains tight.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, performance in Latin America and Asia Pacific will be key in determining the second half outcome. In Asia Pacific, there's been some concern at the progress of the monsoon, but there's still time for sufficient rainfall there.</p>
          <p>In Australasia, it looks as if the winter crop acreage will be up, and across the emerging markets of the region, we're seeing increased intensification both in terms of Crop Protection usage as well as GM adoption.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, grower profitability remains attractive, with soybean prices still at high levels and increasing potential for second season corn.</p>
          <p>I mentioned at the beginning matters not only with removal of the corn ethanol subsidy in the U.S. And this has &#x2013; this is to be accompanied by the elimination of import tariffs, further opening the way for the import of sugarcane ethanol from Brazil. While this is unlikely to have any impact in the short term, if Brazilian producers are dissatisfied with both domestic requirements and export demand, production will need to increase significantly there.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to the final slide, number 26. This year's Capital Markets Days have been designed to show you how our crop-based strategy enables us to meet the differing needs of growers worldwide. But while needs may be different, there are enormous benefits to be had through extending technologies across regions. As the new strategy gains momentum, the breadth of our portfolio will also re-induce the quality of the retailer and the distributor network around the world.</p>
          <p>We will continue to invest in the development of our integrated offer in order to deliver the integration we promised and to expand our already-leading presence in the emerging markets, which represent the principal engine of demand growth for the future.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cost efficiency and the value we create through integration will enable us to pursue these investments, while maintaining industry-leading profitability. By launching new business models, we will expand the size of the market, so then when we talk about above-market growth, we mean taking a larger share of a larger pie, with the benefit of first-mover advantage in having created these new opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>That concludes our presentation this morning. And I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. I have a couple of questions on pricing. First of all, what's the dynamic in North America, or more broadly, that's leading to weakness in herbicides pricing, both selective and non-selective? And then second, could you perhaps talk a little bit about what gives you confidence about price increases later this year and into next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, Jeremy. It's Mike. I'll make a couple of comments and then hand it over to John. First on the weakness on herbicides pricing, we had things in the corn season this year. They just got late. But by and large, the season was a strong one. Corn acreage was up in the U.S. this year. But by and large, the pricing had to do with the comparison back to last year, which we had a difficult Q2 comp to deal with.</p>
          <p>And the overall confidence for the price increase, I mean, look; we're the largest crop protection company in the world. We're facing some inflationary cost, as we've said in the press release this morning, and we feel pretty confident that our growers are going to appreciate that we need to pass along these price increases. We're getting after it early which is important, in order to get it to the distribution channel.</p>
          <p>And, of course, price increases are dependent on the competition following those. But having said that, we've done this before in 2008, and we're able to pass along some of those price increases.</p>
          <p>John, any other color you want to put on that from your side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a bit more on the confidence side.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that since the major events on pricing which occurred really in the first half of 2010, there's been &#x2013; they are progressive. I mean, 2010 continued weak on pricing, but a progressively better position as we got into the first quarter of this year, and there was more positive, dynamic. And certainly quarter two, the environment has improved significantly. We're seeing selective price increases up in North America and in Europe. Europe prices are up 2% in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So the confidence really is based upon a continually improving environment, backed up by the fact that we have achieved targeted price increases. So I think we feel that we've got a good base.</p>
          <p>But in addition to that, we've spent considerable time orchestrated by the central marketing teams who've worked with the regions in making sure that we're identifying the niche opportunities that we have. And as a team themselves, which have come back with their proposals in terms of pricing, and we've taken average of all of that. We've been &#x2013; we're setting targets which average out around the mid-single digits for 2012.</p>
          <p>I think the only negative price is the one you referred to in terms of selective herbicide. Actually isolate Canada, since that relates with Canada, where there was another year of very wet conditions. Elsewhere around, we're seeing a very much improved environment.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next questions come from line of Rhian Tucker. Please go ahead, and announce your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse here. I'm going to ask two questions as well, if I can.</p>
          <p>The first one is on the Seeds margin. It's a very impressive performance there. Can you go a little bit into how much of that is mixed effects with diverse fuel crops doing so well? How much is operational gearing, and if there is any other effects in there?</p>
          <p>The second question is a follow-on one on the price. John, you were saying that you had good price progression already a little bit in Q2. Can you tell us if there was any quarter-on-quarter price increases Q2 over Q1, or if price increases are really only going to come going into the Brazilian season and the 2012 season? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on the Seeds margin, I mean, yes it's a very significant improvement. But it's difficult to break it down into those individual components, Rhian, because the thing is, it's all of those things that you mentioned have contributed.</p>
          <p>We've had a very strong performance in diverse field crops, and as you're aware, that that does carry an above-average margin. We've got some operational leverage despite being able to continue to invest in the business. But we've also really had a good, significant improvement in our corn portfolio, which has been a major driver in recent years, and that took another significant turn with your introduction of Viptera and the introduction of high-quality germplasm.</p>
          <p>So really, it's all of those things which have contributed to the margin as well. So we've started to get some licensing revenue.</p>
          <p>So far as the quarter-on-quarter comment is concerned, then yes, indeed, we are seeing quarter-on-quarter price improvements, and quarter two is a marked improvement on quarter one. And again, it harks back to improving environment. So &#x2013; yes. And we're looking to the second half of the year for that to continue, with a more positive outlook for the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you quantify the second quarter on quarter one increase as a mid-single digit, or we're not quite that far yet?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next questions come from the line of Jean de Watteville. Please go ahead, and announce your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Jean de Watteville, Nomura. I am &#x2013; just three questions.</p>
          <p>First of all, on pricing, I think in the press release you mentioned that you are aiming for mid single-digit price increases for next year. Is that what you expect to achieve? Or is that what you announced to the retailers and new customers?</p>
          <p>I know that you entered a season asking to retailers for 2% to 3% price increase. What I am interested to see is what will you announce in your catalogue for next year? Is it presumably much more than 5%? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question on Seeds. Obviously, a very strong start of the year. I have been surprised that you didn't raise your expectations for the full-year and continue to guide for a15% margin for the full year. Is it just conservatism? Or there's something that you &#x2013; we should be aware of in the second half that could lead to a lower H2 margin than H2 last year?</p>
          <p>And third question, it's on currency impact. Obviously, we know that you have a hedging mechanism in place that kind of delayed the impact of the higher Swiss franc. Assuming currency do not move, and given the hedging system you have in place, can you quantify the currency impact on your EBITDA for 2012 and 2013, please? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jean. It's Mike. Maybe I'll just take &#x2013; probably the first two, and then ask John to add any additional color, and then cover up &#x2013; follow with the currency.</p>
          <p>I think on the pricing, I mean, look, we have many Crop Protection and Seeds products all around world, as you know. And in some cases, we're going have to be raising Crop Protection prices sometimes more than 10%. Other products are going to not have a price increase at all.</p>
          <p>And what you're hearing from us today is that we believe that, when you take it all in then, what we're going to end up with after everything is said and done is something in the mid-single digits. And &#x2013; but it is going to be a range of price movements in all the different markets and all the different products. And &#x2013; so the target is what we would aim to compete with.</p>
          <p>The Seeds, I don't know that I would call it conservatism, as such, but we've been now, since 2007, with this target in place. And it's been out there, and we've been cueing to it now for a number of years. And what you're hearing us say is this target, the one that we've talked about now for four year, will have been reached. And if we go beyond it, that's great, but it wasn't to discourage you at all. Merely that we're going to complete something that we set out and promised to do many years ago.</p>
          <p>John, on the currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the currency, Jean, is &#x2013; numbers to put on this are always difficult. But look, put it this way. Given best estimates on what hedges we've got, what hedges we're likely to put in place, and the way the currency is looking, I anticipate that we'll offset it with the efficiencies savings, the number for which we've given you. And we'll see where we get to in terms of the way the Swiss Franc goes between now at the end of the year and where it is next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we just take the saving targets you're guiding for, and that's your best estimate of the currency impact for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good enough basis at the present time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Operator, next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Martin Fl&#xFC;ckiger. Please go ahead, announce your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I am sorry &#x2013; good morning, everyone. Martin Fl&#xFC;ckiger from Helvea. Three questions, please. Or actually, four questions, if I may.</p>
          <p>First of all, on the acquisition impact on volume growth in both Crop Protection and Seeds in the first half, if you can provide us with the numbers there? Because my understanding is that the acquisition impact would be allocated to your volume growth numbers there. If you could just clarify that.</p>
          <p>And the second question would be on generic competition for Amistar in Brazil. If you could provide us with an update there and what you believe is a reasonable outlook for the product in Latin America?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, I am coming back to the issue of pricing in particularly non-selective herbicides. I thought it was surprising to see flattish prices overall; if I remember correctly, below last year, even. Sorry. So negative pricing, with the exception of Brazil. If you look at price increases by Monsanto for Round-Up, I believe there was some 40% in &#x2013; what they call or what we would call Q2, in the last quarter, anyway. That seems surprising that Touchdown didn't do any better.</p>
          <p>And then the final one is a clarification question, which relates to the currency question just from before. Am I right then in assuming that you're guiding for a negative currency impact of some minus US$175 million in 2012? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Good morning, Martin. Maybe, John, if you could take the acquisition volume growth comparison and currency. I'll just take a first stab at the generic competition in Brazil.</p>
          <p>I mean, we haven't felt that yet. We've got, as we've announced over the last couple of years, limited supplies of generic azoxystrobin that is coming from us, and that will start to come into the market. But look, there is nothing meaningful at this point in time on the price front. And as we said, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:30) is already now fully sold out. We have got a little bit more capacity. We have to develop into it, but that's not something that we're worried about for 2011 or '12.</p>
          <p>Pricing on non-selective, I can't give you the precise Monsanto comparison, because they're, of course, on a slightly different fiscal year than we are. But the big decline in glyphosate which happened last year, so we're up against a different set of comps on that. And I don't think &#x2013; but what I can tell you is there's no basis to believe that our Touchdown compared to their Round-Up  is materially different in the marketplace. So the pricing as such for glyphosate has now been stable for the last &#x2013; nearly the last year.</p>
          <p>John, any further color on that? If not, the volume acquisition and the currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no further color. I think that's clear on those two points, Mike.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the currency and then the acquisitions, I think &#x2013; I don't want to be tied down to a figure, but we are looking to that order of magnitude, Martin. And we're looking to offset it with our efficiency savings, which you're right to point out is that order of magnitude. But I don't want to be tied down to a specific number. There is a lot movement to go on in currency as yet. But yes, we hope to offset it at that order of $175 million.</p>
          <p>Acquisition impacts, it doesn't apply to <mark type="ph" /> crop rotation (44:30). Acquisitions are Maribo sugar beet business and Greenleaf Genetics, which together take six percentage points off the Seeds growth. So six percentage points attributable to acquisitions from Seeds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right then. And maybe one percentage point in Crop Protection, or zero?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If you do the maths, it will work out around that level, correct, in terms of the total Syngenta. But it's contributed by the Maribo seeds sugar beet and the Greenleaf Genetics acquisition, our licensing vehicle in North America.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Tony Jones, Redburn in London. I have got a couple of questions. On Seeds, with such a good performance from Viptera and with margin improvement and a <mark type="ph" /> fair wind from acreage (45:32) recovery, is there a risk that there's limited growth coming into 2012? So I'd be interested to sort of just hear how you expect the story to move there?</p>
          <p>And then also talking about Crop Protection, in your new sorts of cross-selling strategy, could you provide some indication whether that's changed the dynamic of how you negotiate through the channel? Maybe some color on that. That would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the Viptera growth, I mean, look, we had Viptera in 20% of the offer this year. And it is with Viptera and the rest of our insect line-up, we have the best GM insect traits in the market.</p>
          <p>Over the next two seasons, we're going to move the percentage of Viptera up to 40% of that portfolio. And of course growers are willing to pay for the yield that it confers. So yes, we're looking forward to enjoying some of the volume growth and of course the margin growth that will be associated with that phenomenon.</p>
          <p>And I'm not at all worried that somehow the growth in our corn seed business is going to be running out at all. And of course, Viptera also is very active in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:49) class down in Latin America. And as the corn crop continuous to evolve there, lots of opportunity to further leverage that technology.</p>
          <p>On the Crop Protection dynamic, I mean &#x2013; and of course, Tony, you were at the Capital Markets Days. We don't think about it in terms of retailer or distributor leverage. What we do have though is, with the incorporation of Seeds, just a much bigger offer for them to imagine taking to their growers.</p>
          <p>And what are we seeing? There is a change in the nature of the negotiation. Well, what is changing is just making it easier to do business with us, and we're already hearing them say that. It's making it more exciting for them to do business with us, and they are imagining more of the possibilities that they can to take that broader offer and try to make it distinctive within their own business model.</p>
          <p>So already we've taken on a lot of interesting and varied forms all around the world. And I think we're going to be able to give you a lot more color on that, as we get to some of these other territories converted over. Thanks for that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, London. Question for John, actually. Just on Slide 16, John, the two specific items on the bridge for operating income: growth investments, $110 million; cost inflation, $30 million. I just wondered if you could sort of run through specifically what they are, what's driving that? And then you did allude to, in the outlook statement as well, to 2012, obviously part of the price increase, being able to allow the Group to accommodate further growth investments. Do you have a specific number in mind when you think about 2012? Sort of two separate questions, but the same thing, clearly. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, the $110 million is what we're identifying as elements of the cost base which are directed very specifically and targeted on growth. So you've got some R&amp;D projects within that. We've got some very specific market projects, some of them relating to the integration strategy. We have also got systems implementation which is in its final stages this year in terms of providing the back office facilities to enable us to achieve the cost savings, but also to facilitate our ability to actually integrate the businesses and operate as an integrated company. And there's also some volume growth in there, a total of about $110 million. The $30 million is just what we've been able to identify is attributable to cost and salary inflation in terms of &#x2013; and most of it coming from emerging markets in terms of the costs inflation we're experiencing there.</p>
          <p>2012, I mean, the short answer is I don't have a specific number. We will be continuing to invest in the business, but at the same time, this is why we're setting out a sustainable level of EBITDA margin, because we will be operating within the framework within which we set out at the beginning of the year. But I'm sorry, I can't give you a specific number at this stage. We'll be working on that in terms of the opportunity set and the overall prospects in 2012 as the year progresses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks for taking my question. It's Evgenia Molotova from UBS, London. I have several questions. First one is about the gross margin in half year. As far as I understand, according to my calculation, year-on-year, the gross margin decreased by 104 basis points. I just wanted to know what kind of raw material price inflation did you have in this period of time? And also, about the next year, you're expecting price increases, but what kind of raw material cost increases would you expect to have next year? And do you think you will be able to compensate raw material price increases, raw materials inflation, by the price increases that you are going to achieve?</p>
          <p>And another one on margin expenses, if I may. As far as I understand, the marketing expenses grew 17% year-on-year, which is considerably higher than the growth last year. So if you could comment on the future level of marketing and also why the marketing expenses grew so much, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think just maybe on the gross margin. I think the gross margin total for the Group increased slightly, actually. So it's actually currency which is taking it down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we anticipate &#x2013; an important point on the profitability generally is that, given what I've said about 2011 pricing, we will see an improvement in both gross margin and EBITDA margin coming from the Crop Protection business, as the profitability will improve in the second half.</p>
          <p>In terms of what impact raw material prices had within that, they were neutral. So I think the profitability is explained by that. In 2012, put a number into the presentation of less than $100 million for raw material cost increases, and can update on that at the end of the year. But less than $100 million anticipated. And yes, indeed, if we achieve our price increases, that will more than offset it.</p>
          <p>The investment in marketing expenses would really be &#x2013; the components of it are the largely in the explanation I gave to Andrew in the previous question. I think as a percentage of sales, going forward, we will see some leverage there, and without putting a specific number on the amount that we're going to invest.</p>
          <p>But don't forget, I mean, this is where we will be driving a lot of the business in terms of our integrated strategy in terms of achieving our $17 billion sales target post-2015. But we will, as I said, manage it within the context of sustaining the levels of EBITDA margin that was set out in our framework.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Can I ask one &#x2013; just one qualifying question about the second half of the year and the <mark type="ph" /> price increases (54:19)? You mostly referred to Latin American market <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:28) or do you expect to achieve price <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:30) in Europe as well in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; just to clear one thing about the second half in 2011 is that what we've got in place in terms of price increases already out there and achieving revenue, anticipate an improved pricing situation going through the second half.</p>
          <p>Of course, Latin America is the biggest component of it because there's 70% of Latin American sales still to occur in the second half, and they are growing. But just to make sure there is no misunderstanding, the point we're making about the price increases for 2012 are over and above that. There will be specific measures, which we've discussed in the previous questions, targeted at increasing prices in 2012.</p>

          <p>The next questions come from the line of Ronald Kohler. Please go ahead, announce your company name and location.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Ronald Kohler from MainFirst. Two questions. Seed pricing in Q2; I have seen 4% increase in Q1, 2% increase just in the half year. I calculate minus 1%. Can you a little bit elaborate on the price declines in Q2 in the Seeds business?</p>
          <p>Secondly, also on pricing, but more on 2012, you are obviously guiding for mid-single digits, meaning $650 million calculated on your current sales. And you say less than $100 million higher raw material cost; also perhaps you can calculate currency into it. But obviously, your argument going to the farmers and to your customers, you're saying, okay, we have inflation; we have to offset that. This is obviously a significant higher increase than the inflation you are guiding. So meaning either &#x2013; yes, what will be the driver really of &#x2013; what will make the farmers accept such price increases, in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you read anything into the quarter-on-quarter price variances in Seeds. There's movement in rebates. I mean, the message basically is that we've got small increases, I think around 2% price increases in Seeds overall, and I wouldn't read anything into the quarter-on-quarter variances.</p>
          <p>So far as the pricing is concerned, for 2012, well, the mid-single digit at this stage is a target. What we've done, and Mike might give a flavor of this previously, we've worked with the countries, and the central marketing team has pulled together the overall plans. We'll be going out into the market with different pricing, associated with different aspects of our range in relation to the relative strength and positioning. But importantly, in relation to the value that those technologies are bringing to the door, and that's the most important point in relation to how the good orders are actually going to look at this. And yes, we do have to have a look at inflation and we do need to be taking some actions. It's a target at this stage, and we'll see how we get on. There's many months to pass before we get there. But it is worked from a bottom-up basis, and we'll see how we get on.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a minor question, if I may, additionally. You said $19 million in restructuring costs in H1. Does that imply you had also very limited cost savings out of your target $75 million in H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We had &#x2013; always with starting up, there'll be more cost savings in the second half compared to the first half. But I think we are somewhere up to about $30 million, $35 million in cost savings in total in the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the majority then of your expenses will be then in the P&amp;L in the second half?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Okay. The next questions come from the line of Neil Tyler. Please go ahead with your question, announce your company name and location.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. It's JPMorgan in London. Just one &#x2013; most have been answered, but just really going back to the point that Mike made on the U.S. corn or ethanol legislation. I wonder if you've thought sort of broadly to the longer term, and within your Capital Markets Day presentations, on sort of the net effect of that. Obviously, the ethanol production in via sugarcane is significantly cheaper than that via corn. And in terms of your own business, if one were to supplant the other, whether you would see a sort of &#x2013; you would expect to see a net benefit or otherwise. I know it's a very broad question and very difficult to answer at this stage, but I wondered if you could just sort of share your thoughts with us at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think &#x2013; what I think about the U.S. corn grower, today, the corn grower is easily the most productive corn grower in the U.S. They have created this ethanol market for themselves. You heard me mention that importation of corn from the U.S. into China is up.</p>
          <p>As we look at the really long-term trends, corn is very effective for <mark type="ph" /> seed (1:00:08). And you know we've just got actually the registration for a new ethanol trait that's going to make corn-to-ethanol increasingly productive. And the 2011-'12 season is going to see us commercializing that for the very first time.</p>
          <p>So I am long on corn to ethanol in U.S. getting more productive. Equally, it's not today as productive as sugarcane. And if ethanol from sugarcane becomes more able to be freely traded, that's great, because we are in a position where &#x2013; and of course you have Capital Markets Days. You saw our opportunity in <mark type="ph" /> Plan A (1:00:50).</p>
          <p>So I think both of these crops are important to us. We invest in both of those. We've got some unique technology in both of them. And the practical matter has always been a supporter of free trade, and I'd like to think that the elimination of subsidies, as such, would continue to suggest that corn farmers have a ton of opportunities to be more productive. And ethanol plants do, as well.</p>
          <p>So it will go where it goes, but they will be there to support it.</p>
