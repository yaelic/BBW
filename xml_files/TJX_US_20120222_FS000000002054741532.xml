          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the TJX Company's Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 22, 2012.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Incorporation. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">

          <p>And now, I'll turn it back to Carol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Sherry. And good morning. Joining Sherry and me on the call are Ernie Herrman, Jeff Naylor and Scott Goldenberg, who, as you know, was promoted to CFO last month. We are very pleased Scott is taking on a bigger role at TJX and we'll continue to benefit from the combined leadership of Jeff and Scott. Jeff will be revealing the financials on our call today, and going forward, Scott will be doing this.</p>
          <p>2011 was another great year for TJX. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 14% and our five-year compound annual EPS growth rate is 20%. Consolidated comps increased 4% on top of 4% and 6% increases in the past two years, respectively. We believe that these numbers speak for themselves as for the sustainability and strength of our business model. 2012 is off to a very strong start and we see ourselves as being at an exciting inflection point with great momentum working in our favor.</p>
          <p>Today, we'll be keeping the conversation on this call very strategic. We'll tell you how we are investing and positioning TJX for the next level of growth and why we're so confident in our short and long-term future. And importantly, why we are investing more aggressively for the future. We expect our investments to start to flatten out in calendar 2013 and are maintaining our model of 10% to 13% annual EPS growth, which assumes a 2% comp increase. We are confident that we will deliver as always and will strive to exceed these goals.</p>
          <p>Before I continue, let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap full year and fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. Upfront, let me remind everyone that our 2-for-1 stock split was completed earlier this month so all of our EPS and share numbers are now on a split-adjusted basis. And Sherry noted at the top of the call we will be referring to adjusted numbers in today's remarks, which exclude the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. As well, I'll also include an intrusion-related adjustment that impacted fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to the full year fiscal 2012 results. Our net sales reached $23.2 billion. That's a 6% increase over last year. Consolidated comp store sales were up 4% on top of very strong increases in the past two years as Carol noted earlier. The 4% comp in fiscal 2012 was driven by a balanced increase between ticket and transactions, as we continue to grow our customer base.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $1.99, a 14% increase on top of the last two years increases of 23% and 48%, respectively. Obviously, we're very pleased to sustain such strong EPS growth up against a very difficult comparison. Foreign currency rates added $0.01 to earnings per share this year, compared to a $0.01 negative impact in the prior year, but had no impact on pre-tax margin comparison.</p>
          <p>Now, in our press release today, we called out the impact of certain fourth quarter items on EPS and pre-tax margins in both the full year and the fourth quarter periods. These fourth quarter items include costs related to the closing the company's StyleSense stores in Canada and early retirement program, the closure of a European office facility, a separation agreement, and certain write-offs and adjustments at TJX Europe. Those were offset in part by the net benefit of favorable past adjustments.</p>
          <p>And normally, we don't go into this level of detail on operations. But these items, which we discussed in prior sales releases and which were significant in the aggregate, were not anticipated in our original guidance. And they're large enough to impact profit flow through and year-over-year comparisons, so we thought we would call them out and talk to them.</p>
          <p>Combined, these items reduced EPS by $0.02 for both the fourth quarter and the full year and also reduced consolidated pre-tax profit margins by 20 basis points for fiscal 2012, and by 50 basis points for the fourth quarter. And the majority of this margin impact is in SG&amp;A. So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter items.</p>
          <p>For the full year, the consolidated adjusted pre-tax profit margin was 10.7%. That's a 10 basis point increase over last year and in line with our prior guidance. Gross profit margins were up 30 basis points, but were partially offset by 20 basis points of SG&amp;A deleverage, which was primarily due to the 20 basis points of deleverage from the fourth quarter items I just covered.</p>
          <p>As to inventories, at the end of the fourth quarter, consolidated inventories on a per store basis, including the warehouses, were up 3% for our existing businesses. This is less than the mid-single digit increase we'd anticipated, and down significantly from the mid-teens per store increase at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>With store inventories down and turning more quickly, and forward purchase commitments down significantly compared to last year, we feel very good about the liquidity in our inventories and are in a great position to capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In terms of share repurchases, for the year, we bought back $1.4 billion of TJX stock, retiring 49.7 million shares on a post-split basis, which was more than we'd originally planned. During the fourth quarter, we bought back $402 million of TJX stock, retiring 12.5 million shares, again, on post-split basis. So that's the full year fiscal 2012 wrap up.</p>
          <p>Let me now recap fourth quarter results. Net sales were $6.7 billion. That's a 6% increase over last year. And our consolidated comp store sales were up a very strong 7% over last year.</p>
          <p>EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.62. That's a 17% increase on top of adjusted increases of 13% and 104% in the two prior years, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted current year earnings per share by $0.01 compared to a neutral impact in the prior year, and adversely impacted pre-tax profit margin comparisons by approximately 20 basis points.</p>
          <p>FYI, for comparison purposes on a pre-split basis, Q4 EPS would have been $1.25, or an adjusted 19% increase. Our guidance on a pre-split basis called for EPS at or slightly above the high end of our $1.19 to $1.23 original range.</p>
          <p>Consolidated pre-tax profit margin for the quarter was 11.3%. That's a 10 basis point increase over prior year and that's up 30 basis points if we exclude the impact of foreign exchange. The gross profit margin improved 30 basis points, while SG&amp;A delevered 20 basis points. The fourth quarter items I just mentioned negatively impacted pre-tax profit margins by 50 basis points, primarily in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that merchandise margins were up 10 basis points for the fourth quarter, despite the promotional environment and markdowns that were taken to clear seasonal inventories.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call back to Carol, and I will recap our first quarter and full year fiscal 2013 guidance at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. So the major themes I want to highlight are the momentum of our business, how we're investing for the future, our opportunities for growth, and that we're continually raising the bar in every area of the business. Most importantly, I want to reiterate how strongly we believe we will become a company of $40 billion and beyond.</p>
          <p>First, we have tremendous momentum. For the third consecutive year, we ended the year with significant increases in customer traffic. We are convinced we will continue to attract new customers, as value remains a top priority for our consumers.</p>
          <p>We are using our off-price platform to deliver outrageous value to our consumers, with what we see as the most exciting assortment of brands and fashion, setting us apart from other retailers. This is what TJX is all about.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. divisions continue to outperform in 2011, posting big numbers on top of big numbers. Marmaxx comped up 5% over growth of 4% last year and 7% the year before that. HomeGoods delivered a 6% increase in 2011, over 6% and 9% increases in the past two years, respectively. And both divisions also continue to increase their bottom line profits, and perhaps most importantly, both are entering 2012 with great momentum.</p>
          <p>TJX Europe is back on solid track, with strong operating results in the fourth quarter, and we feel very good about this business as we begin a new year and certainly going forward. TJX Canada did regain its momentum at the end of 2011, and we're confident it is well positioned for 2012.</p>
          <p>During 2011, we took several actions to set the table for the new year and longer term future. We closed A.J. Wright because it was the right move for the short and long-term economics of the company. More recently, we closed StyleSense, as the Marshalls shoe business is so strong in Canada. We closed the corporate facility in Europe to better align our business. This is what we do at TJX. We take intelligent risks and do what's right for the business. We test and we test again. We capitalize on what works and move beyond what doesn't. Today we're one TJX, with a no-walls environment, focused on fewer, bigger businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, to the strategic investments we're making to support our growth. We have told you that we are confident that we will grow to be a company of $40 billion and beyond. I remain convinced that we will do that. I'd like to discuss what key investments will help us get there. We are investing significantly in our supply chain and systems. As great as our supply chain is, we have lots of room to improve processes we perform manually now. This will help us get even more pointed in shipping the right goods to the right stores at the right time. We will be investing in a new distribution center on the West Coast, the first new DC for Marmaxx in 10 years. We believe this will lead to even greater ease of shipping, freshness, and excitement for our customers every time they walk into our stores.</p>
          <p>We also will be investing in a new data center and systems to support our growing operations. We are making a substantial investment to start up e-commerce, which I'll talk more about in a moment. We are, of course, investing in store growth. We also will continue to aggressively remodel our stores to improve customer shopping experience, as well as invest in other in-store initiatives. We are investing in talent, both our TJX University and our future bench, as well as other programs to develop our associates for the future.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we will be investing in both our corporate and buying offices in order to support our future growth. To help fund our investments and drive profitability and returns to shareholders, we will continue our cost-cutting control measures. We are planning cost reductions in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2012. These cost reductions also, along with expected merchandise margin improvement will help us deliver our 2012 plan, which calls for flat to increasing profit margins on a 1% to 2% comp, and Jeff will cover the details a little bit later.</p>
          <p>Importantly, as much as we believe we must significantly invest in our business in 2012, we are maintaining our 10% to 13% annual EPS growth model and as always, we'll strive to surpass it. Again, we expect our investments to start to flatten out in calendar 2013, which should give us an opportunity to leverage even more.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to growth. We are more excited about our huge growth opportunities, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we have discussed before, we believe Marmaxx will be a bigger business than we thought just over a year ago, and see this chain growing to at least 2,400 stores. We've also discussed that we believe HomeGoods will be bigger than we originally thought. We raised our growth expectations of this chain to 750 stores in 2011. With other major U.S. home retail chains more than twice the size of HomeGoods today, we're very confident in the long-term potential to achieve these numbers.</p>
          <p>At TJX Europe, we are on a good track and see the long-term potential for up to 875 stores in just our current markets with our current concepts alone. We will proceed prudently but remain as confident as ever in our huge opportunities in Europe. In Canada, Marshalls is another growth catalyst. We see the potential to grow TJX Canada overall to 430 stores and we will be growing this business steadily.</p>
          <p>E-commerce is clearly in our future. We continue to see e-commerce as a major opportunity for TJX. We see it as a marriage between our stores and the web. We plan to lever our $23 billion brick-and-mortar business and merchant organization that is over 700 people strong. We expect to offer outrageous value and utilize our flexibility, aiming to be a more flexible platform than others. We believe e-commerce will open up a greater landscape for categories. Just think about the potential for us to carry categories online that we wouldn't carry in our stores. We have a strong team assembled, consistent &#x2013; consistently of experienced e-commerce talent and off-prices &#x2013; sorry, consisting of experienced e-commerce talent and off-prices.</p>
          <p>The more we learn, the more convinced we are of the huge opportunity e-commerce can be for us. That said, we'll take our time and we'll do it right. We're not ready to talk timing yet and we will have more to say as we move through the year. To continue our momentum, we are constantly raising the bar. This is the drive of our management team. We push harder and stay focused on execution in the near term and position the business for successful growth in the long term. We are continuously striving for even better execution of all the elements of the model that make this company great.</p>
          <p>Above all, we are all about value. Other retailers are getting it and talking about value now. It's been our mission since day one. We are no long satisfied with offering customers great value. We are focused on offering outrageous value.</p>
          <p>We will be pursuing untapped customers with our value. We have made significant gains in the U.S. market, but our research tells us that only 25% of U.S. adults have shopped T.J. Maxx and Marshalls in the last year which is much less a number than at shopped department stores.</p>
          <p>With four powerful businesses, we still have tremendous opportunity to market even harder and bring new customers into our stores. This is even before incorporating e-commerce, which will only add more customers.</p>
          <p>We increased our marketing impressions by 30% this past holiday season to 1 billion impressions. In the aggregate, our brand websites averaged over 4 million, well over 4 million visits every month. And this is without selling merchandise online, other than a small amount in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Our brilliance is our brands and we believe we will make our brand penetration even stronger. Our vendor universe now numbers over 15,000 vendors as we continue to expand our global sourcing. We plan to continue opening more new vendor doors and building even stronger vendor relationships. And as I said earlier, I believe we can get even better at delivering the right goods to the right stores at the right time.</p>
          <p>We dramatically decreased store inventories over the last two years and turned them faster, leading to both stronger sales and margin. We also have a significant opportunity to further reduce inventories and turn them even faster.</p>
          <p>Another factor that gives me such confidence in our future is our financial strengths. Our business continues to deliver superior financial returns for our shareholders, some of the highest in all of retail and generates an enormous amount of excess cash. For 2012, we plan to continue to balance the use of cash between investing and the possible growth of our business and distributing cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback.</p>
          <p>On the investment front, we are making significant investments to support our growth and plan to increase capital spending to $875 million to $900 million range. And Jeff will cover the details in a moment.</p>
          <p>Even with this increase, we still intend to buy back $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of TJX stock and expect that our board of directors will increase our dividend by 21%. This would mark the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases and reflect the compound annual growth rate of 23% for that period. Even with this level of shareholder distribution, we still plan to end fiscal 2013 with approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in cash, which provides significant financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>We split the stock 2-for-1 earlier this year. Since our last stock split in 2002, TJX share price has more than tripled. Over the past one-year, five-year and 10-year periods, our total shareholder returns has significantly exceeded both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Apparel Retail Index.</p>
          <p>TJX is company with tremendous financial strength. All of these underscores the reasons for our confidence in the business and our ability to continue to deliver significant increases in sales, earnings and cash flow to generate superior financial returns.</p>
          <p>In closing, I feel so good about where the company is today. This business has so much promise. 2011 was another great year that reinforces all the points of our amazing business model. With strong execution, our flexible model placed well in almost any environment. But it is our future that excites me the most. The year is off to a very strong start and we believe we have great momentum for 2012 and beyond. We are excited about our growth prospects and confident that the investments we are making to support our growth are the right ones. I love the management team we have in place, which has amazing talent, knowledge and ability. And beyond this team, TJX has a deeply experienced bench from which to draw the future leaders of our company. And we are focused on seeing people grow successfully within our company. We are motivated and ready to move forward in growing TJX to $40 billion and beyond.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn it back to Jeff to go through our guidance and then we'll open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, before I get to guidance, I wanted to touch on the flow through we saw in the fourth quarter. So, for the quarter, we had a 7% comp store sales increase. Ordinarily, we would expect about 80 to 90 basis points of pre-tax margin improvement at this level of comp.</p>
          <p>Now, the actual pre-tax margin improvement was 10 basis points, which raised the question of flow through. There were two factors here. First excluding FX or foreign exchange, pre-tax margins were up 30 basis points. So, FX had a 20-basis point impact on our year-over-year margin comparisons.</p>
          <p>Second, we had the impact of the fourth quarter items which negatively impacted pre-tax margins by 50 basis points for the quarter. So these two items explain the flow through and why there wasn't as much leverage as we'd normally expect.</p>
          <p>Importantly our model for fiscal 2013, I'm going to get to that at a moment, reflects the profit margin that's flat to slightly up over <mark type="ph" /> ROI (23:21) on a 1% to 2% comp. So, clearly we're confident in the flow through of our model looking forward. And by the way that model includes the incremental investments to support the growth that Carol talked about earlier.</p>
          <p>One other point, some of the fourth quarter items also impacted Europe's performance. So, while fourth quarter segment profit was up 89% at TJX Europe and segment profit margin was up 220 basis points, actually, it's up 280 basis points ex-currency. The fourth quarter items had a negative impact of almost 200 basis points on the European profit margins. So that's some important color around Europe's results.</p>
          <p>Let me begin guidance by just briefly touching on our three-year outlook. The three-year growth model is unchanged and continues to call for compound EPS growth of 10% to 13%. The components also remain unchanged, reflecting a 2% comp store sales increase, square footage growth in the 4% to 5% range, 1 to 2 points of EPS growth coming from further improvements in pre-tax profit margin and 4 points of EPS growth coming from the buyback. So that's a three-year model.</p>
          <p>Now to fiscal 2013 guidance. As you can see from today's release, we've provided fiscal 2013 guidance on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. The adjusted basis as always excludes the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation on fiscal 2012 and I'm going to speak to the adjusted numbers today.</p>
          <p>So let me begin with the full year. For the full year, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.21 to $2.31, which represents an 11% to 16% increase over the adjusted $1.99 in fiscal 2012. Now this guidance includes the 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar which we expect will benefit the full year and the fourth quarter by approximately $0.07 per share. On a 52-week basis, excluding the $0.07 benefit, full year EPS will be $2.14 to $2.24, that's up 8% to 13% over the adjusted $1.99 in fiscal 2012 and, obviously, very, very much in line with the three-year model.</p>
          <p>Now to some of the components of the guidance. Our EPS guidance assumes consolidated top line sales of about $24.5 billion to $24.8 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over last year, including the 53rd week. We're assuming the 53rd week contributes approximately 1 and 1.5 percentage points of this increase.</p>
          <p>For comp store sales, we're assuming a 1% to 2% increase on both the consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group, and the comps by definition exclude the 53rd week. For the year, we expect pre-tax profit margins to be 10.9% to 11.2%. This represents a 20 to 50 basis point increase over the adjusted fiscal 2012 pre-tax profit margin of 10.7%, with approximately 20 basis points of this increase due to the benefit from the 53rd week. So that implies that pre-tax profit margins on a 52-week basis will be flat to 30 basis points, and that's on 1% to 2% comp, so actually a little better than we'd expect on 1% to 2% comp.</p>
          <p>We're planning gross profit margins to be 27.6% to 27.9%, which is up 20 to 50 basis points over the adjusted 27.4% in fiscal 2012. The majority of this improvement is driven by merchandise margins, with approximately 10 basis points due to the 53rd week.</p>
          <p>In terms of SG&amp;A, we expect SG&amp;A to be approximately 16.6% as a percent of sales versus the adjusted 16.5% in fiscal 2012. The 53rd week benefits SG&amp;A expense ratios in fiscal 2013 by approximately 10 basis points, and the non-anniversarying of last year's fourth quarter items has a 15 basis point benefit. However, these two items are offset by the incremental investments in our business that Carol outlined earlier, and which negatively impact the SG&amp;A ratios by about 25 basis points. So the remaining 10 basis point increase in SG&amp;A is about what we'd expect on 1% to 2% comp.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels are not expected to impact full year EPS growth. In terms of capital spending, it's expected to be in the $875 million to $900 million range. The increase over prior year levels reflects similar levels of spending on new stores and remodels, but investment in the new Marmaxx DC, investments in new systems, including the data center and investments in e-commerce. So that's the reason for the CapEx increase.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're planning net interest expense in the $30 million to $31 million range, a tax rate of 38.5%, which is up 50 basis points due to the favorable tax adjustments in the prior year, and a weighted average share count of 741 million shares.</p>
          <p>Now, the first &#x2013; so that's full year guidance. And now, let me turn to the first quarter guidance. As you can see from the release today, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.47. That's a 15% to 21% increase over last year's adjusted $0.39 per share. In terms of the components of that, we're assuming a first quarter top line in the $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion range. This is based on comp sales growth and the 2% to 4% range on a consolidated basis and 2% to 3% at the Marmaxx group.</p>
          <p>As to monthly comps, for February we're planning comp sales increases of approximately 7% on a consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx group. For the combined March-April period, we are planning on comp sales growth in the range of 1% to 3% on both a consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. Excuse me.</p>
          <p>In March, we're planning comps to increase 1% to 3% and in April flat to up 2% on both the consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. In terms of margins, pre-tax profit margins are planned in the 10.1% to 10.4% range for the first quarter, up 50 to 80 basis points over the adjusted margin in the prior year.</p>
          <p>We are anticipating the first quarter gross profit margin in the range of 27.5% to 27.7%. That's up 60 to 80 basis points versus the adjusted 26.9% gross profit margin in the prior year. And that's up due to strong merchandize margins as well as the non-anniversarying of last year's 30-basis point negative mark-to-market impact. So those are the two factors behind the gross profit margin increase.</p>
          <p>We're expecting SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to be in the 17.2% to 17.3% range. That's a 10 to 20-basis point increase over last year's adjusted ratio of 17.1%. First quarter SG&amp;A ratio comparisons to prior year are impacted by the timing of our investment spending which didn't ramp up until the back half of last year, leaving the less favorable year-over-year comparisons in the first half of fiscal 2013.</p>
          <p>In terms of foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels FX is expected to have a neutral impact on EPS this year compared to a $0.02 negative impact on EPS in last year's first quarter.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.6% and net interest expense to be in the $78 million range. We anticipate a weighted average share count of approximately 753 million shares. I'll wrap up the guidance with our store growth plans for fiscal 2013. On a consolidated basis, we plan to add approximately 160 new stores with approximately 10 planned closings. This will result in 150 net new stores for a total of 3,055 stores by year end, increasing square footage by approximately 5%.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., with the continued very strong performance of Marmaxx and HomeGoods, we will continue to aggressively expand these businesses. Our plans call for 85 new stores at Marmaxx and 40 new stores at HomeGoods.</p>
          <p>Internationally, we will continue to grow our store base steadily. At TJX Canada, we plan to add 15 new stores in fiscal 2013 including nine Marshalls stores. At TJX Europe, we expect to add 10 new stores this year. We will now open the call for questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to keep the call on schedule. Appreciate if you cooperate with this limit. Thanks, and we'll take questions, now I'll turn it back to Candy.</p>
          <p>So, Candy?</p>

          <p>Hi, Stacy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess a couple of quick ones. One is, do you think that the AUC pressure that the industry faced in 2011 had any negative impact on you and do you expect any positive impact going forward simply from the AUC changes we're seeing in the industry? And then second of all, can you comment on how you view everyday low prices in your competitive set versus department store sale price and does that change the way you think about your business at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Stacy, look, I'm going to come back to who we are, and that is the distance between us and everyone else in terms of cost, and it's the way we buy. We're an off-price company. We buy very close to need. You could not have a more promotional environment. I don't think I've ever seen it this promotional, as in December, and not only were we able to keep our margins, but we had a very, very strong comp.</p>
          <p>So my answer, really, to both those questions is, our model works if we execute our model every day, whether the prices go up or whether people go every day, the model works that way.</p>
          <p>Hello? Did we just lose it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Can you just talk a little bit about segment profitability for TJX Europe? It seems like it improved pretty nicely in the fourth quarter, but you still seem to be below peak levels. Are there any structural reasons why margins can't get back up to the peak levels that you were at a couple of years ago and which we expect for the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll have Jeff go through the year model. But we feel in Europe we're certainly going to increase. I think we're planning like 280 basis points for the year or something, pretty strong increase, Jeff will go through the exact numbers. But we feel that we're in a very good place going forward. We're being cautious. We feel that it's a pretty big jump from this year.</p>
          <p>We certainly have good infrastructure built in. We're planning on only adding 10 more stores next year. So we think this is a really good, sensible, viable plan. Going forward, we still see it as an 8% model. I think this year will be a very good year for us to really see how strong we can be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think if you look at the &#x2013; I'll talk to the fourth quarter and then fiscal 2013. So on the fourth quarter, we saw the margins at Europe go from 3.4% to 5.6%, so that's a 220-basis point increase. That was suppressed a bit by FX. So if you adjust for FX, that 5.6% would've been 6.2%. We actually had a 280 basis point increase.</p>
          <p>The other factor there is that that 280 basis point increase in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by the fourth quarter items. There was about a 200 basis point hit to Europe in the fourth quarter from those fourth quarter items. So you can just &#x2013; we would've had explosive margin growth in Europe in the fourth quarter if it weren't for the fourth quarter items having a 200 basis point impact and currency having a 60 basis point impact. So we feel great about the track that we're on.</p>
          <p>Now as we look forward, we planned the European business on a 4% to a 5% comp next year. And last year, we had a 2.4% segment profit margin. This year, we're planning at 4.9% to 5.4% and that's with 20 basis points of benefit from the 53rd week. So if you adjust out the 53rd week, it would be 4.7% to 5.2%. The 53rd week, in general, will benefit our pre-tax, our margins, in total TJX and our business by 20 basis points next year. So Europe goes from 2.4% to 4.9% to 5.4% with 20 basis points of the benefit of the 53rd week included in that number.</p>
          <p>So we feel good that will be strong, steady growth. Obviously, a higher level of comp would get us to a higher level of bottom line, margin improvement. And as Carol mentioned, there really are no structural reasons that we can't get back to 8% and above on the second profit margin for Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Carol, you teased us a little bit with your comments on e-commerce, and I'm wondering, is e-commerce part of the discussion for 2012? In other words, can you launch this year and if not, what's preventing you from getting there? It seems like the team has been together now for quite some time.</p>

          <p>Yeah, well, again, we're gonna &#x2013; we'll give you a little more color as we get through the year. We learned a lot in the past. We learned a lot from Europe, even when you look at Marshalls in Canada, we're going slow and it's tremendously strong. And we want to make sure that we do e-commerce right.</p>
          <p>So, we are &#x2013; yeah, in our three-year model, it's a tremendous opportunity and we &#x2013; again, I'm going to just keep coming back to, we want to do it right and then we can accelerate it.

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Carol, I just want to, you used the word outrageous value several times and it's interesting is &#x2013; we guess that obviously is an evolving competitive landscape. But I'm just wondering how do you reconcile what outrageous value means and how that's different from the type of value we've seen in the past with the fact that merchandise margins are planned up 10 basis points in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adrianne, it has to do raising the bar every year and the messaging with the team and Ernie has spent a lot of time strategizing with all our divisions to absolutely leverage, to really maximize our off-price model, to keep our inventories even leaner next year and to increase our brand relationships and make them even stronger. So, we're pretty excited about it.</p>
          <p>Ernie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adrianne, I would say it also lines up with the liquidity and the inventory trends that we've been maintaining. We're making sure that we're really buying hand to mouth and the environment seems to have crossed all the markets whether the better markets or the moderate markets and in all categories within the store, seems to have a fair amount of goods. So, again, that kind of fits the model and allows us to, I think, ramp up the exciting values that we have and get them to that outrageous level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Adrianne, as always, we have a few new interesting initiatives up our sleeves and we're always testing things. I just want to make a comment on the margin also.</p>
          <p>&lt; A &#x2013; [05L8JJ-E Jeffrey Naylor]&gt;: Yeah. I guess just to set the record straight, the margin is up more &#x2013; the margin was up 10 basis points in the fourth quarter. As we look at fiscal 2013 for the full year, our gross profit is planned up 20 to 50 basis points. 10 of that is from the 53rd week.</p>
          <p>The balance is all coming from merchandise margins. So the implied merchandise margin increases in fiscal 2013 are in that 10 to 40 basis point range. The third component of the gross profit margin, buying and occupancy, we've got planned flat, but you'd expect that on a 1% to 2% comp. Obviously, we would expect to get some leverage if, in fact, the comp were to exceed the level that we have in our plans.</p>
          <p>So but I think the point, the color here is merchandise margins are being planned up 10 to 40 next year. So we have put some improvement, baked into our full-year model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Adrianne.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. So that's my point, Jeff. I'm just wondering in terms of the merchandise margins, 10 to 40. Maybe you can help us think about is that more of a liquidity issue, what sort of turn expectations we could expect to, because we are getting some...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a big piece of it. And as I said before, as we get better, we talked about systems and we talked about a lot we do manually. If we are, again, very focused on the right goods at the right stores at the right time and I said it a few times that we have still lots of opportunity there.</p>
          <p>A big chunk of our investments for 2012 are in systems to improve for the future. We're going to have another DC on the West Coast in the future. So we're putting investment in, but we see certainly opportunities for this year and hopefully even going forward greater opportunities, we get some of these things really up and running. But we're far from at the end of our game.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Next question. Kimberly Greenberger, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. Good morning. Carol, I'm wondering if you can talk to us a little bit about your business in Canada. The sales numbers really turned around in the fourth quarter relative to the comps they had been producing in Q1, Q2 and Q3. But the operating margins fell in Q4 and it had been relatively stable in the second and the third quarter. Are there some anomalies in there that you could address, and what would your expectation be for Canada here in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, Canada, we closed StyleSense, which is a piece of the fourth quarter and a little bit of merchandise margin due to cold weather merchandise that we wanted to clean out. And we had an increase in advertising. So really those three factors are what hit us in the fourth quarter. But I think Ernie should give you some color, because I think he's feeling, and we're feeling, pretty good about Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kimberly, I think, a couple of things we focused on up there is &#x2013; at one point in the year, I would say, in the first half into the third quarter, we were a little concerned with the values and how we're stacking up against the competition up there. So, going into the fourth quarter, we felt much better about what type of values we're delivering across the store there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, and we've talked about this before. Our ladies business, which is obviously a core component of our Winners business, was something where we thought we had execution issues early on, and we feel we made a lot of inroads there. And if you look in the fourth quarter, we don't get specific, but we did have an improvement in our trend in the ladies business, and even more recently into January.</p>
          <p>So that's always good bellwether for us going forward as we enter 2012. And also a great job on inventory control and liquidity. And with the momentum going into the new year, all those components are making us feel pretty good. I think Jeff wanted to talk to the guidance a little bit here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As we look forward, Kimberly, so we would right now, embedded in our full-year guidance, Canada is &#x2013; we have Canada in as 2% to 3% comp on top of the minus 1% from last year. In terms of bottom line, we have been planned right now 13.6% to 13.9% on top of the 13% &#x2013; I'm sorry, I'm reading the wrong number there &#x2013; take that &#x2013; we have them planned at 12.9% to 13.1% on top of the 13% last year. Canada benefits 10 basis points from the 53rd week, but they're getting hit by 20 basis points in terms of foreign currency, at current rate.</p>
          <p>So if you take all that out, Canada, we would've have planned up 10, on 52-week basis, flat to up 20 basis points on a 2% to 3% comp. That's about what you'd expect, right, a flat to 20 basis point improvement, your bottom line margin on a 2% to 3% comp. I think, which really underscores our belief that the business is back on solid footing and we're confident in the profit and the profit flow through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other point, Kimberly is, again, learning from the past. Ernie has put a pretty strong team together for Marshalls. So we have invested in some bench strength, so that we get ahead of Marshalls as we go forward. We're only planning on six additional stores next year, but &#x2013; excuse me, nine additional stores &#x2013; but that's really going to set us up for the future, so that when we start to really accelerate, we're going to be in great shape and we won't skip a beat.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Next question comes from Paul Lejuez. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hey, Jeff, can you talk a little bit about new store productivity at Marmaxx now that you're opening more stores in some densely populated areas? I would have expected productivity to move higher. My numbers don't show that, but it's always hard for us to get at it exactly. So just wondering what your numbers show. And then also, can you maybe just share with us your assumptions for HomeGoods comps and profit margin assumptions for 2012? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in terms of the productivity, while we are opening in densely populated urban areas in Marmaxx, we are also opening a lot of stores in more rural markets, where the store will open maybe in a sort of $4 million to $4.5 million sales range, which is well below the average. That said, we pay significantly less in rent and can deliver four-wall contribution that's just &#x2013; in dollar basis, just slightly below the average, but on a percentage basis, actually, is as strong or stronger than the average.</p>
          <p>So we've got a really great opening program going in smaller markets, and the productivity in those, as well as strong contribution margins, strong ROIs, the sales tend to be less than the average. And that is really counteracting, or balancing out, the benefit on &#x2013; in terms of sales per store we're getting from those bigger stores.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance, since I've given Canada and Europe, why don't I just give Marmaxx and HomeGoods? You asked for HomeGoods, so I'll start with that. The HomeGoods, we have planned the comp up 1% to 2%. The four-wall profitability, we have planned 10.7% to 10% &#x2013; I'm sorry, four wall profitability, the segment profit margin we have planned at 10.7% to 10.9% and that's again with the 20 basis point benefit from the 53rd week.</p>
          <p>Marmaxx, we have planned to comp up 1% to 2% and we have the profit margin planned at 13.6% to 13.9%, and again that's with &#x2013; in the case of Marmaxx, that's 10 to 20 basis points of improvements due to the 53rd week. So you can see in the case of Marmaxx, we're planning the pre-tax margins down slightly to up slightly on a 1% to 2% comp, again, what you'd expect. And in the case of HomeGoods, same thing, on a 52-week basis, down slightly to up slightly on a 1% to 2% comp.</p>

          <p>Good morning, it's <mark type="ph" /> Marian Casper (48:07) in for Evren. Just quickly, it's clear that your business does very well in both healthy and challenging macro environments. So we're wondering, in your opinion, what do you view as the biggest risk to your business?</p>

          <p>Hey guys, congratulations on a very good end to the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about, what does your research show in terms of traffic? Are you getting new customers, or is your customer coming back more often, or is it a combination of both? And then, what are your expectations for traffic and ticket for 2012? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, for the year, we were up slightly in traffic and in basket. We ended the fourth quarter very strong. We had tremendous momentum from our tri branding, which is pretty exciting because we ended the year going in with a lot of new customers for the new year.</p>
          <p>Marketing plans for next year are &#x2013; we have an increased dollar versus last year. We will increase our impressions and more than likely, we will be on Network TV a couple of more weeks this year than we were last year. We keep learning more and more about our marketing and it's pretty exciting.</p>
          <p>So, we're just going to keep bringing in new customers and that's a big part of our growth vehicle. As I said before, our penetration is a lot less than typical of department stores. So, we have a long way to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's hard to determine exactly the extent to which the increase in transactions is being driven by new customers versus existing customers. All we can really do is look at that penetration stat in terms of the percentage of the customers that shop our chains this year versus last year. What we've seen over time is that's been inking up as we've moved over the last several years. And we think that will continue to do that going forward, given the importance of value to customers.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to come back to the earlier question for a second about Europe and just to understand kind of the progression going forward that you would tend to expect. I know in the past, it was highly seasonal in terms of profitability to the fourth quarter. Do you expect it to be smoother kind of going forward than, let's say, it was in 2009, a relatively normal year? That would be the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, we're giving full year guidance, but what I will say to you is that I think it just reads of opportunity. And we did &#x2013; we have a lot of &#x2013; the percent of profit in the back half is almost 85%. So both Ernie and I just look at that and say, 'this is an opportunity', and that's the way we approach it. So our goal is to get it back. We want it to be an 8% model. We're working towards that. We like the team very much, and we're really heading in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't have this here in front of me, Dan, but I suspect that the pattern is probably not that much different than what we would have seen in 2009. Maybe a little bit less weighted towards the back half but still, more weighted towards the back half than our North American businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess just related to that, what you gave us, the fourth quarter adjusted margin for Europe, from the table it shows 5.7%. Was there an additional adjustment that brought it to the 6%, I think you said 6.2% or 6.5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There was &#x2013; currency had an impact in the fourth quarter of &#x2013; hang on one second, let me just get it in front me. Currency had an impact in the fourth quarter in Europe of about 50 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I thought that was already captured but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So if you look at the &#x2013; we have tables that are on the &#x2013; we put the tables on the web that give you the sales and marketing comparability with and without currency. So, before &#x2013; ex currency &#x2013; the reported numbers we went from 3.4% to 5.6% in the quarter, Dan. So that's up 220 bips.</p>
          <p>If you adjust for currency, it would be going from 2.9% up to 5.7%, or a 280 basis point increase. So that was the difference. And then on top of that, there's the 200 basis point hit we're getting for the fourth quarter items, which would have taken you even higher had we not incurred those items in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Just quickly, the other question was regarding the opportunistic buys that you did last year. Obviously, the year-to-year inventory change came down significantly by year-end. How would you assess overall the sell-through, in terms of traffic and margins, on that opportunistic buys relative to the original thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you're trying to get at pack-aways, I assume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup, yup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in very good shape. We're always within our number. We have more pack-aways than last year because there was just an abundance of fabulous cold weather and brands. So again, we have more pack-aways than last year, still within the range that we always are, but our inventories are pretty lean and we're nice and liquid. We're really in great shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we don't comment on the margin on pack-away product versus the margin on other product. Again, we've never &#x2013; while we've been increasing the mix towards close-out over time, we've never in our MD&amp;A called out that mix is a factor in merchandise margin increases year-over-year. We get very, very good merchandise margins out of our incentive buys as well, so. But again, it's not &#x2013; we really don't comment on pack-away versus other forms of purchased goods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The key is our inventory in stores is way down, we're very, very liquid, and there is a very plentiful market out there.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and just a couple of follow-on points. The first on e-commerce and any opportunity to move more quickly on that, that is say in the calendar 2012, and to use that more aggressively as a marketing vehicle as well as a sales tool. And just your further thoughts on e-commerce if you would. And then, if you could provide specifics regarding the European growth to 875 stores, wondering how that breaks out by country or by region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You guys keep asking me about e-commerce and I'm going to say it 9 million times, we know all the opportunities and we know how many people come to our website. And I guarantee we will do it right. But as always, we want to do things, planning in a conservative way, putting in most of our cost factors, certainly from what we can see, and doing it right. The reason we look long term and see it as just a tremendous vehicle is just that leveraging of the platform and the opportunity to even sell product that we don't have in our stores today, to sell product that we have in our stores today. So we will get there, and we will do it in the right way.</p>
          <p>In terms of the European growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The stores &#x2013; the 750 to 875 breaks down as follows, Richard, we have 300 to 325 stores potential in the U.K.; 250 to 300 in Germany; 100 to 150 HomeSense stores and 100 stores in Poland. So it just reflects the markets that we're in currently and the concepts that we have currently. So we obviously believe that there's potential beyond those numbers. But our mantra right now is go slow, build the infrastructure and then, once we've got good &#x2013; once we've reestablished very strong performance in the division, which we believe we're on the way to do, to accelerate at that point in time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when do you see the benefit?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the supply chain, we're kind of in the first inning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we're really looking at this as probably a two to a three-year project, with more investment in 2012. Then it starts to flatten out. In terms of A.J.s, we really &#x2013; we have the benefits that we talked about from a year ago. But more importantly, it's really what just allows us to grow the Marmaxx chain and the HomeGoods chain. So we see the increasing number of stores and obviously, both those businesses have much stronger margins than our A.J. Wright chain did.</p>
          <p>So there's the opportunity. And that's why we keep increasing the number of stores, because we've really learned how to exist in lower demographics, in high density, lower income, variety, learned a little bit more about the diversity piece of it. So this is what is just allowing us to really grow those chains, and that was the idea initially. It's to leverage four big businesses and not be as spread out, so we feel very good about going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just &#x2013; Jeff, really I guess a lot of questions have been asked, but just a question on the buying and occupancy. What is the sensitivity for every comp point &#x2013; you come &#x2013; for the total company &#x2013; for every comp point you come in above your plan, how much will that lever the &#x2013; do you know?</p>
          <p>&lt; A &#x2013; [05L8JJ-E Jeffrey Naylor]&gt;: Every comp point above plan will leverage expenses by 20 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>20 bips, and that's consistent...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the bottom line by 20 bips, and we really don't break that out between the B&amp;O and SG&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. And is that &#x2013; that's consistent with &#x2013; I've asked this question before, I just want to make sure. Is this consistent with what &#x2013; has that changed over the last...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; that assumes no merchandise margin expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's just the expense leverage that we'd expect. So if you got merchandise margin expansion on top of that, you'll probably &#x2013; we gotten a lot of that over the last three years, you'd expect it to be more. So you really can't say a point of comp equates to 20 basis points on the bottom line, because it really depends how we manage our inventories and the quality of the goods that we're buying, the turns, etcetera, and how those impact merchandise margin. But you can say that a point of comp is worth 20 basis points on the bottom line, and that's mixed between G&amp;A and buying and occupancy, so there's a spread between the two. But we get &#x2013; you'd expect bottom line to see 20 bips</p>

          <p>Hi. Two questions, first on Canada and then general corporate expenses. With Canada last &#x2013; this past fiscal year, you had a segment margin of 13% and despite some poor execution, I'm just wondering why you're not raising the ceiling on that potential to closer to 14%. Because once you really start executing this year, it seems like there's a lot of upward opportunity.</p>
          <p>And then just general corporate expense, what's driving the increase? And should we expect it to be similar in the new fiscal year as it was last year?</p>

          <p>Okay. Well, I'm going to turn it over to Jeff in a moment, but I just want to make a comment on Europe &#x2013; on Canada, rather. I think we have a very prudent plan in there and we are also investing in our business going forward, so that's a piece of it. But I think both Ernie and I are very, very comfortable with our plans. And I think it makes a lot of sense on a 2% to 3% comp. So Jeff, you want to go through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just &#x2013; just an example on Canada. On a 2% to 3% comp, you wouldn't expect a lot of expense leverage. We are making investments and we clearly have had some hits this year that have been related to getting the margins &#x2013; improving our margin and getting it more aligned with the market. So I think &#x2013; we feel comfortable with the way we set the plan for next year.</p>
          <p>In terms of corporate expenses, we would expect a lower increase this year than last year. So you look at this year, we had 100 &#x2013; the corporate expenses were $228 million against $169 million last year. About a quarter of that are the fourth quarter items and a write-off we took earlier this year associated with moving one of our buying offices. A little more than half of this is investment in talent <mark type="ph" /> effects (1:02:50), including TJX University, investments in new systems and e-commerce. The balance reflects normal growth.</p>
          <p>For fiscal 2013, we're expecting the corporate expenses to be, on a 53-week basis, $270 million to $277 million. And on a 52-week basis, that's $268 million to $276 million. So that's up, what, that's up about $40 million to $45 million.</p>
          <p>Almost all of that is the investment in our data center, e-commerce business and other investments that Carol mentioned, partially offset by the fourth quarter items that go away. We had a voluntary retirement program, a separation agreement that flowed through the corporate item. So the net of all of those really explains the lion's share of that growth next year. We would expect that growth really to level out once we get to fiscal 2014.</p>

          <p>As you think about inventory trends and the efficient supply chain, you've always talked about store level inventory turns around 10 to 11 times. How do you see that developing or changing given the inventory plans? And then just two other quick things, number one, marketing spend, how you're thinking about it for 2012 versus 2011? And lastly, on remodeled stores, how's the performance and how's the occupancy costs? Thank you. Bye.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Dana, that's three questions. Well, to give you specifics on inventory terms, I can tell you as I said before, it's one of our biggest investments going forward we are sort of at the beginning of the game. This year, we still will decrease our inventories in stores and we will turn faster. But we don't know the end game of the opportunity because we're going to see how it yields. But we just see a lot of things that we think we can do better for the future. So we're pretty excited about that.</p>
          <p>The marketing spend what I said to you is we're up in dollars versus last year. We will be up in dollars this coming year. We'll be on Network TV a couple of more weeks than we, more than we were a year ago. So, the impressions will be up. But more importantly, we're leveraging all of our businesses together and we think we have some very, very strong campaigns going forward and I think, each year, we get better and better at this.</p>
          <p>In terms of the remodels, we really don't discuss the specific numbers. We like it. We're happy with it. And next year, we are planning to do over 300. Along with that, we're always looking at the next generation and other in-store initiatives that can drive sales for us in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of financial factoids here. On the remodels, the recent performance, the lists we are seeing a very comparable to the lists that we were seeing in earlier classes of remodels. And on the marketing, the dollars will be &#x2013; spend will be up in line with sales and are at the sales ratio. Right now, we're planning basically flat although we reserve the right to change that as we can move through the year.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, congrats to Scott and congrats on a good quarter. Just...</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just maybe you could help us. We've had a lot of talk about it, but what is the magnitude of the inventory improvement you are talking about? I mean can you framework it in reference to turns, are we looking it as another turn that's possible or in the amount of inventory that you think you can take out of stores and maybe tack on how the DC in California helps with these efforts? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah it's &#x2013; I think as we look at turns, we're reluctant to quantify what it's going to be going forward. When you look at store turns in the past three years, we've gone from turning &#x2013; three years ago, we used to say we turn eight to nine times a year. Now, we're saying we turn 10 to 11. We have some divisions that are turning faster than others. We have disclosed that HomeGoods' is net 14 to 15 range. So we think there's opportunities across a couple of our divisions, and systems are only going to help us do that.</p>
          <p>The other thing that helps us is our DC productivity &#x2013; we've invested in engineered standards. So when Carol says we're at the first inning, we're on the first inning of our systems investments. But in terms of some of the investments we've made in engineered standards in our distribution center, those were pretty far along. We're more like in the sixth, seventh inning. And those have yielded huge results. It's not insignificant that we've have 10 years of growth in Marmaxx in terms of comp and new stores without having had to add a DC, and a lot of that is coming from the productivity that we're seeing and a lot of that has come from engineered standards.</p>
          <p>So we think there's opportunity going forward. We don't want to cap our thinking on this, but I would say we're very proud of the increases we've been able to generate at store-level. We think the investments that we've made have yielded very strong results and we're excited about the future investments that we're making that should yield additional benefits. I just don't want to put a number on it, Jeff, at this point. Clearly, we have some of these baked into our plan with a 10 to 40-basis point improvement in merchandise margin next year. And we'll see where we are as we go.</p>
