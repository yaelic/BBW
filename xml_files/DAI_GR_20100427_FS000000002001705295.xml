          <p>Thank you, Michael. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our conference call on the results of the first quarter of 2010. After last year's deep recession, the world economy continued along its recovery path in the first months of 2010. Strong growth impetus came once more from the rapidly expanding Asian economies, especially China and India, but the economies of South America also achieved significant growth. Our automotive division's unit sales profited from both from the globally higher demand and from the market success of our attractive motor range.</p>
          <p>EBIT of &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the first quarter underlined our strong performance. Especially the very positive development of Mercedes-Benz Cars and Daimler Trucks led to this strong improvement. Revenue rose in line with the increased unit sales by 13% to &#x20AC;21.2 billion. Net profit is positive again with &#x20AC;0.6 billion. And we achieved a positive free cash flow from the industrial business in the first three months of the year leading to a slight increase in net liquidity of the industrial business.</p>
          <p>On April 7 Daimler and Renault-Nissan announced a strategic cooperation, which focuses on concretely defined projects in the area of small cars and engines. The partners have signed a general framework agreement on long-term strategic cooperation. This involves the following projects: First, we will develop a common architecture for our smart and the Renault Twingo. As part of this project, we will launch a new smart 4-seater. Another aspect is that an electric drive version of all smart models will be supplied right from beginning.</p>
          <p>And second, we will expand our engine portfolio by jointly developing new small 3 and 4 cylinder engines. Third, Nissan and its premium brand, Infiniti, will procure larger gasoline and diesel engines from Mercedes-Benz. And fourth, we will extend our range of vans by using a common architecture for city vans and we will also share powertrain components for mid-sized vans.</p>
          <p>With this strategic cooperation, we will strengthen our product range both for small engines, as well as in the small car and compact car segments and the partners in this cooperation will be able to exploit increased economies of scale. The cooperation will be supported by a symbolic cross-shareholding of 3.1%, which Daimler will hold in Renault and Nissan and the two of them in aggregate will hold then in Daimler.</p>
          <p>Let's now come back to our business development. In the first quarter, global demand for cars generally continued to recover primarily due to the rapid growth in China. However, car sales in many major markets are still profiting from various state incentive programs, although this applies more to the mass market segment than to the premium segment.</p>
          <p>Worldwide demand for trucks benefited from the strong Chinese market. Our truck demand remained rather restrained in Western Europe. The U.S. truck market continued to stabilize and expanded slightly compared to the weak prior year quarter. Daimler's strong performance in the first quarter of 2010 can be demonstrated if we look at our key figures.</p>
          <p>Revenue increased by 13% to &#x20AC;21.2 billion. We posted group EBIT of plus &#x20AC;1.2 billion compared to minus 1.4 a year ago. This strong improvement not only compared to the weak prior year period, but also to the fourth quarter of 2009 is due to the significantly improved earnings situation, mainly at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Daimler Trucks. Net profit was &#x20AC;0.6 billion, a positive swing of 1.9 billion in comparison with the first quarter of last year. Earnings per share improved to $0.65; the free cash flow of industrial business in the first quarter totaled &#x20AC;0.3 billion. Net liquidity from our industrial business of &#x20AC;7.3 billion remains at the high level of the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow of the industrial business was positively affected by the positive earnings. In addition the sale of our stake in Tata Motors led to a cash flow inflow of approximately &#x20AC;300 million. On the other hand our working capital increased by &#x20AC;0.6 billion due to the higher inventories in line with the growing vehicle demand and preparations for the spring selling season, which are usual for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a closer look at the individual divisions. For the first quarter of this year, Mercedes-Benz Cars continued its positive development of the fourth quarter of 2009. Unit sales increased compared to the first quarter of last year by 20% to 277,000 vehicles. This increase was due in particular to strong growth in the E-Class and S-Class segments, but we also sold more cars of the A and B class and in the SUV segment.</p>
          <p>While unit sales in Western Europe were slightly the prior year level, sales in the United States increased by 28% to 65,000 units. In China, Mercedes-Benz Cars more than doubled its unit sales to 27,000 vehicles and thus maintained its position as a premium brand with the strongest growth in that very important market.</p>
          <p>The division's revenue increased from 9.1 billion to &#x20AC;11.6 billion. Mercedes-Benz Cars increased its EBIT to plus &#x20AC;806 million compared to minus 1.1 billion last year and return on sales went up to 7%. The main factors contributing to this distinct earnings improvement was a significant increase of unit sales, especially in the full size and luxury segments, the related improvement in the product mix and improved pricing.</p>
          <p>Currency FX had a negative impact on earnings, but were partially offset by efficiency gains and cost reductions. In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2009, EBIT improved by another &#x20AC;200 million. This improvement compared to Q4 2009 could be achieved despite lower unit sales.</p>
          <p>With the introduction of the new Cabriolet Mercedes-Benz E-Class family is now complete. Sales of the 2-door convertible started in Europe in January. At the end of March the first vehicles were delivered to customers.</p>
          <p>In the exciting E-Class Cabriolet, we have introduced the all-new AIRCAP system, which reduces turbulence substantially for the occupants of all of our 4 seats. At the same time, the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG was launched on the market, the new Gullwing model has enjoyed an excellent response from our customers, with orders significantly exceeding our expectations.</p>
          <p>The SLS AMG has already received a number of major awards like the prestigious Golden Steering Wheel 2009 award. Recently, the Gullwing also even picked up the Red Dot Design Award, one of the most renowned international design prizes to be awarded.</p>
          <p>The new generation R-Class had its all over premiere at the 2010 New York International Auto Show. The original SUV Tourer has been extensively updated including a completely redesigned front end. Our latest research vehicle, the F 800 Style presented in Geneva impressively demonstrates Mercedes-Benz' ability to harmonize automobile fascination, with the continually increasing demands of environmental compatibility, and unparalleled safety features.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks sold 71,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2010, 8% more than in the prior-year period. Particular the positive sales development in South America and Southeast Asia more than offset lower unit sales in Germany, the Middle East and Japan. Trucks Europe/Latin America sold 26,000 vehicles representing an increase over the low number of 23,000 units sold in the first quarter of 2009. Unit sales in Brazil were boosted by 81%, driven by the economic recovery, tax relief and state support with a provision of favorable financing packages. In Western Europe, unit sales decreased from 11,600 to 8,600 vehicles following the general weak market development.</p>
          <p>The sharpest sales decline was recorded in Germany with a minus of 31%. Unit sales of Trucks NAFTA rose by 4% to 18,000 vehicles, while the business in the U.S. American markets showed slight signs of recovery, unit sales declined in Canada and Mexico. Trucks Asia sold 27,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a plus of 8% compared to last year's periods. The biggest increase was in Indonesia. Unit sales in Japan declined further however.</p>
          <p>Overall demand in the regions outside Japan was 18% higher than in Q1 2009. Revenue of Daimler Trucks of &#x20AC;4.9 billion was close to the level of the prior year period. Further signs of recovery are apparent from the development of incoming orders, especially the Trucks Europe/Latin America and the Trucks Asia units achieved more orders than in the previous quarters. As expected, incoming orders in the NAFTA region decreased in Q1, due to some pull forward effects in the prior quarters, before the introduction of the EPA '010 emission regulations.</p>
          <p>Due to the growing demand for Mercedes-Benz trucks, short time working arrangements will be discontinued in our Werk and Gaggenau Plants at the end of May, one month earlier than originally planned.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks is back in the black, the division achieved EBIT of &#x20AC;130 million in the first quarter of 2010 after 4 quarters of negative earnings in 2009. Return on sales improved to 2.7%. Although overall markets in the triad remained rather weak at the beginning of the current year, the turnaround was achieved mainly due to the positive business development in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Furthermore the measures taken to reduce costs and positive effects from the repositioning of Daimler Trucks North America and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation also led to the earnings improvement. On the other hand, the implementation of the repositioning programs still caused charges of &#x20AC;17 million in the first three months.</p>
          <p>As a significant product enhancement Daimler Trucks is extending its product range and will gradually introduce EEV versions in certain output classes of the Actros, Axor and Atego up to July 2010. EEV means Enhanced Environmentally Friendly Vehicle, and is a classification used for engines, which comply with an even more stringent exhaust emission standard than Euro 5. The EEV standard reduces particulate emissions by roughly one-third compared to the already stringent Euro 5 limits.</p>
          <p>Also as part of our Shaping Future Transportation initiative, 10 Fuso Canter Eco Hybrids are undergoing a 3 year fleet trial in London. Depending on its particular application, The Canter Eco Hybrid uses around 10 to 15% less fuel than the conventional light duty truck, with correspondingly lower CO2 emissions. Last week, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation unveiled the new generation of the Fuso Super Great. The fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly truck complies with the JP09, which is currently the world's most stringent emissions standard. Fuso's flagship truck features a new 6R10 diesel engine with BlueTec technology from Daimler Truck's new engine generation for use in commercial vehicles worldwide.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks North America has presented 2 new heavy duty trucks to its customers, the updated Freightliner Coronado for on-highway use and the Freightliner Coronado Severe Duty for specialist applications such as the construction sector or for municipalities, cities.</p>
          <p>Our Van division sold 47,000 vehicles in the first quarter, compared to 29,000 units a year ago. In Western Europe the most important market for Mercedes-Benz Vans, unit sales increased by almost 60% to 35,000 vehicles. Despite the continued difficult market situation in this region, the division was able to improve its market leadership in the segment of midsized and large vans.</p>
          <p>In the NAFTA regions, sales jumped from 500 to 3000 units at the beginning of this year's sales forced a splinter in the United States and Canada were taken over by our own retail organization. The division's revenue increased by 31% to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Mercedes-Benz Vans achieved an EBIT of &#x20AC;64 million in the first quarter after minus &#x20AC;91 million a year ago. Return on sales improved to 3.8%. The main reason for this improvement was the increase in unit sales, negative exchange rate effects could largely be compensated by efficiency enhancement and cost reductions.</p>
          <p>A prototype of the Mercedes-Benz Vito with battery electric drive recently undertook and passed a series of the harshest winter tests near the Polar Circle. The test van encountered no problems with even in extreme cold, snow and ice with regard to the safety systems, drive, suspension, or all of the other components of a Mercedes-Benz van.</p>
          <p>The Electric Vito is the first vehicle in its class worldwide that is delivered from the factory with an electric drive system as standard equipment. Equipped with a lithium ion battery, the range of the Vito averaged 130 km but can be considerably higher given an appropriate driving style. There is no loss in terms of payload or load volume compared to a conventional powered Vito. In the middle of the year up to 50 Vito E-Cell vans are participating in a test project in the Stuttgart area. The project is supported by public funds and intended to promote the development of urban infrastructure and electric mobility of public transport.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses raised its unit sales from 6800 to 8400 vehicles. A significant recovery of demand was posted in Latin America driven by the positive development in Brazil. Daimler Buses sold 5800 Mercedes-Benz chassis representing a growth of 74%. In Western Europe, we sold 1100 buses and chassis, thus remaining 4% below the high level of the first quarter of 2009. Declines were posted in the city bus business, which had previously been stable as well as in the coach segment.</p>
          <p>Sales in the NAFTA region decreased by 58% to 500 units. Whereas the sales level was stable in the United States and Canada, demand declined considerably in the Mexican market. Revenue of the division increased by 12% to &#x20AC;1 billion. Daimler Buses posted an EBIT of &#x20AC;41 million in Q1.</p>
          <p>As expected, the high earnings level over the prior year could not be fully repeated. The less favorable regional and model mix contributed to the lower EBIT. Earnings were particularly impacted by the lower sales of complete buses in Western Europe. Return on sales was 4.1%, which is still a high level in the industry.</p>
          <p>The Mercedes-Benz Travego is now offered as a "Safety Edition." The Coach of the Year 2010 includes all the safety features which are available in the market and the customer benefits from both from the utmost safety in road traffic and also from the very attractive price and low insurance costs.</p>
          <p>Last month Eagle Bus handed over 2 Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid buses to the Hamburg Municipal Transport Company. The Citaro BlueTec Hybrid is the only hybrid bus in existence today that can travel for certain distances solely on electric power without using its diesel engine. Following the comprehensive facelift for the new Setra TopClass 400 in Europe, the Setra brand presented the revised U.S. version, the Setra TopClass S 417 in Las Vegas.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses North America delivered the last batch of buses to New York City Transit from an order of total of 1350 Orion Diesel-Electric Hybrid Transit buses. Daimler Buses is the world's largest manufacturer of Diesel-Electric Hybrid buses with over 3000 units either in service or on order.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services posted EBIT of &#x20AC;119 million in the first quarter of this year. The improvement compared to Q1 2009 was primarily due to the lower cost of risk and higher margins. On the other hand, we recognized charges in particular from the valuation of held for sale non-automotive assets, which are subject to lease agreements. Compared with the first quarter of last year new business increased by 6% to &#x20AC;6.2 billion and Daimler Financial Services worldwide contract volume amounted to &#x20AC;59.9 billion at the end of the first quarter adjusted for exchange rate effects. Contract volumes slightly decreased by 1% compared to the end of the year 2009.</p>
          <p>In view of the difficult economic situation, the focus remains on taking measures to reduce credit risks. Collection management and remarketing processes were further intensified. As planned Mercedes-Benz bank's total deposit volume decreased by &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the first three months of 2010 to 11.1 billion at March 31.</p>
          <p>The next chart shows the impressive improvement of Group EBIT over the last five quarters. From the low point of minus &#x20AC;1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009, EBIT rose to &#x20AC;1.2 billion in the quarter under review. We have rigorously reduced our costs and substantially improved our efficiency. Furthermore, we profited from the increase in demand and margins, particular for premium cars. And above all, we are able to offer exactly the right product with the new models of the E-Class and the new generation S-Class.</p>
          <p>What do we now expect for automotive markets in 2010? At the beginning of the second quarter, most available indicators suggest that the upturn of the world economy will continue. However, substantial stimulus is still being provided by special and one-time effects. Based on current estimates, we assume that the global demand for automobiles will grow by between 3 and 4% in 2010. In Western Europe, we expect the end of gradual or gradual expiry of scrappage incentives to lead to a decrease in new car registrations. In the United States, the market for cars and light trucks should recover gradually from a lower level following the massive declines of recent years.</p>
          <p>Demand for cars in China and India should continue to grow substantially this year. The Brazilian market is expected to weaken following the expiry of tax relief and Russia should recover moderately following the last year's demand slump, with support from the recently introduced scrappage program.</p>
          <p>Worldwide growth in the upper premium car segment is expected to be more pronounced than in the market overall, because these markets hardly profited from state incentive programs last year. Worldwide demand for commercial vehicles should also increase again following the distinct market decline in 2009. In Europe, market volume in the segment of trucks above 6 tons should be slightly above the level of 2009. For the NAFTA region, we anticipate growth of 10% from medium and heavy-duty trucks after 3 years of decline. In Brazil, we assume that demand in this segment will increase by 20 to 25% and in Japan the growth rate should be between 20 and 30%, although from a very low level.</p>
          <p>Demand for vans should increase from a low level. We anticipate worldwide market growth for buses, mainly driven by the Latin American markets. Western Europe, however demand for buses is likely to decrease. On the basis of these market expectations, we assume that Mercedes-Benz Cars will increase its unit sales in 2010. We will profit from our attractive and competitive model range. We therefore plan to grow at around double the rate of the global passenger car market in full-year 2010.</p>
          <p>Daimler Trucks also anticipates higher unit sales in 2010. We foresee impetus from some Latin American markets, as well as from a very low base in NAFTA region. In our Asian markets, total unit sales should increase once again. We also anticipate higher unit sales from Mercedes-Benz Vans and Daimler buses this year. At Daimler Buses the growth will be preliminary driven by the Latin American markets, whereas in Western Europe we will probably not quite achieve the level of 2009 due to the market reasons.</p>
          <p>What does it mean for our earnings? We expect the Daimler Group to post EBIT from its ongoing business of more than &#x20AC;4 billion in 2010. The key factors of this result are the further recovery of markets, the improvement of the economic climate, and the market success of our products.</p>
          <p>The biggest sources of risk are still to be seen in renewed turbulence of financial and capital markets with debate about high levels of public debt, raw material prices and possible overheating of the Chinese economy. We will still have a cautious look at the development of the automotive markets and continue to monitor the risks in the automotive value chain.</p>
          <p>At Mercedes-Benz Cars, we anticipate EBIT in the range of 2.5 to &#x20AC;3 billion this year, assisted by increased unit sales and higher margins. We expect Daimler Trucks to achieve EBIT between 500 and &#x20AC;700 million in 2010 with contributions from increased unit sales as well as from our programs to reposition the truck business in North America and Asia.</p>
          <p>For the Mercedes-Benz Vans division, we anticipate EBIT of approximately &#x20AC;250 million in 2010, at Daimler Buses we foresee significantly positive EBIT in the magnitude of the prior year. And in the financial services business, we assume that the cost of risk decrease this year. Furthermore, Daimler Financial Services will continue its efficiency enhancement actions. As a result, we anticipate EBIT of more than &#x20AC;500 million.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Now, we take the first question from Arndt Ellinghorst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one is on your order book, given you have better visibility now in cars and trucks. How long really is your order book in these divisions and how does that compare to the start of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on residual values, you're reporting almost 19 billion of operating leased assets on your balance sheet end of the first quarter. And could you quantify the effect from selling used cars coming off lease at an obviously better price now than a year ago and how much that is impacting your earnings at Mercedes and also your cash flow? And also on that topic, when you speak to your accountants, do they urge you to write up your leasing book? And at which stage maybe this year could we expect this? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt, thank you for your questions. Of course, coming to your question of order backlog first to &#x2013; passenger cars of course, we don't distribute the order backlog length in terms of months. But I can tell you is that we saw during January, February and March, an increase in order intakes and also an increase, so to say, in order backlog, especially on the March development. March was an extraordinary good month in that 3 months. That was not only true for passenger cars but also for vans and also we saw some up tick in the order books of trucks. So good news in Mercedes-Benz cars that also led to the question whether we increase our sales expectations what we did then one week ago.</p>
          <p>For the Truck business, the order intake you have seen &#x2013; or onto order intake's development of the first quarter especially there also in Europe, we had a better run in March again and not in January and February. That led to the &#x2013; also to the decision, to as of May, to reduce the short timing in the two factories. What we have announced right now, so some uptick there. We are in Japan also with order intakes let's say, but on the level we have seen it before. So not a surprise in the first quarter there. In NAFTA, of course, we are at a low level you have seen that; and we have the pre-buy effects in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So for trucks, of course, we have given our estimations for the markets. There I would say are not these totally positive &#x2013; are slight positive elements, yes in Europe and also some, a little bit in NAFTA to stabilize. In Japan we see it positive, but not as huge as I just described it in passenger cars, for example. Same as I said in vans for the March situation also positive developed. We see the value, of course, first to make it clear, we are what we have reserved for that was I do think in Q4 2008, if I remember right &#x2013; Q3 2008. Of course we according to the flight path, so we are no relief of provision with that regard. And so there is nothing in our first quarter here of this.</p>
          <p>The other residual values that are in passenger cars are stabilizing compared to Q4, so we are on the same good situation as it was in Q4. Even this German situation has a little bit, is doing a little bit better. You know we had some concerns with the German market, but in Q1 can only confirm that the residual values, that they are of a level that you can discuss, but they are in good shape compared to the fourth quarter, stabilizing and even some room of improvement.</p>
          <p>Of course at the end of the day in our earnings there is not a huge effect, not an effect of these residual values in the first quarter. Also from a cash flow point of view, the residual values, so the off-lease vehicles are not the subject of our good cash flow. What I regard as a good cash flow right now, it comes more from the EBIT development on the one hand and of course due to the fact that our working capital management was better as we had expected.</p>
          <p>The fourth question was a write up. We don't get to a write up, because under IFRS, there is no possibility even to write it up as you question is, from the auditors we get no pressure, because we cannot do it.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Kristina Church from Barclays Capital. I've got a couple of questions. Firstly, just going back to your guidance change, can you say that the huge increase in guidance that was &#x2013; when you only set the guidance in February, was that all because of the change in orders in March, or is there anything else in there that it made that guidance change so significant?</p>
          <p>Second question is, on slide 23 were you give your walk down, and you put in 2 billion for price volume, could you break that down as to how much impact was from volume and how much from price? And even if possible, break down to how much of the impact regionally. How much of the mix improvement came from Asia and in particular from China?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is on foreign exchange. You took a big hit in the Q1 from FX. And I was just wondering whether you are changing your guidance for the full year. I think you said it would be a mid triple digit hit from FX. Does that change since the Q1 or is it that we'll just get a favorable, more favorable FX in the next few quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kristina, thank you for your couple of questions. With regard to the guidance of course, as of now of course, I do think &#x2013; one thing we have a better visibility right now. And that is also based on the development of the business in March and April. As I mentioned it before that is a question also of order intake, and then the question of &#x2013; are we able &#x2013; based on facts to increase our sales in the respective divisions. So March and April business development was a &#x2013; impetus, a input deliverer to this changed guidance.</p>
          <p>Of course also affected our margin developments based on our March actuals, facts which we got last week. Of course showed us a good margin development and a good pricing development more or less not only in passenger cars, but also in trucks. And therefore of course, we came to the change of the guidance, which of course is significant but also, of course, we are regarding this as positive news. So to say, I hope that I &#x2013; even be in that position more often.</p>
          <p>Your question regarding the breakdown and walk, of course, we do not distribute further breakdowns to this walk. I do think we, in this regard, are okay with delivering transparency to quantify it a bit is, first of all, the volume impact, of course to Q1 was the biggest one. Of course, you know that our Q1 result 2009 was a very &#x2013; from a sales point of view very, very low.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I would name pricing. Of course, you know that we in passenger cars had last year the inventory stuff and the old E-Class, the introducing of the new one and therefore the old E-Class inventories, of course, therefore and in passenger cars a huge amount of course was also related to pricing.</p>
          <p>Then you had your third question was regarding exchange rates changes here. One thing is first of all for our guidance; we take into account more the current level of exchange rate whether we had in our first guidance more the higher numbers on the fourth quarter of 2009. Therefore of course it has an impact also on our guidance. In the walk you see a huge impact on currency of 347 million for Cars and overall in Daimler of 432.</p>
          <p>One main is, impact here is the British pound and the fact that we had last year &#x2013; due to the fact that the markets went down so drastically, we had an overhedged position in the pound and that led to some sale of hedges of course positively. So that had a positive effect in 2009, which you cannot repeat twice, of course, and therefore two-thirds of that is more related to the pound. It doesn't mean that we have worse hedges in the pound now, but of course we had a positive effect in 2009. Okay?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. Two questions are left on my side. The first one is with regard to Mercedes-Benz Cars. What I understand now from your better guidance for the division, it's among other things mainly an impact also from better pricing. So would you expect here the better pricing to continue also in the next 2 quarters, and yeah, that's on Mercedes and the second one is regarding market shares. It strikes me that you have lost market shares in couple of divisions, in couple of regions. And I get the feeling that you are prepared to sacrifice a big market share in favor of a better price. So would you confirm that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also of course, very valid questions. Of course due to the pricings, what we see right now, of course we can confirm that the pricing does look as a positive development we have seen will hold on for the next quarters. That is also the basis of our guidance. And of course, it is based on our good product range we do have and our strong &#x2013; so to say, puts our strong position in the market and with the customers.</p>
          <p>The third question &#x2013; the second question you had regarding market share, we have to differentiate a bit. When you see market shares going down somewhat in passenger cars, it might be related to scrappage fees and other development. So we have to adjust these kinds of numbers or they are impacted in 2009 by something like scrappage programs or other developments.</p>
          <p>In trucks, of course, we have a &#x2013; last year in Q1, we had an impact of course due to a strong order backlog. What we had in Q4 &#x2013; towards the end of 2008, we had a strong market share in 2009. We are now more on the normal level. So I would not reflect here any pricing stuff or that we are too, I'd say not too aggressive also. So that is what I count for a long-term strategic rates are fully okay, and pricing is disciplined of course, as well we see some kind of actions from competitors. In the U.S. it is reflected for example, due to the decision that we stop Sterling. So therefore you see some impact, but on the other hand, we can offset some of that Sterling market share into Freightliner shares. So even that is even positive.</p>
          <p>In Fuso, the development there is based &#x2013; of course we have a weaker market share there. And I mentioned in my speech, the new Super Grade, which will get into the market, and this truck fulfills the conditions, which are in Japan necessary to get the subvention of the state conventions currently and therefore, I assume that our market shares and we have already some data on hand right now, that our market shares are improving in Japan again.</p>
          <p>So that was related to a product, special things. So we have removed it. We will come up with other products. I do think in June, with the lift, an updated lift, which also meet this requirement and therefore the market shares should improve there. In Vans, we have improved our market share as I can &#x2013; I have not the numbers now but I have it but &#x2013; I have not the paper in front of me. And within Bus you have always fluctuations due to tenders. So all in all, I regard the development of the market shares.</p>
          <p>If you look at this rightly, of course with some more information and you adjusted EBITDA, I do think, fully okay with our strategies and product portfolio and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Add-on question from my side, but then with regard to Mercedes-Benz Cars again, since you say that you intend to grow double the rate of global car sales this year, we should expect in the next few quarters that you'll gain market share on an unadjusted basis and globally in various regions, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can only confirm your &#x2013; what you said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That means we see an acceleration of the volume increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we have given the guidance that we'll sell more than double as much as the 3 to 4%, of course. You have seen our first quarter. We know that the first quarter was 277,000. You know that we might have some quarters, which are better than the 277,000. And you said this and therefore, yes it's right.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Next in line is Max Warburton. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi it's Max Warburton at Bernstein. As you can probably appreciate, we all spent a lot of time talking with investors in the last week about how a company can change its guidance so much. Could you just help us understand how Daimler organizes its divisional reporting and how often you, as CFO, get this information. Because you actually said something in response to a previous question, you said, I think we got the March actuals last week. Did I hear that correctly? Is it right that it takes 3 weeks to get a monthly P&amp;L for each division? Or could you clarify how the reporting works and how it might be improved going forward? So we don't have this kind of confusion that we've seen in 2010. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, Max, thank you for that question that I can clarify some subjects. On the one hand, I do think fortunately, the markets and the industries have developed every dynamic positively. And these developed positively also in the first quarter and even in March. Although, we had some subject like Greece or big countries and so on and so forth. And the market developed better as expected as I referred in my former answer that was really based on the March development, which was very positive in many of our divisions. And therefore I do think we have seen in the last couple of weeks a lot of companies coming out with good &#x2013; with positive news and also let's say it was kind of I would say so surprisingly better than expected also from the capital market.</p>
          <p>So that was not only a pattern with Daimler. It was a pattern on which you could see not only in the automotive industry, but also in other industry. And therefore we hedged to adjust our expectations too because we had some of that as I said it before, information to rethink our guidance. We have done that after we had all the facts on the table. And therefore I have to tell you, I'm sorry, that we are not the slowest one; we are unfortunately, if you might say so, the fastest one.</p>
          <p>If you compare our disclosure right now compared to many other companies, we are early on even in Germany to disclose our numbers and therefore the numbers we get are early. You get most, of course, quite logically you get the sales numbers pretty early, yeah, I don't know third or fourth working day, somewhat like this. And to get the P&amp;L, I would call us pretty much in the first third; I would say so of industry to report these numbers. And therefore I regard our disclosure as a very fast one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We take the next question from Christian Breitsprecher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Also a question on the earnings progression, it's very hard to understand when we look at the fourth quarter 2009 and the first quarter 2010. In Mercedes and in Trucks you have virtually flat revenues first quarter versus fourth quarter, but you have a significant earnings progression quarter-over-quarter. And can you explain a little bit what was different in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Because most of the cost cutting measures had a full effect already in the four quarter and also when we look at the mix in Mercedes fourth quarter, first quarter it's virtually the same. So can you go a bit more into detail on that issue, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, thank you for your questions. I do think I go to the, let's say the 2 bigger divisions I do think, Mercedes-Benz Cars and Trucks, also maybe a comment on Van and Buses, although we have to keep in mind Q4, Q1, some seasonality and other stuff of course we have into that figures.</p>
          <p>First of all, Mercedes-Benz Cars. Our mix was positively, especially when you see S-Class and E-Class development, therefore also the margin development also positive in this regard. Pricing, as I said before, was not only compared to Q1 2009, but also to Q4 2009, very positively developing. And therefore these are the 2 main factors. A third one is that although you're right that the measures were in Q4 we had, but you don't have to &#x2013; also to imagine that the &#x2013; the cost &#x2013; we could keep the costs on a very low level in the first quarter, although you should assume that for some preparation of the growth, of course, we should have more costs. And therefore, the cost level also in Q1, we were able to keep on a very low level, so and not to increase even you've seen we've produced more. And therefore, of course, normally you should have more cost on board. And therefore this kind of development was positively on top impacting the Mercedes-Benz cost.</p>
          <p>Within Trucks, we can clearly see that the developing of the repositioning programs of Freightliner and Fuso are getting more and more traction. So the development in Q1 2010 compared to Q4 on the glide path of our objectives being breakeven with &#x2013; greater at Fuso &#x2013; so that has had a positive impact.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we had a Brazilian, a very strong Brazilian business which was not happening so far so big in the fourth quarter of 2009. And we can also see here that the costs are on a very low level. Although as you have seen it, the revenues were more or less kind of flat. So both of that altogether led to a truck number which is positive now for the first time in Q1 2010.</p>
          <p>On the Van side, we had always said in the fourth quarter that we had a periodic impact so that the &#x2013; so to say the underlying margin development in the fourth quarter was roughly half of the amount we reported. And that number you can see in the first quarter again is on the same level. Buses, I have already commented to, I do think. And Financial Services, of course, as I said before we see some better developments on the margin side and on the interest side, and therefore also this division is doing well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, we take from Daniel Schwarz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Schwarz, Commerzbank. I have two questions. One is on China. You mentioned overheating of the Chinese economy is one of the risks in 2010. What are the metrics you are looking at for your own planning for China? What would indicate a weakening of the Chinese market? And what would be a negative scenario for the Chinese auto market? Is it no further growth or is it a significant decrease? Is it risk, do you see that risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say to your last point on &#x2013; a slower growth you would assume. Of course, if you would see it overheating right now, I don't know, a breakdown of 40% or whatever. And of course, our assessment is run without going to significant sales numbers for our division here what the bandwidth would be. But of course I do think it's common knowledge that on the real estate sector in China for example, there could be happening something as a bubble, of course it's a huge economy, which they have to develop and therefore I do think we are looking at this as common indicators of what is available in the market, not more, not less. So no specific stuff which is Daimler, so to say, knowledge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question would be with regard to your growth cash in the industrial business, are you planning to reduce this number and should we expect improved financial income in the coming quarters or is the negative 200 million round about 200 million in Q1, is that a good number for the next quarter or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expect that this will be a positive development, what means of course that this number should be better so to say, negatively but better. There are two subjects, and one is from the interest cost of the pension plans worldwide, and the other one is of course our liquidity, interest rates, expense and income in this regard.</p>
          <p>And on the second subject I expect further positive impact because we will now, having seen this positive cash flow in the first quarter. And you know you asked me of course last time of the cash flow guidance and you said &#x2013; I said okay we are reluctant to give one. Now based on the results we have seen, of course we do expect a significantly positive cash flow for the year 2010, which on the other hand mean, with a precondition that all the markets will be not as volatile that we don't get any risk scenario. We will reduce our liquidity further and that means of course at the end of the day that we also that we can estimate that this burden, so to say, shrinks. And I do expect for 2011 some of the turning point that we might get into the positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you would not say what significant cash flow means then in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Significant cash flow means of course, it's significant. You have to keep in mind of course, we have given our guidance of more than 4 billion. We have to keep in mind that we will invest a lot in CO2 and there is CapEx and R&amp;D and we have given this number in the press release of the year in figures. That means of course a substantially increase in these numbers, which will burden the cash flow. But now based on the 4 billion guideline we have, you can subtract these numbers because we are more investing than depreciating. We have to take into account that we have to build up some working capital.</p>
          <p>We have to put some money into regional growth like India, more truck related photon, for example. And we have the interest and tax related subject of course to consider. All in all of course but make your expectation from the 4 billion, but we will stay significantly positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, we take from Charles Winston.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, there. Charles Winston from Redburn Partners. Three questions, if I may, but fairly quick. First, I was just wondering if you could give a bit more detail on the breakdown of revenue growth in the autos division. In other words, help us quantify how much of the revenue growth came from pricing, how much it came from product mix, what the impact of the FX was and that sort of thing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was just wondering if you could give us an update in terms of the process of converting your short-term cost savings from last year into more longer-term gains. You talked about the fact there was quite a large amount from <mark type="inaudible" /> and other areas. Can we see more progress there in terms of converting those to more structural gains?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly just very quickly, why are you planning a reduction in your banking deposits? You mentioned that they sell. You mentioned it was planned; surely that helps finance the Financial Services division. What was the thinking behind reducing that deposit position? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles, I start with the most easiest question. It was the last one. The deposits of course, the deposits were higher than the assets. So that means of course normally you should be in a perfect situation when the deposits are matching the assets, the portfolio of leasing and financing. And so we had an overshoot in that last year due to high deposits and so on purpose, we bring this number more close to the assets, because you know for more liquidity right now, you don't get real good interest rates. Therefore a safe one of course. And therefore we are reducing it as planned, but we will stay at a very &#x2013; at a high number of deposits, of course, because it makes financing interesting. It's the cheapest source of course of refinancing in the long run.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you asked for the efficiency enhancements. Of course, as I said before, we are right now on the cost side in Q1 very &#x2013; on a very lean basis I would say. We don't see any increases here although you would expect in some areas, some increase. But we can hold on with that cost management on the one hand and therefore we stay with our message that we shoot for same kind of numbers as we have done in 2009 to stay stable to make these efficiencies more sustainable at the end of the day, taking 1 term into into sustainable efficiency program. So we hold on with that and we look in every, we have some programs running. We have commented on that. That is in the sales and marketing area as we said it before, a long term program what we have there. We have all modular strategies and so far the global excellence program is in Trucks. So many programs which we are doing more or less also sustainable at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>We have to take into account that we will of course, save our working time reduction will lead us to 30 of June right now. Therefore there will be some, of course, if you might say so, cost increase in third and fourth quarter, but positively spoken. And now we have on top of our decision in Trucks based on the better visibility and the order intakes that we can &#x2013; that we stop our short timing, and based on that you know this, if you get more sales of course in passenger cars, if you have less short-timing, we will get a higher sales contribution, which will offset by far effects from short-timing on the one-hand or the working time reduction on the other hand. Therefore, I do think with every good news that we have no short-timing, the positive news for top line effects on the sales contribution side.</p>
          <p>Your first question was about revenue growth, whether we can break that down. Unfortunately, of course, we cannot. Our disclosure gives you, I do think a lot of information. The revenue growth at all between Q1 2009, and as I said, Q1 2010 was mainly based on the volume at the end of the day and pricing mix and pricing, of course, was only the lower part, if you compare that to Q1 but it is not a miracle because Q1 was really depressed in passenger cars, not as big as in trucks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir &#x2013; sorry, thank you for that. Just to follow-up, I mean, you are probably aware that for instance, last week since the last week, PSA [Peugeot Citroen] gave a figure of list pricing, minus 2.5% and talking about a whopping great mix impact of plus 7 and that &#x2013; pricing, a list pricing figure does seem to be a figure that people are prepared to give and even if you can't perhaps put it into context could you at least perhaps give us some idea as to the impact from revenue just in list price?</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry, my apologies. First of all, could you tell me, do you feel that the Fiat de-merger of its passenger car and heavy truck operations has any sort of impact for your business model considering some of the very clear statements made by Mr. Marchionne?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was wondering if you might be able to say &#x2013; you had recently reevaluated your business ties with Iran following the regime's nuclear policy, something you had announced at the AGM. On a separate, similar note, considering the ongoing investigation into Goldman, would you plan on doing the same at least until &#x2013; as far as Goldman here specifically, at least as far as long as it takes until the SEC investigation is over? And in general, any comments you might make about ethics in the banking industry and your take on that. Bosch has already authority made some statements in that regard.</p>
          <p>Also I'd just be curious whether you would potentially think about retracting your dual listing in New York just like Deutsche Telekom did. And yeah, if you can make one comment quickly about the level of inventories, your production levels at Mercedes were about 48% higher in the first quarter. Sales didn't come close to that that. But could we expect that going on from now on that production and sales would largely be in the correlation of one another? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian, for these many questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's okay. First of all, your question regarding Fiat, I do see no impact right now on our company. I do think they will work as they worked before. Their sales department will try to sell a lot of trucks and they will do so after they will be incorporated in one legal entity. So I don't expect any different management behavior and that what is of course then would be affecting us. So I do think that would be the same as it was before. So no, not a question here.</p>
          <p>On Goldman Sachs sorry, I don't want to comment on the case of somebody who is into that. Of course we are following the case, yes, and following whatever investigations outcome is and to make up our mind afterward when the fact's on the table. I do think there is a lot of speculation right now that we &#x2013; from everybody in that case. So I do think we will get this information after the investigation is over. And then we do our evaluation of that case whether that impact our behavior, I don't know today.</p>
          <p>On the ethics side of course of banking and so on, I do think ethics and compliance, I do think in the ranking of many companies, there is a higher ranking now maybe as it was, I don't know, maybe 50 years ago, I don't know. And I would say regard for our company, we have also introduced our values in Daimler. Of course we had already somewhat, but we needed to write it down and to talk about it. And we made it in subject, I do think, 3 to 4 years ago especially to talk within the company about ethics, values and other things. And I do think that's a healthy process. In this regard, I can only even recommend that everybody is doing it also in your business. I do think it makes sense that you do it.</p>
          <p>From a listing point of view, we have nothing that's planned, I've seen what Deutsche Telekom is &#x2013; have done and of course, so nothing more than this. And your last question of course it can be precise, I do think we have build up inventory in the first quarter in the direction of 190,000 units and that is an increase of 30,000 units compared to the end of the year. But I have to see that is in plan because we have the spring selling season and especially we are shipping cars positively spoken to the U.S. and China and that is roughly 20,000 units of the 30,000 units. And they should be sold then, so to say, in the second quarter as planned and everything is okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I could just make a couple of follow-up comments, first of all that would sound like your inventory levels would creep back down again from where they were at the end -?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one last question about the Fiat issue, I think that means that you are not interested in reevaluating the position between having passenger cars and heavy truck operations in the same company and whether that -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>We have not thought about it, if you had not raised the question. Okay, thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is Thierry Huon speaking from Exane BNP Paribas. So a few questions if I may. First of all, could you give us an idea of the split in China between what you are producing locally and what you are shipping from Germany? And could we expect to have a significant change in the mix given the E-Class launch?</p>
          <p>Second question about the pricing you mentioned several times, do you feel that the pricing improvement came mainly because you have the right line up or because your main competitors are more keen to improve the pricing on the market? Last question, could you share with us what could be the tax rate for the full year with so significant increase in the first quarter? Could you share with us or what we should expect for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your last question, our tax rate in Q1 was 38% if you adjust for, and you have to for kind of normal rates, for example the EIDS impact in <mark type="inaudible" /> industry participations are handled tax wise differently. You come to a normalized rate of 33% for the year; I would take 35% roughly.</p>
          <p>You asked about the pricing, I would &#x2013; I do think I would again say that is our strong product range what we have right now. And of course I would mention another subject, these are our people in sales and marketing and they are, I do think these people have shown that they of course can even with that product can deliver that pricing. So I would mention the second aspect of people and especially the head of sales and marketing.</p>
          <p>The first thing the split between &#x2013; of course you know we have the C-Class and the E-Class, but this is, call Investor Relations please, I do think I'll give you a wrong number in percentages, you will get this number. So it's not a secret here what we are producing there and what we are importing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a very last question about raw materials, when do you think that you will start to fill the &#x2013; or when you would have to agree on higher steel price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, for steel, we are on the Daimler level, so looking at trucks and passenger cards, more or less I would say between 60 and 70% so to say for this year, you see it done with our contracts. These are older contracts and long-term contracts. We will go in negotiations with the objective to keep again long-term contracts although we have to say that might be let's say the other ones that would like maybe to talk us into shorter-term contracts. But for this year of course as a remaining &#x2013; if you might say so, open exposure, but I do think we can handle this open exposure so the question of raw material pricing developments will have more an impact then, on our 2011 and '12 developments. And there we have to cope with that. Current developments are always increasing raw material pricing. The same holds true for precious metals for the year 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So in my list, I have one person left, which is Jochen Gehrke [Deutsche Bank AG].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three quick questions if I may. Just firstly on trucks, you reported a small sequential order intake decline in Europe. Now I don't want to be splitting hair, but obviously one of your larger competitors in Sweden appears to be much more optimistic. When we look at your order intake numbers and we compare it in the industry, do you think there is a standard way of reporting that or is there a different way of putting this number out to investors that might then lead to some misinterpretation?</p>
          <p>Secondly then, you talked earlier on already about currency, but I didn't really understand your response on that point. When we look at the 350 million in the first quarter that you reported in the bridge, should be expect some further significant headwinds or shall I read your communication in a way that we should say that's pretty much it on a full-year basis knowing what the dollar has done since the start of the year?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly just finally just a follow-up here, you said you have3 weeks that you get the numbers that you report them. I suppose you talked about the external reporting and not the internal reporting, or is there really a 3 week lag within Daimler that management sees numbers that have happened? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, Thank you for your questions. First of all, I'll start again with the last question. Of course, we are, I do think regarded as really being in the as I said, first third close to benchmark of delivering our numbers because you can see, which company, when disclosing numbers. First of all I do think you can do a ranking, I don't think that we are &#x2013; I do think that we are under &#x2013; in the first third in this regard.</p>
          <p>When you say of course the numbers we are having there, of course the actual data including provisioning write-offs, everything, audited and pre-audited numbers of course you come to that what I said before that you have the facts, including the cost position on the table in that timeframe. Of course you have sales numbers and other information of course early on, but what do you do with only revenues when you don't have the cost numbers so to say including that, like pricing and everything.</p>
          <p>So I regard us there as benchmark and you have to take into account a little bit, but I don't want to ask for this is for mercy or anything else, but you have to look to working days and of course, I do think that there was something like Easter in that timeframe. That is not always the case. In every month I would like to, but it is not. And therefore I do think you have to look at the subject and if you look at this I do think I call us in this regard very fast, having all the facts on the table and not partially, so to say. And you can imagine on a partial effect, you cannot make a guidance or an estimation, you have to have the full picture on your table. Especially when I talk about March because you have extraordinary developments in March as I said before.</p>
          <p>Currency, of course I mentioned the pound effect in the 350 million, which was more or less two third of that number. Intake of course it will not be in every quarter this kind of effect and therefore I expect this number if we do know our quarter to Q2 to Q2 end of July and so on that should be shrinking. If we have the current rate so to say. And of course the current rates level we incorporated in our guidance of the 2.5 to 3 billion currently and I hope that the market will not be volatile, that it stays at this level or hopefully &#x2013; hopefully it will be even in the other direction, means even somewhat a little bit weaker euro again on top.</p>
          <p>With the order intake of &#x2013; incoming orders of Daimler Trucks, of course, right now we have this slight increase of course, even if you compare to Q4 2009 and I am not aware that they are &#x2013; it will be of different kind of methods to count order intake. We know that we are more conservative in when is the order intake an order intake, what kind of contract you have. And is it just the intention or do you have the contract and how firm is it. There we said we are always conservative. I don't know whether we have within other truck companies that the baseline in their companies is affected by some <mark type="inaudible" /> at this point of time, which I don't know yet. We will certainly also analyze their data, what we currently are doing, but have not finalized to make up their mind whether there is something we have to look into, but as of today, as I said, we have nothing in mind that they are developing better than we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you. And maybe just as a final follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think over the last three quarters, you had a policy of trying to be as conservative as possible to not miss after the developments in 2008. And obviously this last swing in guidance appears as if you've given up that policy and this is much more realistic picture now so to say on a relative scale. Is that fair, or do you consider yourself to be still as conservative as you tried to be over the last 3 quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, the question is whether, I should say whether that's fair or unfair so to say. But I do think our &#x2013; I do think that we &#x2013; as we gave guidance in February, and also during the road show beginning of March, we based our guidance on the underlying data we had. And of course we said it &#x2013; once we said for example of more than 2.3 billion. We said this was an underlying feeling so to say for our guidance and we have to update it. And therefore we regard now, and if we come to a new guidance, I do think you should assume that we are doing our job based on another set of facts, which I currently as I described it with the March data with the cost data and so on. With the pricing data so we can now take this fact and to build up our new guidance.</p>
          <p>I do think it would be not good to give a guidance, which is let's say too much of hope in it so to say. And now you can do it the other way around. You might say, you were right and we were too conservative in this aspect. On the other hand, I do think, I hope that I have not &#x2013; maybe more of this kind of maybe smaller surprises during the course of the year and hopefully also for the upcoming years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Okay. I've got 4 more question. For timing reasons, please 1 question each? Adam Hull? Adam?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's just Adam Hull, WestLB. It's a question on the cash flow, I just wanted to be clear that I've understood you; you're saying a significant positive net cash flow for the full-year. And just to be clear within that, working capital, you had an inflow last year of 5 billion, could you give us some guidance of your thinking on your new guidance as to what I presume an outflow, but what the working capital would be? And just to be clear on the R&amp;D and CapEx, I think your guidance for the full year was 8.9 billion at roughly 10% of revenue, your numbers in Q1 were about 8% spending. Just to be clear, have you changed that full-year guidance on the cash, CapEx and R&amp;D or not? Are you still going for that 8.9 billion or so? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Adam, of course we &#x2013; last year we had a positive impact from the working capital management, no doubt, due to the inventory effect and I do expect the working capital for the total year being the way that's negative, but that means that positively that we expect revenue increase and sales increase and therefore as an investment if you might say so in gross, but we don't quantify it.</p>
          <p>As I said before, our cash flow will depend of course on, first of all on our 4 billion EBIT, yeah, as a baseline and then of course you rightly mentioned our CapEx and R&amp;D figure for the 2 years, 2010 and 2011, what we have said in the &#x2013; in our press release in February and that you compare with last year there is an increase of course to the figures we had last year in CapEx, a higher one and a small increase or slighter increase in R&amp;D compared to 2009 and that of course will certainly impact also our cash flow. But taking that into account including the investment into gross and regional gross we will stay significantly positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just maybe you don't give an exact number, but just to be clear, are we talking here roughly half of that coming through an outflow, roughly half of your inflow last year, it still would seem to be a relatively good position to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think I've given out lot more guidance than this and we have given it, I do think, a very detailed EBIT guidance and of course with all the numbers you have seen of course you can build up your opinion on that and we leave it there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Aleksej Wunrau of BHF-Bank. Two short ones, if I may. The Q1 figure seem to have been largely positively impacted by the positive gap between wholesale and retail volumes. So my question is how long we should expect this trend to continue and by how much it contributed to your first quarter EBIT? And secondly, could you please provide a figure of order intake or volume order intake in the Truck segment compared to the shipments for March alone? So the question is by how much or how much in percentage terms order intake exceeded the shipments in March in the Truck segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your second question, we had roughly on Daimler Trucks level, I do think 10% more order intakes than shipments and secondly you asked for the &#x2013; sorry? Are they retail or wholesale? This I cannot confirm because the profit intake of course, the wholesale number of 277,000 &#x2013; 275,000 or 76,000 [276,000] in cars we find some profit intake not the retail so to say. And retail was 20 &#x2013; 272,000 so that is pretty much in line what you mean I do think is the difference between wholesale and production. Production was far higher was roughly, I don't know 30,000 unit, roughly. And I've said it before these are cars which we ship to China and to the U.S. more or less two third of that, which will get into revenue in the second quarter. So therefore the profit impact you will see more or less through high degree in the second quarter and we have not seen it in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the same applies to the other segments, especially Vans and Trucks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is more or less, you have to look at the wholesale number, which we're distributing compared with the production. The wholesale number is defining the revenue impact and the sales contribution and therefore that is the impact on the profit.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions. One again on the material cost side. Here we saw a dramatical increase in material costs' you elaborated that the impact on 2010 earnings should be rather limited. Can you confirm that per unit cost increase per car is in the range of roughly 700, 800 euros since the beginning of 2009? And the other question is on the Truck side in Brazil, a very strong development in the South American market. Is there a margin of a double-digit reached in Brazil?</p>

          <p>So to your first question of course we cannot go into the discussion of raw material per units here. Message stays in 2009 we think we can manage raw materials because we are with more longer-term contracts and we are somewhat hedged with the precious metal. Therefore I do think we have this stuff under control. There is a limited risk of course if that would explode. And your second question, Daimler Trucks in Latin America, I can well imagine that we have double-digit returns there.</p>
