        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express fourth quarter earnings call.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time.  If you should require assistance during the call please press star then zero and an operator will assist you off line.  And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Ron Stovall.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Carrie and welcome to everyone.  We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.  It's my job as usual to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.</p>
          <p>The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include in the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report, and in the company's 2007 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In the fourth quarter 2008 earnings release supplement and presentation slides which are now posted on our Website at ir.americanexpress.com and on file with the S.E.C. in an 8-K report we have provided information that describes the company's managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explained why these presentations are useful to management and to investors.  We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.</p>
          <p>Ken Chenault Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Express will provide some brief opening comments. Then Dan Henry Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through a series of slides included with the earnings documents, and provide some brief summary comments.</p>
          <p>Once Dan completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&amp;A period where both Ken and Dan will be available to respond to your questions.  Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions.  While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn the discussion over to Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ron.  Before Dan reviews the details, I wanted to say a few words about the economic environment, our results and the outlook for 2009.  And I believe, and I think most of you would agree, that this is one of the most difficult operating environments we've seen in decades.  The housing market has continued to deteriorate, unemployment has risen significantly, and retailers have seen some of the biggest declines in many years.</p>
          <p>Now as we all know consumer confidence has dropped off the charts and corporations have acted quickly to pull back on their expenses.  What we've also seen following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid September, the wholesale credit markets came to a virtue standstill as concerns about the underlying value of troubled assets eroded trust in the banking sector and spurred a series of new initiatives from Washington.</p>
          <p>Now our results for the quarter were significantly impacted by this environment.  Revenues declined, as spending by consumers, small businesses and corporations slowed significantly.  And as you've seen from recent headlines, this slowdown was more pronounced among high-end retailers, and throughout the travel sector, as our cardmembers cut back on discretionary spending.</p>
          <p>Now, as expected, we continued to see rising delinquencies and loan write-offs.  Now, these trends, together with the restructuring charge we took to reduce our cost base, drove our earnings decline for the quarter.  Now, clearly, we're disappointed with our overall results.  Nevertheless, despite the environment, there are a number of developments we can point to that show progress against our near-term priorities, which are staying liquid, staying profitable, and investing selectively to strengthen our competitive position over the longer term.</p>
          <p>First, we continued to remain solidly profitable in the fourth quarter and generated $2.8 billion in earnings in 2008.  Next, our spending declines, while significant, compared favorably to major competitors in the industry, particularly in view of the overall cutbacks in travel and discretionary spending, in the latter part of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, very importantly, average card fees and discount rates, which generate two of our largest revenue streams, were virtually unchanged reflecting the ongoing value that cardmembers and merchants see in working with Amex.</p>
          <p>Now, this is in contrast to the pattern you've seen in much of the retailing industry.  We are not cutting our premium prices, in order to generate business volumes, and I believe that this is a very good indication of the underlying strength of our franchise.  We have stepped up reengineering efforts for which we took a significant restructuring charge in the quarter, and we've already begun to reduce operating expenses, which gives us additional flexibility as we move into 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of funding we have more than satisfied our requirements for the quarter, and we have broadened our sources to include a retail certificates of deposit program that we launched in October.  And since then, we've be able to generate $6.2 billion from a standing start, which I think is very strong evidence of the drawing power of the Amex brand.</p>
          <p>Now for the longer term, we continued to invest selectively in the business, strengthening our partnership with Delta Air Lines in the quarter, continuing to hold our global business, to build our global business with banks who issue cards on the Amex network and successfully integrating the corporate card business we purchased from GE earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>Now, beyond these specific business items, as you know we converted to a bank holding company in the fourth quarter.  This means that we will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and it aligns us more closely with other financial services companies.  In January, we bolstered our capital position and we added $3.4 billion as part of the TARP program.  Now, this additional capital will enhance our ability to extend loans to creditworthy cardmembers, thereby helping to spur economic growth in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Now, looked at from the perspective of our charge card portfolio, we authorized about $73 billion in spending for consumers, small businesses, and corporate cardmembers in the quarter.  And on the lending side, our open credit lines were on par with last year, despite the difficult conditions in the marketplace.  And our aim here is to accommodate cardmembers' spending needs while helping to ensure that they don't incur debt levels that are inappropriate for the current environment.</p>
          <p>As you know, throughout the past year we were very cautious about the economic outlook.  That certainly continues to be the case today and looking ahead we expect difficult economic conditions to continue through 2009.  Now, as we said last quarter cardmember spending in this environment is likely to remain very soft and we continue to expect past due loans and write-offs to rise from current levels.  Our strategies for 2009 remain focused on keeping liquid, staying profitable, and investing selectively to strengthen our franchise and remain in position to capitalize on opportunities when conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Now, we continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the payment sector and that the investments we're making in our business, including the business-to-business sector which is less reliant on credit, will help ensure we can capitalize on those opportunities when the environment improves.</p>
          <p>With that, let me now turn things over to Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Ken.  So let me start on Slide 2.  Total revenues net of interest expense was $6.5 billion, 11% down from 2007.  It was negatively affected by foreign exchange. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis it would have been down 7%.</p>
          <p>Income from continuing operations was $238 million.  Diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.21. Our ROE was 21.7%.  This is a 12-month rolling average, and it benefits from the stronger earnings earlier in the year.  All of these top-line results reflect the current environment, as well as certain significant items in each period.</p>
          <p>If we look at Slide 3, we see these significant items:  First, in the fourth quarter of '08 is the reengineering charge of $273 million on a net income basis.  Pre-tax, it was $404 million.  When we announced the restructuring reserve in October, we estimated it would be between 370 and $440 million, so we are within the range.</p>
          <p>Next relates to Delta.  In signing a new contract with Delta, we agreed to reimburse them at a higher rate for Membership Rewards points that are converted to Delta miles and therefore we needed to reprice our reserve.  It's 66 million on an after tax basis, 106 million on a pre-tax basis.</p>
          <p>In 2007, the fourth quarter included the Visa litigation settlement of $1.1 billion as well as additional business building, some litigation costs as well as a contribution to our charitable foundation.  Net it had a beneficial impact on the fourth quarter of '07 of 534 million.</p>
          <p>'07 also included an enhancement in the way we estimate the ultimate redemption rate for Membership Rewards and resulted in a charge after tax of 430 million.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of '07 we also set up an additional credit related charge which had the impact of 274 million on the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me take a minute on Slide 4 and talk to some of the changes in reporting that you'll see on the income statement.  First, relates to interest income and interest expense categories.  Historically we showed interest income broken between cardmember lending finance revenue and other interest income.  In the future, we'll show interest and fees on loans, the second line, interest and dividends on investment securities and third, deposits with banks and others.</p>
          <p>In interest expense we previously broke interest expense between cardmember lending, and interest on charge card and other.  In the future, we'll show interest expense based on the source of the funding. So we'll show interest on deposits, short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and other.</p>
          <p>In addition to that provision which previously was included in expense -- will now be moved up into revenues below the interest net of interest expense line and will total to a total revenue net of interest expense after provision for losses.</p>
          <p>I'd also note that previously, we had a line which was marketing promotions and cardmember services.  Many of you will be pleased to know now that we are going to break this into three lines, which will be marketing and promotions, Cardmember Rewards, and cardmember services.</p>
          <p>In the past, we had called the line item salaries and benefits or I guess we called them human resources which will now be called salaries and benefits.</p>
          <p>In addition, there will be an impact on some of our metrics.  It has always been our policy for charge card to write off at 360 days.  Bank holding company guidelines require us to write off at 180 days.  So in the fourth quarter, we are moving U.S. card services to a 100-day write-off.  If you were to look at the tables attached to the press release, pages 14 and 19, you'll see write-offs in the fourth quarter totaled 669 million.  That includes 341 million which is the effect of moving us from 360 up to 180 days.</p>
          <p>Now, on this table you should also see that the loss reserve coverage as a percentage of receivables is 2.5%.  In the third quarter, it was 3%.  We have not gone back and restated prior periods.  If we had continued the 360 day write-off, that ratio actually would have been 3.5%.  So it increased from the third quarter to fourth quarter, reflecting our metrics in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As relates to international consumer, as well as commercial card, we will move those products to 180 days in the future.  There are also a number of credit reserve reclasses, but they have a minor impact on our metrics.</p>
          <p>Moving to Page 5, and looking at metrics, Billed Business came in at 160 billion, down 10% from last year, or 5% on an FX adjusted basis.  These results are in line with the industry.  Given our affluent base, with a higher level of discretionary spending, as well as the amount of T&amp;E within our base we thought that we may in fact came in at a lower amount than competitors but that was not the case.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that, Billed Business has dropped significantly.  On an FX adjusted basis we actually grew 11% in the first quarter, 10% in the second quarter 7% in the third quarter and now have dropped to a decline of 5% and this reflects the impact of the economy on Billed Business.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these lower results compared to last year, if you look at total Billed Business for the full year which came in at 683 billion it's the highest annual amounts we've had in our history.</p>
          <p>Total Cards In Force have held up very well, up 7%.  That's 2% growth in our proprietary cards, as well as 22% increase in network partner cards.</p>
          <p>Average spend per cardmember as you can see is down 14%, or 10% on an FX adjusted basis, and this is really the story that has led to the decline in Billed Business.  Transactions in the United States is basically flat, down 1%, and transactions are actually up 6% internationally.  So it reflects cardmembers spending less per transaction.</p>
          <p>Loan growth on a managed basis was 7% down more than our competitors.  This reflects both the economy, the credit actions we were taking and the fact that we have lower amounts of balance transfer than we've had historically.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 6, Discount Revenue is down 11%.  On a managed basis it was down 7%, and was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange.  A positive note is that our average discount rate only declined 1%.</p>
          <p>As we can see from Net Card Fees, we're up 6%.  This reflects the premiumness of our brand in the marketplace.  Within net interest and securitizations, securitization income was down 39% with the major impact being credit losses.  Net interest was down 16%, on lower loans, and was also impacted by the prime LIBOR dislocation that happened in October.  However, the normal relationship of those two metrics are back to normal levels now in January. It also reflects the higher cost of liquidity.</p>
          <p>Let me move to Slide 7, Provision For Losses.  Here you can see total provision on a reported basis was up 3%.  However, as I noted before, one of the significant items was the provision, additional provision that we made in the fourth quarter of '07.  We added 96 million to the charge provision in '07, 288 million to the lending provision and 384 to the total provision. If we were to back those numbers out of the '07 column, provision on lending would have increased 36%, charge would have increased 32%, and the total would have been up 32%. That higher provisioning reflects the higher credit-loss metrics that I'll discuss in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 8, I'll discuss the metrics within our business units.  In USCS the metrics are very much in line with total company metrics.  Billed Business in the first quarter was up 11%, 8% in the second quarter, 6% in the third quarter and they are now down 9%.  That reflects 12% decline in the consumer business, and a 3% decline in small business.</p>
          <p>The 2% increase in cards in force reflect the investments we've been making.  Again here Billed Business is being driven down by average spend.  As I said transactions in the U.S. were only down 1%.</p>
          <p>Average spend was down really across most of card groups, and spending levels.  Cardmember loans are down for the same reasons that I cited a few minutes ago.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 9 the metrics for international consumer.  The international consumer actually held up better than the U.S. in the fourth quarter.  While Billed Business was down 14% on a reported basis, it was actually up 1% on an FX adjusted basis.  If we look across all the regions on an FX adjusted basis, it was flat in each of the regions.</p>
          <p>Again, average cardmember spend is what's the driving force behind the lower Billed Business.  Cardmember loans were lower by 15% on a reported basis, but up 4% on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 10, and Global Commercial Services metrics, here again, we see a drop in the fourth quarter.  On an FX adjusted basis, commercial card billed business at 28 billion was down 5% in the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis compared to actually an increase of 7% in the third quarter.  If we look at the fourth quarter, Billed Business in the U.S. was down 6%, and internationally on a reported basis was down 18%, but only 3% on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Cards in force are up 4% as we continue to bring in new customers.  And here we have a similar story as it relates to average cardmember spend, which was down 8% on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 11, GNMS, here we can see that in total, the U.S. Billed Business was down 8%, and actually it was up 3% outside the U.S. on an FX adjusted basis.  Within the U.S, retail and everyday spending declined 6% and that represents about 74% of U.S. billings.  Travel and entertainment declined 10%.</p>
          <p>And as I noted before, the average discount rate at 2.53 has held up very well, only down 1 basis point from last year.</p>
          <p>Global Network Services continues to be a good story.  Billed Business was flat on a reported basis but grew 11% on an FX adjusted basis.  Cards issued by network partners that ride on our network increased 22%.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 12, we'll look at expenses.  Here the significant items that I mentioned on Slide 3 are having a notable impact on these line items.  If I were to adjust for the items that are listed on Slide 3, if we look at marketing and promotion, and adjusted '07 for the 143 million of incremental spending that we did as a result of the Visa settlement, marketing and promotions would be down 21% year over year.</p>
          <p>If we look at Cardmember Rewards and we adjust for the 106 million of additional provision we made in '08 related to the Delta contract and we made an adjustment to '07 for the increase related to the enhancement in the ultimate redemption rate estimate of 685 million, Cardmember Rewards would actually be down 10% in line with volumes.</p>
          <p>If we look at salaries, employee benefits, and other operating expenses, if we adjusted 2008 to back out the restructuring impact of 404 million and the 16 million of reengineering in '07, and we also adjusted for the Visa litigation settlement as well as the litigation cost and contribution to the charitable foundation, we would actually be down 7%.</p>
          <p>If we look at income taxes and the benefit that we have in the period, it is a result of a consistent level of recurring permanent tax benefits and the impact of that benefit when we have lower pre-tax income, as well as benefits related to the finalization of our state tax returns.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 13 and looking at Charge Card Net Write-off Rate, you can see that the results are pretty consistent over the year and have held up reasonably well.  The fourth quarter on this chart does not include the 341 million write-off moving from 360-day write-off up to 180 day write-off.</p>
          <p>If we move to Slide 14 and look at Charge Card Net Loss Ratio for international consumer, and the Global Commercial Services, we can see that the international consumer net loss is increasing, reflecting somewhat higher loss rates across most companies, most notably Mexico.  Commercial card net loss rate has remained reasonably stable.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 15, the Charge Card 30 Days Past Due amount, we can see that the charge card in the U.S. past due is increasing slightly as we continue to control credit losses very well within the charge card portfolio.</p>
          <p>If you move to Slide 16, Charge Card 90 Days Past Due for international consumer, global commercial card, you can see that the write-off rate for 90-day past due is increasing in international, and that is really across all of the international markets, and also, increasing somewhat in the global commercial.  Both of these reflect the environment that we're experiencing.</p>
          <p>If we move to Slide 17, in the middle you can see that the international consumer write-off rate is holding up pretty well, so I'll focus on the U.S. lending numbers.  The write-off rate of 6.7% is up dramatically from the 3.4 rate in the fourth quarter '07.  We have moved from being the lowest rate in the industry to the middle of the pack.  Our write-off rate has grown at about 100 basis points faster than the industry year over year.  And this reflects what we've discussed before, that we have a higher percentage of small business than the competition. We have more affluent customers in California and Florida, and we also grew at a faster rate over the past two years.</p>
          <p>If we look at this sequentially, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, our increase is very much in line with the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, our write-off rate when you look at a comparison to competitors, because we have a decline in loan balances, there's actually a negative impact in our relationship, because as loans go down, it reduces the denominator and is therefore impacting as the write-off calculation.</p>
          <p>Now, the last point I'd make here is that when we set our higher reserve or provide an additional reserve in the second quarter of this year, we anticipated that write-offs dollars would be higher in the third and fourth quarter, and in fact they have come in and played out very much as we had expected, back in June.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 18, Lending Managed 30 Days Past Due -- here you can you see that the 30 day past due continued to rise in the fourth quarter in USCS increasing by 80 basis points, and this was really very much in line with industry increases.  But based on this increase in 30-day past due, we would expect that the first quarter of '09 write-off will be higher than the fourth quarter of '08, and the second quarter of '09 will be higher than the first quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 19, we can look at capital.  And here, for the full year '08, in the right-hand column, you can see that we generated 1.9 billion of capital over the year.  If we look at the fourth quarter, even with the restructuring reserves, we generated sufficient capital to cover our dividends.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 20, these are our capital ratios.  Capital to Total managed Assets and Total Tangible Capital to Total Managed Assets.  You can see that these metrics strengthened over the first three quarters.  The drop in the ratio in the fourth quarter is largely due to a decrease in OCI or Other Comprehensive Income within the equity section, due to lower net security valuations and pension valuations.  Each ratio improved at the end of '08 compared to the end of '07.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 21, we are providing the three key bank holding company ratios.  These ratio calculations are preliminary and have not been reviewed by the regulators.  These ratios are generally comparable to our competitors and above the well capitalized benchmarks. Historically our capital has been in line with an A-rated company based on discussions with the rating agencies, and regulators and endorsed by the marketplace as we were able to issue long term debt to fund our business.</p>
          <p>Without TARP we may have needed or had a desire to increase our total risk based capital ratio.  If we had done that we may have had to constrain the granting of credit.  However, with TARP, we do not believe this is the case.  As Ken indicated, a good indicator of this is the unused line of credit.  While we have been reducing lines on customers that we viewed as risky, we were also increasing lines to our existing customers who are credit worthy, and we were bringing on new cardmembers.  So in total, we think the unused line of credit at the end of this year will be on par with the amounts that we had at the end of last year.  So TARP is enabling us to continue to provide credit to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>If we move to Slide 22, let me spend a few moments talking about liquidity.  Now, this slide is the exact slide that we had in the third quarter call.  In that call, we had a column for six months as well as 12 months.  And this is the 12-month column.  During the fourth quarter we have significantly enhanced our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Now, as of the third quarter, we were basically looking at short-term liquidity to help us bridge to our contingent funding sources, such as the $5 billion ABS financing conduit that we had with seven banks.  While it was a very sound plan, it was contingent on drawing on the facilities that we had in place.</p>
          <p>If we actually move to slide 23 and look at the activity that has taken place in the fourth quarter, you can see that we have ending excess cash of $13 billion, and if you include the TARP $3 billion funds that we received on the 9th of January, we would have 16 billion of excess cash, which can be used to help meet the long term debt that's maturing in 2009.</p>
          <p>So we're not relying on contingent sources any longer.  We now have excess cash and marketable securities in hand.</p>
          <p>So how did we get there?  So since we're not relying on short term assets to bridge us to our contingent facilities, we've reduced short term obligations by $10 billion.  And the big news is that we've been able to raise $9 billion in retail CDs as well as sweep accounts in the fourth quarter.  Brokered CDs increased by $6 billion. This is a program that we actually started at the beginning of the quarter.  And we increased sweep deposits by $3 billion.  This demonstrates the power of our brand in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We also issued $6 billion under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  So at the end of December '08, we had 21 billion in cash.  So we need about 4 billion of that to meet our working capital needs.  And we would need about 9 billion of that to pay off our short-term obligations.  So after doing those two things, if we add in our liquidity investment portfolio, which is held in Treasuries, we have 13 billion of cash on hand at the end of December including 3 billion of TARP we received early in January.</p>
          <p>Now if you move to the next page, Slide 24, you can see that our 2009 long term debt maturities total about $20 billion.  Now, if we were growing volume and loan balances and AR were increasing, we would have higher funding requirements than the 20 billion.  In a weak economy, with lower Billed Business and lower loan balances, it's likely that we will actually have lower requirements than the 20 billion and we have 16 billion on hand to address that.</p>
          <p>If we move to Slide 25, it's our plan as we move into 2009 to use the excess cash that we have in hand. We will likely issue under the TLG Program and we could issue up to an additional $7 billion and we plan to continue to grow our retail deposits.  And I'd mentioned that the average maturity on our retail CD is about 20 months.  I'd also note that we've already raised in deposits an additional 1.5 billion in the month of January.</p>
          <p>We also plan to launch a new direct-deposit program in the second quarter of '09.  So going forward, it's our plan at the end of each quarter to have excess cash and marketable securities equal to the next 12 months of maturities.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we still have commercial paper program, we have access to the Fed TARP as well as the Discount Window, and we have our committed bank lines.  And if the ABS or unsecured markets were to open we would access those.</p>
          <p>So with that let me conclude with a few final comments.</p>
          <p>Despite the effects of a particularly difficult economic environment, and the restructuring charge, we remained profitable for the fourth quarter, and for the full year, generating 2.8 billion of earnings from continuing operations.  While throughout the quarter, cardmember spending was under pressure, our declining spending compared relatively well to other major card competitors.</p>
          <p>In light of our proportionate greater level of corporate and consumer discretionary spend, we feel good about the relative strength of our business activity.  As we expected, credit indicators weakened further during the quarter against the backdrop of rising unemployment, continued declines in the housing sector, and overall deterioration in global stock market values.</p>
          <p>As Ken outlined at the beginning of the call, for 2009, we remain focused on three key corporate goals:  To stay liquid, to stay profitable, and to selectively invest for the long term.  We believe that attaining these goals will best position us to emerge from this downturn as a strong competitor.</p>
          <p>Through our fourth quarter funding activities, we more than met our funding needs, and built an excess cash position.  This position reflects our $6 billion issuance under the TLG Program as well as our success in building our retail deposits which now total 13.3 billion.</p>
          <p>We believe this excess cash position, our additional capacity under the TLG Program, and the potential to further grow our deposit base, will satisfy all of our maturing debt obligations and fund our normal business operations for an excess of 12 months even if access to the capital markets continues to be disrupted.  We continue to expect that the difficult economic conditions will persist throughout 2009 and further suppress cardmember spending.</p>
          <p>In addition, our financial results will reflect continued deterioration in the credit environment, as well as the negative denominator impact of lower overall lending balances.</p>
          <p>This decline in balances is a function of the tempered spending environment as well as our proactive credit actions that we have implemented in 2008.  As a result, we expect U.S. and worldwide write-off rates will be higher in the first quarter of 2008 than we saw in the fourth quarter.  And this year's second quarter rates will be higher than the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The 1.9 billion reengineering program that we will be implement -- we began implementing in the fourth quarter, is an important factor in our ability to address these profitability challenges.  However, we are committed to pursue additional expenses issues in the event that further reductions are warranted.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the various pricing actions that we've implemented and the antitrust settlement payments expected from Visa and MasterCard provide us with additional sources of financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>As we evaluate our investment decisions throughout this year, we will work to prudently balance near term performance against long term profitability and growth.  While the current economic turmoil will negatively impact our results, our goal is to position the company to generate returns in excess of our dividend levels.</p>
          <p>Collectively we believe these strategies appropriately position us for the difficult period that lies ahead and should enable us to navigate through these conditions in the best possible position relative to our payment competitors and the overall industry.</p>
          <p>In closing we remain committed to our business model.  We have a strong and defined position within the payment industry, our brand is recognized and respected around the globe, our balance sheet is positioned with a capital, funding and liquidity profile that should provide us with the flexibility in these volatile times.</p>
          <p>And of course, in all our businesses we've instilled a strong focus on the customer, someone we need to stay close to regardless of the environment.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening, and we're now ready to take questions.</p>

          <p>All right. Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And our first question comes from Bruce Harting of Barclays Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you speak in terms of the allowance for loan loss, I know you've done this on previous calls, whatever algorithms, you do have to bring loans back on the balance sheet during the course of the year -- can you talk about the prospects for the calc program versus bringing loans back on balance sheet and then how you look -- how we should model provisioning for that thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so Bruce, honestly, your voice is very weak but I think I got the essence of your question which is how do we think about the loan-loss reserve for credit losses?</p>
          <p>So, we have a methodology that we've used for many years which is really a migration analysis using recent historical data.  But we also look at what are coverages of delinquencies.  We look at what our coverage is looking backward in terms of write-offs and also look forward in terms of write-offs.  It's also informed by the recent actions we've taken in terms of the cardmembers we're bringing on what we've done from a credit actioning perspective, as well, and we also are cognizant of what's taking place in the economy.  So it's not just one factor that determines how we set the reserve for credit losses.  It's really a combination of all those factors that drive our decision.  And that's what's reflected in our results for both the year and for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of if securitizations come back onto the balance sheet, I think we have about 5 billion of maturing ABS during 2009 -- if we bring them back on the balance sheet, then we've set up credit reserves for those and those would be reflected in our P&amp;L in 2009.  And we bring them back on at a level that we thought was appropriate based on the conditions that exist in the quarter that they come back on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Could you comment on this enormous growth in the retail CDs?  I thought you said 9 billion, so I guess the question is how are you getting this, who are you getting it from, what are the deposit rates, how sticky are these funds, and what's the relative tradeoff in pursuing these retail CDs versus other funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me talk first to the retail CDs.  We began that program in the beginning of October, in the fourth quarter.  They are retail CDs that are issued through the national brokerage firms.  Customers who want to place money have a choice who they do it with.  They could pick us or other companies that are issuing -- offering those rates.  The rates we have offered are market rates.  We have not paid up in terms of price.  But we think there's a flight to quality, and it's really reflective of the power of our brand.  So we raised $6 billion in the fourth quarter, and the average maturity of those was 20 months, as I mentioned.  So that's one source.</p>
          <p>And for about a year, we have had a different program with a different set of institutional companies where their customers, they actually set the rate, but their customers can pick from a variety of firms that they offer.  And we actually increased the amount through those sweep accounts by 3 billion.</p>
          <p>So, we think from a stickiness perspective that while who the customers are who are accessing the sweep accounts may change, we still think the quality of our name will help the stickiness.  In terms of the stickiness of the retail CDs, as I said, it's 20 months, there's only 2 billion of that 6 billion that have maturities under a year and the other 4 billion have maturities in excess of a year.  So it's our sense that we will have good stickiness.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned we're also going to start a direct deposit program that will be both online and offline, and that we expect to roll that out in the second quarter of 2009.  The average rate, I just mentioned, to give you a sense on the retail CDs, is 3.3%.  So over time, we will need to make an evaluation of whether we think deposits should be 20% of our funding base or 50% of our funding base.  But that's a decision we'll make over time, and would be based on having a good diversity of funding sources, as well based on price.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the point is in a relatively crowded field with a number of people going for deposits and, if you will, a late entry, that as a result of the brand and what it represents, we've been able to dramatically grow in a very short period of time.</p>

          <p>All right, thank you.  Our next question comes from Bob Napoli from Piper Jaffray.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon.  I was wondering if you might be able to give a little bit of your feels -- I know it's very difficult, but looking at the spending trends in the fourth quarter, and the -- the change in loan growth, I mean declining in the fourth quarter, if you could try to give some -- some outlook of what you're seeing so far in January versus the fourth quarter? Has it deteriorated further, and what's your best guesstimate, I guess would be for spending and your loan portfolio for '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, so I can give you some insight about what's happened so far in January.  Spend levels have been pretty consistent with what we saw in December.  So not a further deterioration from there.  But consistent with what we saw in December.</p>
          <p>The factors that are contributing to the lower loan growth are really the lower spending is the most impactful.  But the credit actions that we have put in place are also having an impact, as we're focused on controlling credit losses, in 2009. Although we continue to be very careful to balance between controlling credit losses and wanting to continue to have very good relationships with our customers going forward so we can benefit from their spending both now and in the future when the economy improves.</p>
          <p>And I'd say the third factor is that we are having less balance transfers than we've historically had.  So I think all three of those factors are contributing to the lower loan balances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a feel for I mean do you expect your loans to decline 10% this year, somewhere in that range, is that --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I wouldn't give a forecast but I would say that there is a correlation clearly between what spending levels are and where loan balances go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, good afternoon.  Can you give us a little more detail on the thinking in your lending provision and reserve. A lot of the issuers have pretty big increases in their reserves.  I know you took a big build in the second quarter but you really saw a pretty material decline in the ratio of reserves to your delinquencies. In the fourth quarter economic performance was pretty abysmal across the board -- I think a lot of people are taking a pretty bearish outlook towards '09. And therefore I think the lending provision could have been higher.  Can you just talk about a little bit behind your methodology of what you're thinking -- any sort of employment rate, unemployment rate that you're benchmarking to as you go through '09? And then also what is the driver of the negative 123 other in the reserve reconciliation?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So I think our provisioning methodology is kind of as an at line in answer to the first question, I guess I would note that our reserves as a percentage of past dues on a known basis is 137%.  That compares to last year, we were at about 119%.  While it was higher in the second and third quarter, as I mentioned when we set up the reserve in the second quarter we were really looking forward and were anticipating higher levels of write-off.  So the reserves as a percentage of past dues at 137%, we're pretty comfortable with.</p>
          <p>If you also look at what the increase in write-off rate was it increased about 75%.  And if you look at the percentage of reserves as a percentage of loans, that's also increased a similar percentage.  So as we think about our allowance levels triangulating from a variety of sources we're comfortable, and I think the levels that we have today reflect the fact that we set up an additional provision in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the second part of your question, in terms of 2009, as we are planning into 2009, while we don't do a forecast of where unemployment's going to be, for planning purposes, we're thinking that 2009 unemployment -- for planning purposes will be around, rise up to about 8.5%.  So that's the unemployment that we're -- we're thinking about when we're doing our planning for next year.</p>
          <p>The 122 million other, in the quarter, reflects some of the reserve reclasses that I -- I mentioned before.  They're small in totality.  But that's really what's affecting the 120 -- is a part of the 122 million.  The other part is there's some FX translation in there that's impacting the reconciliation.  So it's some reserve reclassification and the impact of foreign exchange is what's generated the 122 million in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.  And our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research Group.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder, could you just talk about the trend in net interest yield and whether there was a lot of excess liquidity in the fourth quarter that played into the reduction or should that continue declining? And then I had two clarification questions, one on the Delta charge, is that a one time charge or will you continue to have charges as you committed to higher cost of rewards and that's just the amount spent by Delta cardholders this quarter and how the overall higher cost will show up in the P&amp;L?  And then I wasn't clear on the tax rate or what kind of a tax benefit you would expect in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Let me answer the Delta question first.  So the 106 million was a one-time adjustment to the reserve, to bring it up to the pricing we needed to satisfy redemptions in the future that we think will be made through Delta.  Obviously, the higher cost per point on an annual basis, as we -- future spending will be reflected in the cost per point for Membership Rewards.  Although I will point out that we have done a very good job in terms of Membership Rewards cost per point which has stayed relatively flat over a number of years.  So that's the Delta question.  In terms -- go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 106 million rate reflects your expectation of what people will spend over the life of the program on Delta cards that's incremental to what you would have been providing as they spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we do is we use the historical average cost per point as an estimate for what our cost per point will be in the future.  But we've mixed in the fact that we think Delta will be a bigger proportion -- or the cost will be a bigger proportion and therefore reflected in cost per point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  But that's MR and the Delta lending card?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's MR.  That's just MR.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've cobranded the card agreement for them and we agree to reimburse them based on the spending of customers who use the co-brand card and as they spend that we'll reflect that in the P&amp;L as we do today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moving to net interest income, I guess there's two factors in there.  One is, in October, there was kind of a dislocation of the normal relationship between prime and LIBOR.  And on our variable rate lending products which is about 60% of the lending portfolio, that spread between LIBOR and prime has generally run 170, 180 basis points.  When LIBOR jumped up, basically the spread between those for a couple weeks was actually zero.  Now today it's moved back to the normal relationship which for that month or so, where it had moved away, it was a negative impact of that, and I think you're seeing that in the yield at the end of the day.</p>
          <p>However, if you look at -- if you're not looking at yield but you're looking at net interest income, to the extent we have moved to a space where our funding and liquidity is stronger because we're holding cash, there is a cost to carry on that.  The cost that we're going to pay to borrow funds will be higher than the interest income we have, for our investments, because we plan to invest that in relatively safe instruments, either Treasuries, Agencies or other instruments which are guaranteed by the government.  So I think there will be some impact on net interest income off that.</p>
          <p>Your last question about tax rate, I think it was your last question on tax rate because these permanent differences have always been there, except their impact on the tax rate has always been smaller when pre-tax income is very high.  Now that pre-tax income is lower, the permanent differences haven't changed but it's having a bigger impact on taxes, and that's why we actually have a benefit in the period.</p>
          <p>I don't know if I got all of your questions, David but I think I tried to cover them.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening.  I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the regulatory environment and some of the funding issues may be changing the way you look at your business here long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of our funding, I think, you know, we have anticipated changes in the marketplace that took place in 2008. Early in the year, we expanded our liquidity portfolio.  We added the $5 billion conduit facility.  We gained access to the Fed Window.  And now we've moved to actually holding excess cash.  So I think we've demonstrated the ability to adapt to the marketplace and develop very sound liquidity and funding programs.  And however the marketplace evolves we will be able to continue to adapt to the environment and fund cleanly as we have both in the past and in 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of other regulation that may come out, as a result of changes in the TARP rules we'll have to wait and adapt to those.  As they now stand, I don't think the regulations that are required for companies that take TARP will have a negative impact on us.  If new rules come out, then we'll have to adapt to those as they come.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you.  Dan, I was trying to get a little bit more on this charge card accounting policy change.  I'm sorry.  So the way to think about it is this is going to increase the run rate in the rate, right?  And if yes, can you reconcile that with the reserve coverage decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's really shouldn't -- it's not going to impact our P&amp;L at the end of the day.  Because when cards were 180 days past due, we had them substantially reserved for.  And all we're really doing is changing the time period when we write them off.  So instead of writing them off at 360 days we simply move that up to 180 days.  And that's why you see the additional 341 million falling through the write-off line in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, when they were at 360, obviously we had reserves to cover the vast majority of those historically.  And if you looked at reserve coverage as of the third quarter, it was 3%.  Okay?  And as you look at the table, I think on page 14 and 19, of the attachment to the press release, that dropped down to 2.5%.  But that's not a reduction in reserve coverage.  What it really is, is reflective of the fact that we are now not holding receivables on our books that are past 180 days.</p>
          <p>If you made that calculation for the fourth quarter, if we had not changed to the 180-day write-off and stayed at 360, that percentage coverage would have gone from 3% up to 3.5%.  So it's actually a strengthening in the reserves in the fourth quarter.  But because of this change in write-off to 180 days, it drops the calculation down to 2.5%.  It's actually a stronger reserve now than what we had in the third quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the rate won't change much?  I mean obviously all else equal is what I'm saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All else equal it should have no effect on our P&amp;L going forward.  Our P&amp;L will be driven by what the loss experience is in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I've got a follow up. When we think about capital adequacy, I understand regulatory capital is pretty strong, but when we look at the tangible capital is there a minimum that you guys are looking at from a tangible capital-to-managed asset standpoint? And then maybe you could just tie that into some comments on the FAS 140 issues.  I mean what do you guys think about the implementation?  I mean do you think it will be implemented or not?  And that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So let me answer the second part of your question first.  So far as FAS 140, right now I guess the rules have not been passed as yet.  There's an exposure draft out there.  If the receivables come back on balance sheet, at the exposure dates -- exposure drafts date, it would be the first quarter of 2010.  And we would just bring all the assets back onto the balance sheet, as well as the reserves.  We don't think that would have any impact on our business model or on our ability to do business going forward.  So just remind me what the first part of that question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>One moment please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...the implications and then just tie that into your expectations for that tangible capital to managed assets ratio.  Is there a specific minimum level that you guys are looking to maintain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so we don't have a specific minimum that we'd want to maintain.  I think our tangible capital ratio is pretty strong, certainly compared to our competitors.  But we don't have a floor that we've set for ourselves.  I think we act prudently in terms of if we took on additional intangibles that, after that we'd have an appropriate level of ratio of tangible equity to assets.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a couple of quick questions.  One on the roll forward of the reserve on page 14.  Can you just comment on what's driving the difference between net write-offs, or I'm sorry, the provision being down 3% on a known basis versus up 17% on a managed basis. And finally, if you could also comment on potential implications of some of the talk on bankruptcy law changes and cram downs and related issues? That would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So I think the major change is if you look at managed basis, receivables went from 75 billion to -- in the third quarter to 72 billion in the fourth quarter.  If you look at the owned, while it's 3 billion it's on a smaller base so it's a higher percentage.  So I think the difference is largely being driven by the fact that the percentage decrease in owned receivables is larger than the percentage decrease in the managed receivables.</p>
          <p>Switching to your second question about bankruptcy law, I mean I know there's been a lot of discussion about modifying mortgages and loans and the like.  But I'm not aware of conversation about the bankruptcy law or judges changing or impacting how we're into -- how credit card companies are interfacing with their customers.</p>
          <p>Now, we are very focused on credit as we've talked about many times and we're very focused on controlling credit losses.  But at the same time, we do have care programs for customers that are having temporary difficulty, and we work with them to see if we can accomplish something that both meets our needs and their needs. So we continue to focus on credit, not only from a controlling expense and losses but we also focus on seeing if we have ways where we could help customers where we think they're only in temporary difficulty.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  And our next question comes from Rick Shane of Jefferies &amp; Company.   Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys for taking my question, and I apologize, I'm going to ask two, I can't resist.  Can you tell us in the context of the deposit growth, where your programs were versus national average for the quarter so that we can get some sense of how much of this is being driven by brand versus pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the answer to that question, I think the CDs, as I said, have an average maturity of 20 months.  And the average rate that we paid was 3.3.  So I don't have here exactly what the national averages are.  But we were pricing consistent with the market.  We were not paying up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were not paying up or discounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we were not paying up to bring in deposits.  So I think you'll see that those are pretty consistent with the rates that were offered in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  And then the second question is looking at the numbers, the capital generated, matched the dividend exactly.  Would have there been any implication in terms of covenants or related to TARP in your ability to pay the dividend if those two numbers hadn't been equal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we have a very strong capital position.  I'm not aware of any contractual restrictions that we would have based on other agreements that we have in place.  We would have been able to pay the dividend.  And I'm not aware, the TARP does prohibit you from doing repurchases, it does prohibit you from increasing the dividends, while it's outstanding, but I'm not aware of any provisions of TARP that would prevent you from paying a common dividend even if you generated less capital in the quarter than the dividends you were paying in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's no income test related to the dividend from TARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not that I'm aware of.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Taiano from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks and good afternoon.  I have a question on discount rate pricing.  As you guys renew contracts with the merchants or have over the past six months or so could you give us a sense of the degree of push back that you're getting from merchants given the premium pricing if at all and could you maybe just remind us what sort of the average duration of contracts that you have with merchants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as always the case, when you're dealing with a merchant or in any other business when you're negotiating the person who's paying would always like to have a lower rate.  And as we've said, in the normal course, just based on the great continuing shift to everyday spend merchants, in the normal course, our discount rate, if we took no other actions would decline at 2 or 3 basis points a year.</p>
          <p>But as you've seen over the last couple of years we've been actually been able to go back to certain merchants where we are bringing greater value, have a discussion with them about that and they agree to pay a higher price.  So this is not us just dominating them and forcing up the price. It's really based on the value that we bring to the merchant and they've agreed to in some cases pay a higher price.</p>
          <p>A combination of that shift to everyday spend and us going to merchants where we're bringing significant value has enabled us really to only have a 1% decline this year, in the discount rate, which I think is really a testimony to our brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say, this is Ken.  The other points I would -- I would make is, the reality is, we don't have a monopoly position with any merchant.  And the reality, they have choice.  And what's critical in these times is we've invested as we've told you through the years, in programs improving our information management capabilities, our marketing capabilities, and our targeting capabilities.  So very frankly a number of our conversations over the last several months have been with merchants saying, we want to do more with you, on your marketing programs, so that we can build volume.  Because people are really obviously trying to generate sales, and this is where our marketing skills and the -- and some of the rewards capabilities we have, in bringing in business to the merchants is valuable.</p>
          <p>So I think that what it represents is a strategy that we've had in place over the last four or five years that has allowed us to maintain, in a pretty narrow range, our discount rate, which has made a pretty important difference for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.  And on the duration of the average contract, can you share that with us or --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't have that at my fingertips right now.  Generally they're multiyear contracts.  I would speculate, say probably two or three years is the average length of a contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I would say on two levels they're multiyear contracts and what we've also concentrated in doing with a number of what I'd call marquee merchants -- we, in fact, over the last  six to seven years have focused on signing even longer term contracts.  And that has been a very effective strategy for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you and our next question comes from Robert Peruzzi, UBS.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks for taking the call.  On page 20 in discussing your capital position you discussed the change in OCI as a driver in the reduction in your tangible capital ratios. I'm just wondering if you could size that on a dollar basis and maybe talk a little bit about the types of securities that are driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think it's on the securities side it's really the B and C tranches that relate to our securitization is what's driving that piece.  I think it was about 300, between 300, $400 million was that impact from that reduction in valuation on the B and C tranche.  And the other piece was the pension valuation, and I think that was somewhat of a similar number, and the two of them together is what really had the impact on the capital ratios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  And then second, with regards to the restructuring charges, I'm wondering, can we use the allocation of those restructuring charges as kind of indicative as to where the expense reductions are going to occur in the second and third phases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it would be indicative, I guess I'd also point out that employees who are part of our service delivery network are actually accounting wise held at corporate and then allocated out from an expense perspective.  So the restructuring charge related to those employees is actually in the corporate segment.  But beyond that your assertion is right although the benefit of that lower number of employees that relate to the service center will get passed through the P&amp;L over time in the segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question.  Just as you guys pursue deposit growth, any change in bank acquisition?  I know you've been fairly negative on acquiring a bank but is there any change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we've always said that we'll always evaluate every opportunity.  But generally if you were going to acquire deposits by acquiring existing banks, the vast majority of time you'll also acquire the assets of that bank.  And we would have to be very satisfied that the assets of those banks of that bank would be ones that we would be comfortable with from an exposure perspective as it relates to our shareholders.  So we've found that pursuing this path of deposits, retail CD deposits through brokers, the sweep account, and then also, having a direct deposit business, is a way that's very prudent of gathering deposits, without having to be focused on acquiring assets that we may not otherwise want.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks.  I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit since you said that the decline in kind of the reserve relative to delinquencies in the quarter was because the reserve had been built in the past.  What I guess level of metrics would cause you to actually have to raise that back up again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would look at the actual experience that we had in the quarter.  And the impact that it had on the reserve.  Also, if we became significantly more pessimistic about how -- of the inherent risk in the portfolio based on our outlook in the economy, I think both current period economics, as well as our perspective of the inherent risk.  Other things that could impact it is if we were going to bring on customers that were riskier, you'd have to increase the reserve or if you were actually tightening on credit that actually would be a basis for reducing reserves.  So I think we'd include all those factors in evaluating whether at some point in the future we thought it would be -- we needed to have an additional reserve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would be the best way for us from outside to be able to measure that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you would probably do it the same way we do.  We look at a variety of factors not just one factor.  We obviously have visibility into the credit actions we're taking, the customers we're bringing on that you don't have.  And we also have visibility into our migration analysis which is not public.  But you can certainly triangulate against delinquency coverage that we have, you can look at the increase in loans compared to the increase in write-off rates.  I think it's -- mean it's the normal things that you would look at in terms of evaluating that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I think the other point Dan, I think you mentioned is the reserve that we took in the second quarter was projecting out several quarters.  And I think as you said that the performance was within the estimates that we had set.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that goes back to how you balance off the different factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But Moshe, I don't think we'd ever want to lock in to just one metric and keep it at that level forever. So, I don't think we'd ever want to say we want to have a past-due coverage of 130% and, no matter what, keep it there.  Because in some cases you might be over-reserving and in some cases you may be under-reserving.  So I really do think from my perspective looking at a wide variety of factors, including our base methodology is a thoughtful way of approaching provisioning and where the allowance should be set at the end of each quarter.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from John Stilmar [SunTrust].  Mr. Stilmar, please state your company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is John Stilmar from SunTrust.  Thank you for allowing me to get on the call.</p>
          <p>As I look at the changes in actual number of card issuances this quarter, it seems like it was about a 1% decline in the U.S., a smaller decline internationally just over 1% in cards in the GCS business.  Can you talk about the -- seems like there's a relative preference for investment of domestic versus international and commercial.  Can you talk about whether that is true, and what I should be inferring from that?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, with regards to reserve, and I hate to bring this topic back up again tonight, but how should we be looking at the reserve as it relates to the amount of balance that you expect in future periods?  Because clearly one is expectations of loss and the second is the absolute balance that should be outstanding. So I was wondering if you could provide a little clarity on that as well.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just in the first question, in terms of where we invest. We don't have a preference of one business unit over another on a universal basis.  I think we look every quarter to see what business opportunities present themselves.  If we think there's an opportunity to invest in commercial card, that provides us with a greater return than we would have in our next incremental investment, say, in consumer card we'll place the investment there.</p>
          <p>So I think we're always looking at what's going to create the greatest economic return over the life of the customer.  And that's what really drives our business decisions in terms of where we put investments and how much we put in the U.S. consumer and how much we put in international consumer, how much we put in global commercial card and what we invest in the network.</p>
          <p>And as you know, there are always investments that you can make that will get you immediate metrics, and then there's investments you need to make in your capabilities and infrastructure that you need to make over time.  So we try to balance all of those things as we make forward-looking investment decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important point is the optionality and flexibility we have in our card acquisition approach relative to other business models, because we have a choice of a range of consumer products, charge card, revolving, GNS our bank partnership obviously has limited risk and in these times, that's something we obviously balance and look at. And then when we look at the economics of our Corporate Card business and the penetration opportunities that we see, both in the U.S. and around the world, that's attractive.  And so this is something that we're constantly calibrating.  But I think the key point is, we have a range of options based on both the returns and the risk that we see out there in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as it relates to your second question, we are setting reserves based on the inherent risk in the balance sheet as of the balance sheet date so as of December 31.  We're not taking into consideration whether the balance sheet, actual loan balances will go up, or whether they'll go down in the future.  What we do look to the future as, is what do we think is happening in the economy, and that is one of many factors that will integrate into our thinking, in terms of establishing our reserve balance.</p>
          <p>So we just say, from here, we'll just take one more question.</p>

          <p>Just wanted to ask with regard to behavioral changes that you've seen within the rewards I guess expense line have you seen people change how they're treating rewards? Have you guys maybe seen an uptick in redemptions of reward points over the last few months or even into January?</p>

          <p>You know we've had this question from a fair number of analysts.  Thinking that the economy would cause people to utilize Membership Rewards to a significantly greater degree.  And think quite frankly to date we have not seen that.  People continue to do redemptions, they continue to value the program.  So we have not seen a notable uptick in redemptions as a result of the slow down in the economy.</p>
