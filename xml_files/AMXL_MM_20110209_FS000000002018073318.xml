          <p>Good morning. My name is Michael and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AMX 4Q 2010 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Campbell. You may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Good morning and good afternoon. This is Andy Campbell from Credit Suisse. I'm Head of Telecom, Media and Technology Research for Latin America.</p>
          <p>We have on the line with us today from Mexico City, Daniel Hajj, CEO; Carlos Garcia Moreno, CFO; Oscar Von Hauske, Director of Wireline Services; and Daniela Lecuona, Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to thank Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil for allowing us to host the call today and I will hand it over to the company for their opening remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. Thank you everybody for being on the call. Carlos is going to make as always a summary of the fourth quarter 2010 financial result. Carlos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thanks Andy for hosting this call. Good morning everyone. The last quarter of 2010 found a year of strong economic expansion in South America and <mark type="inaudible" /> economic recovery in North America.</p>
          <p>And what about about reacceleration of subscriber growth in much of the region. As such we added 8.2 million wireless subscribers in the quarter, 23% more than we did in the year-on-year quarter. Postpaid additions at 1.9 million in this quarter more than double demand we have seen over the year before . In fact, this was possibly the largest number of postpaid net additions we have ever posted.</p>
          <p>Increasingly, the postpaid segment of the market is about data and having significantly expanded our data capacity over the last three years as we built the common 3G platform in the region has given us an edge in the market.</p>
          <p>The biggest increases in net additions relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 took place in Mexico and Central America, having doubled in the former and tripled in the latter.</p>
          <p>All together, we obtained 24 million new clients in the year, substantially more than we had aimed for at the outset and changed with 225 million subscribers <mark type="inaudible" /> more than at the beginning of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our revenue generating unit on the fixed platform also increased by 12% in the year to end December with 51.5 million, of which 10 million are TV accesses and 13 million broadband accesses. Revenues expanded by 6% year-on-year, with service revenues growing 5.5% in Mexico in 2010.</p>
          <p>However, this partly reflects the appreciation of the Mexican peso versus practically all other currencies, including the dollar. At constant exchange rates, service revenues actually would have increased 7.1% driven by mobile data and by PayTV services that expanded 36% and 39% respectively.</p>
          <p>Mobile voice revenues would have grown almost 9% and fixed broadband revenues 3.6% while fixed line voice revenues would have fallen 6.3%. It is important to note that in this strong expansion of revenue that we have all throughout the region that you should keep in mind that for the last year or so, we have been reporting on the IFRS and &#x2013; on the IFRS we are meant to deduct from revenues the commissions I would say on sales. In this particular quarter <mark type="inaudible" /> postpaid regions were so strong, the commissions that were paid on these sales were obviously a very significant amount that were deducted from revenue. So I just want to clarify this point because I'm sure that we are going to encounter some question. You have to keep in mind that service revenue the way we are reporting are net of commissions.</p>
          <p>Moving on to EBITDA, it came in at 61.2 billion pesos in the quarter, it was 4.8% more than a year before with the EBITDA margins remaining almost flat even in this state of more rapid subscriber growth.</p>
          <p>Our <mark type="inaudible" /> net profit of 24.2 billion pesos would have been nearly 3 billion pesos higher in the absence of extraordinary depreciation charges meant to reflect the impact that the rapid rate of technological innovation has on the market values of various types of telecommunications equipment and the need to phase out over shorter periods of time the older technology.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flow allowed us to fully fund our capital expenditures of 81.9 billion pesos and in addition to spend 56 billion pesos on stock of Telmex, Net Servi&#xE7;os and Carso Global Telecom and an additional 35 billion pesos in share buybacks and dividends.</p>
          <p>Our net debt came down by 10 billion pesos to 207 billion pesos today which is approximately $15 billion, equivalent to 0.84 times EBITDA even in spite of the total capital outlook and the solution.</p>
          <p>So Andy we will pass it back to you, but as we have seen, we had very, very strong subscriber and revenue growth. And I think that our EBITDA was quite strong given the strong rate of our subscriber net additions. Thank you all.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Carlos. Once again, this is Andy Campbell from Credit Suisse. And I would like to start with the first question. And my question is really about the postpaid subscriber additions, as you mentioned it was record quarter for postpay net adds. And if you could just elaborate a little bit on the conditions that are driving the postpaid growth. And whether or not that's a trend that you think will continue in the future quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andy, I think we have very good 1.9 million postpaid additions in the quarter was good, I think Brazil was good, Mexico was good. I think all over all Latin America in the countries, we are focusing a lot on the postpaid subscriber. We are trying to sell more smartphones. We are trying to include data in the plan. So I think it's not only one thing that we are doing, we are increasing our distribution &#x2013; postpaid distribution network and that's mainly a nice thing. We have been doing that for maybe one year, one year and a half, and we are having the results to date. I think something that is helping us a lot is that the economies in the Latin America are starting -- we are starting to see good progress in the last year. So that helps a lot on the postpaid business.</p>
          <p>Mainly in mostly all of the region we're are gaining postpaid in portability where we have portability. I think we are really focusing in these businesses, Andy. And that's why you are seeing good growth on the revenue side, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And are the 3G data card subscribers a meaningful contributor to the postpaid additions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, of course as we're selling &#x2013; in some countries we're selling more than in other country, depending a lot on the big broadband competition, but we are selling a lot, we are moving to a limited data service. To offer limited I think it's very good for the company. And one very important thing that you should know is that we think Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil has a excellent network. I think people will deciding where they are going to have the data and they are deciding on the Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil network to have that data. So that's helping us in postpaid additions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Daniel. At this point Michael, can we please, queue for questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Question is on Brazil: obviously very strong net adds in Brazil. Can you talk a little bit about the ARPU trends in Brazil, I don't know if that was the IFRS item with the postpaid? Seemed a little bit lower than we were thinking on year-over-year changes. And then also the margins in Brazil as you look to the 2011, what do you think happens with the margins? Do we get back up or is it going to continue to stay under some pressure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in Brazil, we do in postpaid, we do 10 times what we do last year. These IFRS it's one of the reasons why ARPU is not &#x2013; it's down a little bit, because, as Carlos says, with the tough commissions from the revenue, and when you have only in December more than 400,000 postpaid subscribers where there is lot. And that there is &#x2013; I make a calculation and maybe it's around 5% the growth that we should have that we could have if we don't have that IFRS issue. I think as we are growing &#x2013; other important issue in Brazil is competition, competition is strong, promotions are very strong in the market.</p>
          <p>And that's other important. I don't have any doubt that in the future, in the near future our revenues are going to grow, and our EBITDA is going to recover. Okay, but right now, I think in Brazil we are trying to gain market share. Remember that at the beginning of the year, middle of the year, we were losing market share. We'll recover that, and I think we're on track again for this year. And we will get the revenue, the ARPU I'm sure that the EBITDA is going to come. Oscar can talk a little bit on what is happening on the TV side, and on the broadband side with Embratel, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as you know we have in the market with Embratel there is satellite TV DTH. We've been growing pretty good the last quarter, we are close to have 1.1 million subscribers in Brazil. And I think our total <mark type="inaudible" /> in the marketplace and as well net the growth that we have in broadband have been really good. And we had a very good market share. And we are &#x2013; and we tend to <mark type="inaudible" /> and be in Brazil to have a better position in the marketplace to deliver <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think with Claro plus net that we have 92% plus in Brazil, I think we are really well supported in Brazil, well positioned in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Tom&#xE1;s Lajous with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. Thank you, thank you very much for the call. I have two questions. The first one is because I am sure the dividend question is going to come up. But ahead of that can you talk a little bit about what your CUFIN balance is at this point, and whether you're going to be able to inherit the sort of $9 billion in CUFIN that were held at Carso Global Telecom?</p>
          <p>And the second question is Daniel you highlighted how good your network is, are you going to &#x2013; do you have any plans or are there any opportunities to start offloading mobile data back on to your fixed network via dual technology devices and/or Santos cells and what are your plans in that respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. If you want I can start with that question Tom&#xE1;s, I think what I am saying about the network I think it's a great &#x2013; what we do by merging Telmex Internacional and Claro really one of the big gains that we're having with that, we're going to have only one network for all the technologies, all the different wireless, TV, video, broadband.</p>
          <p>So of course we're going to use Wi-Fi for Claro and the investments are going to be much more profitable when you do network for all these different services. So I don't have any doubt that that's working. We are really advanced. We have only six &#x2013; we have been only six months working with that and we're seeing all the advantage that's in the network, no? I don't know Oscar, you want to add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I totally agree. And we are moving to a single network all IT and we are making the evolution from old technology, SDS technologies to carry Internet in the backbone . So we will have a very stable VM network not only in Brazil. We are in other countries. And of course with fixed and mobile conversion will be delivered <mark type="inaudible" /> all IT network in the region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a lot of fiber all around the country. We have less miles. We have the backhaul. We are constructing a submarine cable. We have some satellite. So I think we are well support in this &#x2013; in our regions by our network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as regard <mark type="inaudible" /> we generated last year for <mark type="inaudible" /> 86 billion pesos, that's the amount that would be distributable. As to the &#x2013; we have inherited the <mark type="inaudible" /> from Carso Global, we believe that we have some arguments that would point to that would be the case, but this is not something that have been completely cleared. <mark type="inaudible" /> we need to continue to check this with the authorities. At this point I do not have an answer for you, the only thing that I can tell you is that we feel that we generated that we don't have any doubts about is 86 billion pesos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you used any of that to the day, Carlos, did you start, did you use some of that ahead of time or did you use some of that in 2010, or is that what you have available now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's what we have available now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you generate last year is what you are going to use this year, so that 86 billion pesos that we generate last year is what we can use this year you no, Carlos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Si. Then additional 5 or 6 billion pesos <mark type="inaudible" /> before but yes, that's more or less what we can do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think you are going to -- I mean are you going to try and use that much CUFIN?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's always down, as you know very well Tom&#xE1;s, to part of the uses of cash. So to the extent that we engage in acquisitions, there would be less cash less for distributions. To the extent that we do not engage in <mark type="inaudible" /> we distribute the full amount that we can <mark type="inaudible" /> in '08, in '09 then obviously we will just be giving the full amount by way of share buybacks and dividends. It really boils down to are there any alternative uses for cash, and if so to what extent <mark type="inaudible" /> amount that are distributable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of James Rivett with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. I've got two questions, if I can. The first is on just your Mexican mobile business, clearly no signs in the fourth quarter that you are seeing any impact as Telefonica's 3G launched. But I was just wondering whether you could give us an update on where that stands today and whether you are seeing any changes in the pricing environment?</p>
          <p>My second question was just on more generally in terms of smartphones, can you give us an update on where you think smartphones are currently costing, what they are currently costing to you and to the consumer? Just trying to work out how much of the mass market you can target through this. Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question is on the 3G and Telefonica. I don't know exactly, I know that they win the option, they win some license in maybe I think were in September &#x2013; August, September, something like that. And while they need to do a network, I don't know if they already have the network. What I can tell you is that we have more like 500 cities in Mexico with our 3G network which have a good backhaul and we are very strong there. We are investing for maybe three to four years on that network. So I am feeling very comfortable on our side.</p>
          <p>Now that does not mean that the other ones are going to invest and that we are going to have more competition. But we have very good coverage &#x2013; good &#x2013; a strong network in terms of data, no? The smartphones well, you are seeing that the smartphones, there is a lot of smartphones, smartphones with Android software, with Windows software, with a special software from each brand, Samsung, LG. And that depends a lot the price of this smartphone. So, I have no doubt that the price of the 3G handsets are going to reduce a lot. We have been seeing that there are lot of handsets at very good prices today, and I am sure that in the future, near future we are going to see day-by-day better prices, James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question is, is we are going to make this smartphones available for the mass market. I am sure that &#x2013; they are going to be at $30 to $40. But maybe you are going to find at $150 so. And every year, every day, you are going to see more competition in 3G, better prices, more applications, so I don't have any doubt on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. I mean do you think we see a sub-$100 smartphone this year, do you think that's a possible &#x2013; a realistic possibility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, I am not so sure, but maybe yes we can find it at the end of the year or so. Depending a lot on the competition, but the future points with good operating systems, I am sure that we are going to have Android system or Apple system or Windows systems, I don't think we are going to get to those prices. But the other operating systems, I think, we can get to $100 to $120 maybe, but close to $100 of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to focus a little bit on one of the points in the press release. You mentioned that there was the change in accounting at Embratel, which caused net income to be down 542 million pesos. I just wanted to clarify: you say it's not material in the fourth quarter, but when we look at Embratel's results the margins were very low in the fourth quarter. So, I am wondering was there at least a portion of that that was attributable to the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly I wanted to just follow-up on the earlier question around Brazilian ARPU. I think the focus or the way that I am looking at it is on a year-on-year basis and as far as I understand, both this quarter and last quarter -- last year's quarter were on the same accounting basis. So the 15% decline is apples-to-apples, and that is a worsening of the trend from the 11% in the third quarter, which I found surprising given the strong performance in postpaid. So is there anything else going on in terms of your pricing that might be impacting ARPU in the Brazilian market? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Carlos, I don't know if you heard my question. It's Michel Morin from Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Michel, this is Daniela, I am sorry, but we pushed the wrong button, we have a new phone in our new office.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me reiterate the question. There was two questions on Embratel and also on ARPU in Brazil. On Embratel you flagged 542 million pesos of capitalized labor costs, but you say it's not &#x2013; it wasn't in the fourth quarter. So I am wondering if, why Embratel's margins were so low? Was there at least a portion of that that hit in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the Brazil ARPU question from earlier. As far as I understand the year ago figures were also expressed in IFRS. So IFRS really should not be a factor when looking at the decline of 15% on a year-on-year basis. And that's worse than the 11% decline you reported in the third quarter. So I am just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on what's happening in terms of pricing in the market that might be causing that worsening of the ARPU trends on a year-on-year basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, I think it's very important because the commissions last year we had 10 times less postpaid subscribers. So when you have 10 times more subscribers on the postpaid, keep you a lot &#x2013; what &#x2013; I give you the figures. The figures will be around 5% increase on revenue if we take out the IFRS. In local rap we will have around 5% revenue increase, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have to put <mark type="inaudible" /> saving in perspective, Michel. Commissions year-on-year went up 83%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's not minor. As Daniel said, it is 10 times more net additions in postpaid in Brazil last quarter this year than the prior year. And that really has an impact on commissions. So that's basically what explains the ARPU situation. And then the other part you were saying about the <mark type="inaudible" /> of labor cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the 542 million pesos that you flagged in the release?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are saying that it was <mark type="inaudible" /> for the year. We are not saying that it's only an issue of only of Embratel and we're not saying that it has much of an impact on the quarter. We're just saying that it is a consequence of standardizing the accounting policy that we have across all companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not saying it's a factor on the last quarter. We're just wanting everybody to be aware that we have conducted a full standardization of the accounting policies of the company and that it has had an impact on net income for the year of the 500 and something million that you just pointed out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when I look at your Embratel results which were reported separately last night and I see that the margin was down year-on-year and it was the weakest of the year, is that entirely due to subscriber acquisition costs on DTH which was very strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in the case of Embratel they are reflecting in the quarter what we had already begun to reflect in the prior quarter, okay. So in the case of the individual companies, they are only enacting in this quarters the accounting changes that we called for from the beginning of the second half of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, I have two questions please. The first one was just regarding the impact now of lapping the tax increase that came in last year. Obviously you're able to pass that onto consumers quite successfully. Does that gives you more confidence about your pricing for 2011 and potentially your Mexican revenues on mobile that are up 10% at the moment. Growth could maybe step up to as high as 14% going into early 2011? So that was my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is, I was wondering if you can just give us an update on what you see happening on the MTR reductions in Brazil, kind of timing and likely magnitude of that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think for the next &#x2013; for this year, we don't have any MTR reduction in Brazil. I don't have any news on that. So at this moment we are not seeing any reduction on the interconnections in Brazil. We don't know exactly where the regulators are going to decide, but at this moment we don't have any thing there. And the first question, sorry, because we don't hear you very well. Can you repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. I was just asking about the fact that you are now &#x2013; had a 12 month anniversary of the VAT and Telecom's tax that came in in January 2010. Given that that is no longer going to be a drag on your year-on-year comparables in the Mexican mobile business, do you think in early 2011 we can see your growth rates in Mexico step up by around three to four points, maybe growth in Mexico can start getting towards 13% to 14% revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you're saying is that tax that we have last year that is 1% more; I don't think that hurts us a lot. We already have 10% revenue growth in Mexico and well to maintain that 10% will be very good. Remember that we have big base in Mexico and we're moving a lot to focus more on postpaid. We're moving to sell more smartphones, to do more data. So I think if we could have 8% to 10% revenue growth would be a very good, no? I don't think we can go to 14, and I don't think also that the tax that we have last year would impact on the growth of the revenues. We already have that tax, the tax is there, so people is paying 1% more in taxes, so you're not going to eliminate this year this tax, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys, thanks for taking the questions, just a couple. How should we think about ARPU trends in Mexico? Obviously you saw a good improvement there in Q4, if subscriber growth continues to improve, could that pressure ARPU in Mexico going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the important issue here is data, as we grow in data, I think we can sustain or maintain the ARPU and as we are saying we have a good network, we have capacities. So what we need to do is to sell more smartphones and to sell more data, to sell more data in prepaid also. So I think that's going to give us the increase on revenues in Mexico. <mark type="inaudible" /> we are thinking we can have the increase in Mexico, and not only in the big cities. I think in the big cities you have fixed broad-brand, wireless, a lot of competition. I think we have a good advance as in the small towns and small cities, where we can give a lot more data, so that's where we're focusing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just along the same lines, wireless data looks to be at about 23% of wireless service revenue. Can you just talk about how that varies among your stronger countries and where you see data revenue growing over say the next two or three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think data, it varies a lot when you have more SMS, because SMS is inside of the revenue, but when you are talking about browsing and applications, I think all the countries are more or less in the same range. They value not so deeper end, okay.</p>
          <p>And where we can get on the data side, well, I think there are some countries that have 40% of the revenue or 45% of the revenues in data. So I think we could get there, no, I don't know when, but we could get there and have 45% of our revenues on data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil for the consolidated today, a little bit less than 23% is coming from data, 20% of service revenues of &#x2013; is coming from data. And the other thing that is interesting, this &#x2013; you have countries like Argentina where data is already about one-third of service revenues coming from data. And then you have some other countries that are, they still have less than 20% coming from data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By an example, in Ecuador, we sell a lot of SMS, so as a big part of the data is SMS, I think we need to improve on browsing and Internet and applications. In other countries it is more on the browsing and the applications. But overall, we are focusing there and I don't think we have a problem reaching 40% to 45% of our revenues in data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. It looks like obviously you know you had a great quarter in Colombia. I think Comcel, the consolidated EBITDA margin there was expended year-on-year even with higher subscriber growth. So, can you elaborate on what happened there? If there is any non-recurring benefit that has been taken into consideration or into account this quarter? Or it's simple &#x2013; it's as simple as the scale contributing to the margin increase? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>And the second is on the consolidated tax rate. It was a bit lower &#x2013; well, if you take the whole year it was, I think around 27%, only 14% around &#x2013; 14% in the fourth quarter. Why is it the case, and what can we expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question on Colombia, what you're seeing Mauricio is that we have been growing this quarter the growth on revenue is around 10%. So all the efforts that we have been doing on postpaid data and to increase revenue are there, we are controlling the costs very well. There is no recurring revenue. So it's the last year. So I think it's only all the work that we have been doing in the last year, no? Increasing revenues, containing costs and that's the growth on the EBITDA side.</p>
          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; on the wireline, I think, we need to &#x2013; we sell a lot of broadband, we don't sell a lot &#x2013; we don't have a good year in terms of TV, but we are also controlling very well the cost and that's the reason why you are seeing the very good results in Colombia. I think we can sustain that and improve the television subscribers, no? Even with that I think the fixed revenues are 8% higher than what we have last year. So all overall Colombia is doing very well.</p>
          <p>Carlos is going to explain you about the tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the effective tax rate, Mauricio, we have extraordinary moves in this quarter, some of them have to do with depreciation, but some of them also have to do with the booking of a deferred tax credit. This deferred tax credit, which is important, was the last installment in the series of credits that we began to put on in the end of 2008. We mentioned it in the release of the last quarter of 2008. This was because the existing carry-forward tax losses that we had in the country, as soon as the auditors realized that they would be &#x2013; that it was likely that they would be utilized in the future that led to the booking &#x2013; the recognition from accounting standpoint by way of a deferred tax credit. So that &#x2013; if you do not have these extraordinary items, the effective tax rate would have been 31% for this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. So, I guess that that's what we should expect going forward, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what you should expect, yes. Pretty close to the statutory tax rate, no, effective tax rate.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Maybe just to continue on the margin question, just in another geography, Peru saw pretty good margin performance there, maybe less, not so much a case of sort of seasonal surprise. But that business is gaining scale; the margins are now in the 40s. Should we expect them to kind of flatten this year and sort of stay in there? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Another one if I may, just on &#x2013; maybe elaborating a little bit more on PayTV, that segment is growing revenues, very, very strongly 80% there. Maybe just some comment on the mix of that growth, what is cable, what is satellite? And if it is indeed things like Embratel, the satellite platform, what is the opportunity to keep growing that segment? Are there other countries you can enter or add satellite to your cable assets? Thanks very much guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Peru, I think, we have a very good year. We grow from 35% EBITDA margin to 44% EBITDA margin. We are growing in market share. We are growing on postpaid. So I think all overall, we have a very good year on Peru. I hope we can still grow the revenues. We have a lot of efficiencies in the company. I think we already merged the fixed and the wireless there, and I think we could have a very good wireless &#x2013; wireline year in TV and broadband in 2011. I think all overall I am feeling very comfortable on Peru. If we're going to grow the EBITDA this year, well I think depends a lot on how aggressive we could be in the market in the television side, in the broad &#x2013; fixed broadband and the other one is how can we contain costs in the company. So that's more or less what we have to do. On the TV side, Oscar can explain to you what &#x2013; how we are doing in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you see the mix of cable and DTH, 80% of the pay-TV subscribers have cable, and 20% is satellite TV. You see Brazil &#x2013; if you see the pay-TV penetration, it's still very low, it's around 17% of the households already have pay-TV. If you compare that with Argentina that is 52% and even with Mexico that is 36% this year, a huge opportunity to be in the marketplace to grow. And as well in the other countries that we have presence of pay-TV, we have presence in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Dominicana with pay-TV. And if you see the pay-TV penetration with exception of &#x2013; as I mentioned, in Argentina it's around 20% the other areas. So we see future opportunity in marketplace to deliver, with cable in the AV market and with satellite in the CDE market segment of the market.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is related to churn and <mark type="inaudible" /> most of your markets, probably with the exception of one churn increase and I was wondering if that's because you are converting a lot of your postpaid &#x2013; prepaid customers into postpaid or there was yearend <mark type="inaudible" /> subscriber base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think both that we are being very careful on not having subscribers that are not giving out revenue. So we are aggressively disconnecting the subscribers that are not active. And the other thing is we are also moving part of the base from prepaid to postpaid, both are there. So we think that's important.</p>
          <p>Other thing that you could see there that we're being very careful is that subsidies. We have been more careful on the subsidies though as we have a bigger base and the base is churning. So it's very important that you don't have big subsidies on your handsets, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One other question, you are talking about one network to provide all services, but with that hopefully there will be more bundling of services as well. But we haven't seen much bundling of services, can you tell us where you stand with regards to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How about again, again the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The bundling of services, we haven't seen much bundling of services since AMX has bought Telmex and Telmex Internacional, any plans on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we are doing the job on the network, let's say in Chile we are operating a triple play service, a fourth play service and in Peru the same, in Ecuador the same. In Mexico, we are still separate; we are not doing anything together. But we are going to decide when and how we are going to do things depend on convenient for us, no? So, that's I think we need to be ready to give this bundled services, but we want to be careful that in each country how to do it, where we don't want to reduce revenue only because we want to do a bundling service. So we want to be careful on the way we do it, no?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, thanks for the question. My question basically focuses on MOUs where in Mexico price per minute according to your statement fell by 13% and MOUs increased by 10%, whereas in Brazil price per minute fell by 20% and MOUs only increased by 2%. I was just wondering if you could give some more color on sort of the success in compare and contrast between each of the markets and sort of why it's working in one and not in the other? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are comparing Mexico and Brazil? I think that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just in terms of the MOUs because obviously the price per minute they're declining in both, 13% in Mexico and 20% in Brazil whereas you're getting some traction in Mexico in terms of the MOUs, but you're not in terms of Brazil, and so I was just wondering why you're getting success in Mexico, but not Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you cannot see the reductions that 20% in Brazil or 13% in Mexico. You have to see what's the price per minute in Mexico and price per minute in Brazil. In Mexico, the price per minute is around $0.045, okay? So I think we are really competitive and we're doing well. That's why I think the reduction is only 13% because we have reached to a very aggressive pricing. In Brazil, I think the price is around $0.09, so the reduction is going to be faster there. That's the reason why in one country we reduce more than in the other country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But <mark type="inaudible" /> you're estimating that based on the ARPU numbers that we have in the report and those ARPU numbers are already deducting the commissions again. So to the extent as we saw before in the call, these commissions were actually quite important in Brazil in this particular quarter. You are incorporating that effect into your calculation, okay? So I think the important thing is waiting out the next quarter you are going to see a normalization of commission and you are then going to see what measures as the real revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, put it another way then, how much additional growth do you think you can get in terms of the MOUs in each of these respective markets? I mean should we expect to see sort of that 10% in Mexico continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, yes. I think of course. As revenue goes down, the economic situation of the country gets better, I think people are going to spend more and we are going to reduce the price or they are going to get more minutes. Let's say in pre-paid, in pre-paid, if you spend $10, you get some amount of minutes. If you reduce the price there for $10, you get more minutes and the people are using that. So it is immediately the reduction on the price, and the usage.</p>
          <p>So I don't have any doubt that all overall not only in Mexico, in all the countries you are going to see increase on minutes of use. In some countries, you are going to see faster reduction on prices than in other countries, but I am sure that in all the countries you are going to see the increase of minutes of use. And also increase on data usage, no?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Only one more thing. You remember that when you're looking at MOUs, it's the traffic per client, it happens that the number of clients in Brazil this year went up by 16%, which is twice as fast as <mark type="inaudible" /> in Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that 2% sort of diluted down then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Exactly, you have the fees subscriber base increased by 16% in the year. In Mexico it increased by 8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fine. Perfect. It's very clear. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. I just have two. First is on client acquisition and retention costs, as you pursue the postpaid opportunity more robustly, not just in Brazil, but in other markets, how should investors think about the near-term trade-off between margin and top line growth? Would you expect to spend similar to the 26 billion pesos on equipment in 2011 as you spent in 2010, and simply ride the decline in unit cost curve down and do more units? Or should we expect an effect in certain markets similar to what we have seen when you have reinvested in network such as in Claro back in 2005 and '06 in Brazil? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very, your question is very &#x2013; the answer is very difficult, because it's going to depend a lot on the promotions and the aggressiveness of each of the competitors in each country. So we don't know if subsidies are going to get bigger in some countries or less in other countries. I think what we are trying to do is to have less subsidies and better rates. I think that's more or less the strategy that we want to have.</p>
          <p> But that's the strategy then you have to go country by country and do what you need to do there, no? So one thing is what we want; the other thing is what your competitors let you do. So we, you know and we Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil has been, I think, the last 10 years we are more on the growth side. We are not &#x2013; we also been very careful on the costs. We want to have better profit. What I think the main idea today is, the main strategy is the growth and that's where we are going. I think Latin America is the region where we want to be and they have a very good economic situation. The countries, some countries are growing more, other countries have less penetration like Brazil by an example, it only have 85% penetration. So we are deciding on the growth in that country no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel, that's very reasonable. And it ties into my second question, which is a bit of broader strategic question on M&amp;A. I mean, the situation within region for inorganic growth opportunity for AMX really hasn't changed that much in the last several years, I mean, aside from a few small operators in Chile and the Caribbean. Of course, in the past there was Telmex Internacional, which could be the vehicle for pursuing some potential acquisitions out of region.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering if Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil were to pursue expansion outside of South and Central America perhaps in Eastern Europe or opportunistically in another continent, thinking more Africa, would this be funded on Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil's balance sheet or possibly out of a separate non-recourse entity. As the latter might provide you some better option value for AMX, while those operations are more in growth and investment mode.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think first we need to have the &#x2013; to see what's going to be the investment. It's going to be outside as you said of Central and South America, if it's going to be in Eastern Europe or in Africa. And if it fits under the financial terms that we think under the strategy of Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, then I think the investment would be in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. If it's not related to Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil, maybe we could do it outside Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil in the group. But if it is related to telecommunication I think we could do it in Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil. So that's where my responsibility, our responsibility here is to try to find where could be a good place where we can invest outside, no? At this moment, we are not finding outside of Latin America any good opportunity. But we are going to open as always to see there are some opportunities in other regions, no?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel and Carlos. My question is regarding dividends and buybacks. Where should we expect AMX <mark type="inaudible" /> for the year? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have been -- regarding as we said around 4 billion pesos to 5 billion pesos on share buybacks. On dividends what &#x2013; I think that Carlos can answer -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just reiterate we have the same policy that we have had for quite some time. We like to maintain a capital structure in which our net debt is less than one-times EBITDA, today it's at 0.84, 0.85 times EBITDA so we are practically there.</p>
          <p>It's a policy that given that objective of working capital, we will distribute the cash that we may distribute to the extent that we have not utilized it for acquisitions. I mentioned detailing <mark type="inaudible" />. So to what extent are we going to distribute either by way of share buybacks or dividends, it's a function of &#x2013; I look at the structure and the alternative uses for the cash <mark type="inaudible" />. In the absence of <mark type="inaudible" /> alternative uses, we can distribute as much as our cooking, we mentioned that the cooking that we have available from last year is 36 billion pesos plus some leftovers from prior years, probably as much as 100 billion pesos. So those are all the parameter I can give you.</p>
