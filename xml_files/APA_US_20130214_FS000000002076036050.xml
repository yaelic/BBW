          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Allie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Apache Corporation fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time I would like to introduce your presenter for today, Mr. Brady Parish, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Parish, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Allie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Apache Corporation's full year and fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>This morning we reported 2012 earnings of $1.9 billion or $4.92 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items that impact the comparability of results, totaled $3.8 billion or $9.48 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations totaled $10.2 billion.</p>
          <p>On today's call we will have three speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. First we will hear from Steve Farris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rod Eichler, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally Tom Chambers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>We prepared our quarterly financial supplemental data package for your use which also includes the reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or pre-tax margins. In addition, new for this quarter, we have prepared an operations supplement to summarize our activities across the various Apache regions. These can both be found on our website at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.</p>
          <p>Today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A further disclaimer is located with the supplemental data package on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon and thank all of you for joining us.</p>
          <p>Apache achieved some new milestones in 2012. First of all despite significant down time we grew our average annual production to 779,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, almost 5.5% above 2011 if you adjust for dispositions, which is a new record for Apache. And as a matter of information, and I assure you, not an excuse, I would like to point out, had we not experienced the unplanned down time in the North Sea and Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf of Mexico during just the third quarter our production growth would have been 6.3%.</p>
          <p>More importantly during the fourth quarter we averaged 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for the first time in our company's history, which establishes a strong base as we enter 2013. And despite &#x2013; as Brady pointed out, despite weaker North American gas prices, our balanced portfolio enabled us to generate $10.2 billion of cash flow, consistent with 2011.</p>
          <p>I would also like to point out, driving this impressive cash flow were our liquids revenues, which constituted 81% of our overall $17 billion in revenues for the year and natural gas &#x2013; North American natural gas accounted for only 11%.</p>
          <p>By the end of the year we had fully integrated our Midcontinent and North Sea portfolio expansions and we really hit our stride in our large Permian position. As a result we built operational momentum heading into 2013. We have become the most active Permian Basin player with 38 operated rigs and we plan to increase our horizontal rig fleet to half of our total operated rigs during the year. We have also become a leader in the Midcontinental liquids and oil plays increasing our horizontal drilling activity from six rigs at the beginning of 2012 to 25 today.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year we advanced the Kitimat LNG project by increasing our interest to 50% and expanding our strategic relationship with Chevron, who we believe possesses the financial and technical LNG wherewithal to complement our upstream strengths. And it should help us accelerate our plans to monetize the over 50 Tcf of natural gas that we have in Liard and Horn River, importantly at oil-linked prices.</p>
          <p>I'm sure all of you have noted in our earnings release this morning, during 2012 we replaced 156% of our production before revisions. Excluding property acquisitions, this replacement ratio would be 131%.</p>
          <p>Low prices in Canada for natural gas during the year was the predominant driver of the negative revision of 299 million barrels of oil equivalent, in fact, it's over 90% of that number. With this transition behind us, we're going to move into 2013 with our initial capital budget set at $10.5 billion which is essentially flat with our &#x2013; 2% year-over-year from 2012. Our capital allocation for 2013 really reflects our choice to deliver competitive near-term performance while building balanced long-term value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Approximately $4 billion of our capital will be invested in on shore U.S. where we expect production to grow in excess of 20% in 2013 driven primarily by our Permian and Central region drilling programs. We also project our North American oil production to grow by 14% in 2013, which is up from 12% in 2012. Furthermore, our 2013 plan calls for $2.2 billion investments in ten year long &#x2013; in ten long year (sic) [ten long-term] infrastructure projects, which represents nearly 21% of our total 2013 capital.</p>
          <p>As a result of this capital allocation choice, and taking into consideration production declines in certain of our regions, we expect total production to grow by 3% to 5% in 2013. Just for comparison purposes, and using our budgeted economics, if we instead use this long term capital investment to fund additional drilling in the onshore U.S., our projected 2013 growth rate would be in excess of 6%.</p>
          <p>Based on our current ownership of these long term projects, these projected are expected to contribute 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day over the next five years and over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent by the end of the decade. As a result of our two major LNG projects, production for our development pipeline is expected to continue to increase over 200,000 barrels of oil a day, before settling into a zero decline multi-decade plateau.</p>
          <p>We have built this company by focusing on returns, balance and long-term value. Over the last three years we have deepened and strengthened our portfolio, we now have over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent on book resource in our Permian and Midcontinent positions that is second to none. We have a robust project pipeline in motion that will provide a stable base of free cash flow for decades and we have broad exposure to quality resource and exploration opportunities around the world.</p>
          <p>Our broader and deeper footprint provides us the opportunity to optimize our portfolio and as such, we're in the process of identifying approximately $2 billion of asset rationalizations to be completed during 2013. We're not in a position to get into specific details at this time but having acquired $16 billion of assets over the past three years, and strengthening our asset base we have been in the process of reviewing our overall portfolio.</p>
          <p>We are here for one purpose and that is to generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders and we truly believe we can continue on that mission.</p>
          <p>Finally, another important item of note is that last week our board approved increasing our common dividend by 18% from $0.17 to $0.20 per share. This follows our increase from 2012 of 13%. We remain confident in Apache's ability to continue growing profitably and see dividend growth as an important component of shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>With that I'll hand it over to Rod Eichler, our COO.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon.</p>
          <p>As Brady previously mentioned, we have compiled an operations supplement for your use which highlights our activities by region during the fourth quarter. We have put this together in an effort to be responsive to feedback we have received and hope you find it useful. In the supplement we have provided detailed operational information for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We'd also like to highlight some of our most notable achievements during 2012. First there is our growth in the U.S. Onshore through drilling. Combined, our Permian and Central regions grew production nearly 24% year-over-year and represent over 25% of Apache's total global production by the fourth quarter at 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As impressive as these results are, the reality is we're just in the early stages of our growth as each region evolves into full scale development.</p>
          <p>In the Permian and Central alone, we have identified over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resource potential to further fuel our liquids rich gas and oil production growth going forward. In addition we're in the process of completing our resource assessment in Canada of our liquids rich gas and oil opportunities. With approximately 7 billion gross acres in the western Canadian sedimentary basin we anticipate identifying several thousand economic wells in our various plays, which should allow us to add another North American onshore growth region as we ramp up activity over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>We also successfully integrated the Beryl properties into our North Sea region then spent the last year preparing for a drilling campaign that will test new opportunities based on the first 3D seismic acquired over these fields since 1998.</p>
          <p>Finally, we replaced over 130% of our production through the drill bit and approximately 156% when you include acquisitions. This obviously excludes the impact of negative revisions which primarily resulted from the weak North American natural gas prices during 2012 versus 2011.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead I want to focus the remainder of my remarks on our plans for this coming year. The plans are based upon our initial $10.5 billion allocation of capital, which Steve has mentioned, includes $2.2 billion for long term projects not expected to generate production until 2014 and beyond.</p>
          <p>In 2013 we expect our U.S. Onshore regions to grow production in excess of 20%, predominantly consisting of liquids growth. We also expect our investment to increase production in the North Sea and our drilling program in Egypt to increase our gross production in that region. However we expect moderate production declines in Canada and Argentina, double digit declines in Australia and deepwater due to future timing of our next development projects coming on line and a double digit decline in the Gulf of Mexico shelf due to natural field declines.</p>
          <p>We are currently running 122 rigs worldwide and expect to average a similar amount over the course of the year. We plan to drill more wells in 2013 than 2012 with an estimated total of nearly 1600 wells. Almost two-thirds of all planned wells will be drilled in the Permian and Anadarko Basins of the U.S. and are expected to generate fully loaded after tax rates of return in excess of 20% at plan commodity prices.</p>
          <p>Our financial supplement posted on our website outlines Apache's 2013 initial exploration and development capital allocation by region on page 10.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our region highlights. The Permian region produced nearly 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter with 74% liquids, constituting nearly 15% of our total production. In addition we replaced over 260% of our production in the Permian through drilling activities during 2012, excluding price related revisions and ended the year with 800 million barrels of proved reserves, 28% of our total.</p>
          <p>In 2013 we'll further exploit our vast 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent net resource position with plans to drill over 700 wells running an average of 34 rigs and investing nearly $2.4 billion of capital. We will significantly ramp up our horizontal activity in the basin. We are currently running 13 horizontal rigs and a total of 38 rigs and anticipate increasing our horizontal rig count to 17 by the end of the first quarter. As such, nearly 180 of the 2013 wells will be horizontal versus 104 horizontal wells in 2012.</p>
          <p>We will build upon our successful horizontal program in 2012 by increasing our Wolfcamp shale and Cline shale developments and will be focused on driving down drilling and completion costs as we move towards development mode to further optimize our returns. We have already successfully delineated 10 horizontal plays across the region. This year it was our target to test an additional 20 horizons. In the Midland Basin we'll continue our successful vertical program in the Fusselman, Wolfwood and Wolfberry plays within Deadwood and other areas. On the Central Basin Platform we plan to drill additional Grayburg, Clearfork and Wichital-Albany/Abo horizontal wells and <mark type="ph" /> to test in the (14:49) Strawn and Mississippian zones.</p>
          <p>In the Yeso play in southeast New Mexico we will continue to drill vertical wells but will begin our first horizontal program in the Cedar Lake area.</p>
          <p>In the Delaware Basin where we already have successfully drilled the second Bone Spring horizontal, we're trying to test it in the first quarter and also drill a horizontal well in Wolfcamp. We will be actively testing the vertical Wolfbone within this emerging area for us.</p>
          <p>Finally, since we see the number of questions regarding our Permian realizations, I wanted to mention that we successfully negotiated a five year contract to sell crude that is then transported to the Gulf Coast via pipeline. The terms of this contract are confidential but should allow us to receive favorable pricing for this oil. These volumes will ramp up over the next several quarters and at full capacity we will sell up to 20,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Central region, the region produced approximately 79,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. This is a 9.6% increase over third quarter 2012 production and over 38% on an annualized basis. Just as significantly, we increased our oil production by 24% in the fourth quarter versus third quarter to 21,000 barrels of oil per day which represents 27% of total region production.</p>
          <p>Total liquids production increased by 24% to 31,000 barrels of oil per day or approximately 39% of total region production. Further we replaced over 340% of our production in the Central region through drilling activities during 2012 excluding price related revisions and nearly 645% when you include the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>For 2013, we will continue to accelerate activity as we plan to ramp up our drilling across our extensive acreage position in the Anadarko and Whittenburg Basins. We will further exploit our vast 5.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent net resource position with plans to drill nearly 300 wells, up from 192 wells in 2012, while running an average of 29 rigs, of which 28 are horizontal, and investing nearly $1.4 billion in capital. About a third of our program will target the prolific liquids rich Granite Wash with another quarter targeting the oilier Tonkawa. Rigs will also work the Cleveland, Marmaton, Cottage Grove and Canyon Wash.</p>
          <p>Apache has 11 lower Marmaton tests planned for 2013 with a total of 90 resource locations identified. 17 vertical Canyon Wash wells are currently planned for 2013 with expectations that we will commence water flooding in the Wash and begin a horizontal program in the Canyon Lime later in the year. After integrating our Cordillera acquisition and further delineating our acreage over the past year we expect to be able to drive down drilling and completion times and costs as we optimize our development program.</p>
          <p>In our Gulf Coast Onshore region we intend to average three operated and one non-operated drilling rigs during 2013 and anticipate we'll drill 39 wells. At Atchafalaya Bay we anticipate our drilling activity will increase gross production from the field to 155 million cubic feet of gas per day from 140. Phase 2 of this facility expansion from the Atchafalaya Bay Field to Belle Isle will be completed during the first quarter, and startup of phase 3 will commence, but should be completed late in the second quarter, bringing the capacity of the Atchafalaya Bay system to 222 million cubic feet of gas per day from 155.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, we plan to drill over 30 wells as we exploit low-risk, liquids-rich prospects. We will also work to expand our inventory of permanent drill prospects and acquire additional wide azimuth 3D seismic as we apply deepwater technology to the shelf to enhance subsalt imaging and identify previously overlooked prospects.</p>
          <p>In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico we have grown our position to 166 blocks and approximately 900,000 acres and have identified dozens of prospects to sustain an active exploration program for many years. In 2013, we plan to drill three operated exploration wells and four one-off development wells. We have two rigs under contract <mark type="ph" /> with full prospects, at Saint Marcus in (18:56) Mississippi Canyon 93; <mark type="ph" /> Starlight in (19:00), Green Canyon 230, 274; and Guadalupe in Mississippi Canyon 554, 555. We are moving forward with a partner operated <mark type="ph" /> project (19:08) for Lucius and Heidelberg and expect to invest $200 million for our share of four wells in these two developments during 2013.</p>
          <p>In Canada our 2013 program includes over 150 wells with a focus on oil and liquids rich gas opportunities and horizontal exploitation in the Sparky, Bluesky, Beaverhill Lake, Dunvegan and Viking oil plays. We also intend to test the Montney and the Duvernay within our substantial acreage positions in these plays.</p>
          <p>Our 2013 plan in Australia totals nearly $1.9 billion and includes drilling 16 wells, six of which are for exploration. Mid-year the partner operated Macedon gas project will be complete and will add approximately 35 million cubic feet of gas per day of net production. But the real focus in Australia continues to be the long-term growth we will realize from the pipeline of development projects we have lined up over the next several years. This includes the Julimar Wheatstone LNG development project, the Coniston and Balnaves oil projects, the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:10) and Upper Pyrenees projects and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:14) gas compression project. Total capital dedicated to these projects in 2013 exceeds $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Coniston oil development, in order to prepare the Ningaloo Vision FPSO for its increase throughput capacity, Apache has reviewed all requirements for planned maintenance and has scheduled the vessel to go offline to the shipyard in the first quarter of 2014. This time it will take advantage of the 2014 cyclone season window that would normally see some weather-related downtime thus optimizing production for 2013.</p>
          <p>Turning to Egypt, our operations continue uninterrupted. This asset remains a highly profitable piece of the Apache portfolio and as such we plan to make a similar investment in 2013 as we did in 2012. This will allow us to drill over 270 wells including over 60 exploration wells. Our drilling program will focus on <mark type="indiscernible" />, <mark type="indiscernible" />, (21:08) Jurassic and AEB targets. They are also looking to further test the use of horizontals in the region. Based upon our level of investment combined with <mark type="ph" /> Heedman (21:18) field now online, we expect <mark type="ph" /> growth (21:20) production in Egypt to be slightly higher in 2013.</p>
          <p>For the North Sea, we plan to drill 27 wells of which 24 will be operated, including 11 new wells at Forties and at least 6 at Beryl. We also plan to drill a third well at Bacchus in the first quarter. In 2013 we will install and commission the FASP topside and commence drilling operations. Two wells will be drilled at FASP in 2013. Apache will acquire 307 square kilometer 4D seismic survey of the Forties and Bacchus fields commencing in July and complete the acquisition of the Beryl 3D seismic survey which began in the summer of 2012.</p>
          <p>In Argentina our investment level will be consistent with recent years as we aim to invest within the region's cash flow. We plan to drill an additional 20 wells during year, 16 of which will be Apache operated focusing on Gas Plus wells as well as continued Vaca Muerte exploration activities.</p>
          <p>Finally, with respect to our new venture activities, we continue to evaluate the well data we have collected from our Bakken and Mississippian Lime exploration wells and we'll provide further detail in the future with respect to our path forward in these areas including any development plans.</p>
          <p>In Alaska we're in the final stages of drilling our first onshore well and expect to complete it in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In Surinam we've signed a 3D seismic acquisition contract for a 2,100 square kilometer survey over our Block 53 and expect to commence seismic operations in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>One last item of note before I turn the call over to Tom Chambers. Due to Cyclone Noel offshore Australia and other weather related events in Australia, planned plus unplanned facility downtime in the Gulf thus far this year, we expect first quarter 2013 production to be down versus fourth quarter 2012. However we have already incorporated this downtime into our 2013 production guidance.</p>
          <p>That concludes the operational highlights and now I'll turn it over to Tom Chambers.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>While 2012 provided plenty of challenges, we finished the fourth quarter strong, averaging 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, boosting us to record production for the year and fueling record oil and gas revenues in our second best cash flow year ever. Production which averaged 779,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day was up 4% from the prior year and up almost 5.5% adjusted for dispositions as Steve indicated. More importantly, record oil production of 352,000 barrels per day combined with record oil price realizations drove cash from operations before working capital items to $10.2 billion for the year and a record $2.8 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas revenues of $16.9 billion were slightly higher than 2011 and we achieved a new record in spite of average North American natural gas prices falling over 30%. We continued to benefit from our portfolio with WTI crude prices currently over 28 times the price of North American gas. Having 72% of our oil production priced at Brent or Brent comparable indexes, which continues to realize substantial premiums to WTI, also enhances our results.</p>
          <p>Our international natural gas portfolio continues to have a positive revenue impact by providing increasing volumes to markets with gas prices significantly higher than North America, particularly Argentina, Australia, and the UK grid. For the fourth consecutive quarter international gas price realizations outpaced those in North America. In 2012 international gas price realizations increased 13% compared to the prior year and at $4.15, they were 47% higher than those realized in North America excluding hedging.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings for 2012, as you heard, we reported earnings of $1.9 billion or $4.92 per share despite the impact of several key non-recurring items. Our results include prior quarter non-cash property write-downs in Canada totaling $1.4 billion after tax, directly related to collapsing Canadian natural gas prices. We had a number of other charges that impacted our results for the year, including $226 million of deferred tax charges, a $118 million tax adjustment in the UK related to decommissioning discussed in the third quarter, a $51 million charge for derivative mark-to-market and $19 million merger and acquisition charges.</p>
          <p>When we remove these items for comparability purposes, we earned $3.8 billion or $9.48 per share, down from 2011's $4.7 billion and $11.83 per share. A detailed breakout of all our financials including adjusted earnings and cash flow from operations can be found in the financial supplement located on our website.</p>
          <p>The bottom line though, is margins and we have been able to sustain strong cash margins at $42.86 per barrel of oil equivalent, down just 6% from 2011. Margins were impacted by a 3% reduction in commodity price realization and a rise in our lease operating expenses. Current year repairs, maintenance and plant turnarounds directly impacted our LOE by almost $0.40 per BOE, predominantly related to the Grand Isle 43 corrosion repair and Canadian plant turnarounds.</p>
          <p>In addition, with continued growth in our Onshore North American operations, our labor costs have increased as well. Our operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are also impacted by the location of our properties. Oil properties are inherently more expensive than natural gas properties to operate, as are offshore properties. With 51% of our 2012 production oil and liquids and approximately one-third of our production located in offshore areas, our costs run higher than many of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Total cash costs during the year averaged $17.06 per barrel of oil equivalent, up $0.82 over last year. For 2013 cash costs absent price dependent production tax are projected in the $14 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent range. We remain focused on cash margins and continue to monitor our costs trends in all areas in addition to reviewing our capital spending to ensure we focus on the highest rate of return projects.</p>
          <p>Our ability to sustain margins allows us to generate a robust $10 billion of operating cash flow that funded our largest E&amp;D capital budget ever. In addition to our organic cash flow generation we were able to successfully issue $5 billion of new debt this year at all in cost of 3.6%. $3 billion in April of 5, 10 and 30-year tranches used to fund the cash portion of the Cordillera purchase price and repay maturing debt and an additional $2 billion in December of 10 and 31-year notes with record low coupons, allowing us to take advantage of continuing low rates to term up floating rate debt and increase our overall liquidity.</p>
          <p>Our successful E&amp;D capital program with its focus on U.S. drilling added 372 million barrels of oil equivalent to proved reserves during 2012. That's over 130% of what we produced during the year at a finding cost of a little over $24 per barrel. At first blush that might seem high but I'd like to point out that our 2012 spending included over $500 million of facilities capital plus nearly $1.5 billion for leasehold and seismic purchases that, while not on the cost side, do not &#x2013; while in the cost side, do not immediately result in reserve additions. Excluding this spending, finding costs would have been very competitive.</p>
          <p>While the seismic and leasehold purchases were very large last year, we do not see that trend continuing in 2013, however, these expenditures, while seemingly a drag on finding costs now, will provide a large benefit in the future setting the foundation for future growth.</p>
          <p>Reserve adds through acquisition totaled 73 million barrels of oil equivalent bringing total adds to 156% of 2012 production. Unfortunately low North American gas prices were primarily responsible for negative price revisions totaling 299 million barrels of oil equivalent, the majority in Canada. I would point out with gas prices rebounding somewhat in the second half of the year, the negative revisions were halted after the third quarter and virtually all those reserves remain in the ground available to be produced if and when prices and economic conditions warrant.</p>
          <p>Turning to income taxes for a moment, the adjusting items mentioned earlier also impacted our 2012 effective tax rate, moving it up to 59%. If you adjust for these onetime charges, our tax rate would have been a more typical 44%. As mentioned earlier, 2013 will be another active drilling year and balancing our capital allocation and ensuring capital availability are key.</p>
          <p>Because our cash flows are heavily influenced by oil realizations, we have recently entered into financial derivative contracts on 125,000 barrels a day of oil for calendar year 2013, using a combination of WTI and Brent swaps representing about one-third of our worldwide oil production based on our fourth quarter of 2012 volumes. Our average combined hedge price is approximately $98 per barrel. We have not entered into any new gas hedges and our international gas portfolio exposure helps mitigate our North American price risk.</p>
          <p>In closing, we had a solid year of production, revenues, cash flows, resulting from our active drilling program. We have built a very strong foundation for cash flow generation and support both for our ongoing drilling program and our inventory of longer-term development projects as we head into 2013.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to turn the call back over to Brady.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Steve, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the overall production. In October you guys updated the market and you were about at 800,000 barrels a day in overall production. There in the quarter despite some pretty strong gains in the U.S. Onshore and you're guiding down now for Q1. So the sense is you're losing a little bit of operating momentum outside of the U.S., I was wondering if you can just comment on that and just the overall shift to a little bit of a lower growth rate in 2013, notwithstanding the changes in capital allocation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; to be real frank, to hold on 800,000 barrels a day for a quarter, we were very proud of that frankly because we have never hit that from where we were.</p>
          <p>In terms of going into 2013, the first quarter we're affected by a hurricane &#x2013; I mean a cyclone in Australia. I will tell you though, we put that down time in our 3% to 5% growth projection. There is no doubt that we have some properties that are declining. But we're going to more than make up for it in the Permian and the Anadarko Basin this year. And we're pretty &#x2013; we're pretty confident about the long-term value of our Canadian assets also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just I was wondering if you could comment, has there been any change in the way you're thinking about &#x2013; I know guidance is relatively new to Apache, thinking about the long term. Are y'all changing your approach, i.e., maybe trying to guide to a P-90 type of case versus maybe P-50, differently? Just trying to see if there's been any change in the way you're thinking about guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are new to this. I have to be real honest with you. One thing we don't want to do is miss our guidance. And we're going to spend quite a bit of money internationally and if you remember what Rod said, $1.5 billion of that $2.2 billion is going to Australia. The biggest chunk of that is Junimar, Brunello and Wheatstone LNG facility which is now over 80% contracted. And those are tied to oil-link prices so when that comes on we're going to see about over 25,000 barrels a day for the next 25 years.</p>

          <p>Steve, I wanted to get a little color, you mentioned about the possibility of maybe divesting around $2 billion worth of assets for that 3% to 5% production growth guidance for 2013. Does that guidance already include the potential sale of those assets if there's production? Or would the guidance potentially need to be adjusted after a sale?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then my follow-up would be on service costs specifically in the Permian and then in your Central region. Just curious as you look at 2013 and compare it to 2012 how do you see service costs trending, do you think prices are bottoming? And are there any areas of services right now where they're a little bit tight in either one of those regions?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The service costs in both areas are flat to declining. We see that specifically we see that in the Permian, with very large increases in number of frac stimulation companies. As a result that's provided a specific downward pressure on the price and in fact, we have seen 30% drop in frac spread costs compared to 2012 and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:42) we'll probably expect to see even more decline in our side from using more self-sourcing of sand and chemicals in 2013 which will allow us to further reduce those stimulation costs. Same thing on rig rates, rig rates are much more favorable than they were. We have seen a 5% to 7% decline in rig rates for the mechanical rigs, the 1000hp rigs we use to drill the vertical wells at Deadwood as an example. We expect to see continued downward pressure on those as well.</p>

          <p>This is Roger, just one little bit of comment on the sales. We're going to identify exactly what it is we're going to sell but not everything necessarily would have current production. For example, the assets that we sold to Chevron, I guess, last week, we collected $400 million on, there's no production associated with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the Permian, you said in your ops report that you spud 22 horizontal wells with 463 frac stages. Are you going to be increasing the frac densities at all? Because it averages about 20 a well. Just curious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends a lot on what zone or unconventional target that we're after in terms of the optimal frac concentration. We have a lot of efforts underway right now that are very area specific to try to optimize the amount of frac stages and a large number is not necessarily the optimum number and we're trying to find out in certain areas. So we expect to see overall improvements in both the cost and the efficiency of our frac treatment programs in both Permian and Central as we go forward in 2013 based on a lot of the benchmarking we're doing to become a best in class operator in these areas we're drilling horizontal completions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry I'm having trouble here with the phone. But in Egypt you talked about winning in a recent round of bidding, you won a couple of leases and there's going to be a new PSC contract. I'm just wondering if we should read anything into that, or is that the direction of &#x2013; that we should expect the contracts to go in Egypt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing I would say is they have continual posting of leases in Egypt, concessions in Egypt that people bid on. The most significant thing about that &#x2013; the latest bid rounds were, they were very similar to all of the other concessions that we've got in the western desert. So there weren't any term changes in terms of what they had asked for in the latest bid round.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your expectation for this contract is it's going to look just like &#x2013; just like it did last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's always &#x2013; cost recovery goes from 35% to 40%, but in terms of directionally, it's pretty much the same as all our concessions across the western desert.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of the long term potential, there is definitely a tremendous amount of hydrocarbons there. Being able to do that and the magnitude that it takes over the timeframe that it takes, we decided that that wasn't in our best interest. And you're going to see that when we talk about our assets sales. The real thing, we now have some long term projects that have some significant doability and significant potential. So we're going to have to balance off our long term and our short term in terms of being able to grow both &#x2013; long term but also be able to grow short term.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On one of the comments you mentioned that 72%, I believe of your oil is linked to Brent or Brent equivalents. Can you provide any perspective on how you see price differentials playing out between Brent and WTI, Brent and LLS and also Midland Cushing going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; Brent is the world price and when you look at what &#x2013; 5% of oil is traded at WTI prices. So what you have is, is you have a bottleneck in certain areas. Certainly west Texas is one of them. There's an awful lot of people trying to solve that problem. I think Tom or Rod pointed out that we have an equity interest or a throughput interest in a pipeline that we're going to start and there are going to be more and more of those. My personal opinion is that I think those numbers will come &#x2013; and it's not going to be in the next 18 months, but over time they're going to &#x2013; that spread is going to shallow. I mean, I just think that's not attainable forever.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon, everybody. Hopefully you can hear me okay. I've got a couple of questions if I may. Steve, clearly this is a bit of a change from what you told us at the Analyst Day last year. Can you help us understand, is this move away from the drill target in 2013 a move away from the long-term growth target as well? In other words, are you abandoning now the 6% to 12% target you laid out? And if so, if you could help us to understand what's changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. In fact it's not. If you look at our asset base, it really is based on what our capital allocation is this year. If you look at the amount of production that we are developing it should help us in terms of attaining that &#x2013; actually we're at 6% to 9% if you don't include gas. If we see gas go up, we could drill more gas wells. But right now 6% to 9%, we're still looking at that from a long term basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. <mark type="ph" /> And (46:54) you had kind of signaled that if you tempered gas, that would be the number so I appreciate that. My follow-up is really on the asset sales. Forgive me if I'm wrong here, but it sounds like you haven't quite identified what the assets are or have you? Is this a bottom up process or are you saying $2 billion is a number and then trying to make that fit? Where I'm going with this is how big ultimately does that disposal process get, because clearly you're extremely asset rich and you're obviously not getting a lot of credit for it on the share price? I'll leave it at that, thanks.</p>

          <p>Doug, I didn't &#x2013; in terms of, certainly we have considered assets that we may sell. In terms of specifics and our pricing we &#x2013; I mean, we have also scoped order of magnitude of the pricing. But we're really not in a position at the present time to talk about which one of those asset bases it would be. All of them will not include current production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to go back to your question about are we abandoning the long term. Really, if you think about what Rod said in that in these long term projects we're spending over $2 billion on this year, they're going to add 150,000 barrels a day and then later 200,000 barrels a day. So those are big needle moving projects where we've got to put capital over a number of years, we don't get near term production growth but when they come on you see a real stair step in our growth.</p>
          <p>So when Steve was talking about the LNG projects, for example, those are very big stair steps that will bring our average rate over the long term back to the kind of range that we're talking about earlier. But in the short term, those are dollars that aren't adding production in 2013.</p>
          <p>The rate of return is great but when you bring them online, especially those LNG projects, they don't deplete. So they're very enticing.</p>

          <p>Just two quick questions for me. With limited capital investment in Canada around your gas assets could you give us a little bit of color on how we should think about volume decline? And then a similar question for the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The capital allocation I think we're putting $600 million in Canada, which will be directed. What we've done, just for information, we now have a Kitimat upstream business and we have our base Canadian operations business. And we have two different organizations, just recently set up, one to do nothing but the Horn River and Liard.</p>
          <p>In terms of the base business in terms of our &#x2013; we are really directing that more towards liquids-rich and in terms of what the decline curve is, I don't know. I don't have it. We should see a slight decline but it's not &#x2013; it's not real significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, great. Just a second question for me, in terms of the Permian and the Midland Basin, could you provide a little color how your Cline results have performed to date, how those look against your type curves and how we should think about current well costs? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Cline, we really had some good progress on the Cline. We may have cut six days off the time it takes to drill a Cline horizontal in the Deadwood area. That translates to an average spread rate of about $60,000 a day savings which translates into about $360,000 a well, so that's very significant.</p>
          <p>And then generally speaking, we gave you some information at the Analyst Day last June that it cost us about $7.6 million, and as a result of some of these efficiency improvements and overall cost reductions that I mentioned we should be under $7 million in total well cost in that particular formation. And I think the Cline well results have been posted in the supplement.</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone. If you don't mind too much, I'm going to take one more stab at the guidance question because I think the earlier question maybe got to this a little bit, you have laid out the 3% to 5% overall BOE guidance but it's maybe not that &#x2013; it's not meaningful, it's not apples to apples to replace &#x2013; when you're replacing oil volumes with gas volumes or vice versa, as you guys are. So if you have it in your minds and can share it, do you have an idea of the four pieces of your product mix: North American liquids, North American gas, international liquids international gas, what the individual growth rates on those four would be? You might not have it, but I just thought I'd...</p>

          <p>Okay. You can come back. Another thing, I greatly appreciate all the data on the &#x2013; in the operations supplement you have. Just two those, two things on that if I could ask. One, I saw you guys drilled another really good horizontal in the Central Basin platform in the Permian and I think you're really the only operator who has been doing that. So I'm curious if you're planning on doing a lot &#x2013; much more of that?</p>
          <p>And then the last kind of obscure question that comes from the operations release is, I noticed in the Gulf Coast region, you said you're drilling in Lamar County, Mississippi. I'm wondering if that's a Smackover target or if you're ready to talk about that?</p>

          <p>Well, to answer your first question, I believe you might be referring to our drilling program in our Three Bar Shallow Unit which is a Wichital Albany play I think we mentioned on our last quarter's call. We <mark type="ph" /> continued to drill &#x2013; (53:54) we have five wells drilled and producing there. It's one of our best plays in terms of estimated oil recovery per horizontal well and we have a couple of wells that are currently waiting on completion and we have an additional 12 wells yet to drill in that program, nine of which will be drilled in 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. You talked about some exploration plans in 2013. I think you guys said three Deepwater Gulf wells and six wells in Australia. Could you give us some more information about what type of targets those are and what some of the associated gross potential may be on system of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Australia, the wells are mostly in the Olympus, Bianchi, the general Gorgon trends south &#x2013; just north of the Exmouth Basin area. They're targeting the typical Mungaroo Triassic reservoir objective which we have in other producing areas out there. We had a successful exploration test at Azola about two years ago and we're following up on that.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, as I recall, those specific targets on those prospects I mentioned are probably going to be Middle Miocene.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. I guess additionally, another question on the asset sales, traditionally Apache has been a obviously an acquirer of a lot of assets over the years. Is there any sort of shift in philosophy that you guys are seeing here now that you have announced these asset sales, somewhat I guess prior to specifically identifying it? Are you guys trying to maybe strengthen the balance sheet in response to maybe some capital expenditures coming up in the LNG side over the next couple of years? How are you guys thinking about this, any just philosophical change, curious on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a philosophical standpoint, if you look at where we have come from over the last three years, and you look at the assets that we have acquired, and it's not just here in the last week, but over the last month or two we have been look at our asset base and saying, okay, now which of these asset bases to we want to take forward into the future. We have to make some tough choice. We can't be all things to all people, so we have to make choices to which one of these that we can actually exploit or could somebody else exploit them better? We're still going to be a net buyer if you think about $16 billion and $2 billion, but in terms of just transitioning our asset base, that's what the effort is about.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just picking up on the growth and the asset sales and the acquisitions together, it's interesting to note that the areas that you have that are growing rapidly, the Permian and the Midcontinent are where you have focused your acquisitions over the last couple of years. And so I guess in your interest in achieving your 6% to 9%, the guidance longer term, there are various ways you can do it. You can acquire more assets in growthy areas, you can sell assets in producing areas that have little growth or you can just wait it out, as Rod described, wait until some of these long lead time projects come online. Is it fair to say that it's more of the latter strategy there, just kind of wait things out until the long lead time projects come online and that you've kind of decided on and in that case should 2014 be another year of relatively low growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't put forward our 2014 plan. It really depends how we allocate that capital, Brian and also what our asset base look like. We certainly want to further those long term projects, but we also have to balance &#x2013; what I was suggesting is, we have to balance short term growth with long term growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess, would you consider acquiring in the areas that have become more core to you or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:00) or are acquisitions completely off the table here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the present time we're going to drill wells. So -- that doesn't mean we won't pick up an acre or two around some place but in terms of making major acquisitions in new &#x2013; in our existing core areas or new core areas, that's not something that's part of our strategy right now.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question.
