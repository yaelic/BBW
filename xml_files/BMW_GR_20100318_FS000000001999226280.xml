          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are on time. It's 10 o'clock. Good morning and I hope you all had a good night after our dinner event yesterday evening. I would like to welcome you all to the Financial Analyst Meeting of BMW AG for the business year 2009.</p>
          <p>For those of you who don't know me, my name is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl and I am responsible for Corporate Affairs and Politics of the BMW Group. So the winter is gone for good, hopefully, and spring is at our door. So thank you very much for joining us today.</p>
          <p>A few technical details; Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management and the Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, Board Member for Finance, will be speaking to you about the company's business and financial performance in 2009. Then we have enough time for our Q&amp;A session. Afterwards, you are all invited to join us for lunch.</p>
          <p>So that's all from my side. First, Dr. Reithofer, the podium is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I can say the most important people are amongst you, for example, Mr. Ritesh. I think you all know him. Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see here, we are creating the future and we are on the path towards profitable growth. In line with our strategy Number ONE, we moved the company's strategic realignment forward during the 2009 crisis.</p>
          <p>We have sharpened our profile as a sustainable company. We have launched attractive new models. We have invested in our sites, in new engine technologies and in future projects. We have cut costs significantly and today, we are a leaner and more powerful company than ever before. We have created a new and emotional design language for our cars. And our technology package, Efficient Dynamics, is the best in the industry, combining maximum performance with minimum fuel consumption.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we set in motion our strategy Number ONE with a clear vision. In 2020, we will be the leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility.</p>
          <p>An important milestone in this effort is meeting our profitability targets for 2012. In the current business year 2010, we will take a significant step to reach this milestone. We plan to post Group earnings significantly above the 2009 level and we expect growth in the solid one-digit percentage range with over 1.3 million cars.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to highlight the following: First, what did we do to succeed in 2009? Second, why is the BMW Group on the right track towards future growth? When we met here last year, I told you that 2009 would be a transition year with two priorities: crisis management in the short-term, and investing in our future success in the long-term.</p>
          <p>Today, I have to say we are very proud, our fixed costs are lower than in 2005. We also managed to cut material costs dramatically, thanks to our ability to increase scalability efficiencies in our processes. These changes have been implemented in collaboration with our suppliers and partners.</p>
          <p>We have always made continuous quality improvement a priority. From our perspective, quality is a key aspect of our customer focus. As a premium car company, we constantly strive to improve standards. Despite the economic crisis, we continued to invest in our future.</p>
          <p>First off, we invested in new technologies, such as hybrid and electric motors, as well as Efficient Dynamics, an area in which we managed to extend our lead further. We also have invested in our production plants, mainly in Germany, in the United States and China and in November 2009, we announced our strong commitment to China as a production location.</p>
          <p>We are going to expand our capacities in Shenyang from a little over 41,000 units to over 100,000 units and together with our partner, Brilliance, we will invest a total of almost &#x20AC;600 million. As a result, we will be able to produce up to 300,000 cars at the Shenyang plant in the long term. In January and February 2010 alone, we doubled our sales volume in China compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Customer focus, you know that is the core of our basic principles at the BMW Group. Chinese BMW owners mostly ride with a chauffeur. This is why, as early as this year, we will present a long version of the new BMW 5 Series exclusively developed for the Chinese market. We took the right actions to steer the company successfully through a challenging year. You are already familiar with the key data.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we posted pre-tax Group earnings of &#x20AC;413 million, up 17.7% from the previous year. All in all, we sold close to 1.29 million cars. We stood our ground as the world's leading manufacturer of premium cars and further increased our market share in the premium segment. And our sales volume increased significantly in January and February 2010. Due to various model changes, March will be weaker than the previous months.</p>
          <p>A few remarks about BMW Motorcycle. In 2009, we delivered a total of 87,300 BMW</p>
          <p>motorcycles to customers, down 14% from 2008. Current sales figures are showing an upward trend in sales, with an increase of almost 25% from February 2009.</p>
          <p>Our shareholders and investors have remained loyal to us despite the difficult and volatile environment. We believe shareholders should share in company's performance and the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend for the same amount as 2008 at the Annual General Meeting.</p>
          <p>The positive development of BMW ordinary shares, which were traded 47% higher at year-end than in the beginning of 2009, demonstrates the confidence the capital market has in the company's future. In 2009, we have once again showed that BMW stock is a sound and, I would like to highlight, long-term investment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the second topic, why is the BMW Group on the right track for future success? We are really putting the pedal to the metal this year when it comes to new products. From October 2009 to December 2010, we will launch 17 new or updated BMW, MINI or Rolls-Royce models.</p>
          <p>And for us, of course, very important, the new BMW 5 Series Sedan is the start of a new era for the BMW Group. The 5 Series is not only an image driver, but also a strong contributor to Group sales and revenue. It is with this new model that we were able to harness also newly gained efficiencies in our production process and modular system.</p>
          <p>Next year, the 5 Series will also be available as a full hybrid. In April this year, the first BMW hybrid models will come on the market and of course they represent the state-of-the-art BMW ActiveHybrid technology. In the future, we will select the optimal hybrid solution for each model from our module system.</p>
          <p>Developing Innovations is part of our DNA, and this is not going to change. Our innovative strength helps us to tap new growth potential for the company. And again and again, we present our customers with new offerings.</p>
          <p>In the future, we will generate growth both in the large model segments and in the compact and sub-compact segments. We will launch more MINI and BMW models and variants, also in the small car segment. This segment is bound to grow further and we will take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
          <p>We are exploring the possibility of developing a joint architecture for the front and four-wheel drive systems of these cars. In other words, there will be a front-wheel drive BMW in the small class segment in the future. We all know that the cost structure in the small car segment is different from that of the larger model classes, but we intend to grow profitably in this segment as well, because there is one element that applies to the entire process chain. We will increasingly apply modules to various models and brands and this approach enables us to cut costs further, without compromising top quality.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, premium is also defined through sustainability. Customers are currently testing the MINI E for us. And BMW will follow suit in 2011 with a customer test fleet based on the concept study BMW Concept ActiveE. This test fleet will be built at the Leipzig plant.</p>
          <p>The average emission of our European new-car fleet is only 150 grams per kilometer, equaling a fuel consumption of 5.9 liters per 100 kilometers. And it's important, I think, for all of us and what's even more amazing is the performance of our cars achieve with these low emissions, on average 170 horsepower or 125 kilowatt. And we plan to reduce fleet carbon emission worldwide by at least another 25% between 2008 and 2020.</p>
          <p>However, ecological responsibility as an automaker is only met if we maintain a sustainable production system as well. And I mean, you all know, 2009 marked the fifth consecutive year the BMW Group was named the World's Most Sustainable Automaker by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. And, I have to say it here, BMW will continue to be a sporty-inspired brand. We at the BMW Group continue to deliver maximum performance, taking new challenges and compete on a level playing field.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, growth will pick up in key automotive markets such as the United States of America and China this year. Nevertheless, I have to say the effects of crisis will persist and continue to define our business for quite some time. Although the competition will remain fierce, we at the BMW Group are all motivated and ready to rise to the challenge.</p>
          <p>We have two priorities in 2010, profitability and shaping our future. Here is a perfect example, the BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics and I said to my people, I like the car. I hope you know what it means, if I say I like the car. That means the day will come, I will drive the car, another concept car. Our Megacity Vehicle will also be fascinating. This innovative car will be built at our Leipzig plant, our future Center for E-Mobility Production.</p>
          <p>Two Bavarian locations are also involved in this project: Wackersdorf and Landshut. Our efforts will make sustainable mobility possible in urban environments. I mean, this car will not be for an urban environment, you should know. I mean, you should try it on the Autobahn or somewhere else, but it's definitely not a good car for the city. You can drive it as well in the city, but if you would like to feel the performance, the Autobahn is better.</p>
          <p>In line with our corporate philosophy, the energy demand for producing carbon fiber will come from hydropower. We are currently looking for a suitable location in North America to set up our joint venture plant, our joint venture plant with the SGL Group.</p>
          <p>Acting sustainably now will pay off in the future. So BMW Group is clearly leading the way. In early March, the BMW Group was ranked as the most admired automotive company in the world by Fortune Magazine. You can be certain we have a clear path forward. We will remain an independent company that takes a long-term approach and acts in the best interest of all stakeholders. And this year marks a turning point toward long-term profitability, and we remain focused on achieving our 2012 targets.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer. You can give me the orders for this car, afterwards, we could discuss this. Thank you for your clear statement and now, Friedrich Eichiner.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to BMW's press conference on last year's results. Let me start by making two statements regarding our business performance in 2009. First, as planned, we posted positive earnings in 2009. They were actually in the triple-digit-million euro range. Second, our automotive segment closed the fourth quarter successfully, we achieved a turnaround.</p>
          <p>There were two major reasons for this. One was our resolute crisis and financial management. Another was the fact that we benefited from the efficiency measures taken as part of our strategy Number ONE. We continued our extensive cost initiatives. This enabled us not only to avoid a loss, but also to improve our Group's profit before tax compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>We managed the global economic crisis better than many of our competitors and we used this time to prepare thoroughly for the years ahead. In addition, we improved our cost position. This brings me to the financials.</p>
          <p>I will focus on key figures. Further details are in the annual report in front of you. The Group's profit before tax was clearly positive. It amounted to &#x20AC;413 million. This is proof of our robust planning and foresight. We succeeded in mastering the challenges posed by the crisis.</p>
          <p>Our early production and retail sales management were successful, despite a difficult market environment. Efficiencies from our strategy Number ONE also made a positive contribution to earnings. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are proposing a dividend of &#x20AC;0.30 per share of common stock and &#x20AC;0.32 per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting.</p>
          <p>As was the case what year, the dividend payment totals &#x20AC;197 million. We will thus distribute the major part of the annual profit of the BMW AG to our shareholders. The Group's profit before tax was clearly positive in the fourth quarter, totaling to &#x20AC;334 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Automotive segment, our EBIT in the fourth quarter was a positive &#x20AC;93 million. We managed to return to profitability in this segment as well, benefiting from the market's increasingly stable environment and our comprehensive efficiency measures. The Automotive segment's EBIT totaled minus &#x20AC;265 million as of December 31. Despite the positive trend in the fourth quarter, we were unable to fully offset the losses incurred in the first nine month.</p>
          <p>Currency effect had an added negative impact of &#x20AC;194 million compared to the prior year. Most of all, this reflected the deterioration in the exchange rates for the euro to the British pound and some emerging market currencies. An additional expense of &#x20AC;324 million was incurred, above all, for voluntary severance agreements and partial retirement contracts. We made extensive use of the latter, because of its benefit to both the company and its employees. Many staff members signed partial retirement contracts, especially in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The decreases in volumes and margins impacted our earnings by &#x20AC;3.3 billion. This was caused in equal parts by the 10% decline in sales and the impact of further competition provoked by the crisis. Just under &#x20AC;380 million in positive effects came from the drop in raw material prices as well as depreciation and amortization compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, measures within the scope of our strategy Number ONE gave us a tailwind. We benefited from measures already implemented in 2009. We reduced our personnel costs to &#x20AC;561 million, primarily as a result of personnel measures taken in 2008. Efficiency measures taken as a part of strategy Number ONE contributed &#x20AC;648 million to earnings in the Automobiles segment. In fact, we reduced fixed cost and the cost of materials significantly.</p>
          <p>To lower fixed costs, we took extensive efficiency and cost-related measures in sales, development and production. Our fixed costs are now lower than they were in 2005. In '09, our cost of materials dropped in large part thanks to the cross-divisional material cost initiative as well as higher economies of scale and synergies in purchasing. We expected to realize further significant savings as a result of efficiency measures in the years ahead, especially in terms of variable costs. The reduction in the cost of manufacturing new models will play a major role.</p>
          <p>As planned, we reduced capital expenditure by optimizing capital employed. Capital expenditure at the Group level were down by more than 700 million, compared to the previous year. The main contributors were measures for the reuse of existing production structures, as well as the increasing use of modular systems and reduced variant complexity. Our CapEx ratio was below 7%. We achieved the targeted ratio for CapEx established in our strategy Number ONE by improving efficiency.</p>
          <p>We tapped synergies in terms of research and development costs as well. By leveraging synergies and making more efficient use of resources, we reduced the cost as well as the R&amp;D ratio, which fell to 4.8%.</p>
          <p>This was in part made possible by the increased use of virtual simulation technologies as well as measures for safeguarding quality standards in recent years. This gave us the additional latitude necessary to develop forward looking technologies, especially, in the field of electric mobility and alternative drives. Most of the development project were accelerated in 2009 to promote cutting-edge technology.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our strategy Number One has led to major structural changes. Of course, we did not anticipate the crisis either, but thanks to our strategy, we had the right measures in place to react quickly. Sufficient liquidity and good access to capital markets were crucial at the head of the crisis. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled &#x20AC;9.4 billion by the end of 2009. This means that we still have a very solid position.</p>
          <p>We will adapt our liquidity for the developments of the world economy and capital market. In the light of the market collapse, we synchronized production and sales immediately and resolutely in 2009. This timely and flexible move benefited our working capital position. Thanks to our free cash flow management, we managed to reduce working capital by some &#x20AC;2.1 billion in the Automotive segment compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted free cash flow in the Automotive segment was just under &#x20AC;1.5 billion at the end of the year. We netted a total &#x20AC;2.2 billion. 1.6 billion was used to fund a further tranche of our German pension obligations and about &#x20AC;600 million from the purchase of current securities. This reshuffling allowed us to obtain improved conditions. Our unadjusted free cash flow amounted to minus 754 million for 2009.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our planning extends beyond here and now. I would like to briefly outline, how we intend to improve our refinancing going forward.</p>
          <p>As announced, we will continue to develop BMW Financial Services strategically. We will transfer more of our financial services operations to our U.S. bank in Utah and BMW Bank Deutschland. We already processed large parts of our North American Financial Services business by our Utah Bank, which we also used to refinance our business. We will increasingly integrate our European Financial Services business in BMW Bank Deutschland.</p>
          <p>On European markets, we will increasingly operate via BMW Bank Deutschland branch offices, which are run under a German banking license. To date, we have only done this in Portugal. December 2009 saw the integration of our Spanish activities into BMW Bank. Other countries will follow successively. By expanding the BMW Bank, we are establishing the prerequisites for optimizing our refinancing via deposits and central bank liquidity. This enables Financial Services to become much more flexible and efficient.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the current business trend observed in the Financial Services business. It posted very positive growth in 2009. It proved itself in a difficult market environment, achieving a profit before tax of &#x20AC;365 million for the year as a whole. The penetration rate posted a marginal increase to 49% in the financial year that just ended.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we adjusted the residual values assumed in our new leases to the market's lower expectations. In so doing we adapted appropriately to changes in market conditions caused by the financial crisis, as well as to the higher volatility presently prevailed in the used car markets. This was done both operatively and in terms of the risk provision. Furthermore, we stepped up market-specific programs for resales via the dealer network.</p>
          <p>The used car market in the U.S.A., Canada and the U.K. posted a general recovery in 2009. They also displayed largely stable development in the second half of the year. Government incentive programs had a negative effect on European used car markets. The market appeared to start bottoming out towards year end. There was no need to accrue additional risk provisions for our leased products inventory in 2009. Positive and negative impacts on earnings largely offset each other. As before, we expect developments on used car markets to remain difficult and variant.</p>
          <p>The credit portfolio was also affected by the financial crisis in 2009. The credit loss ratio for the entire credit portfolio was 0.84% in 2009. It was thus 25 basis points higher than in the previous year. However, it was within the range of 0.78% to 0.85% we had expected. We had already factored a rise in the credit loss ratio into our planning at the beginning of the year. So credit default risk remained higher. The development of the credit default rate will depend on the general economic trend and the rate of unemployment in the markets.</p>
          <p>Our risk management system has proven itself both appropriate and effective, especially in times of crisis. In sum, BMW Financial Services is much more crisis-resistant now and is back on course towards profitability.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I now would like to address the financial year underway. What do we expect? In general, we have a cautiously optimistic view of the future. Like independent market experts, we expect that the premium segment will recover in 2010. We plan to generate robust retail growth in single-digit percentage range for the full year. In our opinion, opportunities for growth will result from the market's anticipated recovery and above all, from our new products.</p>
          <p>Our coming models will make us even more competitive and improve our price position. We have introduced new processes, which will enable us to react more flexible to supply and demand in markets and thereby improve the quality of our earnings. In so doing, we want to substantially strengthen the contribution to earnings made by sales.</p>
          <p>We will benefit from progressive measures taken to improve profitability in terms of both variable and fixed costs once again this year. By taking extensive cost and efficiency-related measures in the last few years, we have made the BMW Group capable of dealing with rapidly changing market conditions.</p>
          <p>Efficiency levels and profitability improvements achieved will be embedded in our processes and structures over the long-term. We aim to markedly improve Group EBT in 2010. We intend to achieve an EBIT margin in the low single-digit percentage range in the Automotive segment. We thus plan to take a major step towards achieving our strategic goals as before, an EBIT margin of eight to 10% and a RoCE of at least 26% in the Automotive segment are our profitability targets for 2012.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we want adjusted free cash flow in the automotive segment to be on the order of last year's level. Retail climbed by a double-digit percentage in the first two months. However, this was largely driven by base effects. In general, we do not yet expect the first quarter to be strong. We expect that retail will experience a seasonally-induced drop compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>The new 5 Series Sedan will be gradually introduced worldwide only starting at the end of March. It will not produce positive effects until later in the year. First quarter earnings will not benefit from the new 5 Series Sedan.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to our efficiency enhancement, we are in a good position. We are benefiting from ongoing activities in line with our strategy Number ONE in all divisions. We continue to focus on creating value and aligning the company to further improve profitability.</p>
          <p>This forms the foundation towards increasing the company's value and provides the path for a successful future.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>From Credit Suisse. I have two questions. The first one is on fuel efficiency improvements in the U.S. When I look at where BMW stands compared to the proposed targets that are kicking in a couple of years, you are clearly suffering from selling small cars which are quite powerful and so you are quite a way below the targets. So what you will do to improve fuel efficiency and how could that impact, firstly, the cost base from shipping more fuel efficient European engines to the U.S. and how do you think your customers will react to be enforced to buy smaller engines, especially in the U.S?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a bit more financial. When I look at your material costs on Page 57, in the annual report, I can see that they haven't really come down relative to Automotive revenues. And so what is it that despite a fall or a tailwind from lower raw material costs, your material costs are just not coming down relative to sales? Is it really that most of your savings have to be spent to more content on fuel efficiency still and when will that change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Arndt. I think we will start with Mr. Reithofer and then Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean first of all the new regulations in the United States of America, as you know, will work from 2016 on and we will have an interims period between 2012 and 2016 in principle, like in the new European Union. And of course, we have to change our product portfolio as well in the United States of America. I mean, at the moment, we are in a thinking process, are four-cylinders as well an option for the United States of America, not just petrol engines, four-cylinder diesel engines as well?</p>
          <p>And if we look into the year 2009 &#x2013; back into the year 2009, if you see for example, the X5, already 17% of all X5s sold in the United States had diesel engines. So we are well on track and we made last week, during one of our board meeting, decisions towards how we will develop diesel engines in the United States and as I said, we have to change our product portfolio. But I would like to add, we will be able to achieve the targets in the United States of America. We don't have the problems of another German car manufacturer in the United States in 2016, so &#x2013; and we are in line with the Obama administration.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the CO2 and profitability, what we try to do in U.S., we try to keep the balance, as in the whole portfolio. We have to do both. We have to invest into the smaller segments and at the same point in time, we try to strengthen the upper segments as well. So that's why cars, the 5 Series GT, X6 and there is more on the way to come with the new 6 series, will help us to strengthen our position there. You have to offset that. That's the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point is what we really are doing, R&amp;D and in purchasing, bringing in our modular systems, using a common shared toolkit for MINI and for example, BMW cars as we explained we would do in the future will help us to come up with a better cost position at the same point in time. So those are the two strategic levers which we like to set in order to come to the profitability we want to see in those markets. The &#x2013; now I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question was material cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Material cost, it's absolutely right what you're saying. You cannot derive it from the measures you mentioned. Material cost, you have to see that we are increasing our mix now with the strong performance in China, but the mix is very high with the introduction of the new 7 series that had the growing volume in '09 and if you look at our revenue per car, you can see that we have a growing mix in 2009, despite the crises.</p>
          <p>And of course, the 7 series is on &#x2013; the material costs are much more expensive than the 3 series. So we have a growing absolute figure to consider, but based on our measures, though, for example, the comparison against the predecessor, we see the improvement in material cost and it's on the level we explained to you, that it's maybe more the realistic measures.</p>
          <p>Now the question, why it's not &#x2013; can you not see it on the bottom line? And of course, there have been other factors in the market offsetting the benefit of the lower material cost and it has to do with the fierce competition and the stress on the pricing area. That's more or less the reason why we cannot see it on the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to follow up there, if you say the argument is mix, then that should have a positive impact on the material cost ratio. I understand that material costs in absolute terms are increasing, but the ratio should at least...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why I said the second. Usually you would see it, but part of our mix improvement was offset by sales allowances and incentive spending and you know that, that is one of the burdens we had to face in the crisis and that was the reason why I said we didn't see everything that we achieved there on the bottom line, because other influences are &#x2013; had offset this positive development on the material cost side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you asked, Mr. Ellinghorst, you asked as well the mix question. I mean for me, it's in such a way normal that I have forgotten to give you that answer. Of course, we will have a mixture as well of battery electric vehicles, hybrids and petrol and diesel engines. And if you see, for example, the BMW 7 Series or BMW X5 or X6 in the future, of course, we have to see those cars as well with hybrid &#x2013; as a hybrid.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and we introduced in the United States of America our so-called Megacity Vehicle to earn gold credits with the Megacity Vehicle, because if you are a large vehicle manufacturer in the United States, you have to earn gold credits to be able to sell your cars in the United States of America. So it will be a mixture between our big cars with hybrids, for example, with six and eight-cylinder engines and we will have petrol and diesel engines and we are in the thinking process to introduce four-cylinder engines as well, as I said.</p>
          <p>But you can have in mind, of course, a vehicle like an X3 with a four-cylinder engine and, of course, we will introduce as you know our battery electric vehicle and we need the mixture. But that does not necessarily mean that we will sell in the United States 50% small cars, but for me, it's absolutely normal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, Jochen Gehrke and then Adam Hull, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Jochen Gehrke, Deutsche Bank. Just three questions on working capital, you reduced 2.2 billion roughly in the year 2009. Now that your business is growing, should we assume that working capital is going to be a drag on cash in 2010?</p>
          <p>And two more strategic or medium-term questions, when you laid out your strategy Number ONE, I think it was back at the end of 2007, you had a plan of being at 6% EBIT margin in 2010 and on 200,000 incremental units, you were planning on going to eight to 10%. Now you are in the single-digit EBIT margin range, you'll still keep eight to 10%, but the volume delta is actually identical, roughly around 200,000 units. What is it, is it really that you're so much more confident on your cost, which seems a multi-billion gap to earlier on plans?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, Dr. Reithofer, you laid out that small cars you want to be profitable. When you introduced the MINI and the 1 Series, your predecessors were equally saying that it's not going to be margin dilutive and you would do it profitably. I think the consequences were a little bit different. What is it that went wrong with the 1 Series profitability compare to earlier on plans and what are you planning to do different when you are pursuing a small car strategy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jochen Gehrke. I think we'll start with Mr. Reithofer and then Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, first of all, you have to see the MINI and the 1-Series BMW as well from a strategic point of view. I mean, if you see the targets in the European Union for example, the CO2 target, then you need small cars to be able to achieve the target. So for us, it was a strategic necessity to keep MINI in the year 2000 (sic) [2009] and to introduce 1 Series BMWs. Otherwise, the option for us was only to pay, because 100% sure we would not be able to achieve the target. So that is the strategic aspect. And we always said, we have to achieve our profitability targets as well with MINI and with 1 Series BMW.</p>
          <p>And I can only tell you with the new 1 Series BMW coming in 2011 and the new 3 Series BMW, we have a lot better cost structure compared to the past. We improved a lot, so &#x2013; and if you see our 1 Series and 3 Series platform, we speak about purchasing volume over lifecycle of about &#x20AC;100 billion. That means it gives us, as well, room to be, as well, from our economies of scale point of view, on the right track. Well, that means from the year 2011 onwards, when we introduce, I'll say it again, the new 1 Series BMW and the new 3 Series BMW, our cost structure will be a lot better compared to the current models, so &#x2013; and I am quite optimistic if I look into the year 2011.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and if I jump into the year 2013, '14, '15, I mean, we are at the moment on the way to develop a new architecture for our cars. So &#x2013; and the new architecture will include MINIs, will include small BMWs and we will achieve volumes, let me say, between 700,000 units and 1 million cars a year. That is what we plan. So &#x2013; and that will give us economies of scale as well. So &#x2013; and we are on our way at the moment to develop a modular system for our engines, that means starting on the lower end and going up to the higher end.</p>
          <p>And it will be one modular system for all our engines, sorry, with two exceptions, our eight-cylinder engines and 12-cylinder engines, but I mean, the two of us, we know we can ask for higher prices. So that means we will have a modular system for our front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive cars in the future.</p>
          <p>We will add a modular engine system and we will combine both. And of course, the modular engine system will as well be for standard cars &#x2013; that means rear-wheel drive cars. So &#x2013; and that, I have to say, is a revolution for BMW. We never, ever introduced a modular system in such a large scale. So &#x2013; and that will give us room to maneuver and that will give us economies of scale and even with the launch, as I said, of the new 1 Series and 3 Series BMW, it is, for BMW, a big jump forward from a cost point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mr. Eichiner, smaller cars, smaller margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course smaller cars have smaller margins than big cars, that's true. But in order to really balance the profitability, we are working in the portfolio. Despite the gains on the cost side that were already explain and portfolio management is a key to it. So, if you now &#x2013; and markets like China are playing a major role in that. So with the strong mix in those markets and these attractive products like X6s, new 7, new 5, new concepts like 5 Series GT, we try to balance profitability in the whole portfolio. That's our way to really maintain a strong profitability position for the Group, and I think it will work out, as far as we can see it.</p>
          <p>Then your second question was about the working capital, and I mean, clearly, we will have an eye on working capital in 2010 as well. And we see first the potential to reduce inventories and receivables, because, from our perspective, we are not yet totally in a pull mode and we want to come back more into a pull mode. What I mean with pull, you can see it if you look at our results in the fourth quarter, where we've been selling more, and having said that, at the same point in time, you could reduce working capital. But with the strong demand on attractive products, I think there is still a good chance to achieve something on the working capital level as well and clearly, we will not be burning cash. That's not what we want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Next question, Adam Hull and then Thierry Huon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Adam Hull at WestLB. Two questions on cash, cash spending and free cash flow. Now, you managed to keep cash CapEx and cash R&amp;D where you cut it quite significantly in 2009. I think it was 4.8 billion, down from 5.7 billion on a combined basis. Could you give us some indications, will we go back towards the kind of upper fives in the next year or two, just give us some guidance? Because it seems quite a low ratio if I look at absolute cash spending and compared to and well, it's a bit above Daimler, but they are guiding towards it having to go up. But we still see an absolute relatively low level.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on your free cash flow guidance, you talked, I think, about 2010 free cash flow being of the same ballpark as the 1.5 underlying number, but as you mentioned, working capital had an inflow of over 2 billion last year. So really, the underlying was kind of a clear negative, something like 500 million. So to get to a positive 1.5 billion in 2010 just seems like a very big jump. I mean, should we be focusing on that guidance or not reacting within the press conference? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, CapEx and R&amp;D spendings, I think we said that we want to go for a 7% ratio for CapEx and a 5.1 to 5.5 on R&amp;D and I think that's a healthy number. So we will come back to such a kind of ratio. I mean, I think it's healthy because it's not in a range of &#x2013; we had it years ago where we had on R&amp;D side more than six, because we are now benefiting from the Efficient Dynamics investment. We've done that. The company has digested those investments and we are now benefiting from it in our whole product portfolio. But as I said, 5.1 to 5.5% for R&amp;D and the 7% for CapEx is from our view point, a healthy ratio for the future, which you can take.</p>
          <p>And on the free cash flow for 2010, clearly, as I said, we'll be working on the working capital and we still see some improvement there. Will it be 2.1 billion? Maybe not, but having said that, we have to see the operational cash flow. We are expecting really a strong operational cash flow with the new models coming to the market. This should be something that will help us to maintain our position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Thierry and then Kristina Church, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas. One question first about the pricing in the premium segment. One of your competitors said recently that the pricing remains extremely strong &#x2013; extremely weak, sorry, in the premium segment in Europe and also in the U.S. So I would like to have your view on that? Are you sharing this comment?</p>
          <p>Second question, about the &#x2013; about what Dr. Reithofer said, you said that the new platform, the new architecture would have about 700 to 1 million units on it. Is that correct? So it means that you have extremely strong assumptions for the new BMW front-wheel drive, if you have only the MINI and this new concept other car? So could you elaborate a bit on that? And last question, which is more philosophical, what &#x2013; how could you make small cars really different than the one from the volume makers? I guess that when you have a small car, you are driving it at a lower speed or it's probably more difficult to make it really different from what the mass maker are doing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That are the right question for the Chairman, Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, first of all, we are confident that we will be able to make it different, trust us. So what does it mean? At the end we had MINI as a front-wheel-drive car, though and in the past, BMW was a rear-wheel-drive car. And what we are talking about at the moment is, we will have new product ideas, I mean, we know them already, of course. We will have new product ideas for MINIs and for BMWs. This does not necessarily mean that we have now an additional 1 Series BMW. That can as well be a car we don't have at the moment in our product portfolio. And I think it will not be only one car, it will be more than one car, what we don't have at the moment in our product portfolio. And that is true for BMW and that is true for MINI.</p>
          <p>So and all these new product ideas and, of course, current models as well we will include in future in the modular system, will give us, let me say, in a timeframe from 2014, '15 and '16 onwards, a total volume of 700,000 up to 1 million cars on a front-wheel-drive platform. So, and now include the modular system of engines and flexible between diesel and petrol engines, flexible between three &#x2013; did I say three? Three-cylinder, four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines and between diesel and petrol engines and that comes in future from one modular BMW system.</p>
          <p>So then you can imagine what it means on the engine side. It will move us into the range because we are optimistic that we can sell more cars in the range of above 1.5 million engines coming from one modular system. So now combine both together and now have in mind, the same will happen with our large cars. So &#x2013; and the products, they look very, very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the last question was pricing in the premium segment, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Thierry, you are absolutely right. Pricing discipline is a big challenge in the whole industry. And as in the crisis, as we have seen in the beginning of the 19s, it's same now. We have now to fight to get back to more discipline there. And I think that is valid for all manufacturers because the margins we had in the crisis is not something you'd want to see on the long-term. So that is really the big challenge.</p>
          <p>Now, what are we doing? First of all, we really did everything to achieve a turnaround in the fourth quarter already and we've been successful. So we could come back to more pricing discipline in the fourth quarter of 2009. And now, with every new model that will come to the market, we are really targeting our sales organization to come back to price discipline. That is the way forward and if you get models with a high demand, very attractive models like the X1, like the 5 Series GT or the new 5 Series, which is on the horizon now, I think we have a good chance with attractive new products to go that way. That is how we want to tackle it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think this is sustainable or it just because you &#x2013; we are in the &#x2013; during the phase-in, phase-out, so it's absolutely normal to have lessons and things on the new 5s than on the previous one, but do you think this gain, in terms of pricing, would be sustainable, or it's going to go as time goes by?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on the recovery of the economy. So if you say &#x2013; if you come back to a higher demand in the industry, which we hope will be the case, like in the U.S., where the market is very much down and if this will &#x2013; would recover, I think then we have a certain relief. And from my viewpoint and what I hear in the industry, they are all suffering from the same problem, right? And they all want to get back to more pricing discipline. Having said this, we know it's not an easy way because the fight for market share is going on, right? So it's still &#x2013; we have to find the right balance, but the trend, I think, will go back to more price discipline. The question is how long it will take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So next question, Kristina Church and then Jose Asumendi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yes, it's Kristina Church from Barclays Capital. I just had a question on your EBIT work down on Page Three. It's &#x2013; the severance pay and the early retirement was negative 300 million and then you've got also your head count reduction savings. I was just wondering what we should expect in 2010 on the head count reduction, whether there will be more? So you said that the 561 was a continued effect from 2008 actions? Whether there were continued actions in 2009 that we should see coming through in 2010, or any more additional savings in 2010?</p>
          <p>And then also the volume mix market, I was wondering if you could break down a little bit more so we can get a feel for how much of that was pricing? And you are saying that pricing is still tough. How much of it was volume versus &#x2013; you are saying that there's an improved mix in China, but how much was the effect of pricing?</p>
          <p>And then finally, if we're thinking about your 2012 target, getting to the eight to 10% margin, how should we think about that and the bridge from where we are today to the 2012? How much should &#x2013; of that is coming from top line and how much from the efficiency savings under your strategy Number ONE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Kristina. Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nycount reduction, as we said, we're on our way to restructure our company in a way that we shift from divisions where we see no strong need to come in with resources to divisions where we see future requirements. For example, electro mobility. So it's a shift going on. And overall, we still said we will take every opportunity to improve our structures further and our processes. It will not maybe in a big amount, but we will use natural attrition and the same instruments we had in 2009. Partial retirement, for example, to a certain extent in 2010 as well. So that is at least the plan. Now the effect from 2009 in 2010, it will be a low three-digit million number that will come to the bottom line and where we can benefit.</p>
          <p>Now your next question was about the situation in the markets and the pricing impact. Well, we &#x2013; just to give you a rough number, 1% of improvement on the cost of retail side is in an order of magnitude of 450 million, right? That is 450 million and with the growing business, it will go up to 500 million. So that is the lever we have in that business when it comes down to the discussion about pricing discipline. And that's the reason why we are so much focused on bringing the pricing discipline back into our sales organization. And as I said, the strategy is based on the achievement we already had in the fourth quarter of 2009, that every new car introduction will be targeted to be on a level we had before the crisis. So that is how we approach that issue.</p>
          <p>Now, targets 2012 and how can we step up? You know where we are in '09 and clearly as I said, we need to do the first step in 2010, otherwise it will not be something that well, would be reliable. So first step in 2010, then you have to see, the end of 2010, beginning of '011, new products will come to the market. So 1 Series and later on, 3 Series, which is our volume product, will come to the market on the way to 2012 and with the tailwind of a whole range of new volume products like the 5 Series in '09, like X3 in '09 &#x2013; in '010, sorry, like 1 Series and 3 Series in '11 and '12.</p>
          <p>This is a big tailwind and we think this will help us to achieve those profitability targets, not only because the cost base is better. We think we have a chance to come back to more price discipline and the market and the success on the market with those new products will be a tailwind as well and help us to achieve this eight to 10% return on sales target.</p>

          <p>Jose Asumendi, RBS. The first question on China. I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on how cash generative are the Chinese operations and if you are able to fund the current investments with the operations there? And second one, just going back to the profit bridge on your Number ONE efficiency measures, I was just wondering if you could explain which are the main drivers behind this figure, why is the figure lower than the previous year, and what is your expectation for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Jose. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, talking about China, I think we will be able to fund the investments, the CapEx we need, in order to build up the new plant out of the cash we generate in our joint venture. We are gaining more and more momentum in the joint venture. The capacity utilization is at its limits, with the possibilities to increase capacity and generate even more cash in the course of 2010 and '11. And this will help us in order to really finance the growth we intend to implement in the Chinese market. So that is at least the plan. If the development will proceed like we anticipate it but, you never know. China is still an emerging market. So things could change, but that's what we think would happen.</p>
          <p>Now, efficiency measures, we are talking about the 648. This is allocated to the fixed costs and the savings on the material costs side, but you should add to those costs the savings we had on the head count side and this is a significant saving, at least in the Automotive segment, of 561 million and even higher in the Group. So overall, if you look at the cost saving, it's more than 1.2 billion in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, Philippe and then Sabine Blummer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question I have is, I looked at your profit bridge and compared to what I was expecting, you've done much better on the cost cutting, which is great. But you've done much worse on the market. Could you help us understand how much of this 3.3 billion negative impact is re-pricing? You've given the sensitivity, how you improve if you improve your pricing, but how much did you take in, in 2009, in terms of negative pricing effect? Most of your competitors give us the pricing effect separately, so if you could disclose that, that will be very helpful.</p>
          <p>And the other question is more to Dr. Reithofer, as there were a few distressed or disappointed traders yesterday on the trading floor at UBS, when they heard that you're going to do a front-wheel-drive BMW. To what extent have you looked at, does having a front-wheel-drive equal, in any way on the mind, the BMW brand in the eyes of some more traditional customers, or do you think, is that a non-issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philippe. Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me, say we will not see a 7 Series BMW or a 6 Series BMW or a 5 Series BMW or a 3 Series BMW with a front-wheel drive. So &#x2013; and we will even distinguish if it comes to 1 Series BMWs, will it be a front-wheel drive car or a rear-wheel drive car. But I am talking now about the years 2014, '15, '16, and further down towards the year 2020. And I would like to say, again, we will launch the new 1 Series BMW in 2011 as a rear-wheel drive car, definitely. And of course, the same is true for a 3 Series BMW. And that will be, for us, a period in between now and our second model offensive to launch all the new products I was talking about.</p>
          <p>And to give you an answer, of course we will have an engine portfolio as well for the years 2010, '11, '12 and when we launch the new 1 Series BMWs and 3 Series BMWs, we will use our cooperation engine, the cooperation between BMW and PSA as well, for lower entry models 1 Series and 3 Series BMWs, of course a turbocharged engine. So that means we will have an engine portfolio from now on until the year 2013, '14 and then we will have a new engine portfolio.</p>
          <p>So only to give you more details and it will be interesting for you. We asked customers, 1 Series BMW customers, and about 80% of the 1 Series BMW customers did not even know that they have a rear-wheel drive BMW. They thought they drive a front-wheel drive BMW. And that was, for us, quite a surprise as well and if you would like to have, in a smaller BMW, more room, let me say, for four or five people in the car, you have to introduce a front-wheel drive BMW, otherwise you will not have the room.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but as I said, have in mind, we are talking about new products. And the new products will fit very well to a front-wheel drive. And our customers should not be annoyed. And I cannot imagine a 3 Series BMW with a front-wheel drive, you can trust me.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've been already talking about the particular lever we have on that side and we said that 1% is close to 450 million, as a measure. And I can tell you that more than half of the effect of the 3.3 billion is related to the pricing, yeah, more than half of it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You would &#x2013; you are in the process of changing over probably your most profitable line, the 5 Series. Could you give us some preferably quantitative idea about the impact on the fourth quarter and first quarter results, probably not, but give the flavor for it? Second, you said you are continuing to reduce staff also, through voluntary redundancy. Should we also pencil in a similar figure to the cost of staff reduction as in 2009 for 2010?</p>
          <p>And lastly, for the small car architecture, you must &#x2013; if you will target 700,000 to 1 million units, you must have an idea of a much larger MINI. So is it right to assume that, for the next generation, you are aiming at 400 to 500,000 units? And in terms of timing, are you &#x2013; the MINI is coming in at 2013, if I am right to understand, but yesterday it was mentioned that new car, a smaller architecture will come in 2014. So, I am a little bit confused on that one.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first car with the new architecture will be one of our current MINIs, in a new version, of course. And we will introduce the new architecture with a MINI and it will be the current hatchback on the basis of a new architecture. And afterwards, we will launch a smaller BMW. More I don't want to say at the moment, because then Mr. Winklekron knows it as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question about the 5 Series, clearly in the fourth quarter '09 and still in the first quarter '010, we have to manage to run out of the old car and run out of old car is not something that is positive for your profit development. Then usually the cost &#x2013; let me say, there is some cost associated to run out. So that is the first thing. The second, with the ramp up of volume in a new 5 Series, I think as we always said, that will start in the second quarter and then the full effect will come in the second half of the year. We really expect a benefit on the profit side and that will enable us to maintain what we said in our guidance, that we will see a low single digit return on sales number at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now head count reduction in 2010, I think the effect will be in a low three digit million number and will be a bit lower than 2009, because now the restructuring is leveling out. We are growing again, as I said, and we need capacity and so this is clearly now flattening.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst Schneider from HSBC. I have got three questions, if I may? The first one is regarding the top line again. Am I right in assuming that the production will rise more than sales in 2010? Second question is regarding Financial Services and the leasing penetration rate. Should we expect that leasing growth again less than consumer financing in 2010? Or will the leasing penetration will even decline further in 2010 versus 2009?</p>
          <p>And the third question is again regarding the profit work down 2010, which burden should we expect again from early &#x2013; yeah, retirement provisions or severance payments and what is the likely impact of raw materials and currencies in 2010? Any rough indication would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Horst. I think all will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think you are right. Production has to gain momentum, because we are expecting growth in 2011 higher than in 2010. But overall, the business will &#x2013; has to be &#x2013; yeah, we have to grow the business up to 2012 in order to achieve more than 1.6 million cars and this is a prerequisite to get to the 8%. So we are awaiting a growing business now, with the background we explained, the new cars coming. And this would mean that we have to ramp up production accordingly and I think this will take place, especially then in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now if we &#x2013; your questions about the SF, the penetration. From my viewpoint, I think we have now a good balance between loan and lease in our SF business and I think we don't want to bring the leasing penetration further down, because this would mean that we possibly would lose customers. We still have a lot of customers who are asking for a lease and if we cannot offer this lease to the customers, they simply would buy another car.</p>
          <p>So that is what we want to avoid and that's why I see we have reached now the limits of the shift from leasing to financing and it should be a good balance now. Now the early retirement, as I said, we will use every opportunity to adjust our structures. I think it will be a low three digit million number in 2010 that we possibly will have to spend in order to follow that strategy.</p>
          <p>From the currency side, looking at our hedging positions, I think there will not be a burden this year, maybe we have an upside in a two-digit-million number. That's at least the actual calculation we have.</p>
          <p>On the material &#x2013; raw materials side, I think the more the crisis will flatten out and the more the markets will recover, the more demand will come into the markets. That's the reason why we are expecting rising raw material prices and maybe a small burden also in a middle two-digit-million number for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, then a follow-up. If you expect production to rise more than sales, how can you expect inventories to go down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the one thing is the production to rise. The question is, how big will it be and on the same point in time, we have now a stock in place, I explained it to you, where we think the existing pipeline that we have can be structurally reduced in order to come back to a more pull related situation. So there is a stock in place, that's one thing, and this stock structure has still a room for improvement and then we add again, as a negative effect, new production. So overall, the balance has not to be negative as an outcome. So that is how we see it. So there's still a little bit too much stock in the system actually from our viewpoint, that's what I want to say. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank. Given the need to sell more small cars to secure the margin of larger cars, would the Rover business case today look much better than it did a couple of years ago? Or in general, owning a mass manufacturer, does it become more attractive going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look, let me say, from now on into the year 2020 and you see the growth rates, then you can see &#x2013; if you see two sales regions, North America and Europe, that we will have a possible growth rate of smaller premium cars between four and 6% every year. And customers, they would like to downgrade and downsize, let me say, from a 5 Series BMW or a 3 Series BMW to a smaller premium car. They don't want to have a mass product. They would like to have a premium product as well in future.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and at the moment, we have not enough products to offer to customers in the small premium segment. So &#x2013; but we see a rising demand from now on until the year 2020 in the small premium car segment, crystal clear, because we have, if you see, different customer groups. You have groups there from a wealth point of view, very rich people, but they don't want to drive a 7 Series BMW, but they would like to drive a premium car. So &#x2013; and let me say it now, they don't want to drive a Polo or Golf. They would like to drive a BMW.</p>
          <p>So and we have to offer products to be able to have an advantage because of the annual growth rate in the premium small car segment of four to 6% in the United States of America and Europe. So, but at the same time, we see a rising demand on the upper end of the cars. Let me say Rolls-Royces, for example, Ghost, for example 7 Series BMWs, 6 Series BMWs, new, bigger cars that we don't have at the moment. So we see it on both ends and if you go back, let me say, to the year 2000-2001, we had a pyramid on the top. The premium car manufacturers in the middle &#x2013; middle class car manufacturers, let me say it like that. And on the lower end, manufacturers, they produce products to drive from A to B.</p>
          <p>And it changed during the last ten years. Now we have a cent clock. So in principle, the medium-size car manufacturers they lost volume towards the premium car manufacturers. I mean, I have in my mind the Audi A4, the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-class. I mean, these three products were able to conquer volume in the middle segment of the pyramid from the past and now as I said, it's a cent clock. The volume moved down towards products to come from A to B and it moved up to premium car manufacturers like Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and we see the same development now in the small car segment, that we have customers, they would like to drive, let me say, not only to talk about BMW, to drive a small Mercedes, but to drive a small BMW, but at the moment, the car manufacturers don't have products. That is the situation where we are in and it's not our opinion. We have independent companies. They said that trend will definitely come.</p>
          <p>And let me say, if you jump &#x2013; if you go to Asia, in Asia, we have a totally different situation. Asia is still &#x2013; in Asia, we have still a very good sales situation if it comes to the 7 Series BMW, 6 Series BMW, 5 Series sedans and, and, and. So we have to balance the situation, as Mr. Eichiner mentioned it. So but we need the product, otherwise, other car companies will sell the products if we don't have them.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. I have three questions. The first question regards the fleet demand, everybody expects some improvement coming from corporate fleets in 2010. Have you seen some indicator that the situation is improving now? Second question is regarding the Financial Services. Due to the lower cost of refinancing and maybe stabilization of deferred RoCEs as well as the situation in residual value so far to see some strong leverage in the short-term for the profitability of the Financial Services? And by the way, do you think that actually we may see some write-back on the provision passed on the charge on the residual value?</p>
          <p>And the last questions regards technical points. Looking at the pension provisions, despite the transfer you made to external front, the pension percentage didn't decline a lot, it was a limited decline and I could see in the financial report that there was a surge in pension provisions regarding other entities. Do you have some explanation in this breakdown between autos where we see some decline and those entities where there was a surge in the pension provisions in the balance sheet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Philip. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, fleet market. I think we are expecting growing demand there, because it has to do with the general development of the economy and we know that when the fleet customers who had a difficult time in the crisis have been cutting back their expenses and shifted their plans to buy or replace fleets. This will, from my viewpoint, now level out and they will come back with a certain demand. So we will see a relief on that side.</p>
          <p>Now Financial Services, I agree with you, Financial Services will benefit from lower refinancing cost in 2010 and possibly from lower risk cost when it comes down to residual values, but we still see risks on the credit default side, because as long, for example, in the U.S., the unemployment rate is highly above 10% and in Spain, close to 20%. I mean, there is still a risk that our customers will not be able to carry the payments. So it's a twofold view on that, positive on residual values and very cautious for credit defaults.</p>
          <p>No, are we awaiting write-backs, actually, I don't know. That would be &#x2013; that would mean that the used car market would recover even more. We would appreciate that, but actually, we are not calculating with that, because you don't know, for example, in Europe, whether this is really a trend where we can rely on. It's still a very depressed market, used car market, for example, in Germany.</p>
          <p>Now your question about the provision, well, you have to see that we had actuarial losses due to lower discount rates in U.K. and in Germany and that was a big offset. It's near &#x2013; close to 1.3 billion and that was an offset to the 1.6 billion on funded &#x2013; which we funded in grocery and that is the reason. We offset the equity with it and so you don't have it in the P&amp;L and the income statement, but that was basically the background on that. All right?</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi. I have two questioners about China. The first one is that you seem very optimistic about the market development there. So I was just wondering, what are your expectations for the next three years for the underlying market development? What do you have in your own forecast when you plan what you're going to do there over the next years?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, Dr. Schoch has talked about the strong mix in China and especially the high level of option take-up. I was just wondering, what does the mix look like within the model range, so what is the engine mix here? And then also given that there is a trend towards urbanization, what kind of mix dilution do you expect going forward? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean, China, it's difficult to look into the future. The first two months in the year 2010, they look very promising. I mean, we could double our volume in China, but we think, to give you that answer, that the general trend will go up in China over the next three years. But you never know. Will we have, let me say, for a couple of months as well, not so good months? I mean in China, as you know, we don't know, if you look into the Chinese economy, is it overheated? If you look into the home market, the market for homes, you don't know, will a bubble burst, but we think if we look ahead during the next five years, that the general trend will go up and it will be a good market for us.</p>

          <p>It's like looking into a crystal ball. I mean of course, I was reading the study of Goldman Sachs as well, it's very optimistic. It's one indicator, but we have, as I indicated as well, there is sometimes 180 degree different. So, but as I said, long-term trend, we see as very positive, but will it go up without, let me say, bubble-bursting effects? I cannot say at the moment.</p>

          <p>Okay, second part, high mix and option take rate profitability, Mr. Eichiner?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are right. Clearly, China has a very strong mix. It's a &#x2013; if you look at the big markets, it's a market with the strongest mix. So we have more than 50% in the 7 Series, 5 Series, X6s, X5s in those category. And that is definitely positive for our profitability. Will a mix dilution come in the years ahead of us? It's a question that's very difficult to be answered, because I think from the demand side, not. Chinese customers want cars like this. So the demand is okay and we would be able to sell a high mix there as well. It's a strongest 7 Series market, it's the strongest 12-cylinder market. But what is a risk is the regulations and we don't know how much the government will interfere in the future. And if strong regulation would come in, this could influence the mix position. But as I said, we don't know it. And actually, it's a positive development so far.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Max Warburton and then Stefan Burgstaller.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Max Warburton at Bernstein. Two questions on margin progression. In Q4 last year, you reported an Auto margin of under 1% and obviously, your friends in Stuttgart reported over 5%. From your perspective what explains the difference? And if it's mostly model mix, if it's basically they are already picking out an E class and you are in 5 Series changeover, are you pretty confident you could do a similar margin at the same point for BMW, e.g. Q4 next year? Is that a good target to aim for, what Mercedes just did?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the 2012 target, the eight to 10% margin, how would you describe this? Is this something that is backed by a detailed financial model, a big spreadsheet with lots of moving parts? Or is it more something we should see as a target for the management, for the organization and if it doesn't look realistic to hit that target, what happens next? Do we put it back to 2013 or '14 or do we start again and think about a different target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Max. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look now &#x2013; if you look at our margin development and our profit development in the Automotive sector, you can see that we had a very stable trend. We could improve the second quarter against the first one, low volume in the third one &#x2013; we had it even to the second one and then we managed to turn around in quarter four.</p>
          <p>I think it shows that this is a trend. We are not going up and down and up and down heavily with big volatility, it's exactly in our guidance to move up on a straight way, so that is at least a strategy. We had some burdens in the fourth quarter, for example, when it comes to the personnel issues, like the packages we mentioned for partial retirement. For example, half of that burden of those 324 million we've showed to you was in the fourth quarter, just to give you an indication.</p>
          <p>Now looking forward, yes, we are expecting that our margin will now improve with the introduction of the new cars. That is logical from our viewpoint and that would mean that in the course of the year, in the fourth quarter of the year, we should see a much better margin. That would support what we've said in our guidance.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to your question about the 2012 target, it's not just a number that's in here. So we have detailed planning. We are doing a kind of a long-range, mid-range plan and there's every detail in. There are all the production plans in, there are all the fixed cost plans in, all the market developments in. So the company is gathering data all over the place, and they are doing it on a regular annual basis.</p>
          <p>And based on this planning, we will achieve that number. So that's why the management is quite confident that we can get there. Is it for sure? Well, there's still risk in the system, you know that. So we don't know if our assumptions are right and there are many assumptions in, assumptions about the development of currencies as well as markets. But there is nothing out of range, I have to say. It's more based on normal assumptions and we think if this is in that range, then we should be able to achieve it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question, Stefan Burgstaller and then John Lawson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Stefan Burgstaller from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. Question for Dr. Eichiner. I really would like to take the market on a churn it over with the eight to 10% in 2012. And if you think when you've announced this target, what's happened, not just what happened to the dollar, but we had the crisis which obviously structurally lower at the market and you might have come back and readjusted your fixed cost plans to accommodate that.</p>
          <p>But more importantly, as you highlight, you had to absorb a significant pricing impact. I think, just trying to make a stab, maybe 2 billion over the last two years, so you just gave this rule of thumb for a 1% change in the price, say four or 500 million. Why this is not structural and why should this come back? And if it is structural, is this not the biggest risk to achieving these targets?</p>
          <p>And the second question for Dr. Reithofer, the decision to aggressively expand the small car product range, as you said earlier, I think has to be viewed as a strategic response to the ever-tougher-getting CO2 targets you are facing in Europe, in North America, I guess in China. Does this mean that you have now made a dogmatic approach? You made a dogmatic decision for a standalone strategy to face these challenges in the next decade? Or was this just the first step in a strategy to set out what BMW wants to do, what is best for BMW in this context and now you are getting on onto the corporate side, trying to find the best corporate partner in order to underpin your industrial concept for the next decade? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Stefan. We'll start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Mr. Burgstaller, you are absolutely right, we ask ourselves the question, what is best for BMW? And then we outlined our plans. I mean, you know the situation like I know where we're heading. We have regulations in the European Union. We are talking just about facts. We will have regulations in the United States of America and it even can be that we have a push in China towards electro mobility earlier than we all anticipated.</p>
          <p>So and we have to prepare the company for such a scenario and we are on our way to move the company towards such a scenario. Is it dogmatic? No, it's not dogmatic. I mean, we follow a flexible response strategy, let me say, and Mr. Burgstaller, I would like to say one thing. I mean, as you saw, we were able to reduce the CO2 emissions of our fleet from 195 grams to 150 grams and if you have the horsepowers of our vehicles in your mind, that was quite a step for the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>But to achieve the target in the United States, in the European Union, and probably in China, we have to make one big step further. It's just realism. So and I mean, Mr. Burgstaller, you can ask yourself as well, what's all about the battery electric vehicle? I mean, if you know the new regulations in the United States of America, you know to earn gold credits, you need plug-in hybrids, because only a plug-in hybrid is able to get gold credits, or you need a battery electric vehicle. So that means it is a must for a car manufacturer like BMW and we would like to be in the future, a large vehicle manufacturer in the United States of America, to achieve these targets. No, it's not dogmatic. We ask ourselves, what is best for BMW? And we see no other choice for us.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Norbert. 2012 targets, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your question about pricing and if it could be structural, well, we think it's not structural and we have some good reasons to believe that. So, first of all, looking back to the fourth quarter in markets like the U.K., where we've seen the first signs of recovery, we've been able to bring the sales support down so the pricing discipline could be improved. With the introduction of the new products like the X1 and the 5 Series GT, we are exactly on the level we calculated on the sales analysis side. So we didn't have to spend more. The X1 is item demand and we don't have to give a lot of sales allowances.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the long-term underlying trends, we have to see that the world population is still growing and the rough projection is 2020, 9 billion people on the Earth. We see what's going on in China. We think the growth in India coming and in South America and we see a more or less stable situation in Europe and we know that the demographics in the United States are still very healthy. So they will come back to demanding cars, because there is no alternative to that.</p>
          <p>And that's a reason why we think in the mid to long-term, the underlying trends are still in favor for the automotive industry and for further growth. And this is giving up some confidence that we could come back to more discipline. Have we planned to do it in one step? No. We are planning that this will take two to three years in order to get there, but this is part of our plan and we think this could be the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, John Lawson [Citigroup] and then Michael Raab.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A couple of questions on the financial income, if I can, because it's often been a disappointment to us with billions apparently of net auto, where assets, you haven't reported a very strong net interest income. And I think in 2009, you finally did report a positive number. You obviously had an awful lot of liquidity at various times during the year, although it's come off its peak of almost 12 billion. I mean, could you say where the liquidity is likely to go in 2010, the gross liquidity? And would you care to help us understand just what the cost of running an excessive liquidity position in 2009 might have cost you?</p>
          <p>And then related to that, am I right in thinking that you have now withdrawn the disclosure that you were giving us until the end of the third quarter on the internal funding of Financial Services? And if I'm right on that, I wondered whether you'd like to explain what &#x2013; why you thought it was perhaps necessary to do that? Is it just a confusion to the market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, financial income, well, I mean, you have &#x2013; on the financial side, you have to see, first of all, we had a bit higher cost of funding this year. And this has clearly a negative impact and the interest rate we could get for our liquidity reserve was low as the same point in time. So that were two effects we had. Liquidity development, looking forward to 2010, I mean, as we said, we have a flexible approach. Actually, we are looking at the development of the markets, especially capital market, and if we see that there is no further turmoil, I think we will get some relief.</p>
          <p>We have a plan to externalize the last tranche of our pension obligation. So that is in our plan for 2010. So it will be another 1.5, 1.6 billion externalization that we will do this year. If there would be any evidence that the capital market will be back in a kind of a trouble, I think we would react very quickly.</p>
          <p>Then the second information I want to give you, I think we are now getting more and more in a more favorable position when it comes to the structure of our liquidity management, because the more the assets in our banks in Utah and in Germany are increased, the more opportunities we have to use deposits and to get excess to central bank liquidity and that is something that is very stable also in a crisis. So that's why we think you have to see this in a certain context. The more we can do on the banking side, the less cash we have to put aside, it is communicating. And that's how we are handling it. At the end of the day, I have to say we will fulfill the rating requirements when it comes down to liquidity. That is driving us and clearly where we are focused on.</p>
          <p>And on the next question, internal funding. Well, it is still our strategy to use the internal cash in order to support Financial Services business. Why is it so? We see Financial Services as a part of our value chain. I mean, you know we are financing nearly every second car in our business via Financial Services. Without financing, we wouldn't sell it. So that's the reason why we try to use these legal Financial Services as far as possible and we had already a discussion about the fourth quarter. You know we had a very positive cash development in the Automotive business and clearly, we used it in order to support this position on the Financial Services side.</p>
          <p>And I think &#x2013; and a further question on the net financial assets? Well, I think if you look at net financial assets, you can see that internal financing is still going on. Overall, there was no big change despite the movement in the fourth quarter, where we again used cash generated in the Automotive business to do the refinancing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you very much, Fritz. I think we have time for two more questions and then I want to close our meeting. We'll start with Michael Raab and then the last question will come from John Buckland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you gentlemen. Michael Raab from Kepler. Three quick questions. Firstly, let's presume for a second, you achieved the eight to 10% margin target in 2012. What would happen to that marginal level in the years after, once you have another, let's say, maybe 500,000 additional small cars coming on stream in between 2013 and 2020 per annum?</p>
          <p>Secondly, as far as the three-cylinder engine is concerned that you alluded to, Dr. Reithofer, is it just going to be gasoline or as well, diesel? Is that going to be a whole new construction or is that a shortening of a four-cylinder version that is already existing?</p>
          <p>And finally, maybe more on Mr. Eichiner's side. As far as EBIT and auto free cash flow on an adjusted level in 2010 are concerned, I am under the impression, and please correct me if I am wrong, that the EBIT development intra-year is more back-end loaded. But how would I imagine the development of adjusted free cash flow in this year, on an entry year basis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We'll start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as I said, it will be a modular system for BMW and MINI engines for the future. And I said, it will be a flexible system from three- to four- to six-cylinder and between petrol and diesel engines and of course, you asked the question, you will receive a straight answer. Three-cylinder engines will be petrol and diesel.</p>
          <p>It will be again, it will be a modular system and it will give us very good economies of scale. And let me say, if you would like to be from a business point of view, a good cooperation partner, then you have to think first what is good for your company to stay independent and they you can ask yourself, can I generate more economies of scale if I have even on top a cooperation partner? If you need desperately a cooperation partner, you will not be a independent company anymore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second part, smaller cars, our targets 2012, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, important for us, strategy in '12, as I mentioned today, is that we're not only producing small cars, that the segments starting with the 3 Series upwards will grow at the same point in time. But clearly, you are right, we have a focus to, as Dr. Reithofer said, in order to really benefit from development in the lower segment and that is strategically very important for us. We need to get younger people associated to our brand and when we have them in our value chain, we can sell them up. So that is basically a strategic point as well to offer cars in those segments.</p>
          <p>Our approach is to come up with a, I don't want to say platform, with a kind of a flexible, K-Tech flexible modular system and the ways that we are combining MINI volumes together with new cars on the BMW side and shift &#x2013; and bring the volume into a much higher level than today. So you look at the numbers we can sell on our front-wheel platform with MINI, with the blend we have in place, this will triple.</p>
          <p>And with a tripling of those volumes, we should have better economy of scale and a better payback. So we should be in a much better position when it comes to the profitability of those small cars. All in all, I can say we evaluated that in our long-range planning very thoroughly and we should be able after 2012 to maintain the profitability level, if nothing seriously happens to the economy or to currencies. But everything is going in the wrong direction, which is still something that is important on the assumption side. So that's the plan for that.</p>
          <p>Now 2010, you're right, we will be more back-end loaded. I wouldn't say only back-end, I think with the introduction, the second quarter could already benefit. Then usually third quarter, we have summer break, it is a bit weaker and then again, we have a full volume available in the fourth quarter. So this is more or less what we are expecting in the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our target is and I think we will achieve that, to really be positive on the EBIT side of course in every and each quarter. That is true for the first quarter as well, but be profitable, grow over the course of the year and the first quarter will be possibly the lowest one. The same is more or less than true for free cash flow development. And we have to see how we balance this in the first quarter and then we get more and more momentum coming in from the growing operational cash flow. So that's how we see it. Hope that's okay for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. John Buckland with MF Global. Just to go back to John's question about the cost of liquidity and the lack of financial income in the Auto division, perhaps you could answer that question, when will there be a reasonable contribution from holding all this cash?</p>
          <p>But my main question relates to how the shareholders are going to benefit from the much improved profitability, if you deliver it and the cash flow, if you deliver it? In the late 2009-2010, you're obviously giving some of that money to externalize the pension. But how &#x2013; what can you tell shareholders about what proportion and what mechanisms you will use to pay the shareholders to participate in this much improved outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly, we &#x2013; you know we have a stakeholder-orientated approach in our company and shareholders are very important for us. And you can see that because we nearly &#x2013; the dividend payment we do in the crisis year '09, I think it was a clear signal that we want to see our shareholders participating in the success of the company.</p>
          <p>But first of all, we have to be &#x2013; we have to have success, we have to have a higher EBIT. And this has to be achieved in 2010. And I can tell you, our strategy is not to come back to a 20% ratio on dividends we had in the years before 2007. So it will clearly be a bigger share that we are prepared to give to our shareholders. It will not be at the 98% level we have for 2009, that I can say as well, but we will grow that share and let our shareholders participate.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to the relation between the Auto segment and Financial Services, and I really want you to understand that we see it as a really captive combined business. I mean if you really have 40 &#x2013; 50% of your costs financed, you need financing. And that's why we don't see a problem that we are using cash generated in Auto to support financing on the Financial Services side, because this gives Auto again the opportunity to sell more cars and it's generating cash again. So that is a momentum which we are using and it's still a part of our financing strategy and I don't see a reason why we should change it.</p>
