          <p>Thank you and welcome to DiGi's Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of 2009. I am Stefan Carlsson, CFO, DiGi and on my right side here is Johan Dennelind, our CEO as usual. We will now take you through the presentation and key highlights in debt, followed by the usual Q&amp;A session. So please Johan over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Stefan and good morning, good afternoon to all of you. Thank you for joining this call. I'll be summarizing a bit some view from '09 and Q4 and then hand back to Stefan shortly.</p>
          <p>Maybe starting off to say that it's good that we're back into 2010 or back in 2010 I will say. 2009 has been tough year for Malaysia starting on the macro side. The economy has stabilized towards the end, but still technically Q4 was most likely in a recession.</p>
          <p>We have seen our customer confidence slowly improving in our various measurements, especially towards the later part of Q4, so optimistic that we have the consumer confidence growing into this year.</p>
          <p>When you look at 2009, the industry has grown despite the fact that the economy has shrunk, and especially around mobile Internet and broadband, it has been the year when I the internet really took off. And it's also been the year one DiGi finally entered the arena around mobile broadband, especially. We'll come back to that later on in the presentation.</p>
          <p>We -- one year ago, we told you that we were focused on cost efficiency for this year -- for 2009 and put out a number around two percentage points around 100 million. I will come back to that, but we have delivered on that ambition and above. But we also have some unexpected cost increases which we have been guiding you through throughout last year and will give you an update from that as well.</p>
          <p>On the capital discipline as we call it has been a very good which have rendered above the guidance on the cash flow of 1.4 billion. So summarizing 2009, we are fairly all right with the year. It could have been much worse and we're now geared up for a competition and the momentum into 2010.</p>
          <p>Remember that how we also entered into this last year with not having 3G broadband and now entering out to 2009 with a great customers and great momentum in this area.</p>
          <p>Looking at Q4, let's say we have 1% Q-on-Q revenue growth. I will come back to the underlying drivers for that but it's -- towards the later part of the quarter we have seen in the consumer confidence coming back and also the purchase power coming back.</p>
          <p>We have yearly revenue growth of 2%, which if you look at our business excluding broadband is most likely holding our revenue market share or even maybe slightly up, but we'll have to wait and see for the others.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margins are 43% for Q4 and '09, slightly lower than we had hoped for of course, but again with the cost efficiencies that we have been able to achieve. And also now the savings, entering into this year it looks promising.</p>
          <p>The PAT has been impacted as you know on the -- the amortization of the 3G license starting from Q2. So we have a decline year-on-year, probably back Q-on-Q growth this quarter number four. Operational cash flow, Q4 slightly above 300 million and for the year as I mentioned 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We are also declaring a second interim dividend of 54 sen per share taking the total dividend for 2009 to 1.78 shares. Again, showing our commitment to our capital management road map and we will explain a little bit more in detail what that actually mean.</p>
          <p>I think I will hand it over to you, Stefan here. As my voice is getting slightly rough.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johan. I will not go through slide number four with the key numbers; you have them in the presentation. So, straight into some of the underlying drivers now for the numbers that Johan has gone through for the quarter. Looking at the overall customer acquisitions, we see a strong quarter for us mainly driven by a strong prepaid performance and that's why they have been is the way it is.</p>
          <p>And we're clearly getting back momentum on prepaid in the market and we continue to see an improving trend both in terms of gross activations as well as net debts. As we can see the total adds for the quarter was 327,000 customers, which is substantially higher than what we have done in previous quarters and throughout the year. But Q3 -- during Q3, I would say that we started building some of that momentum in the markets.</p>
          <p>Postpaid is still a bit slow, I'll come back to that in a few slides. You see that we're keeping the M&amp;P growth there and this of course is to highlight as we are happy to be a net receiver. But we're reiterating that the overall numbers are not changing the market in the big way but we're happy to be the choice for the people that are reporting, or the most popular choice.</p>
          <p>On the mobile internet, as we now called it total broadband and small screen customers, we have now more than 500,000 cumulative customers, mobile Internet customers on the 3G networks. And the -- all of those broadband, the mobile broadband customers were 50,000 -- slightly above 50,000 as of today.</p>
          <p>I would move over to prepaid, the prepaid slide and as we have said the underlying trend is improving. And we have positive momentum continuing throughout from Q3 out in Q4. And out of the total customers overall 2000 came from prepaid and we're happy to see at least stable but also slight tendency over decreasing rotation churn which is good.</p>
          <p>As you know from how this market works when you have a very strong acquisition quarter, you tend to get some of that back as churn in the subsequent quarters and that will probably happen also now because we've increased the rotational churn from those customers that we're taking in. But obviously it's good to have the momentum that we have in fact now.</p>
          <p>We're also focusing much more on segmentation of CRM as you've heard us talked about before. And we're starting to see that paying off in good, better usage trend and also some slight control over the churn as I just mentioned. Of course the usage was also helped by competitive activities during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>On the more concerning side, we have average revenue per minute declining trend that coming from a general competitive price pressure, but also specifically in the IDD segments in the markets. As you know are very competitive and have been very competitive throughout the year. So we see that pressure on ARPM and we also see that pressure to continue going forward.</p>
          <p>ARPU is negatively impacted also on a downward trend because the natural elasticity that we used to have in the market about a year plus back is not all -- is not there for all segments anymore and there are only few segments, which will give you higher than one elasticity so price pressure now will lead to a slight dilution of ARPU as we go along which is expected.</p>
          <p>What has driven this prepaid momentum? We are saying that we are happy with the Hit 1 and the continuation of the Hit 1 offering in the market. We are pushing out Prepaid Easy promotion, which is gaining momentum and popularity in the market. DiGi Music has also helped to create some momentum on the prepaid side.</p>
          <p>Moving over to postpaid. We have a similar statement that we had last quarter on postpaid overall saying that we're focusing on quality customers. Obviously we are not happy with the way we got low credit quality customers throughout the year, so that's why we're now reiterating that, we're willing to take a slightly lower net debt so slightly slower growth as long as the customers are of good quality.</p>
          <p>We see though some improving momentums in some quarter in -- some segments even though the overall impact on postpaid have been rather slow, also in this quarter. We just want to remind you that we're trying to rebuild and find the right balance going forward on the credit risks towards the market and we probably haven't found that balance completely yet.</p>
          <p>The involuntary churn which is the bad credit customers is trending down together with the bad debt I'll show you later. We guided that fourth quarter bad debt would trend down which it has started to do which is good, but we're not really happy with the level it is now but its at least trending in the right direction. So overall on postpaid we added 35,000 customers out of which the lion's share of that was on mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>Yeah, there are still just to comment on the usual pre to post migration. It's still happening but it's much more limited now and it's more controlled. And we're trying to make sure that the -- it's right customers that actually migrate and that should be migrating from the prepaid offering to the postpaid offering.</p>
          <p>Quarter was slightly down due to business closures during the quarter. On postpaid the average revenue per minute has been -- well I would say headed downwards journey during '08 more than anything else because that's when we have more sort of price pressure coming, and ARPM has been fairly stable the last five, six quarters and that's probably because we're sort in the region of the interconnect level as such.</p>
          <p>Okay, I'd move over down to overall revenue and we had a slight revenue growth of 1% for the quarter. In absolute terms prepaid and postpaid mobile revenue grew by about two million each and of course that's not a big number, but at least it's growing. In the past few quarters we have seen higher contribution from our postpaid segment and we're including some new information there which of course you could have calculated yourself before but we're showing it in the graph on the right that the postpaid revenue as a total share of billing revenue is growing. It's partly due to the market share we are taking on postpaid, but it's also partly due to the contraction that we saw in prepaid in 2009 which was in line with the overall market contraction.</p>
          <p>The growth generally is driven by higher service base as well as the pretty good data contribution. So I'll show you in the next slide. Broadband revenues is of course contributing more, although we're still -- we are not talking about it in absolute terms that is probably worth mentioning into towards the second half of 2010 when it's more material or substantial.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the data slide. We see now that the first of all we have split it up -- all the overall data revenue has split up in three parts. One is now messaging, we used to call it SMS, but it's all messaging obviously as message is the main part of it. We also have the category of value-added services, which is more content related and then we have a third category which we now are tracking as mobile internet which is basically data or internet access.</p>
          <p>And as you can see from the slide we see good traction on the data growth, particularly from mobile internet as well as on the value added services. Messaging is flattish and that's also because even though it's slightly growing in usage, it's also under price pressure which keeps the overall revenue roughly at the same level. So, what's driving the mobile internet and gross revenues mainly the wider mobile internet footprint that we have, as well as more smartphones or smart handsets in our network as such.</p>
          <p>As we have said before, mobile internet data is one area where we believe we will grow our revenues substantially in the next years. We also think that value added services will grow to some extent with better handsets and new services being developed.</p>
          <p>Moving over to EBITDA and PAT, I would say that we are kind of in line with what we have guided you throughout the year for the margin. Although, we have to some degree over-delivered as I will show you soon on the savings we have also had some negative developments on the cost side. But on the quarterly basis now negative impact on Q4 versus Q3 was basically traffic cost, driven a lot by the promotions in the market, not related from the IDD segment.</p>
          <p>We also have some cost of materials increase driven by mainly devices and modems. And because of the good -- I mentioned the CRM stimulation on reload and usage. We also saw reload commissions going up for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Possible impact is that we have smart A&amp;P spend slightly lower than previous quarter. Our savings effort in the operation maintenance area is also paying off. So those costs are going down and as I mentioned before the doubtful debt provision trended down in Q4 still relatively high, but it trended down.</p>
          <p>Moving over to -- I will say it's a new -- also similar information included last quarter, but it's a bit of a new we are showing it. We are trying to show the existing business. OpEx and the Cost of Goods Sold we're separating that out now because, of course, the Cost of Goods Sold which is related -- more directly related to revenue creation is more variable and we are showing it separately and the rest of the cost is basically level of OpEx.</p>
          <p>And then in the last few quarters, we see that the trend is that regaining efficiency in the core business and you can see that in &#x2013; turquoise, the light green part of the graph on the left. The mobile internet expansion costs are coming in inline with our guidance. We started doing about a year back of pressuring the margin by more than two percentage points. So the margins would have been just point higher without the start up costs related to mobile internet.</p>
          <p>And that was that guidance for 2009. We are pleased really with the gross of savings overall, more than 170 million. But, of course, we are then not too happy with the fact that the traffic cost is increasing and partly due to the price competition in the market. But that has been too high and the more expected mobile internet costs are also pushing down the margin. So we see on the graph -- on the right how the various growth movements have been in each of category.</p>
          <p>Moving over to the CapEx investment side. We are -- we saw a CapEx number of roughly 720 million in 2009 which was really in the guidance throughout the year. Just want to reiterate that the key investment program now is the 3G or mobile Internet network rollout, that's the main focus. And then we still feel up our guidance of CapEx yearly of about three to 400 million, still it's very valid for the next year or two.</p>
          <p>We are keeping a good pace in the rollout and we're making sure that we're keeping a good quality while we are rolling out -- while we're launching so that we can deliver our promise to the customers, like the average date etcetera. We have also funding that of course in 2G now I mean also going forward which will be more limited to quality focus as well as front capacity when needed of course.</p>
          <p>And I think the coverage number of metrics I think you well aware all. We are slightly down 95% coverage now on the existing 2G network. And the mobile Internet coverage of the population is around 30% as of the end of the last year.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow very strong and also strong throughout Q4, although it went down slightly due to the higher CapEx in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Capital management, we are -- I hope you, you can see progressing according to our plan and our timeline of optimizing the balance sheet throughout 2010 or within 2010 timeframe. So before Q4, we put some gearing on the balance sheet as you know. We committed to a new dividend, a minimum dividend policy which is 2010 going forward that's what we said that we're going to payout minimum of 80% on net income, we're going to pay that quarterly going forward. Of course we will reassess this as we go long but that is the policy going forward.</p>
          <p>We have also declared a special dividend of 75 sen last time. In Q4 now we have further referred gearing and total borrowings now stood at 922 million as of end of the year. And as Johan mentioned, we just declared a second interim dividend of 54 sen per share. And it takes total payout for the year to 1 ringgit 78 sen per share, which is equivalent of 138% payout ratio for the year of net income. So, the payment details around that dividend is entitlement date is 8th of March and the payment date is 26th of March.</p>
          <p>Just a short comment on why you don't see us declaring a normal final dividend, there are two main reasons for that. First one is that we want to payout faster i.e. during March in this case not be fully dependent on AGM etcetera. And by doing this we'll also optimize our cash flow planning as such and our cash flow in the company for the next year.</p>
          <p>I think with that I will hand back over to you for some regulatory updates and forward looking outlooks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As usual, we'll try to give you a little bit flavor what's going on, on the regulatory arena. I don't think we have many news, may be some small updates please. Spectrum reforming for the 2010 will be the crucial year where reforming will be debated and discussed and also decided on roadblocks not allocated or decided but very much the work needs to be done this year. I think still the ambition for the industry, however, I think might be slipping a little bit. We'll keep pushing up but there might be some delays.</p>
          <p>On access pricing review, I think we have a similar view that the June date, end of June date where access pricing formation expiring might have to be extended because we are not fully up to speed there yet and then you -- we're still under discussion, so those two probably will see a slight delay.</p>
          <p>On the HSDPA side, the broadband, the high-speed broadband topics, which are very much on, I would say, government agenda, regulatory agenda and of course the industry and the DiGi agenda. And the reason got here is that TM has now come out with the first information on commercial terms and launch dates for consumer retail broadband offerings, we're still pending on the more transportation fiber optic pricing.</p>
          <p>The first view I'll look on that doesn't look fully promising, would say, still bit unclarity on how we will be able to compete on those suggested pre-cost levels and what the regulation will do on the pricing from TM versus the consumer side. But at least the good thing is that the pricing and the costs terms are out. There are some dates mentioned end of March the certain parts of plan valid where this can be available for us and others to resell to the consumer. So this is something that we are exploring as we mentioned before depending on the commercial terms that we now will have to go deeper into it. So, at least a small step forward on that side.</p>
          <p>What's next? Yeah, what's next? I think we are always pushing for the change to happen within the general industry, and we are right now very committed on how delivering a better 2010 than 2009 getting back more growth, better growth and improving net margins and the capital discipline as we have maintained throughout last year.</p>
          <p>We'll have to go even deeper into the segmentation focus that we have started. Also increased importance of course on the existing customers on how we can retain them, take care of them and up sell as well.</p>
          <p>Needless to say the internet business is a core part of the future, but data revenues over time will be slightly the dominant revenue stream for mobile operators and so also for DiGi. So here we are very bullish on the general growth for the internet and we are confident that DiGi is a leading player here and we're off to a good start. It also going to drive an increased focus on handsets, or should I say devices, both in terms of modems and handhelds but also in terms of smartphones.</p>
          <p>So you'll see an increased focus on lot not only from DiGi but from the industry. It is happening as we speak. We also in competitive edge in the way we address our customers and the way we work internally. We had always seen that's the competitive edge and we continue to push that through the DiGi way. And we will continue to drive operational efficiencies through outflow of various established cost programs which we have talked about. We're hoping the addition even more on these areas in order to make sure that the costs don't grow faster than the revenues. Meaning also we are aiming for a margin uplift during the years to come.</p>
          <p>We also very committed as Stefan and I have mentioned many times to our capital management story and our optimization of the balance sheet. I think we have proven that point too over and over again.</p>
          <p>If you turn page to 2010, we are giving you some of our guesstimates for this year. We think that the revenue for the industry could be around 5%. Having in mind that the industry growth for last year was around 4% if you include broadband, and if you exclude broadband the revenue growth was probably around 2%. So, 5% around and we aim to be above that now when we have all the tools to compete which we haven't have in the past.</p>
          <p>So for the first time entering into year, I think we have all that we need to outperform our competitors. And the margins, we talked about we are aiming to improve them. The CapEx will be around the same levels of last year, but we also prepare to invest in order to grow the business. But all-in-all, we are aiming for a higher cash flow margin than last year which was around 28%. So that's why we're putting our cash flow guidance this year about 28%, operational cash flow.</p>
          <p>That sums it all up actually, thank you for listening. And we're happy to take your questions from now.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Roshan Raj from Nomura Singapore. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Just two questions, first one being what are the other assumptions around DiGi's growth in '010 exceeding the industry growth, is it going to be entirely data? The second question is &#x2013; what are your targets for broadband in FY'10 largely in terms of your subscriber growth? And what would be the percentage of contributions from broadband in '010? And could you give us some color on what would be the medium to longer-term margins that we can look at for DiGi? Yeah. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roshan; Johan, here. On the growth side, of course there are multiple growth drivers that we are looking at. We have said this before and I can say it again that the market is not fully penetrated, that's one growth driver to tap into the last few millions of users that are not yet owning and using a hand phone. The second one of course is the market share fight on the existing customers where we are able to gain from the competitors and we have shown that in our attractiveness of the A&amp;P stats. And the third one of course is also the &#x2013; our existing base, we get them to use our services more, especially around data. So you're correct that data will be an important growth driver.</p>
          <p>Looking at the broadband side as invisible to our revenue growth this year, we have said that before. Last year was about building creditability and establishing ourselves. This year the revenue from broadband will be visible and next year it will be significant and we stick to that guidance. In the margins side I don't think we go further on what we said that we're aiming for a margin uplift this year and also next year. So that is based on our cost programs that we have in place, based on the revenue development that we see for now we would be able to get a margin increase. But also remember that the margin levels that we have, given the size of the market is above the average for many third operators of similar markets in size. So, that is the answers for the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up question. What would be your assessment of growing the revenue from the East Malaysian geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly. That is an area where you find a chunk of those two, three million people in Malaysia that don't have a mobile phone, today. So that's part of the market where we will hopefully be able to gain some revenue growth going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question comes from Karen Ang from Citigroup Bancorp. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have two questions. First, can you please remind me what the amortization of intangible assets is for the full year of 2009? And secondly, you mentioned that CapEx will be the same level as last year, but then you would be prepared to spend for growth. Can I just clarify where potentially could upside risk to CapEx come from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Karen. I'll take your second question first. On the CapEx, I mean we I don't know what you mean by upside on CapEx &#x2013; we're estimating and that we need approximately the same CapEx for this year as we had last year. And the movements are basically, slightly less investments in 2G as such and we're talking about the balance now as slightly more into 3G and the mobile internet.</p>
          <p>And then we have of course some key IT investments that we will also do for this year. There big -- the big year question mark is surrounding how much capacity that you need to invest in? I think this is more of a question on 2G potentially also 3G, but we are -- we're building our 3G network fairly robust. So I think it's more it's the 2G traffic develops with a substantial RPM decline and the lot of usage increase. Potentially CapEx will have to be higher due to capacity issues.</p>
          <p>So on your -- first question you asked for the full year amortization &#x2013; in spectrum I think it was the 69.Yeah, 69 million for full year. So it's basically 695 million divided by 10 years of spectrum or license lifetime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I can just follow-up on the CapEx question, what's the thinking on investment into the backbone; will you accelerate or increase investment there as mobile broadband, mobile data the take up improves from where we are right now?</p>

          <p>The investment case as we said before investing in the backbone is what we are doing a bit of that, but we don't want to do too much because we are -- we're not being into the business or building back, full backbones. We would rather lease part of it and the way the prices in the markets are developing, it looks like we can lease quite a lot of it.</p>
          <p>But I think the key question is, rather down the road two, three years ahead when the capacity is much more higher and then we will have to see where the lease line prices are in Malaysia because today they are very high and due to lack of competition. You have only a few players in the market, but prices have started to move which would probably make us build a little bit less, but we are catering for three to 400 million, we're catering for some backbone investments in there as well.</p>

          <p>Yes, good evening. Thank you for the call. I just want to follow-up with the comments on slide 15 regarding optimized balance sheet and I guess at the beginning of the call you'd talked a little bit about discussing the outlook for capital management and obviously last year as you mentioned you paid out 138% of earnings. Are there any metrics that we should be looking to that -- it considering that's important and I guess the key question is any change in those metrics versus 2009 and earlier years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't really have any additional information here. But obviously overall we're getting closer to being optimized in our view without disclosing our internal philosophy around that. But we obviously want to have a good funding mix with the lowest rate to average cost of capital I think that one is of course important. And then we want to have some flexibility. But other than that we haven't really guided on the exact gearing levels for which metrics we are looking into in detail. So -- but I guess as we go along now over the next few quarters we'll have to share some more color on this with you, since we say that we're going to be optimized during 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. I have several questions first you mentioned that your 3G coverage is around 30%. Is that all on HSPA and where do you see this going in 2010 based on your CapEx budget? Also how do you think your 3G network now compares with Maxis and Celcom? Just trying to figure out why the company is lagging in terms of net adds for wireless broadband. And third question is how this regard to pricing pressure on the IDD side you mentioned this awhile ago. And is this still ongoing into the first quarter and which operator's behind this in your view? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Arthur, Johan here. Let me start elaborating a bit on your 3G mobile broadband question. I think when we came in to the market starting to rollout Maxis, actually we did it on the latest HSPA platform with 14.4 megabits per second which we then were first with in the markets. We still are and using that as a part of our proposition better speed for less when you go to the broadband side. But you are right, 30% footprint is on the 3G HSPA now. And we are increasing it by the day and we are not holding back for any reason.</p>
          <p>We are steaming ahead as much as we can and getting into new key market centers according to our plan. But, I must say that the way we have come out -- how fast we have done it and the reception we have gotten has been tremendous. So, I think in that sense we also over-achieved our commitment to the regulator in terms of compliance of coverage et cetera. But over time, of course, the network will not to be the competitive edge. It's going to be in our customer fronting activities, our branding, our pricing and that's where we also are focusing a lot right now affecting our expectations for the consumers.</p>
          <p>On the pricing side Stefan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean we &#x2013; as you know we don't comment on Q1 specifically. But we have seen IDD being the main competitive arena throughout the last couple of quarters. And the main players pushing there is of course Bienvenidos, we have some low price dominos, but Tune Talk is fairly new in that arena and but you also have Merchant Trade et cetera. So we will have non-traditional players pushing, but you also have Celcom and Maxis that probably want market share in that segment as well. So it is a highly competitive arena, but so is other segments like youth for example. So it's not the only competitive arena but we have a good market share in the IDD segment so that's why we are mentioning it as a price pressure for DiGi.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. If I can just follow-up with regard to my question on the broadband side, I'm just trying to figure out in terms of the momentum the company is clearly creating with the likes of Maxis and Celcom. I was wondering what is really responsible for this. Is this the matter of network coverage not being up to par versus your competitors at this stage or is it more on the marketing and CRM side?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Arthur as I mentioned we have -- had one ambition last year and that was to establish also as a mobile broadband player, and second drive the expectations for the consumer. And this year is about making sure that we deliver also on the numbers creating that significant revenue streaming in 2010. And I claimed that we are not behind. We are way ahead in customer experience. And that's what matters. We're building our brand for future. Of course we're behind in terms of coverage, because we started many years after the others, but in terms of product and brand and experience we are way ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to ask a couple of questions to follow-up on the EBITDA margin and the CapEx outlook longer-term. Firstly on the CapEx you mentioned probably flattish levels for 2010 versus '09 and explained roughly how that would be allocated et cetera. Do you think that you're still kind in the CapEx peak years with the 3G coverage rollout? And would you be able to envision that post 2010? There could be meaningful further reduction to the CapEx level from the 700 something million and if so you know roughly what do you think is the sustainable level?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the EBTIDA margin, comparing the fine prints of the guidance this time versus what you had given for 3Q results sounds like you are obviously turning slightly more positive and you are now aiming for increase in margin versus the stable margin previously. And we've seen that in the fourth quarter. There is quite a lot of meaningful cost cutting that's helped the margin as well. But how much of this is sustainable and how much incrementally do you think you could squeeze out of 2010? And would you still envision then that as most of the cost cutting is more or less I guess in the next 12 months as well as data margin pressure continues to set in that you would still see a further compression trend post 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Helen. Good questions. I will start on the CapEx. I mean, yes, we mentioned flattish CapEx levels versus 2009. We also already mentioned the allocation roughly. I mean the main investment program, which you already know we're guiding around 3 to 400 million a year is on the 3G network, with the mobile internet rollouts. There is also a fairly sizable part of the 2G networks, main focus on quality, but also dependent on the capacity development, we might have to put in some capacity investments there as well.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, you are talking important investments in IT systems and product development et cetera which we normally don't mention exactly what it is. So that's the rough allocation. And when it comes to the peak years, we have said before that 2009, '10, and '11 will be peak years for 3G rollout as we said with approximately 3 to 400 million per year. With the 2G investments probably decreasing slightly every year from '09, '10 and '11 and going forwards, that's the reason why we can keep &#x2013; we keep the balance at a flattish CapEx even though we are rolling out more and of course coupled with the further CapEx efficiencies and procurements et cetera. We can keep the level flat even though we are doing more of the same, more for less.</p>
          <p>On the margin side as you understand it is very difficult to guide generally on the margin in the market like this. We know what we are doing on the cost side. And that's why we are slightly bullish now. We are saying that we hope the activities that we are doing from 2010 and '11 I will say it in the next couple of years actually because it takes time to get effect on some of the structural cost efficiency and savings. But over the next couple of years we will have some improved efficiencies in the overall what you call production platform of the company. While the 2009 savings was more on quick wins and smarter marketing spend et cetera. So we have the short-term savings already taking most of it and now you have the more structural long-term savings and that's why we are positive that we will -- we are aiming at least to be above the current levels of EBITDA. But there are many factors in play to understand the competitive environment will &#x2013; is uncertain. The price development there. The sales and marketing spend down in the markets by 16 days et cetera so the manufacturer is in play but we hope that we can achieve a better margin than what we have done for where we are currently.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's one additional element, previously when we said maintain I was referring to the 45% level that we have in the last year. Now, we're referring to the 43% and then of course we are aiming to increase from 43 level. We're with the cost efficient programs that we are running and also seeing some momentum coming back on the top-line that should be doable that will be in short.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And, just one final question from me. Regarding the industry revenue growth of 5% that you are estimating and your targeted grow revenue at a faster pace. How much of that is from macro rebound effect versus voice, versus wireless data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A very good question, here you have various assessments of that. I think that the core business, a lot of things are related to the macro comeback. So around probably 2, 3% could be from there and the remaining to 2, 3% could be from the driver &#x2013; from the growth of broadband per se. But those are rough estimates. I am sure you have your own market assessment as well, that's how we view it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So then for this is higher market share growth versus the market average, how would you say your exposure would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since, we are not fully on par on the broadband side, yet, we have to do even better on the non-broadband side in order to be above the industry average. So, clearly we have to continue to push the so called core mobile business when -- at the same time when are establishing ourselves in more key markets centers for the broadband push, but all-in-all we believe that's suitable and that's where DiGi's aiming.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I am sorry, one last question from me -- is your subscriber gain that you saw in fourth quarter of the year would you say that's mainly from existing market churn from your competitors or is most of it actually new incremental adds into the market from East Malaysia or youth whichever other sources?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. I have three questions. First one on the fourth quarter results where you had very strong subscriber growth and ARPUs are fairly steady, but revenues were rather flattish about 1%. Just trying -- I am trying to reconcile where the difference is -- coming in the later part of the quarter? Second question is on your -- you did mention about the elasticity of prepaid diminishing is that something of a concern going on the road where you see further price points, price pressure? And the third question is on your broadband contributions for 2010 you expect it to be significant, can you give us an idea of what do you mean by significant? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kelvin. On your first question yeah, I mean, it's the strong net adds you normally don't get full effect on the revenue in the actual month or quarter that you acquiring to customer. So you may be aware that we are expecting the revenue uplift to come in the subsequent months and quarters so, it's not a direct revenue in the quarter as such follows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kelvin, Johan here on the broadband question. What I said was 2010 it going to be visible when it comes to revenue growth from broadband. 2011 its going to be a significant part for revenue growth and given I know you have the 5% to industry we aim to be above and it is not here, you have visible parties, when you get at a certain numbers and next year its going to be a significant. So we are not guiding on the absolute revenue for broadband. Right now its still about getting into the market centers and maintaining the great word of mouth and the experienced that we have for our users that will render returns later as we go along but its already visible. So, you will see that as we go long we will present in Q1 -- after Q1 we will have the revenue numbers also part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>On the prepaid side, just a general comment there I think we revamped the prepaid offering the Hit 1 and later also Prepaid Easy. It is actually an unbeatable proposition we have out there and it's gaining in traction and momentum. But that is also putting a bit of pressure on the APPN for the segments when they are going on to the Hit 1. Because when you Hit 1 it, then you get a lot lower prices and that has people started to detect. And we are also encouraging that of course, because then they see the great value of being on Prepaid Easy. So, yes, there has some dilution on the APPN, but in the return we have bottomed back our growth momentum on customer side and acquisition side. And that is the intention right now. So, that sums up your three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just quickly follow-up on the question on wireless broadband. I mean that part on the three incumbents, we also have got the some of the WiMAX operator coming in and we have start-up called YTL coming in. What are your thoughts on them? And also on WiMAX roll and basically a pure WiMAX -- a pure data operator coming in the longer-term competitive environment surrounding this industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good question, Kelvin. It requires quite an elaborative answer, I can go more in detail later on, but a very brief statement here is that I think the mobile on the wireless mobile side is very healthy competition right now. You have the two different technologies competing WiMAX and WCDMA and that is good. It's driving prices to move where the prices should be and it's setting the bar on customer experience where it should be.</p>
          <p>And I think we are taking a lead in both those areas in setting the price right and the experience right, whether that's a WiMAX or mobile broadband right now, doesn't really matter. I think WiMAX has been mostly targeted at versus fixed broadband and competing against 3G mix here. And of course, WiMAX has handicaps, when it comes to mobility and the license and I think that handicap will remain. But as long as Streamyx is the monopoly on fixed than WiMAX probably has a chance to survive in Malaysia, but we need -- all of us need fixed broadband competition to become much clearer into the market because that is needed both fixed and mobile wireless if needed in this country to drive broadband numbers overall and they are complementary, is not mutually exclusive. So that's the short version of my view.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi thanks for the call. Two questions from me. One, I would just like to get again more clarity on the 5% revenue growth number. I think you are mentioning earlier in the call that you are expecting most of that to come when you push into voice rather than data for FY '10. Could you help me understand, who you think you could be taking market share from as you have highlighted competition is already quite stiff in this area. So could you give me -- give us some idea who are -- where do you expect share to come from?</p>
          <p>Number two is relates to the CapEx, give some color on what is going to look like for FY'09 to FY'11. I was wondering what happens after FY '11, I mean what kind of guiding thoughts would you give us to get an idea where those most stable CapEx levels could be? And finally on the margin side, I understand -- you mentioned there are some other structural kind of cost savings. Could you give us a sense, is it more from the O&amp;M side, the particular area on the cost line items that could help you with longer term cost savings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Chen Hsung. I &#x2013; let me just clarify little bit here on the revenue predictions. First of all, we have ambition to have a revenue market share gain overtime &#x2013; that we've smaller thoughts on that because it's the relative gain. So we have to take the point of departure and what we think the industry will grow -- how fast the industry will grow? And with our estimates right now is around 5%, it could be wrong. If it's lower then we feel it won't be above, if it's high we still want to be above.</p>
          <p>And when you say where does the growth come from? Yes, there is a growth coming from the mega drive right now around the Internet both small screen and big screen and this can be a significant part of the industry growth. We cannot compete fully in all these areas. So we have to be excellent in again where we are to get our fair share. If we get our fair share, that's great for 2010. If we get slightly lower than our fair share of the bad growth, we need to compensate with higher growth in the mobile -- core mobile business at once which is done excluding the big screen broadband. And there you have the multiples sources of revenue that I mentioned; one is the remaining subscribers, the customers that don't have the mobile phone. 2, 3 million people still, over the next few years -- two, three years will come on board and that significant, that, as a country size, it's a small country. And of course here the market share gain, we will take from everyone. We don't have to target long specific competitor to win from. We win from all of them. And the third one of course our existing customers to work with them to understand that after solid usage and behaviors we can help them spend wisely and also up sell on our services around value of the services not too heavily. So that's the answer on revenue side and you can just plug it in your models. Stefan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Stefan Carlsson. On your CapEx question, we have &#x2013; I would just reiterate what we have said before is that beyond the main investment period of the 3G network roll out &#x2013; which ends, not ends but it's coming towards more normal level in post-2011. We have said as we probably see CapEx to sales trending down towards low teens or potentially around 10% over a three to five year period. That's the best guess we can give you right now. On the cost savings, of course, I will not give away too many details here. It's also competitive arena. But we are focusing more on processor reengineering or automation issues internally. We have some looking at asset utilization and asset sharing et cetera. So there are many things that takes a bit more time that we can incorporate better and use our own assets or set our own assets better than we're doing today. So some examples, but we will not go into the details on these things.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. But could you just maybe give a comment on the operations and maintenance, I mean the debt line -- the cost of line had a nice drop from the previous quarter. Is this a kind of similar one which you should be expecting? I mean what was behind that significant drop?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I am not to -- we're not going in to guide on the specific cost item like that, but as we have said before, we have done a lot of re-scoping and rightsizing of operational maintenance agreements and we've also done a lot of renegotiations that we've mentioned in the previous quarters so that is behind the improving trend on O&amp;M as such.</p>

          <p>Good evening gentleman. Thanks for the call. Three main questions from me, first of all, I mean, big picture question with regard to the industry growth and margin. First of all with regards to industry revenue growth, what do you think would result in industry growth coming in say at 10% as opposed to 5% over the next 12 months? Is it's going to come from wireless broadband or could it come from the traditional businesses? Two with regards to your own EBITDA margins. First of all, if one will take  a three to five year view, what kind of EBITDA margin should one be looking at either for yourselves or for the industry and for yourselves in particular, what exactly would be -- you be more optimistic and say margins will come back to 45% as opposed to stay at 43%? And finally, with regards to -- this talk of SP Telemedia coming into Malaysia via U Mobile. How do you see that as both a threat as well as an opportunity because I believe you've got this network roaming agreement with U Mobile?</p>

          <p>Good evening. Pram Thank you. Industry revenue is 10% is very bullish. It's not unthinkable. If everything comes together and the, if the system works and the also fixed broadband competition is there. I think it's not unthinkable, but not in our base case. So, we'll guide you as we go along. I don't know what you have in your estimates Pram , but 10% sounds quite bullish to me. Two -- question number two is -- Stefan will come back to question number three SP having coming in -- into U mobile, I welcome as we have a partnership with U Mobile. So, U mobile success in some aspects is also our success nowadays. So in that sense we welcome to stable -- stability of our industrial partner to U Mobile. Stefan?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Pram . Stefan, here. I mean you are asking a very difficult question and you know we don't guide on the long term normally -- as you well heard earlier in conference call that we don't guide on a long term margin. But we do realize that there is some margin pressure happening in the market as you know. You could argue that some tariffs are now starting to come down and we are starting to see some of that pressure in the market. But I think -- but what we have said before long-term is that we are happy if the margins would stay above 40% long-term in that terms adding a three to five year perspective. That would be a good case and that's also taking in the effect of wireless broadband etcetera. I cannot give you more specific guidance than that right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So again I like to follow-up on that especially in the competitive environment, if SPT were to come in do you think we could go for another price war? I think that's the biggest worry for most people when they look at a new player in the market. Of course one could argue that U Mobile probably has less of a network asset to fill up so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that has been the case when every new entrant's come in and we know or not there is price war danger and that still prevails. But I think the main issue there is well -- how the big three reacts. And so far as we have a pretty good track record of not overreacting and being rational in the way we address the consumer needs. So I don't view this as suddenly a much bigger risk of a big price war across the board. In certain segments, yes, but that is not only driven by U Mobile.</p>

          <p>Hi, everyone. I've got three questions. Firstly on the MVNO we do see them sort of gaining some decent momentum, more traction in the marketplace. I'm just wondering whether DiGi would be looking to relaunch or come-up again with the Happy package. Secondly, on the site acquisition issue, I do hear from some of the smaller players that has been the issue for them, but clearly they are more Greenfield. I'm just wondering whether DiGi too will face any sort of similar issues in terms of site acquisition for the 3G network. Third question is on the iPhone. I do hear some market talks that iPhone will no longer be exclusive to Maxis come second quarter. I don't know whether you've got any market intelligence there to share and whether DiGi could also be looking to distribute iPhone in the future?</p>

          <p>Hi Clare.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope you're doing well. I think you should pay a visit to the East Coast of Malaysia, where we have recently moved in with the Happy offering revamped, quite interesting, and I think that we'll talk about in next quarters coming. It is also other types that we announced. We are partnering with the two for the current runtime. And we're of course looking into how we can strengthen our segment offerings and we are now positioning going forward.</p>
          <p>I think that is an important part of doing business for the big three going forward. I have not though- however seen a great momentum among them except for big SIM numbers being dropped out there. So we'll have to wait and see. But at the moment we are not waiting and seeing when it comes to how we should react, but I think we're waiting and seeing if they are succeeding. So we're acting as if they would be successful but not overreacting.</p>
          <p>On the iPhone question, I don't know if Maxis has exclusivity actually &#x2013; that was news to me. And I think iPhone is a global phenomenon that will be non-exclusive in all markets. So in that sense we would have to evaluate it as part of the offerings to our consumer base going forward as well as we have done for Blackberry for example. And if you see Android et cetera so if iPhone is one, Android is coming up strongly and the awakening of the sleeping giant is also happening on the Nokias, and the Sony Ericssons. So handsets will be more important going forward. And the third question...</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had also some questions on the site acquisition, but what was your angle there Clare that it's difficult to get new sites or was it a cost issue or what's the refer to the smaller players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's with regard to getting the site as in big banked companies are not very forthcoming on allowing new sites to be built etcetera. Not on the cost side but as in the actual number of sites to be gained?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way we look at it this term, there are many other things that also come into place in the big rollouts. We have been rolling out many sites for many years. So it's not a big -- this of course challenges occasionally on sites and there are some cost issues related to FPC sites et cetera. But other than that, we don't see that's the kind of main challenge in rolling out 3G.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Can I just follow-up on the thinking behind launching MVNO in East Malaysia only, maybe is that just to target a market segment in which you are weak at this point in time? And also -- how large is that MVNO, how large is Happy's contribution to your top-line detail, is that anyway near significant yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, its not and it's not MVNO actually. It's a brand, but you could theoretically see that in MVNO or a different proposition, but we'll see WiMAX becoming significant. We will talk about it since we haven't talked about it, it's not yet significant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, thank you. First of all, I am just looking at the OpEx breakdown and I noticed that advertising was reduced down the fourth quarter, but that commissions had continued to rise through the year. And I am wondering if this is indicative of a shift in which are you selling in the market? Is there a change in the competitive landscape that is pushing you to get subscribers differently? Are you offering higher commissions to your distribution channels et cetera? And how you see these two costs going forward? Is there room to cut more on the advertising side and then ultimately control the commissions? And then on the broader, I guess, picture, I know Telenor has been actively pushing the idea of sharing of networks et cetera, and is this something that can be explore more meaningfully for you in Malaysia? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Starting with the Telenor question, I think we have been pushing our agenda around efficiency for quite sometime and partnerships already exist heavily in the industry today on how we're sharing, and that could be taken further. We are absolutely open and open to those kinds of discussions.</p>
          <p>On the first question, I think a couple of comments on the A&amp;P side and on the commission side. First, its not a decided spilt for the future that we should be lower on A&amp;P and higher on commission as such, but I can say that this year has been a lot of -- last year has been a lot of focus on trimming and the A&amp;P making it really efficient. I think we're down 20% A&amp;P on the year and also slightly down our share of voice but we've maintained the brand equity and brand preference which is very strong. So, I think we have done a lot more as far as consumer relevance for less investment spend. So there has been a good combination, but I don't think we can trim it much further per se without risking, losing the relevance on the share of voice.</p>
          <p>Commission in last Q4 has been pushed, sometimes you have to be with the market on the commission side. And that was clearly something in Q4 we did. We pushed back into market or using commission. If there is a change to come as an industry on the commission side, all players have to take the same routes. Right now that's not the case. And therefore we are all in many kind of the churn -- more high churn market, high commissions resulting in high churn. It's not optimal. We'd rather be on more value-based commissions where you also reward the dealers on more of a tenure and usage from the customers. But that is dangerous to do on your own, because then you can miss out some acquisition momentum, especially now when we probably only have a year or two left of real growth after that its more market share gains from others. So we'll have to balance this over next quarters as well pull and push.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a last question on mobile broadband, do you planning for having new coverage area and if there is any? And another one is, do you have the numbers specific for mobile broadband, for ARPU and the churn rate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I didn't get your name, sorry. We are definitely entering into new coverage area for 3G broadband. And we will announce as we go along, the new footprints. We have not released any numbers on ARPU, so we'll have to come back on that after Q1 on the contribution from the big screen side.</p>
