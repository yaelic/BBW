      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Philip, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to take you through our results for the third quarter of 2009. As you will be aware we have scheduled an Investor Day for the 17th, two weeks from today, so I intend to keep this relatively brief and to focus simply on our achievements in Q3 and our financial results.</p>
          <p>We got a fair amount accomplished in the third quarter. This is the first time since the beginning of the crisis when our quarterly results were not materially impacted by losses and write-downs on our residual risk positions. We are therefore able to show much improved underlying profitability for the second quarter in a row despite having achieved considerable further derisking. I say underlying because as the credit markets have improved over the course of this year and they have increasingly recognized our return to solid financial stability, our credit spreads have continued to contract and we've had to charge off own credit gains we had previously taken.</p>
          <p>The big news item for us in the quarter, the settlement the John Doe summons, came as a huge relief to everyone at UBS. Finally, we were able to put one of the worst episodes in the history of the firm behind us and could embark on the long haul of restoring our reputation. I can't overstate how determined our management is to prevent a situation ever occurring where the actions of a few individuals can bring the whole firm into such discredit. Confidence in UBS since the matter with the US tax authorities was settled is measurably improved.</p>
          <p>We were delighted when the Swiss Government endorsed the efforts we have made and agreed to return to us our independence. The MCNs [Mandatory Convertible Notes] we had issued only in December last year were converted on the 25th of August and the resulting shares placed into a receptive market. Staff morale saw an immediate boost. The whole firm is back to work with the determination and an enthusiasm we have not seen for two years.</p>
          <p>There was another event of note in the quarter. We completed on the sale of Pactual. Although this was of course entirely expected, I'm going to mention it a few times today because it had a fairly significant impact on the results of the quarter.</p>
          <p>We reported pre-tax profits on an underlying basis of CHF 1.6 billion. Mainly because of an own credit charge of similar magnitude, we have posted an attributable loss under IFRS of CHF 564 million. The improvement in our financial performance was driven by a significant improvement in fixed income where for the first time in a couple of years, the business has contributed positive revenues.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management in the Americas reversed its prior quarter losses with a modest profit contribution and Global Asset Management tendered an improved result. Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank reported disappointing numbers.</p>
          <p>Our net flows of client assets remain a concern and will do so for some time to come. Notwithstanding outflows from all of our Wealth and Asset Management divisions, the balance of invested assets remains stable largely as a result of good investment performance.</p>
          <p>We continued to strengthen our balance sheet. We cut legacy risk wherever healthy markets enabled us to do so. From June to September we brought the overall balance sheet down by 8% and risk assets down by 15% and we ended the quarter with a 15% Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>This by now familiar slide details the performance of our divisions showing their reported and adjusted results. We recorded gross revenues before own credits and CLE [Credit Loss Expense] of almost CHE 7.5 billion. In Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank, both revenues from client transactions and recurrent fees came under pressure. However, in the Investment Bank we saw revenues recover strongly mainly because of the absence of significant write-downs and losses on the risk positions in FICC [Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities].</p>
          <p>Credit loss expense fell again quarter on quarter. In Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank, we continued to benefit from the release of allowances taken last year against collateral from defaulted Lombard loans. The overall credit situation in Switzerland remains robust given the general economic environment.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, CHF 63 million of the net CLE of 243 million was incurred on former trading positions reclassified to loans and receivables in Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>Now as you know, we report changes in the overall fair value of certain of our financial liabilities as economic own credit. The continued tightening of our senior debt spreads led to a net increase in the fair value of these liabilities in the quarter. As I forecast in my presentation of the second quarter results, this resulted in a charge to income for the period of over CHF 1.4 billion. And given the current level of our credit spreads, I would not be surprised if there were another charge, another sizable charge for our own credit in our fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>Overall expenses were just under CHF 6.4 billion. I'll cover them in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>The bottom half of this slide shows the adjusted pre-tax profit for the quarter for each of our divisions. We add back charges we incurred on three items: own credit, the closeout of the currency translation account in OCI through the P&amp;L when we completed on the sale of Pactual, and marking to market the embedded options in the MCN before it converted to equity in August. Adjusting for these items, the firm made an underlying profit before tax of just under CHF 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Losses incurred from own credit effects are largely tax deductible but otherwise do not impact our regulatory capital, nor is there a regulatory capital impact from the true-up of the replacement value of the MCNs prior to conversion. And because the Pactual CTA balance had accumulated in equity over the period since we bought the business back in December 2006, its release also had no impact on our regulatory capital.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the quarter-on-quarter change in our revenues by business activity. The more stable sources of revenue, fee and commission income and interest margin, slipped slightly to a total of CHF 5.7 billion. Commission income was up marginally. M&amp;A and other corporate advisory fees were marginally weaker. Net brokerage fees were down 7% as our cash equities business coped with staff dislocation from the first half of the year in the context of a seasonally weak quarter. Underwriting fees were flat with ECM picking up the slack from a weak quarter for debt capital markets.</p>
          <p>Portfolio management and advisory fees were strong, up 5% overall, driven by a pickup in Wealth Management Americas and higher performance fees in A&amp;Q [Alternative and Quantitative Investments].</p>
          <p>Interest margins came under pressure in the Swiss Bank and in the deposit books in the Wealth Management businesses. The yield pickup from extending deposit maturities in our portfolios of replication and fixed-receiver swaps has diminished significantly. This is especially marked in Swiss francs where the curve is essentially flat after the two-year tenor. We've responded by lengthening the replication books a degree, but we do not expect to see a material improvement in interest margins in the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>A more encouraging development was in the net income from our trading businesses, which made a positive revenue contribution after own credit effects for the first time since the second quarter of 2007. This was largely because of the significant reduction in write-downs and losses from the FICC trading books.</p>
          <p>Despite the significant reduction in non-personnel expenses in the quarter, overall group operating expenses grew for the second quarter in a row. Adjusting Q2 for goodwill and restructuring charges, operating expenses grew by 6%, reflecting an increase in underlying personnel expenses of CHF 420 million. More than all of the increase in personnel costs resulted from an increase in the rate of accrual of performance related compensation by around 65% quarter on quarter. About half of this increased accrual rate was attributable to our decision to raise the threshold for deferring compensation, where this included a catch-up effect for the year to date. And the division most impacted was Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank.</p>
          <p>We have now met our commitment to bring our fixed cost base down to the announced annual run rate target of less than CHF 20 billion by 2010. We still expect that additional cost savings will be achieved as a result of head count reductions that are still to be reflected in our cost base.</p>
          <p>The chart at the top of this slide shows the change in the number of staff on a full-time equivalent basis employed with the bank over the third quarter. Almost 1,000 of the overall reduction in head count was attributable to divestments. The chart at the bottom of the slide shows our broad expectation of the development in head count in 2010. Actual numbers will inevitably vary for a range of factors, including voluntary departures and our hiring programs. We do still expect that the adjusted overall group head count target of 65,000 full-time equivalents will be met in 2010. This takes into account the sale of our offshoring business center in Hyderabad, which we expect to complete in Q4.</p>
          <p>Net new money flows in the quarter were again negative in our three Wealth and Asset Management divisions. In Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank, net new money outflows increased slightly on those of the prior quarter. Flows from international clients improved whereas those from Swiss clients deteriorated by marginally more. We saw net outflows in all geographic regions, but they were only modest in Asia.</p>
          <p>In Wealth Management Americas, we saw net new money outflows of just under CHF 10 billion. The financial advisor population decreased by 653 or 8% during the quarter; though of this, 274 FAs left as a result of divestments. The remaining net reduction of 379 reflects our limited recruiting, some further redundancies of lower producing advisors, and voluntary departures. In Global Asset Management, net new money outflows were CHF 10 billion compared with 17.1 billion in Q2. Excluding money market flows, net new money outflows slowed to 2.3 billion from 7.8 in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The third quarter saw the first positive net inflows from clients other than those of our Wealth Management businesses since the fourth quarter of 2006. Net outflows relating to the Wealth Management channels were CHF 13.3 billion.</p>
          <p>To put client flows into perspective, the chart shows the movement in client invested asset balances from quarter-end to quarter-end, and these balances are an important driver of our recurring fee income. Overall, invested asset balances were stable, showing a modest increase. Strong investment performance was offset by outflows, divestments, and the appreciation of the Swiss franc, particularly against the US dollar.</p>
          <p>I'm now turning to divisional performance. Revenues in Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank fell 3% quarter on quarter to just over CHF 2.8 billion. Portfolio management fees were up strongly, but brokerage fees were seasonally low. Interest income especially on our deposit books fell sharply as yield curves flattened in all major currencies.</p>
          <p>The margin on client assets fell four basis points from 87 to 83. On the face of it, this is concerning, but there are a couple of contributory factors to this that merit explanation. First, we significantly increased the allocation of the quarterly cost of our liquidity buffer to this division. In future quarters, this cost allocation will revert to previous levels and should anyway reduce overall in light of the flattening of yield curves. Second, WM&amp;SB took a charge on its holding of units in a property fund. Overall, I would expect revenues to start to improve in the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the continued drag from depressed liability margins.</p>
          <p>Underlying expenses were broadly flat quarter on quarter, but reported numbers were impacted by the shift in group compensation policy that rendered the larger proportion of the division's bonus pool payable in cash and therefore expensed in this year. The third quarter numbers incorporate a year-to-date catch-up effect. Also, consequent upon the sale of Pactual, we took a charge of CHF 47 million for the write-down of intangibles related to our private banking business in the Bahamas.</p>
          <p>We remain dedicated to turning around net new money flows and improving the margin we earn on client invested assets. J&#xFC;rg Zeltner and Franco Morra will present our plans for doing this in some detail at the Investor Day.</p>
          <p>In the appendix to the slide pack, Philip has included a slide showing you the disclosure enhancements we propose for this division. You'll be pleased to hear we will essentially revert to showing you separate P&amp;Ls for Wealth Management and for the Retail and Corporate Banking business in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management Americas returned to profitability with a reported pre-tax profit of CHF 110 million. The recovery was largely driven by cost control. Operating income increased 1% quarter on quarter in Swiss franc terms despite a 5% fall in the value of the dollar over the period. Recurring income increased 6% to 834 million. Managed account fees were higher as was net interest income, the latter largely because of the impact in Q2 of the special assessment fee of CHF 17 million levied by the FDIC. The proportion of total income represented by recurring income rose a further three percentage points to 61%.</p>
          <p>Personnel expenses decreased 15% quarter on quarter in Swiss franc terms. Excluding restructuring charges, personnel expenses would have declined 10%, driven by a CHF 36 million credit from the release of an overaccrual of deferred compensation year to date and partly from lower salaries and recruitment costs. Non-personnel expenses were down 35% on a reported basis and 19% quarter on quarter on an underlying basis adjusted for restructuring charges in Q2.</p>
          <p>In Swiss franc terms, the gross margin on invested assets fell by one basis point to 79 basis points in the quarter. The decrease comprised a two basis point increase in the recurring income margin to 48 basis points. That's corresponding to a strong 6% increase in recurring income; and a three basis point fall in the non-recurring margin to 31 basis points.</p>
          <p>Global Asset Management reported a profit for the quarter of CHF 130 million on positive draws of 9%. The improvement was mainly revenue driven. Performance fees, mainly in A&amp;Q, and portfolio management fees were generally higher, reflecting the higher average invested assets base. The cost to income ratio fell to 77.1% and is now broadly in line with that of competitors.</p>
          <p>The gross margin on institutional assets rose from 37 to 40 basis points. In the wholesale intermediary channels, it was two basis points stronger at 37 basis points, partly driven by the effects of the sale of Pactual on the managed assets mix.</p>
          <p>In Q3, we saw further improvements in fund performance. We already see this feeding through to net inflows from third-party institutions and would expect this positive lag effect to continue for several quarters to come.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the Investment Bank, revenues before disclosed own credit impacts and credit loss expenses of over CHF 2.8 billion represent the best performance by the division for two years. The improvement stemmed from the significantly higher contribution from FICC, which generated almost CHF 1 billion of net revenues.</p>
          <p>There were a number of factors that led to the better result from FICC. In credit trading, revenues improved following several key hires. Revenues in macro were stable, with rates businesses picking up a little slack from the foreign exchange trading businesses, which experienced narrower spreads, lower volatilities, and seasonally lower trading volumes.</p>
          <p>We rolled out systems to further refine our estimations of the impact of credit spreads on the carrying values of our derivatives portfolios under IFRS, the so-called Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA. Under our previous approach, we measured our own credit effects on uncollateralized derivative exposures by calculating the fair value difference between discounting cash flows at LIBOR and discounting them at our senior debt curve. We recognized, however, that the custom and practice of our derivatives counterparties would be to hedge their exposure to us by buying credit protection in the form of credit default swaps, just as we do ourselves to hedge our exposure to them. So we changed our approach and introduced the change in Q3. Our DVA calculation is now therefore consistent with our CVA approach, which we adopted some time ago.</p>
          <p>So under the new approach, for all derivatives, we take into account all potential expected exposures and any collateral and netting agreements to determine our counterparties' exposure to us. We then use our own credit default swap spread to determine the theoretical cost of hedging exposure to us and add the derived amount to the fair value of the derivative.</p>
          <p>Had we not introduced this change, our revenues for the quarter would have been CHF 260 million lower. This boost to FICC results was, however, more than offset by the negative impact of estimate improvements affecting other items.</p>
          <p>During the early part of Q3, we commuted most of our remaining exposure to monoline insurers where the protection had been bought related to the value of RMBS CDOs. You may recall that we adjusted Q2's results for the insight the commutations gave us into the market value of these instruments. In Q3, we reconsolidated the CDOs whose insurance we had commuted into a cash receipt. We have already substantially sold down the assets of these CDOs with little impact on the net results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Credit spreads on the monoline insurance sector rallied again in Q3. This enabled us to reset our CVAs to the amounts receivable under the remaining credit default swaps we have with the monolines. This yielded trading gains to FICC of around CHF 0.5 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally on FICC, I'd like to mention an accounting effect that's not reflected in our quarterly result. This relates to our reclassified assets. In Q3, the increase in fair value of these positions was such that had we not reclassified them, we would have recognized additional trading profit of CHF 1.8 billion. On this topic generally, we've improved our disclosure on the reclassified assets and set it aside in the quarterly report and included a new summary slide at the back of the presentation pack.</p>
          <p>Turning to IBD, total revenues were steady quarter on quarter at CHF 700 million. Advisory revenues continued to be cyclically weak, reflecting the slowdown in the global economy. Capital markets revenues were down 13% to CHF 670 million despite a 14% increase in ECM revenues. ECM gained market share across all regions and saw a significant pickup in activity in Asia. Other fee income and risk management revenues improved by almost 100 million to result in a net charge of 171 million. This net charge was mainly attributable to losses from a tightening of credit spreads during the quarter, which affected hedges taken out on our investment grade loans.</p>
          <p>Equities had a disappointing quarter with revenues down 20% on Q2. Commissions from cash trading rose slightly, but the improvement was offset by lower trading revenues. We saw lower revenues too in derivatives, prime brokerage, and prop trading. We have recently lost some market share in equities. However, we have made some new appointments and made some key hires, which gives us every confidence that we can regain market share in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Overall, the Investment Bank reported another improved result, though still a pre-tax loss. This quarter it was CHF 1.4 billion compared with a loss of 1.8 billion in Q2. Adjusting the reported figures for disclosed economic own credit produces a small profit of CHF 66 million francs versus a similarly adjusted loss of 0.6 billion in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses rose 7% quarter on quarter on a reported basis, largely as a result of the significant increase in personnel expenses, driven by higher accruals for performance related compensation and to a lesser extent salary increases. G&amp;A expenses, however, fell 17% to CHF 571 million.</p>
          <p>Now turning briefly back to the group balance sheet and capital management, our Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of Q3 was 15.0%, the increase on Q2 being largely attributable to a CHF 37 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets. Some 30 billion or so of the reduction came in the credit risk framework and 6 billion or so in the market risk framework. Almost all of the latter reduction and some of the former came from improved application of credit valuation adjustments.</p>
          <p>Of the CHF 30 billion reduction in credit risk-weighted assets, approximately 7 billion was due to the downgrading of certain student loan auction rate certificates to below the BB- rating. This triggered a full deduction of these exposures from capital equivalent to CHF 1.6 billion, half of which was charged to Tier 1 capital.</p>
          <p>On this next slide, you'll see our usual chart that traces the movement in regulatory capital ratios from quarter-end to quarter-end. Tier 1 capital fell by CHF 1 billion or so to 31.6 billion at the end of September. The IFRS loss for the quarter was more than reversed to take into account P&amp;L items such as the losses on our own credit that did not impact capital. We then deduct CHF 1.4 billion for the cost of the prepayment of the coupons on the MCNs held by the Swiss government, which we made in August. Then there was the impact of the downgrading of some of the student loan aucs that I just mentioned as well as the sale of Pactual.</p>
          <p>And so to sum up, we've now made really good progress in derisking the balance sheet. Though we have still some way to go to exit all of our legacy risk positions, our primary focus is now on generating greater levels of revenue and hence profitability. In the future, we expect our capital ratios to benefit from the retention of earnings rather than predominantly from risk reduction.</p>
          <p>I do want to finish on a positive note because I think that probably reflects the new mood of the firm. Morale is high and confidence is coming back. We've hired some outstanding people into the firm whose presence is already making a difference. Bob McCann having chosen to come to work for us is a testament to how we are able to attract industry leaders to our ranks. The tide has turned and you should expect further improvement from us, particularly in 2010.</p>
          <p>That concludes my presentation on the third quarter results. We look to seeing many of you in a fortnight's time at our Investor Day here in Zurich.</p>
          <p>And now we have some time for Q&amp;A. So with that, I'd like to open the call for some questions and hand over to the conference operator.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Jon Peace, Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a couple of questions please, the first one just on the fixed income trading number. You used to give us an underlying figure, which was 1.5 to 2 billion in Q1 or 1 billion in Q2. I know quite a lot has gone on with your accounting. So I just wondered if you could give us a like-for-like trend so we can understand what the underlying momentum is on that business year to date.</p>
          <p>The second question is just back to the Wealth Management business; thank you for your guidance about revenues likely to improve in Q4. I just wondered if you could decompose that into net new money and margin and where we might expect to see those trends. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in fixed income, I think somewhere buried in the quarterly report there's a statement that says that the billion or so that fixed income made, although there were some overs and unders, was relatively representative of the underlying. It's difficult to gauge because there were quite a few changes. We refined a number of our estimations of carrying values in that division in the quarter. But the underlying looks as though it's around about that level if not a tad higher than 1 billion, and we would expect that to improve modestly. Your range of 1 to 1.5 billion should be where we are.</p>
          <p>On Wealth Management revenues, one of the reasons why we're confident that Q4 will be better than Q3 is we won't have those one-off items that impacted the revenues in Q3. We are also taking some steps. Now I don't want to steal the thunder of my colleagues presenting in two weeks time, but there are a number of steps we are taking. Clearly we're not just sitting by watching it happen, to improve the gross margin that we get on client assets. The client asset balance is the key driver. The volume of client assets has held up, notwithstanding the outflows. We're seeing some very good investment performance. And so honestly, investment performance continues to hold and we should see that management action to improve the gross margin by changing the way we interface with our clients brings us higher revenues. Now one of the ways without, as I said, stealing too much of J&#xFC;rg's thunder next week &#x2013; or two weeks time would be that we would reprice some of our products and services because it's fair to say we have been discounting a little during the crisis. But there are a number of actions that we intend to take.</p>
          <p>On the flows, I don't &#x2013; as I said a little earlier on the call, we don't have much confidence that there will be a quick and significant reversal of flows. There's nothing we see in the pipeline that would suggest that that is the case. A number of the factors that are affecting our flows we'll obtain for some time. I think the key one, certainly in interfacing with some of our clients myself, is the question of our profitability. And we may successfully communicate that we've made a real underlying profit and operating profit when we're talking to professional investors. But when the headlines are still negative, that does impact our client base, and it's very difficult to dissuade them from the fact that we are continuing to clock up losses. And so I think that's a fundamental issue that we have and we need to solve that clearly.</p>
          <p>I think there are all sorts of other issues that impact our flows. I'll just highlight the additional scrutiny that I think the entire industry is undergoing at the moment by all governments. It particularly I think impacts us. I think we have a confidence and morale especially with our client advisors. I think we have continuing attrition. As you know, we still have a number of client advisors who are still on our books and are in outplacement, and they will come off the cost base in the coming quarter or two.</p>
          <p>And then I think generally, there is a lower level of wealth creation, particularly in our strongholds in the emerging markets, which doesn't help our gross inflows, and as a consequence, our net flows look mediocre. And as a consequence though, obviously in recent quarters, we have been showing net outflows. So a whole range of factors, none of them I think likely to change in the coming quarter or two. So we're guiding to the fact that we may have outflows for a few quarters to come. Obviously, we're working to make that not true, but our best estimate is that that's the case.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. On the costs, I wonder if you could be a bit more specific. I think you said you got to the 20 billion run rate. Is that below 20 billion? Could you talk a bit more?</p>
          <p>And I'm still very confused about Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank. I mean are you going to be more specific about the one-off revenues and the one-off costs in terms of what could be the true underlying base for Q3 versus the reported 792?</p>
          <p>And then the last thing is on risk-weighted assets. In the Q2 slide pack, you talked about Basel II add-ons adding I think 60 billion, and then a net reduction in risk-weighted assets of 10%. So assuming the rest is 80 billion, I mean how far away should we see the reduction in risk-weighted assets? I think 28 billion I think you put on the slides as derisking it. Is that comparative to the 80 billion? I mean how far are we down the road on that? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you're right. On the underlying costs -- that's the costs before variable compensation -- we were a tad below the 20 billion run rate, so just below 5 billion in the quarter. It wasn't much below, but it was at least below.</p>
          <p>On Wealth Management revenues, I think the single biggest item affecting revenues in the quarter was the cost of the liquidity buffer. We showed that the margin was down by four basis points and the liquidity buffer itself was a couple of those, and that won't recur in Q4.</p>
          <p>The reason we charged the liquidity buffer to this division, to be quite frank, was because our regulators were worried about us taking down the size of the buffer, while the John Doe summons issue had not been settled. And as a consequence, it was the only division or the principal division that was holding up the buffer. So we charged the excess cost of that division under our internal cost allocation mechanisms. We've now taken down the buffer because we came to a settlement on the John Doe summons. And in any case, the cost of the liq buffer is diminishing as the yield curve out to one year flattens in all the major currencies.</p>
          <p>So that will be an obvious immediate reversal of that revenue effect. The other was this write-down on the property fund, which we'd hope not have to take again in Q4. This is an historic issue stemming back to Q4 last year, where we bought some units in the property fund, given the redemption queue from clients, and we took a valuation adjustment on that, essentially, in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The bigger impact on Wealth Management was on the expense base, where there was &#x2013; of the expenses, there is a good 250 or so million which is certainly one-off, because it's the catch-up effect on the change in the way that we manage the compensation for that division in particular --  across the group, most prominently affects that division. Essentially what we did was we moved the threshold at which we start paying deferred compensation in stock up, and that took a whole swathe of people in Swiss Bank and in Wealth Management out of the equation. And therefore, the accrual we've made for that deferred compensation was brought back and charged to this year, because it would now be paid in the 2009 bonus round in cash.</p>
          <p>The RWAs, I didn't mention &#x2013; I didn't repeat myself on Q2, although what I said then still applies. The BIS [Bank for International Settlements] has come out with the new algorithm for adjusting the regulatory VaR to convert it into a notional number of RWAs. And essentially, it would multiply the RWA number by a factor of something like 2.5 to 3.</p>
          <p>Now in the quarter, we managed to take down our market risk framework RWAs by 6 billion or so, and that's because we've been working on this systems capability to apply CVAs to our derivatives exposures, which were the bulk of that. And as a consequence -- I think it's 16, Philip?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>16.3 billion is the RWA number attaching to the market risk framework. So the delta, if you take &#x2013; if you multiply it by three and you get to that point, then it's equal to 50 as opposed to 60, which is near where it was before.</p>
          <p>So maybe that has come down a tad, but that's only because we've had low regulatory VaR. Which, again, I would like to see our regulatory VaR go up a bit, because I'd like to see us put more risk on the table and actually trade a bit harder. So it's of the order of magnitude that I mentioned in Q2.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it will be 10 anymore. We mentioned operational risk -- that came down a tad in the quarter. It came down 1 billion from 46 to 45, but at 45 billion, that has still got quite some way to fall over time. Difficult to predict when it happens.</p>
          <p>And then there is our legacy book, where last time, we said there were risk assets of a variety -- of mostly credit risk assets attaching to that book of the order of magnitude of 50 billion or so. And this extraordinary event in the student loan ARCs, where 7 billion of the 22 gross amount of exposure to student loan ARCs was downgraded by Moody's, to the extent that we were required to take those out of risk-weighted assets and deduct them in a proportional amount from capital.</p>
          <p>That led to a reasonable deduction from net back book, but the back book has still got of the order of 30 billion or so to go.</p>
          <p>So that will come off over time. There is operational risk to come down. But the market risk I think will go up. Well, it will go up. I'm sure it will.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could go a little bit more through the net outflows, the 37 billion. And just business by business, describe what is really driven by your restructuring and what is really driven by really clients leaving? And maybe a little bit, subjectively, what the issues are around these outflows, if that's possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a question for two weeks time, I have to say, because then you'll have the management team of that division on hand to take you through it in more detail.</p>
          <p>But essentially what happened -- the 37 is just the aggregate of the three divisions' totals. It's a little unfair to aggregate like that because to understand the nature of the outflows, you have to look at Asset Management's quite separately. Because of Asset Management's net outflows of 10 billion, 13.5 or so were attributable to the Wealth Management channels, and predominantly Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank. And so it actually had net inflows, which were nearly all to do with the fact that its investment performance now for some quarters has been very strong, continues to be strong. And there's always a lag effect of attracting institutional money.</p>
          <p>Now, if you take the other two divisions, the easy one to understand is Wealth Management Americas. And essentially the driver there of 10 billion of net outflows was the fact that we basically didn't really hire anybody in the quarter, and we had some turnover. We sold some business and branches to Stifel Nicolaus. And therefore, we saw financial advisors leaving us, and we didn't really replace them. And with that business model, when financial advisors leave, they generally take a lot of their client assets with them.</p>
          <p>The situation in Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank is different. This time, for Swiss clients, we saw outflows of just under 4 billion, whereas it had been basically flat in Q2. Now, as I said earlier on the call, I think the variability of 3 or 4 billion per quarter for Swiss clients is not unusual; it was probably attained for several years, and it's probably therefore a reflection of Q2's strength rather than a particular weakness in Q3. So I thought, although Q3 might be slightly higher than you would expect, somewhere between zero and four is what you could expect from the Swiss clients at the moment, until we &#x2013; I think until we return to profitability.</p>
          <p>In the international markets, there are all sorts of factors, the principal one of which of course is that we are compelled and we've compelled ourselves to exit a business whereby we bank US taxpayers cross-border of an in SEC-regulated entities. And as a consequence, we are imposing outflows on the bank. Now with the heightened scrutiny of governments around the world on tax matters, and given our role center-stage in that, in the earlier part of the quarter, before the John Doe summons was settled, I think we were disproportionately affected.</p>
          <p>I do think reputational issues still weigh on us a bit, and that particularly weighs on the morale of our client advisors. And their ranks have also been reducing, both voluntarily and involuntarily. So I think until we get stability in our ranks, we return to profitability, which I think is crucially important, then it would be difficult for us to categorically state that we are confident that we could turn around the situation.</p>
          <p>Now, we do have inflows. We clearly have inflows. We just have outflows that exceed them at the moment. And we need to work on both of those. We need to work on maximizing inflows. We need to see the markets recover. We need to see value creation take place again, particularly in our strongholds in the emerging markets. And we need to stem the outflows.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the advisory -- the level of advisors, should we assume that that level is now a base level? Or should we assume -- in the Wealth Management Swiss Bank?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We still expect to see another 100 or so leave us in the course of this quarter, Q4.</p>
          <p>You may have seen a chart -- we'll certainly produce it in a fortnight's time -- which shows the way that we grew the client advisor base in line with client assets, and not with the number of clients we had. And so the number of clients being serviced by an advisor fell over the period of 2003, frankly, to 2007/8. And so rebasing the business to a new level of client assets which drives our revenues on a slightly smaller number of clients has been necessary.</p>
          <p>Now we have had regrettably -- this is no doubt about that -- but we have had to resize the business. And that process does not complete formally until the early part of next year, as people finally leave the bank.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Last question, just on the IB. The clean revenues, if I annualize as 11.5, 12 billion. That's not a bad number. But your cost income is about 86, if I even adjust a little bit for additional, let's say, bonus accrual. What is the problem? Is it purely revenues, or is there also some cost issue within that line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you can generate more revenues with the same risk-weighted asset base, more or less? It sounds &#x2013; margins going down, risk-weighted assets not growing, but you think there is enough capacity to really generate more revenues?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do. I think the nature of the risk-weighted assets changes. I think we need to trade harder, so our regulatory bar should naturally go up. However, there are still a big chunk of assets that relate to legacy positions, which in time will -- just even with the passage of time -- run off.</p>
          <p>So yes, we recycle locked-up risk assets. And once they're freed up, we redeploy them in our trading books. But at the moment, I guess we're just not trading hard enough.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, two questions. Just returning to the buffer, you obviously said that it still needs to be run down in the fourth quarter. But I don't think you said from -- to what amount. Could you just somehow try and quantify either P&amp;L impact or total impact of how much more you could potentially right-size that into next year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just returning to the question about revenues and cost base. So you're now below your 20 billion target. It sounds like you really need to reinvest for growth. What's the new feel for what's the right run rate of cost this next year? I see that you're indicating you're going to get rid of another 4,000 of staff, but it sounds from the tone of the conversation that that really won't materialize into much more on cost. Perhaps you could just clarify the push-me/pull-me on the cost side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the liquidity buffer, if you want to be a real accounting nerd this time, you can to turn to page something in the balance sheet, and you'll see that the assets that we hold available for sale have mysteriously started to increase. They used to be about 5 or 6 billion, and they have gone up to 50-something I think.</p>
          <p>And the reason that that's the case &#x2013; I'm shuffling through the papers to try and find the balance sheet to prove I'm right. The reason that's the case is that we are moving the liquidity buffer. We're moving it out of the Investment Bank into Corporate Center. And the reason we're doing that is that the Investment Bank now is pretty much self-funding. All of our divisions self-fund. And so holding the liquidity buffer is really a function of the fact that we are still not profitable on a full IFRS basis, although obviously on an underlying basis, and because it's just prudent always to hold something of a liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>Now you'll see that in the balance sheet, the assets -- let me just find it and give you the number. Financial assets -- financial investments available for sale -- it was 5 billion, 5 billion, and then it has become 59 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's part of the process of moving the buffer from the IB to Corporate Center. Now you can't move it because they are being reclassified as -- or being classified as available for sale. So you have to let the reverse repos go off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you have to find new assets and reverse repo them somewhere else. But we'll move that up to something of the order of 75 billion or so. And I don't think it needs go much higher than that, maybe even a tad lower. But the reason for that increase is that's where we've been moving the liq buffer.</p>
          <p>Now the cost has come down quite a lot, because essentially we try to borrow for nine months to a year and then invest it very, very short-term -- overnight, two nights. And the yield curve has flattened so much that the cost of doing that has fallen away considerably, and I think the cost in Q3 was only of the order of about 300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot less than the 800 or so, whatever it was in Q1. And of course, during Q3, after the settlement in August, we started to bring down the buffer, so the run rate is probably now lower than the 300.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the group costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the group costs, I think you're right. There is a bit of teeming and lading.</p>
          <p>On the group cost, the head count that still has to come off the balance sheet and the associated multiplier effect on cost is still there, and therefore we're confident that we can bring the cost base today, given actions we've already taken, way below the 5 billion per quarter.</p>
          <p>However, you're right. We're now going back into growth mode gently. We have to pursue revenues and profitability, and we have been hiring. But we've been hiring in key strategic areas, not across the board. And the hiring has therefore been of relatively moderate cost compared with what we've been able to save year to date.</p>
          <p>So I still feel confident that our costs are under control -- that we'll maintain this level below 20 billion annually. If we don't, it's because there has been significant improvement somewhere in the business that has warranted us investing more in that particular business. But at the moment, that looks like the right cost base for the market and for our capacity to exploit the market to make profits. So I wouldn't expect to fail that target.</p>

          <p>Hi. I just had a couple of number questions for you. I think you quantified the positive impact of monoline spreads on the fixed income revenues, and I just missed that number, so if you could repeat that?</p>
          <p>And then I guess there are some offsetting negatives on the FICC number. If you could give us some of those, it would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then going back to risk weighted assets, you say of the 37 billion fall, 7 billion of that's related to the student loan ARCs. I get that. Of the remaining 30 billion, how much of that is just currency? So what would that 30 billion number be, if currency had remained stable throughout the quarter? That would be helpful. And then I guess the rest is just real reduction in risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>And then I guess the last question I had, just coming back to the 207 client advisors that left in Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank, am I right in saying you're guiding for similar levels of falls next quarter, as well? Is that what I'm interpreting?</p>

          <p>On the risk-weighted assets, it's difficult to gauge the currency. I don't have it, but I can make an educated guess. The dollar essentially fell by about 5% against the Swiss franc, and the euro didn't do anything, and those would be the two major currencies. Most of the PRVs are in dollars.  And so I would have thought 5% of the 30, so not very much.</p>

And that was a contributory factor to the reduction. The other is genuine risk reduction. For example, the -- on the monoline commutations, where we received free access to the CDOs, we basically got hold of them and sold their contents. So there was a fair amount of clearing out of old stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to go back, on changing the model, which essentially is not I guess real risk reduction, it's just optical risk reduction. When you say it's a significant portion, are we talking 5 to 10 billion, or what is significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would have been a large proportion of the reduction in the credit risk framework.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be credit risk -- it would be application of valuation adjustments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, it's not entirely model because pre-crisis we didn't do too much CVA work. So during the crisis, we've built up credit protection against our derivatives counterparties, which doesn't say much for how we've run the derivatives business beforehand. But nevertheless, we've improved the way that we manage that business and manage the risks in it. So there is actually genuine risk mitigation now. And then there's the reflection of that in the risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The number you missed on the monolines -- just as a refresher for those of you who have forgotten how these things work. We have these negative basis trades, where we're long in asset, and the assets were nearly all long off now are CLOs. That's virtually all we have left. And we protect the value of those with an insurance policy in the form a CDS from a monoline insurer.</p>
          <p>So to the extent the CLO falls below 100, the difference between the value and 100 is covered by the monoline. And we didn't trust the monoline to pay off in full, so we took a valuation adjustment against it. And the impact that we took is only from the CDS losing value -- the PRV from the CDS losing value -- as the CLO goes back up in value, because the market goes up in value.</p>
          <p>And all we released is the valuation adjustment against that receivable, and that was 500 million in the quarter. What we didn't take was the increase in the value of the CLO. And the reason we didn't take that is because we reclassified those to loans and receivables in Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>So we have this accounting short. If we had not done that, overall on reclassification, our trading revenues would have been 1.8 billion higher in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so to go from the 1 billion, let's say, you take the 500 million off for the positive impact of the moves in the monoline. And then to get back up to the 1 billion run rate that you're painting as an underlying, presumably you're not adding back any of that reclassified asset. So there's obviously 500 million that I'm missing there, give or take. And what is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be &#x2013; the monoline amount is in the FICC numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. So you reported, in broad terms, 1 billion of revenues there, and then you're saying there's 500 million of positive impact from the monoline move. So I would strip that out and say there's an underlying of 500 million. But I think you said the underlying is close to 1 billion of FICC revenue. So obviously I'm missing 500 million of negative impact that cancels out the positive impact from the monoline. I was just wondering what that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a net negative impact of the model changes that we mentioned.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And then there's the cost of &#x2013; the fact is, the cost of maintaining that back book. It doesn't come for free, it doesn't yield very much. It was written as a carry trade pre-crisis, and it carries a funding and risk cost. And that's -- while our book is still sizable, it's still a sizeable number.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, John. A couple of questions.</p>
          <p>Just returning to the Wealth Management expenses, looking at obviously personnel expenses, you've explained the issue around the change in threshold. First of all, can you just share with us what the change in threshold was? That is the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point is the non-comp expenses, also if you just strip out the restructuring charge last time around, it appears to have gone up about 9%. Have I missed something there in terms of what happened in the non-comp line within Wealth Management?</p>
          <p>The third point really is just to touch again on the head count reductions. There was a lift of 2,000 excluding the service center sale. Where, in the main, are those going to come from? Obviously you're talking a great deal about the improvement in morale. But obviously having the ongoing leak of jobs is something of a concern.</p>
          <p>And I guess the final point going back again to the increase in personnel expenses on the back of the change in threshold, you say that 420 is the overall impact. I think you said that the one-off effect in Wealth Management was 250. How much of the rest of that 420 if you want is the lag effect problem, what the charge was this third quarter? Thank you, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lots of questions. The first one on the costs in Wealth Management, the non-personnel expenses may look as though they've gone up, but that was &#x2013; I think the factor there is the impairment of intangibles in relation to the Private Banking business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've put that out actually, John. I hope I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In that case, we'll have to get back to you. So I can't think of a reason why it would have gone up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean if we just look at the general and admin, they've gone from 513 down to 499. So you have a 66 million restructuring charge, but please get back me to when you get a chance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We may have some one-offs in Q2 and Q3 that we need to work on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get back to you. On the head count reduction, most of the jobs that are in the 2,000 are in Switzerland. They are mostly in Wealth Management &amp; Swiss Bank, and then mostly people who were in our so-called Coach program, which was the outsourcing &#x2013; the outplacement rather service that we set up. That winds down this quarter. So you'll see those head count numbers roll off the balance sheet this quarter and I think some in Q1 next year. And as a consequence, the cost associated with that comes off.</p>
          <p>So as far as morale is concerned, we communicated those redundancies now in Q2, so two quarters ago, and those people by and large are not at work; and if they are, they are happy to be at work, so I think the morale issue should be behind us in relation to those overhanging head count reductions. They're not all in Switzerland, but that's predominantly where they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The threshold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The threshold, well, the threshold is not a particularly secret business. Sixty-odd thousand people in the company are going to know it. I think the threshold, the full hand was 200,000 francs or equivalent in other currencies, and it has been raised to 250,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the final point which was how much of that 420 of those additional personnel costs related to the catch-up for the first two quarters? You mentioned...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...something like 250 in Wealth Management in Switzerland. I wonder what the balance was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's nearly all I think. Yes, it's nearly all of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we look at run rate going forward, how should we work that out &#x2013; of that 420 because if you're &#x2013; tell me what the underlying costs were with the new threshold in it the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to forecast bonus rates. That's why we give you them before the variable compensation. But the trend is a lower number of staff. We've taken the accounting charge under IFRS 2 on the acceleration of the accrual for the cash base, not on deferred compensation. So Q4 should see a significantly lower compensation charge overall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on the sale of the service center in Hyderabad. I think you still will use a service center, and thus I think the cost effect is not as much as 2,000 employees less, or will this service center in the future also be available for other companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We sold the service center to an existing provider of outsourcing, offshoring services. And the purpose of doing that was to improve the efficiency, increase the scale, improve the efficiency and control standards there. You're right that it does not lead to a reduction equivalent to a net loss of 2,000 people because we will continue to use that facility. We will also continue to operate our service center in Poland in Krakow, where we continue to hold and retain that in-house. But you're right, the cost base will improve as a result of the transaction. That's why we did it, but it won't improve by as much as the cost of 2,000 people.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to invite you to re-explain me something that you explained before in connection with this liquidity buffer that you are moving from the Investment Bank to the Corporate Center. I understand that you are reclassifying in connection with that certain assets from hold-to-maturity to available-for-sale. That was my understanding. Now in the same conference, you mentioned that the reclassification of assets a year ago which you made has deprived you to show a profit of CHF 1.8 billion I understand. Is there a connection between these two situations? This is my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is I would like you to tell us a little bit more about the key hires you have made in the quarter. You mentioned that several times, especially I understand in the fixed income division. How many people are talking about, what kind of people are those, et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on your first one, the liquidity buffer isn't technically being reclassified. We are letting it run off in the Investment Bank, which it does anyway. It turns over very, very frequently. And as it turns over, we're rebuilding it in the Corporate Center. And that's of very little relevance because the cost of the buffer was anyway charged out from the Investment Bank to the other divisions. A large amount of the costs were retained by the Investment Bank, but it charged the other divisions with some of the cost.</p>
          <p>Moving it to the Corporate Center doesn't change that because our cost allocation still works on the same or pretty much the same basis. So we're not technically reclassifying. And just a small correction, the assets in the Investment Bank were not held to maturity. They were in the trading book. And they now come out of the trading book, and because we don't hold big trading books in the Corporate Center, we are classifying them when we rebuild them as held available for sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That may not be forever because the accountants are proposing at the moment to abolish available-for-sale, but for the time being at least that's how we hold them. And the reason I raised this is so that the analysts could look in the quarterly report of the balance sheet and see the buffer being moved into the Corporate Center into a separate accounting category, a separate line on the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so there is no connection between that and the fact that we failed to recognize what would have been CHF 1.8 billion of trading revenues in the quarter. But because we reclassified certain assets last October-November-December quarter, then we hold those as loans and receivables, and we're not allowed to mark them up when their market value goes up. The fact that they go back and become worth a lot more means that potentially at some stage we could sell them. And the interest that we accrue on them is higher, but we're not allowed to mark them up in our books and take trading income. But had we not reclassified them, you're right; that would have been additional revenue and therefore additional pre-tax profit. But there is no connection between that and the liquidity buffer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the key hires, I suppose the most notable hire in the quarter was Mr. Robert McCann to come in to run our Wealth Management Americas business. And his arrival was the subject of a separate press release, so I'm sure you're aware of his arrival.</p>
          <p>I think the other ones that have received some coverage are in the fixed income division, although that's not where they have been confined to. We've hired some very good corporate financiers and corporate advisors, and we've hired some senior people into our equities business. We've rehired some people back to our equities business who had left us. We have new leadership, as you may know, in the Investment Banking Department, one gentleman who had been with us for some time, and then one who had been a head of Equities Trading come back to run our Corporate Advisory business.</p>
          <p>In fixed income, we've hired essentially a new team in credit trading, very few people left over from a small team we had beforehand and then in the rates business and the core fixed income businesses as we've hired a number of relatively senior people. They generally are salespeople and that would support our flow trading strategy because our strategy would be to originate and issue fixed income product and sell that to institutional shareholders. It's that distribution sales force that we've been building up. That's a slightly different model from the one that we had pre-crisis where we were essentially using our balance sheet as a principal repository for fixed income product and not selling it and distributing it properly frankly and as effectively as we should have done, so a lot of building up of sales and distribution forces.</p>
          <p>I think again it's fair to say that the Investment Banking team will present this in more detail and probably names you don't already know at the Investor Day. But there is a lot more information on what we've done and how we've shaped the strategy of the Investment Bank and where we'll be focusing in the future.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello. I have some questions on the Wealth Management side. I was wondering if you could go more into detail in Asia Wealth Management. Is there hiring ongoing on relationship managers in Asia or do you see more a flat amount of relationship managers? And you gave in the second quarter a statement that you had maybe money inflows. Can you give a similar statement for the third quarter? And regarding gross margins, do you see an increase in gross margins from the Asian business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On hiring in Asia, the answer is a categoric yes. We are definitely hiring there. On the net inflows, we did have net inflows in Q2. In Q3, we had very, very modest net outflows. And on the gross margin, Asia has historically been slightly lower than our average gross margin, but we will present in a couple weeks time a number of plans generally to improve our margins across the board. So yes, Asia would be included in that strategic thrust to improve our revenues.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And in FICC business, can you give some kind of run rate for the fourth quarter or for 2010, where it's going? It was very good, about 1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Is that going to improve you think for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you we'd like it to improve. I think what we prefer to do is take you through in quite considerable detail at the Investor Day the plans we have for FICC. And you'll be able to see hopefully the breakdown between the different asset classes as to where we think our revenues can come from and what ambition levels we have for each of those. But at the moment, you're right. The current run rate for Q3 was around about 1 billion, a little over perhaps. And it has been for the past couple quarters in the 1 billion to 1.5 billion range.</p>

          <p>The last question for today is from Mr. Jacques-Henri Gaulard, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Where do you think &#x2013; how can you gauge the situation vis-&#xE0;-vis the regulator today, I would say, at UBS?  Do you think is it better? Are people a bit more relaxed vis-&#xE0;-vis you? Do you have the feeling you can do more what you want to do?</p>
          <p>And vis-&#xE0;-vis the buffer, are you being able to actively bring it down as much as you would want to? So overall temperature assessment really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got lots of fans at the regulator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The liquidity buffer is really driven now by management's best estimate of a reasonable stress scenario for cash outflow in the bank. So we're doing it on the same basis as I imagine every other bank should assess its requirement for a liquidity buffer. And so although it's higher than we would hope longer term to have a buffer, that's principally the result of the fact that we have no IFRS profitability, which is weighing a bit on the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The client flows are less relevant because they are generally not in the form of anything on the balance sheet. Their content is off the balance sheet. Again that must be a contributory factor just to this the potential stresses on a liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>As for relations generally with regulators, I think they're fine although there is a general change I think in the air in relation to capital and in relation to funding and liquidity supervision. And it was going to be one of the topics that I was going to address when I speak at the Investor Day in a couple of weeks time, is just look at the whole regulatory capital debate, look at capital allocation for us, and then gate that in the context of the new funding and liquidity requirements that are emerging. But I don't think in Switzerland &#x2013; we have tripartite regulation with FINMA [Financial Market Supervisory Authority] taking the lead with the Fed and the FSA. So we see all three of those regularly. And I don't think there is anything happening in Switzerland that is particularly out of line with international standards. So I think it's fine, but regulations are tightening. So if you're looking for returns of capital anytime soon, don't.</p>
