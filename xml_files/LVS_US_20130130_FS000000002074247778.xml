          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Dustin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand the call over to our host, Mr. Daniel Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we're making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may discuss adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted property EBITDA, and hold-adjusted property EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. We also want to inform you that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website for your use.</p>
          <p>With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today are Mike, Rob, Chris, Ken, and we look forward to addressing your questions in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Well, we had a record quarter. On a hold-adjusted basis, we generated $1.1 billion in EBITDA and $0.63 in earnings per share. But first I would like to provide a progress report on the execution of our four principal strategic objectives.</p>
          <p>One, deliver organic growth from our existing property portfolio. Two, deliver additional growth through new investments in our current markets. Three, identify new integrated resort development opportunities in geographic areas outside of our current markets of Macao, Singapore, Las Vegas, and Pennsylvania. And four, increase the return of capital to shareholders. I like that one.</p>
          <p>First, organic growth. I will highlight our record performance in Macao where our industry-leading scale and infrastructure investments enable us to deliver robust market-leading growth in the world's largest and most profitable gaming market. For the quarter, our market share gross gaming revenue in Macao was 21.1%, up from 15.5% last year. That's a 36% growth in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:03). Rolling volume was up 37.1% this quarter to a record $39 billion. That represents VIP market share of approximately 18% of rolling volume for the quarter compared to just 12.8% one year ago. That's a 40% increase in market share rolling volume.</p>
          <p>Equally impressive is our strong growth and momentum in the mass market in Macao. Due to its higher margin structure, this segment is far more important to our future cash flow and bottom line results. That doesn't mean that we're going to ignore the VIP or any other segment, but we just want to point out that this has a very, very robust potential. Our mass table win in Macao for the quarter was up a whopping 52.6% to more than US$769 million, another company record. Our unrivaled strength in this segment allows us to lead the pack in EBITDA generation in the Macao market today, as we always have.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, our investments in that portfolio of integrated resorts on the Cotai Strip in Macao, featuring dining, retail, entertainment, and the hotel room capacity so vital to serving the mass gaming segment uniquely position us to deliver strong cash flow growth in Macao. Our mass table game productivity again improved meaningfully this quarter, with win per mass table per day across our portfolio of properties expanding by over 33% to reach a record US$9,716 per day. Our mass win per table per day was a record at every property in our portfolio, with the Four Seasons increasing 68% and The Venetian Macao increasing 47.8%. Wow, I'm full of figures today.</p>
          <p>Sands Cotai Central continues its steady ramp, with the mass table and slot businesses each reflecting meaningful growth this quarter. Total mass wins per day, which includes revenue from mass table games, electronic table games, and slot machines, increased by 65.4% compared to the quarter ended <mark type="ph" /> September (5:39). We welcomed over 13 million visitors to our Cotai Strip properties in the fourth quarter, including over &#x2013; this is whopping &#x2013; over 5 million in the month of December alone. When you annualize that, you're coming to twice &#x2013; that every visitor to Macao came in at least twice.</p>
          <p>We recently opened a fully enclosed climate-controlled pedestrian walkway with escalators and moving sidewalks to promote greater interconnection of and accessibility between our Cotai Strip traffic. The pedestrian walkway links Sands Cotai Central and its almost 6,000 hotel rooms on the east side of the Cotai Strip, with The Venetian Macao and Four Seasons on the west side, promoting easier access between all our Cotai Strip properties.</p>
          <p>And as additional amenities mature, including the 2,100 new Sheraton hotel rooms and the additional gaming capacity that came online earlier this week, and as the massive infrastructure projects underway throughout China make it easier for more people residing outside Guangdong province to efficiently and conveniently reach Macao, we believe our interconnected Cotai Strip properties will comprise an ideal platform for growth in the world's largest and most profitable gaming market.</p>
          <p>Stepping back to the opening of the pedestrian crossway between the east side of the Strip and the west side of the Strip, we have, as expected, increased the retail sales the first week or two &#x2013; the first couple of weeks &#x2013; I think almost the whole first month &#x2013; by about 45% on the second floor of the Four Seasons. It's also increased the first level. And we significantly increased the retail sales on Cotai Central on the first, second and third floors. Turning to &#x2013; well, this provides additional value to us when we get to the point of monetization of our retail assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The US$16.5 billion in <mark type="ph" /> roll (8:18), is the second highest quarterly total on record and missed setting the property record by only a slim margin. If we held 2.85% against that rolling volume, we would have produced EBITDA of $406 million this quarter at Marina Bay Sands.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to strategic objective number two, development growth in our current markets. In Macao, we will also develop The Parisian, which will be our fourth integrated resort property on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The Parisian will add another interconnected integrated resort property to our portfolio on the Cotai Strip. We've received the requisite government approvals and are now starting construction in The Parisian. Our site preparation work is well underway. We are targeting the opening of The Parisian for late 2015.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to strategic objective number three, development of integrated resource in new markets and geographic areas. We're committed to identifying and executing on new development opportunities in Asia and as we have had teams on the ground for some time in Japan, Korea and Vietnam, and we will continue to work on these promising metrics. We've also been investigating opportunities elsewhere around the globe including Europe, North America, and South America. In December, the government of the region in Madrid passed legislation that outlines the regulatory framework to enable integrated resort development in the Madrid region. There are a variety of steps left in the development process, which continues to move along.</p>
          <p>As we've said in the past, we'll only pursue projects with EBITDA returns in excess of 20% on investment. As the company's largest shareholder, I naturally have a vested interest of pursuing only the highest valued projects that will maximize shareholder returns. Your interest and my interest are aligned.</p>
          <p>Turning to strategic objective number four, return of capital to shareholders. The board and I were pleased to be able to return nearly $3.1 billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends in 2012. It is gratifying that we have now built our business and cash flows and strengthened our balance sheet to a degree that we were able to return such substantial sum while retaining sufficient liquidity to fund our promising growth opportunities. We have every intention of increasing the recurring dividend in the years ahead, hopefully the months ahead and our business and cash flow steadily grow.</p>
          <p>Before moving to your questions, I want to point out an asset of the company that we will continue to highlight, our retail mall business in Asia. We generated over $128 million in revenues. That's a 16.9% increase over the result from one year ago. Net operating income reached a record $110 million in the quarter. We believe our Asian retail mall assets are among the most valuable retail assets of their type in the world, and at cap rates with similar assets in Asia, could easily approach $9 billion to $10 billion in revenue. Eventual sale or monetization of those assets, which is an important component of our fundamental business strategy, will fill our coffers and allow us to greatly increase the return of capital to shareholders in the future.</p>
          <p>In closing, let me emphasize my confidence about the future of our company. With our outstanding strategic positioning and a disciplined, experienced leadership team we have in place to execute our strategy, I couldn't be more optimistic about the future.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike to begin the Q&amp;A session.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheldon. Operator, may we please have the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Solid results. I just wanted to see if I could start by asking about Singapore. Looks like the volumes there were very strong. Could you give us any color about just the trends that you guys saw across the quarter? How Western New Year looked. And just kind of what you guys saw on the rebound, particularly on the VIP side that drove that big number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, it's Rob Goldstein. We, obviously a good quarter on the volume side, as far as the rolling segment. I would caution you that it's a very concentrated market. We're not sitting next to Mainland China. And so again, it remains concentrated. But we're seeing obviously happy with results in terms of the volume. More important, from my perspective, is the mass, the non-rolling and the slot ETG number was, I think a nice bounce from the bottom. Our high was 4.6% a day. We were north of 4.4% a day. And we see a recovery there, which I think that's more &#x2013; to me it's more important to us for long-term opportunity. That represents $1.1 billion of departmental income that annualized. So to me the rolling volumes will continue to vacillate. We could see some real growth. Or we could see it diminish. It depends on the players that visit that quarter. But to me the critical part for Singapore was the bounce back up to a number above 4.4% a day. And I hope we can trend back up.</p>
          <p>As we've mentioned previously, we have a sales team and a strategy in place to address the premium mass because we drive that premium mass from a tourist perspective and not be dependent on local Singaporeans, I think will bode very, very well in the future in Singapore. Clearly a $400 million normalized quarter is a damn good quarter. We're very happy with the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one more knit on that. The $400 million does not adjust for the $24 million. So we would probably add that back on a recurring basis as well, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then, switching over to Macao, obviously some really impressive property level margin numbers, I think that the question that we're getting from folks is just as we look forward here you guys look like you're really starting to take some share. Just any sense you can give to us about how you're kind of seeing customer behavior, maybe starting to look at things more like bookings, as we think about Chinese New Year and looking a little bit ahead here, given just how strong the rebound seems to have been in December and into January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even our new property we opened two days ago is 100% full. The new Sheraton Tower of 2,100 rooms, approximately is completely booked for <mark type="ph" /> January (15:33), and all the properties are booked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, we should take share. We've got the best products there to take share, because we have the most rooms, the most gaming space. I mean look, we're in a very fortunate position having enormous exposure in Macao and we should take share. Our retail, our footprint both in Cotai and the Peninsula, were in a very privileged position. So, yes, we're very happy with the quarter, but we think the best is ahead of us. Look, it's an extraordinary market from any perspective, the best in the world. We've got the most exposure there as far as gaming positions, retail space, sleeping rooms. So, to Sheldon's point, it just keeps getting better. As you know, the greatest predictor of a mass gamers place to gamble is where he sleeps and in our case with all these new rooms, we are in a position we should be taking share and doing very, very well in the future. And we're very fortunate obviously to have not just the mass, but the premium mass going our way as well. So, feel very bullish about what we did last quarter in Macao.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It applies to everybody, except the homeless.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And I guess the last one for me would be just a big picture strategic question, but you did bring up the &#x2013; in your prepared comments the retail space. Could you give any timeline or any sense of timing you guys could give to us about how you're thinking about that? I mean, I think, generically, we've heard in the past that you did want to get Cotai Central probably ramped up a bit further on the retail side before you looked to do maybe something more strategic, but any color or glimpse you guys could give to us on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, we've made no decision in terms of the timeline for retail disposal. I think as ramp-ups take place both in Singapore and Macao, they're always under consideration. We are getting our work done organizationally for when the time comes so that we'll be prepared for whatever disposal matter will take place, but there's no real indication now. We have still a long way to go in terms of building that business and we're seeing very significant increases in retail still in Macao and, of course, the other thing is that we are planning to do an additional shopping center in Macao with subject to government approval. Those plans are being submitted as we speak. So there's a long way to go before we'd actually put it on the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That piece of land that we're talking about putting up a standalone retail mall, a big one, with about 800,000 net rentable square feet, and potentially another 300,000 plus in The Parisian net. The only question occurs in my mind right now is whether or not we see a change in the cap rates coming up in front of us, because that would motivate us to move quicker. Or we should wait till we put up the new mall and The Parisian before we sell all the retail in Macao. We could also make a deal that we sell the current retail, the Four Seasons, the Grand Canal Shoppes and the shops in Cotai Central, and then with an understanding that somebody else will buy &#x2013; somebody will buy with a predetermined cap rate and a certain EBITDA number. The new mall &#x2013; by the way we already own the land for the mall, already own it. And we don't &#x2013; we're not to worry about getting a new piece of land.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful color. Great quarter, guys. Thanks. I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shaun.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, good afternoon. I have a couple of Singapore questions, put a little bit differently. Rob, you mentioned Singapore rolling shipments still at concentrated area. Is it getting less concentrated by looking at either geographic sources or number of players, and the big volume increase relative to what we're expecting on the Rolling Chip, is that more players or is that more wagering per player? And then, I have a couple of follow-ups on that and credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It all remains unchanged, it's again you're down in different part of the world we're independent on mainland Chinese, Indonesians, and Malaysians, as well as PRs from Singapore, but I would say that it's a very concentrated market, and unfortunately I don't see that growing as quickly on the spread of customers. We want to see it grow, that's our intent, that's our design of our program. But frankly, I don't see a whole lot of change quarter-to-quarter to tell you otherwise.</p>
          <p>I do see it changing on the premium mass segment. I think we're seeing significant movement. I think our team there is starting to unearth some opportunities outside of, we want to move to a more tourist based segment, in the mass &#x2013; premium mass, and again I think that's where I think there's real growth potential to add more customers, add more a desirable mix of people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That partially answered my second question on Singapore. Looking at the price...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, Joe, but I'll be redundant here, is that, that segment in my perspective that's where the real &#x2013; because of the margins and all that the opportunity there is much more material to us than the rolling segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you guys see a tangible benefit in the fourth quarter from some of the new hires that are trying to target that higher frequency premiums mass gamer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say we saw a tangible benefit. I think we're starting to see it in the first quarter. I think we'll see it progressive throughout this year. Frankly, we're doing two things. We're revisiting our database in the premium mass. We're also opening offices. And I think you'll see that progress fully in 2013. I do think there's real opportunity to grow this segment materially as we get into 2013 and 2014. I think this is a very good move for us. It's very fortunate we're doing this. And I think that's where our big upside in the short term is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. In the slide deck &#x2013; on the slide deck on your website, you have the slide regarding Singapore credit collections. One thing there, maybe you could help answer is the aging of those credit collections. Are you seeing improvement there i.e. are you seeing the older credit outstanding start to come down? Or is it the relatively newer-issued credit that's in that collections number more recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mixed bag. I mean I don't think it's &#x2013; I wouldn't characterize it either way. There are some aging issues in Singapore because we found that market like Las Vegas is that customers will go somewhere else if they want to wait longer to pay. So it's a longer cycle we ever anticipated. On the other hand, we collected $377 million in the fourth quarter, which is up significantly from the previous two quarters. I feel our balance is pretty good right now with our receivable mix versus our &#x2013; we've taken the balance again in terms of what has been a long year for us. Our reserves have grown significantly. But now we're at a point where we feel much more comfortable.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't characterize &#x2013; I'll be clear with this. Singapore is the most challenging credit market from a perspective of, a) highly concentrated; b) very little legal help in the region to collect; and c) there is no junket buffer. So as I said in the past, I remain optimistic, but cautious. It's &#x2013; when you're giving away a lot of credit to a smaller number of people and you don't have the legal remedies you have here in the U.S, it still remains a challenge. I don't want to represent that it's easy. It's not. But we're seeing nice collections, we keep ramping them up. I think we're in much more balanced place vis-&#xE0;-vis collections and our &#x2013; what we've done in the last 12 months, I think was the right approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And the one thing I'd add to that is we've issued a big number in terms of credit drop, almost $13 billion. We've collected almost $12 million of that. So when you think of it in terms of kind of signs of issue, as we talked about in the past, any collection issues we have are really specific to isolated accounts as opposed to systemic problems across the portfolio. And our receivable balance now, if you back out the open programs is about almost 30% &#x2013; the reserve is almost about 30% of the receivables balance. I think we're in pretty good shape as we talked about before that number will continue to grow a little bit. But we're getting up there where it will get to that 35% or so, which we think will be about a stabilized reserve percentage in relation to receivable balance. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say on average that you're seeing collections on average shorter to collect? And are you seeing the average aging come down as well? Or has it been pretty consistent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think the collections have been very consistent. I think the issue with regard to the aging is just those kind of &#x2013; those isolated accounts that are problems, those obviously age out until we get collections on that. But the vast majority of it is pretty consistent from a collection standpoint. And if you look out kind of going back over the last, I don't recall, the 8 to 10 quarters, when you get out about six months and you look back in terms of our collections, we collect about 95% to 97% of the amounts that are outstanding. So it's those things that are, in essence, problems that end up aging longer. But I don't think it's really the bulk of the accounts, the bulk of the accounts are collected within, in essence, that first six months, the majority of them even shorter than that. But after six months we're about 95% to 97% collected.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then switching over to Macao, this will be my final question. You referenced in the fourth quarter at The Venetian Macao, there were some renovation disruptions from the work that you do in that Paiza Club. Do you think you were able to kind of capture that business at your other properties? Or were you able to &#x2013; are you able to quantify the net impact there, in fact, what may have been even a stronger quarter in Macao, absent those 29 fewer active rolling tables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's hard to quantify, Joe. The one nice thing though now, having just been there this month the one nice thing about it is that you can now access across that bridge right into Four Seasons, right into SCC. So I think get a lot more access so people are comfortable with The Venetian. They couldn't find a place to play.</p>
          <p>I think we have a hard time quantifying, but anytime you get to the numbers we're doing, The Venetian is the most potent product in Macao. It's hitting on all cylinders, all gaming segments, lodging, retail. The scale and theme we're building just translates well in the market. And no matter where the Macao market goes, The Venetian will participate. So I think it's by far the most important part of our portfolio right now. And I don't think that 29 tables have had a major impact either way. I do think that Venetian as it gets more tables on the floor and these numbers coming up at the mass and the VIP, I mean the balance in The Venetian is staggering to me. It's just the most balanced product in Macao by far. And our results speak to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. A couple questions. First, Ken, should we no longer use for Singapore this range of hold of 2.7% to 3%, which is I think historically what we've been assuming, because essentially over the past 11 periods, you've been all over that. And I think it's only 1 in 11 where you've come in there and I understand the issues. But should we just start to widen out the range? Is that how you're starting to think about the whole percentage in Singapore, or will at some point it start to narrow down? And then second question, $24 million property tax assessment, I'm sorry if I've missed that. What is that for in Singapore? And then finally, expansion, in particular the hotel stock, at some point you've talked about trying to do something with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just talk to the normalization. I'm sure, Rob, will want to comment on that and the property tax, and then I'll turn it over to Rob. But I think that 2.7% to 3% range is still inappropriate kind of range for Singapore. And when we normalize we use the midpoint of the range. With regards to the property tax, the issues that we got basically at the very end of the year, we got an additional assessment from the government of about $24 million. At least a-third of that pertains to 2011. The balance pertains to 2012. We're still going through that to see what it pertains to. But certainly, the balance of the $13 million that's specific to 2012 doesn't all belong in that fourth quarter. It would have to be spread basically ratably over the year. So obviously it was impactful to our fourth quarter numbers. And part of it, as I said before, doesn't even pertain to 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, it's Rob. On the range, I wouldn't change a thing. Since we opened the property, I don't know if you know this that our life-to-date since the day we opened in 2010 is 2.7% and it will remain at 2.7%, 3% property. The only thing different in Macao than Singapore is the volumes, obviously, in Macao are deeper. The player base is deeper. But when it's all said and done, we're at 2.7% even after experiencing a horrific year this year on a few small customers who still &#x2013; the math is the math is the math. And in the end, those people who won some money will come back and lose it back. It isn't that complicated. I wouldn't change a thing. I would leave your range at 2.7% to 3% because you're in the range after a lot of bad quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So even though the quarter is &#x2013; what you're saying then, is truly you're saying, is that they all offset each other. So from the 2.18% to the 3.34% to 3.58%, they all offset. And you're saying that when you add them all up, it comes out right to 2.7% or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's 2.7%, and Macao is over 3%.</p>

I think Singapore has been &#x2013; here's my bet, if you have a lot of Asian people betting a lot of money for a lot of time you're going to do just fine. In Las Vegas, at The Venetian and Palazzo, we've handled billions of dollars, we're holding 27% lifetime here. It's the greatest market in the world with the greatest gamers, I wouldn't worry one bit about it. The math will prove out just fine.</p>

          <p>We've been talking about Tower 3 putting a new VIP facility up there for some period of time. I was in Singapore just a few weeks ago and we did receive a request for information from the government from certain government agencies about putting more details on the request, which we are now submitting. But I don't expect you'll see something like that happen because there's about a year construction period where it would happen. As far as additional rooms are concerned and additional buildings, we've had some conversations but nothing is quite moving forward at this point.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of projections and what have you, I would not feel comfortable that you would have projections of that for some period of time and we'll give you updates as soon as we get them, but the construction periods would be really a year for the tower and probably considerably more than that for the room addition and the building addition.</p>

          <p>Let me just add one other thing, we are investing significant capital in the building now, doing more facility work inside the casino in the Ruby Room and others, redoing it, expanding it, making it better.

But we don't have any sign that it's imminent; we don't have any sign that it's far away. But, Singapore moves at its own pace and we'll just have to wait until they give us an okay.</p>

          <p>our next question comes from the line Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Switching gears back to Macao, your table efficiency improved nicely in the quarter. That's obviously been a goal of yours so that's been great to see. Just wondering if you could discuss some things that you're doing to continue to drive table efficiency in the market? And if you could, perhaps, Rob, this is a question for you. Just discuss your plans to improve/grow your premium mass presence in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks for the compliment. We feel we're making progress. I think Ed and David have just done a terrific job and our goal over there is to make all our tables work harder.</p>
          <p>To your point, the only profit we had that we feel very balanced with right now despite our great results is The Venetian. I mean, the win <mark type="ph" /> for us (33:43), both on the premium mass, mass and the junket are just terrific. We feel the balance is really right at The Venetian and that's why that property is just knocking the door down. But we have opportunities throughout the portfolio both downtown and in Cotai to do a lot better, in my opinion. I think it's a segment &#x2013; we have 1,500 tables with the additional 200 tables we were given by the government this week. And so our goal is to &#x2013; we're agnostic as far as what segment we're in. The highest performing tables or segments get the tables.</p>
          <p>I think the growth is clear downtown we think, although our tenth year of operation, the place has found a real audience, especially in terms of the food program that Jeff and his team's put together downtown. We're embracing the high frequent day trip market like Guangdong. We think that we found a nice niche downtown in the peninsula and we're going to keep growing our business there. The focus there will be mass, premium mass for sure. We'll have some junket but we're not going to compete with people downtown. We're going to focus on mass, premium mass.</p>
          <p>The Palazzo is the most, I think of all of our opportunities that might be the greatest because clearly our junket performance is very strong. What David has done there is exceptional from where it began two years ago, where is that now. But what has happened is we're winning $19,000 a day on the mass side and of course that's premium mass. So if you multiply that times, let's say 50, or 60, or 70 tables, there could be huge potential growth there. And David and his team are looking at that today. And so we think there's big upside there to do better. Our slot win, by the way, was over $1,000 per unit per day at the Four Seasons. To me, you've got to rethink the balance there. As good as the junkets are we'll look at that opportunity.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, SCC, we're starting to really hit there but I think, as you &#x2013; that's our lowest performing in the portfolio in terms of the win from a non-junket, but non-rolling performance. Mass tables, they are the most sluggish in our group. With the new rooms opening, with the market booming, I think you'll see that improve dramatically. But like The Venetian, Sands SCC will remain more of a mixed product with lots of variety. The big focus obviously is your main return on table and with so much exposure in the market we can do better and we will do better. I think there's a clear indication that our room base, our retail base, our food offerings, and the plethora of things we offer at all these properties puts us in a very unique position to do better. And that is our sole focus, Felicia, as far as Macao. We see terrific upside. We're privileged to be in the market with all that growth.</p>
          <p>And, frankly, we're not tied to any one segment. We're tied to making money and productivity. And one thing I will say is one market we're in that almost no one else is in and that's the mass-mass. Our exposure to pure mass, not premium mass is incredibly important to us.</p>
          <p>So when you look around and see the SCC or The Venetian, we can get those places to making $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 a day on a pure mass play, it's going to be very, very important to our growth. And people right now are all focused on premium mass. We're there, but we're really focusing as well on the mass-mass. We had kind of a monopoly due to pricing and table count.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Felicia. We're in constant conversation, Ed, Tracy and myself just met with the government a couple of weeks ago when I was in Asia. I think that in regarding the Cotai and all of the new products that are coming on Cotai. You're not going to see any real conclusion on distribution of new tables there for a number of months since. I think the government has assured us as well as others that they're going to operate appropriately with these hotels and casinos which you're going to see developed but there's no firm commitment yet as to who is going to get what. But we've been told, I assume the others have been told the same thing, that in their own time they will make up their mind and treat everybody adequately. That's how we're going today as we get to financing on Site 3. We're in the ground now, and we're going forward with the project on the anticipation it all will be well but it will be some period of time before you see an absolute commitment for us as well as others, I believe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the government is &#x2013; we trust the government that they're going to treat everybody fairly. They have a &#x2013; there's been more publicity about our competitors buying the land. They make a big deal about it when they close the land. But we've owned the land since 2007. We've owned Lot 3 since 2007. And so, however they treat everybody else they're going to treat us. We're confident of that.</p>
          <p>And just like the 200 tables was allocated to us several years ago because we couldn't have got the financing without the assurance of tables and they kept their commitment we're very happy over that. And I'm sure that we'll be treated the same but certain like in a different category because everybody was talking about getting the land and what they're going to build, we already own the land. So, we've been assured by the government we're going to be treated like everybody else. And they seem to be giving &#x2013; they said they're going to give preference to those companies that build more non-gaming and of course that's our specialty. We developed them a little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then, just my final question, Rob, back to Singapore, you definitely talked about mass win per day, and how you're pleased with the level you have in the quarter, but I'm also assuming that you'd love to grow that. So, how should we think about the kind of optimal levels there, or your goals, rather?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our goal, if you recall a year ago was, we were trending, we're at 4%, 6% a quarter, our goal is at 5%, and it all came apart. So, our goal is to get back to &#x2013; keep growing again. I can't define where we want to get to because I don't know how high up really is. I have this belief that we have been given an opportunity to go after the tourist-based market and not be dependent on the local market. I think there's a lot of people in Jakarta, in KL and out in the region in general that are premium mass customers. I don't know how high we should be thinking about that. I just think we need to do a lot better than 4.4% a day. I'm pleased we got back to that, but I think the team over there, we've hired some very good people, and we're putting management and sales team in place. I feel there's a lot of potential to grow that segment.</p>
          <p>I don't want to define it. Is it 4.8% a day? 5% a day? I don't know. I just believe we're going to get more out of that region than we have in the past, and more out of that segment. And that's a 65% to 70% margin segment. So, to drive Marina Bay Sands to a higher level, that's going to be the most important indicator, the most important metric, is that win per unit per day non-rolling tables, slot, ETG.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that a lot of people are talking about possibility of different emerging markets coming out. We are of the opinion that a lot of the U.S. markets have been over-saturated or about to be over-saturated. And we keep our eye open, but we don't want to get, we don't want to compete with the good job that Caesars is doing on the riverboat market and the small casino market out there. We know that we're the experts in integrated resorts and I think anybody we approach the various governments understand that and what it can do for them and their tourism efforts.</p>
          <p>But there's no reason to &#x2013; we don't want to liquidate. We don't want to sell any of our assets because we don't want to sell the keys to the kingdom. Our basic differentiation, beside the integrated resort model or the multi-disciplined resort offering is how do we fill the hotel rooms we think is because of the MICE market: the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions. That is very critical to us. So we sell out to anyone of our properties, somebody is going to learn how to make the key to our kingdom. We don't want that to happen.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have people there on a constant basis and we're constantly talking to the powers that be and to be. But as you can see, the Japanese just re-elected another &#x2013; they went to the opposite party from the one that was governing. And they, in the past, have been favorably inclined to doing IRs with casinos. There's absolutely no reason why Japan should welcome IRs with open arms. They want more tourism. And there's a great, great, fantastic location there if we could get it. And I think if they got serious, very serious about it, which they may be now, because there is an inter-party &#x2013; about 125 members inter-party commission that's been put together to on a non- Parisian basis to study the issue of IRs. So we're just going to have to wait. The Asians don't move as fast as we can here in Las Vegas, but we're on it. If there's anybody that's on it, and anybody that's doing it, that's keeping their finger in the pulse, it's us. We know how good would Singapore &#x2013; we know how good one of these locations could be.</p>

You look at our numbers in Singapore, they're unbelievable and they're getting better by the day in Macau. So I think there's no reason to think that market doesn't continue to boom. We're very bullish on ETGs.</p>

          <p>And then, just last question on Parisian. Can you give us a sense of what you would expect to spend yourself for The Parisian in 2013, 2014 and 2015?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The total project cost, Harry, we're estimating at somewhere around $2.6 billion all in. It could range up a little bit, but that number's actually been approved by our board as for the capital cost of the building. That's including what we put in before. In terms of the investment as to how the cash will go out, probably we'll be using about $700 million roughly of SCL cash and the rest will be financed. Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello? Yeah, we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Ken can speak a word about that to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so to answer your question with regard to 2013 is going to be probably just over about $400 million, 2014 is going to probably be around $1 billion, maybe a little bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They aren't talking about what the financing. I think Harry was referring to our equity portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, the cash outlay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, oh, oh, I see. Well, then as Mike talked about, it's going to be around $600 million or $700 million and it should go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've just cut out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, $600 million to $700 million, and then that for the most part will go up ratably. A little bit more upfront in 2013 and then the balance kind of spread over 2014 and with a little bit in 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the last question that I had it's really a housekeeping item going back to Singapore. You made a comment that you feel like your reserves there are essentially where you think that they're appropriate. Do you think that at this point or from this point on that your actual dollar outlay for your reserve can actually decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned before, we're still building up on a percentage basis. We're at about 29%. We <mark type="ph" /> probably get to (48:30) about 35% or so in terms of the receivable balance. And so, yeah, I do think over time it could come down a little bit. But we're still going to be spending a fair amount each quarter, maybe a little bit less than what we've done in 2012, but it'd still be fairly close to that. Because if you think about it, we're still issuing a tremendous amount of credit on an annual basis and we want to make sure that we're appropriately reserved. So we'll be booking reserves consistent with the amount of credit that we're issuing. So, if it comes down, it'll be incrementally down, but it should be just marginally lower, if not the same.</p>

          <p>That's very helpful and it does it for me. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a question for Rob or perhaps Sheldon. As we think about Parisian, one thing that seems to become clearer is that more and more of these developments on Cotai are going to be much more heavily branded and much more heavily themed. The feedback we've had on The Parisian and Eiffel Tower theme has been very strong. What's your sense when you talk to customers about how that brand and theme will resonate as the property opens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we can only point to The Venetian and its property theme. It's been very well received. And the Chinese people are curious, interested in foreign locations and the appearance of it. I think that the uniqueness of having an architectural icon like the &#x2013; as the Eiffel Tower, I think that would be very well received. People speak very optimistically about the fact that the Chinese people will like it, they'll flock to it. It was challenging to get a walkway or elevator and getting it over to where the restaurant is at the base of the &#x2013; about a third of the way up to tower. We're trying to be as authentic as we can. We learned from building The Venetian here that what brings the family being in the thematic location is the construction and the development of the landmarks and the icons. And certainly the Eiffel Tower is the most iconic structure in the world, and we're going to do a good job on that, I think they're going to come there. Listen, it's going to be gangbusters, it'd be tremendous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to Sheldon's point, you look at the scale and the theming of The Venetian, the only place that might make more sense and the only place they want to visit more perhaps than Venice is Paris. And I think our research indicates that the Chinese folks want to get to Paris just like my wife wants to get to Paris. And I think you're going to find that &#x2013; I think it's a great theme, a great concept. And if you look at The Venetian's performance, it's so nimble and it works on all cylinders because it's not just theme, it's got scale, it's got the food product, it works on all different levels, lodging, retail.</p>
          <p>I think what's been designed for The Parisian honestly is as good as The Venetian, maybe better. Pretty extraordinary product. We feel confident. Our customer feedback on The Parisian team is exceptionally strong and positive. And to your point I think it's a lot like Vegas was in the 1990s when we built The Venetian here, there's a desire to see a theme property, a theme experience that speaks very, very well for the mass market as well as the high end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of our designers/architects is Parisian. He's a very well-known designer/architect in Paris and he was brought into one of our consultants and we're using him to get some authenticity for the entire property. It's going to look very authentic and I think the Chinese people, the Asians are going to be very excited about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And a lot of that dovetails with what we've heard on the ground. Just moving on, Rob, a question that relates to your earlier comments on the mass business. I mean one thing that surprised us was the strength in slot and hotel revenues in Macao in the quarter. How should we think about growth in those two segments going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know how you think about it, but I'm wildly bullish. I think that Macao is in its infancy. What Sheldon did in the Cotai Peninsula enabled the mass. If you think about, if it hadn't been the Cotai development, you would have been stuck as being landlocked on the Peninsula. I think what we've done is open up the floodgates to build these magnificent multi-thousand room hotels that enable the customers to have a place to sleep, a place to gamble, and we're just lucky enough to have yes, we're premium mass segment. Yes, we're junket segment. But we're kind of in a really weird place into the pure mass. And to your point, having just come back from there, when you look at the pure mass, non-premium mass, it is just extraordinary how much they're gambling and how much they're sleeping there, eating, it's a whole experience. And I think it's a &#x2013; I'm terrifically bullish on Macao and the mass business, not just the premium mass.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I'll now hand the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, everybody, for joining the call. As we close the call, it was a wonderful year for Las Vegas Sands Corporation. I think everybody realizes that. I think this is a year where we opened close to 6,000 hotel rooms in Macao, two additional casinos, a variety of food and beverage restaurants, expanded our capital investments, rehabilitated our Venetian hotel in Las Vegas, moved our Bethlehem numbers up to be the most successful property in Pennsylvania. I think the management team and the company's employees have done a marvelous job. I hope all of you recognize the work that they have done to get to these kinds of results. So thank you very much.</p>
