        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS' Q1 2008 earnings conference call. Louis Gallois, our CEO; and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about 1 hour and 15 minutes and should conclude at 12.15 P.M. Continental European Time. This includes Q&amp;A which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>This is also webcast on our home page with special banner Q1 2008 Earnings. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was emailed to you this morning with slides, which we will now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contained a safe harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now to Louis Gallois.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentleman. During the past quarter, I am pleased say that results benefited from combination of measures and the achieved results are better than expected. In a nutshell, strong revenues growth of 10%, surprisingly resilient ordering activity and good underlying performance. Hans Peter will go into these details at length today along with favorable phasing effect of Q1 coming from hedging, customer financing, and R&amp;D expenses.</p>
          <p>However, from the standpoint of our overall business, we still face challenges. Although we have made significant progress on the development and ramp-up of the A380 <mark type="inaudible" />. There are still obviously &#x2013; there are still significant levels of execution risk as we have previously discussed. You've seen that for the A380 yesterday.</p>
          <p>For a number of reasons, we must remain cautious in the way we characterize environment, pressure from the weak dollar, increasing old price, consolidation of the U.S. airline market. We are buffered against these factors to a large degree, thanks to our robust growth across the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Contributing to this commercial success are three factors &#x2013; demand for our excellent products, Airbus and Eurocopter, deliveries continued at record pace. Both divisions continue to be market leaders; an increasingly strong service offering for civil and parapublic and defense customers, the core element of our strategy; a much leaner, more efficient management and decision process than at any time in the EADS history.</p>
          <p>We see all three factors in play across EADS, for example at Eurocopter, where a strong service offering drives about 37% of the revenue stream. Our biggest challenge in the near-term then is offsetting the forward pressures on EBIT. As we'll discuss in a moment the current combination of hedging and cost reduction measures is important but not yet sufficient.</p>
          <p>We are not yet where we want to be in terms of cost reduction and restructuring, and we are attacking this problem as quickly as we can. We are about to implement the next round of Power8 measures even if divestment of various industrial facilities is a little bit delayed due to unfavorable financial and monetary environment.</p>
          <p>Further steps will be undertaken. I believe, however, that the market needs to take a holistic view of our company which is overall moving in a positive direction. We are really strict about our near-term EBIT pressures, the overall dynamic, however, is &#x2013; of the company, which is very much setting the  pace in the growth of every aspect of this business.</p>
          <p>Let me turn first, if I may, to the highlight of the quarter. On page two please remember that all forward-looking statements such as in our guidance are based on assumptions, as conditions may change, so may our positions and plans. I will now turn toward the main Q1 2008 business achievements. Hans Peter will follow with the group and division performance. Then I will close with discussion of our outlook and guidance.</p>
          <p>Now, on to page four. The Airbus Q1 order intake is substantially higher than the year ago, with 420 gross order versus 134 last year. Of course in the next quarters, I'd expect the pace of order intake should slow down.</p>
          <p>The A350 XWB is extremely well received. We've 356 firm orders from 21 customers, of which 64 new gross orders in the first quarter. The attractive A330 captures 51 new gross orders in Q1. As you are aware, we recently announced increases in the list price for Airbus aircraft.</p>
          <p>Our backlog remains at historical levels. This is a significant hedge against prospective downturn. Airbus delivered 8 more aircrafts in Q1 '08 than in Q1 '07, and set a new monthly record in March handing over 48 aircrafts to customers including two A380 to Singapore.</p>
          <p>In Q1 2008, EADS became the leading supplier to the Royal Air Force. As the U.K. selected AirTanker for 27-year air refueling contract. EADS owns 43% of AirTanker. The U.K. thus becomes the fifth customer after the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Australia and UAE to choose the A330 MRTT.</p>
          <p>For the FSTA program, MTA, our Military Transport Aircraft Division, will be responsible for the development of the aircraft for delivering 14 aircrafts to AirTanker and for part of the services. We have previously announced that Northrop Grumman won the competition of the U.S. tanker based on the A330 aircraft. A stop-work request has been issued due to the pending dispute filed by Boeing. It is not included in our order intake numbers, but it is obviously a major step to increase our U.S. footprint.</p>
          <p>A400M is progressing, first flight is progressing. First flight is scheduled for this summer. Engine installation is underway and the flying test bed is being readied to begin the flight test in June. The results of this test phase will be key to assess the program schedule. You're aware that the execution risk is high on that program.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter's backlog is at a record high following Heli-Expo with 299 orders in Q1 2008. The steep ramp-up leads to 102 deliveries including eight LUH for the U.S. Army and six NH90 in Q1. The medium-weight civil EC175 developed by &#x2013; with China prompted market interest at Heli-Expo.</p>
          <p>The ATV designed for the delivery of freight and population support to the station, and the Columbus laboratory developed and built by Astrium, both docked with the International Space Station. The ATV docking is a first ever automatic rendezvous of the space vehicle.</p>
          <p>Amongst the other business highlights of the past quarter is a successful acquisition of California based PlantCML, a leading provider of emergency response solutions and services in North America. This acquisition marks one of the first concrete steps in our Vision 2020 strategic plan and should enable us to grow our premier activities in the U.S., premier activities which are organically and internationally growing as well.</p>
          <p>You heard the A380 announcement and conference call yesterday, so I won't add much. It is far too early to draw hasty economic conclusion, also this could translate into further costs. The A380 ramp-up is proceeding, so we are not facing the catastrophe of two years ago, but it is just not fast enough. We need to keep the Airbus teams that have already done a remarkable turnaround focused on building up the delivery momentum sustainable and never relent. And thus our focus is on customers and how to accommodate their needs as best as possible, while of course minimizing impact on our performance.</p>
          <p>Now I leave the floor to Hans Peter to drive you through the financials of this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everybody. As Louis said, results are looking good especially taking into account the U.S. dollar impact. It shows despite all the program issues that underlying business is doing well. And at the same time, I'm sorry to say the complexity to reconcile performance remains high and we tried to help you a little bit on the dollar reconciliation on our slide.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to the financials, and now I am on page seven. First I would like to remind you that MBDA is now consolidated at 37.5% and Q1 2007 figures have been adjusted accordingly. In Q1 2008, revenues grew by a strong 10% and across all divisions, despite a negative dollar impact amounting to approximately 300 million. Higher deliveries in Airbus and Eurocopter, volume ramp-up in Astrium and Defence, and the achievement of the A400M milestone contributed positively to this increase.</p>
          <p>We will dig into EBIT explanation shortly, and I will emphasize the good underlying performance. Nevertheless, be aware that Q1 is benefiting from some favorable phasing effects. Order intakes surged, lifted mostly by Airbus order stream and the FSTA order intake, and backlog increased by 4% to record level despite a 17 billion euro negative revaluation hit at the deteriorated year-end dollar rate. The defence order book grew by 6% to 58 billion euros driven mainly by the FSTA contract.</p>
          <p>The impact of the dollar development is an important component of the analysis of the EBIT number. This is now on page eight. You are aware that Airbus loss making contract provisions are revalued at the closing spot rate causing volatility on earnings. This quarter this revaluation had a negative effect of more than 500 million euros taking the end of 2007 dollar euro closing rate as the reference rate.</p>
          <p>On the other hand the revaluation of trade liabilities and the mismatch between the currency rates at which pre-delivery payment flows where received, and the rates at the time of delivery had a positive impact of around 200 million euros. But Q1 benefited from temporary excess volume of matured hedges because those hedges were put in place before the A380 delivery shift of 2006.</p>
          <p>Later in the year less hedging volume will mature compared to the exposure causing a negative phasing impact in the second part of the year. Therefore if you compare Q1 2008 to Q1 2007 taking into account the impact described above in the bridge and the negative impact of the deterioration of the hedge rates, year-over-year the dollar impact is a negative 360 million euros from Q1 &#x2013; from 2007 to 2008.</p>
          <p>Last year EBIT was break down by the Power8 restructuring provision. This year no significant one-off charge happened. Neither in the Airbus nor in EADS except those described above. With R&amp;D slightly lower in Q1 2008 the improvement linked to operational performance amounts to roughly 360 million euros including Power8 contribution.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to page nine. There you can see that EBIT margin reached 7.8% in the first quarter. R&amp;D decreased to 534 million euros in Q1 2008, but is expected to ramp up through the year to close to 3 billion. The interest result mainly across higher average rates and net cash balance through the quarter. Meanwhile other financial result declined by about 264 million euros. This is mainly due to the revaluation of dollar cash assets at the closing spot of 158, and due to the unwinding of the discount on provisions, whose present value grows as we move towards their consumption.</p>
          <p>The earnings improvement leads to a tax expense of 125 million euro, compared to a tax benefit of 17 million last year. The tax rate is therefore around 30% in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line, it leads to a net income of 285 million euros for Q1 2008, compared to a loss of 10 million in Q1 of last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, net cash in Q1 2008 exceeds our expectations and benefits from favorable seasonality effects. The robust 1.3 billion euro gross cash flow from operation increases in line with the improvement of the operational performance. Nevertheless I have to point out that in the next quarter, significant amount should be consumed for settlement restructuring expenses and CapEx.</p>
          <p>In Q1 2008, working capital has a neutral effect on cash flow. Increase of pre-delivery payments of 1 billion euros across all divisions and inflow from customer payment offset the 0.6 billion euro usual growth of inventories from Defence, Eurocopter and Astrium divisions and payments to Airbus suppliers.</p>
          <p>The most significant difference compared to last year is the impact of the change in working capital. Inventory grew much less than last year on the A380 and on the A400M program. In the meantime pre-delivery payment flows linked to Airbus order was more favorable this year than last year in Q1.</p>
          <p>Investing activities consumed only 0.3 billion euros of cash in Q1 2008, but CapEx especially on A350 is expected to ramp up through the year. We expect CapEx to reach around 2.6 billion or a bit more for the full year.</p>
          <p>In Q1 2008, we still managed to reduce slightly our customer financing exposure. Cash flow from customer financing is expected to be negative for the rest of 2008. Free cash flow before customer financing has improved significantly to &#x20AC;1.1 billion at the end of March 2008 versus &#x20AC;785 million last year. Despite the seasonality effect on settlements, restructuring expenses in CapEx, we envisage upside on our free cash flow before customer financing guidance.</p>
          <p>Then let's turn to page 11, where we have the hedging policy slide. While the dollar depreciated, we kept hedging. While only $4.8 billion of hedge is matured, $8.6 billion of new hedges where done in Q1 2008. At the weighted average rate of $145 per euro which is the plan rate. It is worth mentioning that interest spreads between currencies mitigated the impact of the extensively deteriorated dollar spot rate on dollar forward rates.</p>
          <p>The high order inflow dilutes the hedged Airbus eligible exposure to around 55%. Nevertheless, even if we modify the phase of hedging activities, we make sure net exposure for the next two calendar years is roughly hedged.</p>
          <p>We told you already that we are using more options and increasingly implementing structured forward transactions as a complement to classical forward. Now Louis is going to take the slide on Power8 and the Airbus slide. Louis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. Against the deteriorating hedges, we are addressing our cost structure and the first step off is of course to implement Power8. Right now, more than 4,000 people are committed to making Power8 happen. The overall plan is on track, delivering a both targets for some more use but we know targets are changing.</p>
          <p>At the year end, measures already implemented since inception should generate annual cost savings of around &#x20AC;750 million. Measures about to be implemented around &#x20AC;300 million more and potential actions and new ideas could add around &#x20AC;350 million.</p>
          <p>Cost saving runs through the EBIT and the inventory lines.</p>
          <p>So dollar development forces us to go beyond Power8 and we are working to design it properly in the civil water. Structural measures tackling our industrial footprint to dollarize aggressively our cost base, will be progressively implemented over time.</p>
          <p>So, termination of negotiations for the sale of certain Airbus sites does not change the site disbursement strategy, as I said, and we will proceed with the come out of the sites in two separate units to prepare the sites for sales at the later stage.</p>
          <p>Thanks to cash performance of Power8, so far significantly above target and our air force reduce costs, we are able to maintain the cash and EBIT Power8 savings targets previously 0communicated. Regarding risk sharing partnership, we are still working on but the &#x20AC;1.8 billion amount seems within reach.</p>
          <p>Let's dig into the divisional earnings now.</p>
          <p>On the Airbus, Airbus continues to break delivery records as we said. The supply chain remains under pressure, but is being monitored carefully. The Airbus order books remain robust as I said 420 new gross orders in the quarter boosted the book to build ratio despite a higher number of deliveries.</p>
          <p>Gross order intake is split predominately between the fast growing Asia-Pacific airlines and leasing companies. Legacy carriers and lessors are the largest contributors to recent order activity, with value activity in the U.S. and in Europe.</p>
          <p>Airbus's backlog has a diverse regional spread. Asia-Pacific is the largest region accounting for 34% of the backlog. Europe and lessors account for 18 and 16% respectively. North America represents 11% of the backlog. This last ratio is important. Some have expressed concern that the consolidation trend among U.S. airlines may precipitate the contraction in demand. As you see, we are limited &#x2013; we have limited exposure to this market.</p>
          <p>Revenues are up 7% driven by the growth in deliveries and A400M Power-On milestone. It is impacted by price deterioration and dollar impact even if the seasonality of hedging volume mitigates this impact.</p>
          <p>Q1 2008 EBIT is mainly driven by the excellent performance of the deliveries of the A320 and A330, and improvement of the A380 loss before the revaluation of loss making contract, closing spot rate. It is weighted down by the different dollar impacts already mentioned and the continuing price deterioration and aircraft delivered.</p>
          <p>Future quarters should be more negatively impacted by potential customer financing expenses even the first &#x2013; the first quarter has been low on the topic. It could be impacted also by the increase of R&amp;D and the reversal of the positive volume hedging impact of Q1.</p>
          <p>Hans Peter is going to drive you through the other divisions. Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis. Let's turn to MTA on page 15. In Q1 2008, the division's revenues grew to 636 million, mainly due to the achievement of the A400M power-on milestone. It's approximately 420 million euros. Two C-295 were delivered to the Spanish Air Force this quarter compared to only one to Brazil in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>EBIT is therefore improving from a 13 million euro loss in Q1 2007 to a 1 million euro loss for the same quarter this year. We mentioned the award of the FSTA contract for 14 A330 MRTT. It fuels the order intake of the quarter for a total value of approximately 3 billion euros, covering for the delivery of the 14 A330 and part of the corresponding services to be provided in the 27 year concession period.</p>
          <p>The UAE and U.S. tanker contracts are not yet included in our backlog. Even if the U.S. Air Force awarded the KC-45A tanker contract to Northrop Grumman / EADS, Boeing has filed a protest of that award with the Government Accountability Office as you know and a stop work request was issued. A final decision from the GAO on the merits of Boeing's protest is expected by the end of June.</p>
          <p>On the development side the new refueling boom, which has a larger refueling envelope and better control, successfully performed its first in-flight wet contact with a fighter plane and fuel was passed.</p>
          <p>Regarding the A400M program, the static test of a dedicated A400M complete structure has begun at the facilities in Getafe. It aims to demonstrate the reliability and the integrity of the aircraft structure to withstand critical loads for which it has been designed. The power-on milestone, as I said, was achieved. Aircraft systems interfaces have been connected and the electrical system successfully tested. In the medium weight turboprop range, two CN-235s were ordered.</p>
          <p>On Eurocopter, in Q1 revenues are increasing by 11% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by serial and development activities. 102 helicopters were delivered compared to 74 in Q1 2007. Volume and favorable mix improved EBIT performance despite negative impacts like unfavorable exchange rates and higher R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>The order backlog exceeds 14 billion euros now, thanks to the strong order inflow. Eurocopter made significant progress on key international programs. The medium-weight civil EC 175 joint development with China prompted market interest at Heli-Expo last month, since LOI were signed with 13 operators in Europe, North America and India for 111 helicopters including options.</p>
          <p>The EC225 received type certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority, clearing the way for commercial operation of its twin engine 11 metric ton class aircraft in the U.S.</p>
          <p>The Columbus, Mississippi production line for the U.S. Army's Light Utility Helicopter is progressing as planned. In Q1 2008, Eurocopter delivered 8 UH-72A Lakota helicopters to the U.S. Army ahead of schedule with full operational capability. A total of 26 helicopters had been delivered now at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>NH90 is progressing in the ramp-up phase. 6 aircraft were delivered in Q1 2008 to Italy, Germany and Finland, compared to 8 aircraft for the full year 2007.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter as you know already derives more than 30% of its revenues in services. We hope to see more growth here in the long run, for example following broader application of customer support center and the expansion of other service initiative.</p>
          <p>Astrium on page 17. Following several years of innovation and efficiency improvement, Astrium's strong competitive position is shown by its full order book and rising EBIT. In Q1 2008, it generated revenues of 0.8 billion euros, up by 19%. This increase is driven by the ramp up of Paradigm services and increased Ariane 5 production.</p>
          <p>EBIT more than tripled. A strong increase is partially linked to the de-risking of some of our key development programs, including Galileo. Operational improvement related to volume effects and efficiency improvement mainly in Space Transportation more than compensated the unfavorable impact of the declining British pound to euro exchange rate on Paradigm and the slightly higher R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>With the docking of Columbus with the ISS, the ATV launch on an Ariane 5 and the docking of the ATV with the ISS, Astrium have just competed a run of three brilliant successes in the area of Space Transportation.</p>
          <p>In the Satellite business, Astrium has booked two further order intakes with the Mercury probe BepiColombo and the express AM4 commercial telecom satellite for the Russian state-owned satellite operator, RSCC. This satellite, the most powerful Eurostar 3000 ever ordered, it will be equipped with a four band payload to be built by Astrium.</p>
          <p>This success is remarkable, because it's the first for Astrium on the Russian national market. A lot happened in the satellite business since Astrium has entered into an agreement to acquire the innovative University of Surrey spin-off company, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, which specializes in the design and manufacturing of small and micro satellites.</p>
          <p>Completion of the acquisition is subject to obtaining the relevant regulatory approval. With the acquisition of SSTL, Astrium is further strengthening its position in the satellites market.</p>
          <p>On the services side at a smaller scale than the ramp up of Paradigm, Astrium started the commercialization of the TerraSAR-X services, which will provide a highly reliable observation capability as radar satellites collect data independent of cloud cover or solar illumination.</p>
          <p>If we move on to Defence. Regarding the divisions, precision first, in 2008 MBDA will be consolidated at 37.5% and 2007 has been adjusted accordingly as I already said. Like-for-like revenues are up 9% to 990 million euros, thanks to a strong quarterly contribution from MBDA in Q1.</p>
          <p>EBIT is benefiting from those positive volume effects and from lesser restructuring costs. The seasonality pattern of the earnings in Defence, usually back loaded, should be the same in '08, but this first quarter is better than usual. Order intake is above 1.3 billion euros.</p>
          <p>It is worth mentioning the export weight, which amounts to 45% of the total figure. Export orders mainly consist of missile orders and international contracts of our Secure Network business, with new contracts for the TETRA system coming from Brazil, China and Spain.</p>
          <p>Further highlights include the acquisition of PlantCML and the partnership, a division linked with the Indian Group TATA to bid for the Indian Army's Technical Communication System. The new team partnership combines system integration expertise with local domain knowledge of the Indian market.</p>
          <p>Finally, a few words on Other businesses. EADS North America, which encompasses the EADS U.S. corporate activity, U.S. managed subsidiaries and the prime contractorship of key U.S. contracts is now consolidated in Other businesses and not in Defence and Security anymore.</p>
          <p>Q1 2007 figures have been adjusted accordingly. The different divisions will continue to report the work share of this programs in their numbers. In Q1 2008, EADS North America sales mainly include the revenues linked to the prime contractorship of the LUH program.</p>
          <p>Revenues and EBIT of other businesses are roughly stable. In the first three months of 2008, regional aircraft manufacturer ATR delivered only 8 aircraft due to customer financial issues and difficulties in ramp up. It received new orders for 3 aircraft, this lead to a total order book of 190 aircraft by the end of March.</p>
          <p>EADS EFW was burdened by an unfavorable product mix caused by lower deliveries of converted freighters, but benefited from stronger aero structures business compared to the same period of last year. EADS Socata handed over 6 TBM 850s to customers and has an order book of 58 aircraft.</p>
          <p>On 31 March 2008, the order book of Other business stood at 3 billion. And Louis, up to you now to deliver the guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Hans Peter. On Slide 21, we reiterate the guidance given to you in March 2008. The EADS guidance based on the closing portrait at year end 2008 of 1 euro for $1.45 U.S. EADS expects Airbus to capture above 700 aircraft orders in 2008. EADS revenues are expected to exceed 40 billion euros in 2008 which about 470 aircraft deliveries for the full year.</p>
          <p>EADS expects its 2008 EBIT at 1.8 billion euros, while in the first quarter the strong underlying performance across businesses particularly at Airbus shows a satisfactory trend. EADS needs to balance it with challenges on key programs this year.</p>
          <p>The weakening of closing spot rate at year end 2008 could have negative impact on earnings linked to the revaluation at the deteriorated U.S. dollar rate of some Airbus balance sheet items, including loss making contract provisions.</p>
          <p>Before the impact of customer financing, EADS expects 2008 free cash flow at 500 million, keeping in mind it is the most volatile item to predict. This includes the cash consideration for the acquisitions EADS announced lately. If the positive trend of the first quarter is confirmed upside to this number is possible. For 2008 EBIT guidance as well as for the mid-term outlook, any potential financial impact of the new A380 delivery schedule has not been determined so far.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ben Fidler here. Two questions. Firstly I wonder, if you could just clarify to us what the level of Power8 savings actually was in the first quarter of the year? And secondly, just in the light of things that are going on in the airline industry at the moment particularly airline profitability issues and financing issues, if you would just update us on where you're at with the production ramp up plans for the non-A380 programs, are you still pressing ahead to rate 40 and where you're now up to with those plans? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Louis? It's Hans Peter. Power8 savings question. What's it &#x2013; what I can say, Ben, at this point of the year is the savings we record in Airbus are inline with the full year expectation. So we're progressing on plan with the program and I think with the year-end disclosure we have given you the number for the full year. So &#x2013; and so far on Power8 we are progressing as I said. Louis, on the second airline profitability you want to...?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On airline profitability indeed, Ben, there are some clouds as we know. I think we have at least in the US not seen a positive quarter of the big airlines. So there is an increasing pressure coming from there, but as Louis said the exposure is limited currently to the U.S. market. We are concerned especially about the high fuel price without any question. $100 or more is becoming more and more difficult and the interesting question will be, in how far to transfer the increased cost to customers. For the time being the production ramp up is as we've planned it. So there is no change you have seen the good delivery numbers of the first quarter, so we are progressing on plan towards reaching our peak deliveries around 2010. And, as you know, we have some cushion in that, if we look in to the year 2010, '11, '12, so for the time being there is no change. But as I said before we are carefully watching the situation here each and every month, at least we are discussing that in order to understand early enough, if there would be a change necessary.</p>

          <p>Good morning gentlemen, thanks very much. Two questions, one, is around the projected order intake. You're talking about just over 700 aircraft, but you've had orders of 395 so far. So are you really only expecting 300 for the rest of the year? And is that currently backed up by what you are actually seeing in terms of immediate prospects that you're talking to? Second question, probably linked to that, is the low level of deliveries on ATR and you mentioned that there were some customer financing issues around that, and I wondered if you could fill in a little more detail about what those issues are and how they're being resolved? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question on the projected order intake, you could think that we are a bit conservative but as Thomas &#x2013; as Hans Peter said, we are prudent because we are carefully following the evolution of the market. I said in my first statement that we are &#x2013; our target is above 700. 700 seems to be clearly achievable. We could do a bit better, but you have not to expect that on the three next quarters we get the same number of orders as on the first one. And it's clear that the market is still active, but not at the level of the last year and the first quarter was perhaps more linked to the last year momentum than to the present year momentum. On the low level of deliveries to &#x2013; of ATR perhaps, Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick, you're right indeed as I said, eight aircraft for the first quarter seems low at expected delivery of around 60 or probably slightly more than 60 for the full year. There are two reasons, as I said, one is that we have some technical issues in &#x2013; technical issues in the ramp up which are recoverable as we would expect at least. But this is not the major reason, the major reason is currently that six aircraft are waiting for customer acceptance. So, they are built, they are ready for acceptance, and the customers need to put their financing in place which was not done until the end of the quarter. So, there will be some delay due to that. But we wouldn't expect that the customers would be in default to be clear. So, we will pick up normally in the second quarter with the deliveries and recover part of what we did not deliver in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it this sort of event which might lead you to be doing more customer financing generally because you'll have to step in with backstop financing to ensure delivery?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from Olivier Esnou from Exane BNP Paribas, France, Mr. Esnou please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. My two questions are the following. The first, I would like to come back on the A380 hedging gain in Q1. And they relate to hedges maturing relating to aircraft that should originally have been delivered and are not delivered. But if I look at your backlog and original delivery schedule, I see that the gap that we see in Q1 should continue well into Q4 and even part of 2009. So I'd like to understand why you think this hedging gain will reverse while it's not clear to me. The second question relates to price escalation because you issued a press release saying that you have increased prices for new aircraft, what I would like to know is for the backlog, are you confident that with the raw material price increase we have now, you have sufficient price escalation close in your backlog to cover fully the negative headwind you will have? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the hedging issue, indeed in the first quarter we had excess hedges which were coming from the first half of 2006 before the announcement of A380 in anticipation of more A380 deliveries in 2008 and specifically we were at this point hedging the beginning of the year. That was obviously stopped after the announcement so we will see significantly lower hedging volumes in the second half. So on a full year basis the volume we have covers the exposure but it is &#x2013; the phasing is front loaded, meaning we have a lot in the first quarter, much more than we have on maturing exposure. And we will see this correspondingly negative effect in the second &#x2013; no, in the third and in the fourth quarter. So there is still a few &#x2013; a little bit of excess volume in the second quarter, in the third and fourth quarter this will be compensated which carries a little bit of EBIT volatility probably. Because obviously it will depend on the spot rates in the third and in the fourth quarter a bit. But we are not &#x2013; if you look into the exposure, the remaining exposure on the hedging slide was 10.9 and if you take the 4.8 billion of matured hedges in the first quarter, it is obvious that the first quarter is higher than the remaining part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we look at the year as a whole, how much in dollar amount? How much hedges should mature relating to the A380?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relating to the A380, I cannot tell you the number, Olivier, honestly. Because we are looking at it globally and this is how the slide is built, so this is the way we are reporting our hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 250 is the maximum on a quarterly basis we will have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On price escalation and increases of prices and I understood your question in a way that you relate it to the price escalation formulas we have in our contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes the backlog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it enough to cover the price increase of raw materials...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In some cases there are raw material escalation clauses, yes. But obviously we don't see the same clause from ourselves with the customers. So, in a way there might be a mismatch between escalation coming through from material price increase and the ability to transfer this to the customer. So, in other words not everything, if this trend would be confirmed, is transferable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because one of the shortfall of Route 2006 was coming from raw material, if I remember well. So is there risk of Power8 shortfall due to that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it was not a shortfall, Olivier, it was that part of the Power &#x2013; Route '06 savings at that time we were compensated by unexpected increases of raw material prices. This is correct. For the time being you have seen that we tried to react in terms of the pricing. We have increased the prices of Airbus, one reason being indeed this issue. So, we try obviously to recover part of it in our contracting with customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning gentlemen. I also have two questions please. The first one is related to the A380 and just wanted to know, Hans Peter, the provisions that you've taken on the A380, are they covering the shortfalls there or do you still have continuing losses going through the P&amp;L on the A380? And if so, how big a loss did you take on the A380 in Q1? That's the first question. And then I'll follow up with the second one if I may after you answer this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So A380, the provisions we are quoting are obviously related mainly to the dollar situation, which is not your question. The answer to the question is yes there are still ongoing losses also slightly lower than last year in the first quarter. So there is coming some improvement from that. And it's still coming from excess costs we have and we do not capitalize and it is coming from customer support activities and obviously then also R&amp;D, which is still flowing into the program. So the answer is yes. We have losses. If you want to know the number, Zafar, I am sorry. We are not disclosing program results. We are only disclosing segment results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I would &#x2013; would imagine it is a material number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not insignificant, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second one is just on the pricing impact. You warned last year that there was going to be some pricing impact in Q4 of '07 and a lot of it falling into '08. Could you give us some idea of the pricing deterioration impact in the Airbus numbers quarter-on-quarter perhaps? Q1 this year versus Q1 last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not give you a precise number. It's going to be probably a bit back-loaded again, but we have seen pricing deterioration in the first quarter between the two years.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, It's Colin Crook from UBS. One sort of more strategic question, there has been a couple of stories recently with DRS and Finmeccanica and I think Ralph Crosby was quoted in the papers saying, you may be interested in that sort of business and there is also something I think overnight about EADS and Thales and maybe EADS taking the Alcatel-Lucent stake in Thales. I wondered if you could make some comments about whether there would be any interest in that and any views on that is my first question. The second question relates to the CapEx; I think if I heard you correctly, you said CapEx this year of 2.6 billion. Can I just make &#x2013; is that before customer financing, and if it &#x2013; if so, why is it rising so much related to last year? What was the big increase in expenditure actually of?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On CapEx Colin, 2.6 that's what I quoted before indeed. This is up from 2 billion we have seen last year. If you remember last year we had a huge saving on CapEx compared to the guidance we gave due to a much stricter CapEx process, particularly at Airbus which is part of the Power8 cash saving program. Obviously, we continue with that strict procedure and process this year. Some of the last year's savings were not savings with 100% but probably 50% or two-thirds of it was saving, the rest was simply some postponement. So we expect during this year to recover part of it. Obviously, I would not exclude if we continue with the strict process that we are not spending everything again, but at this point of the year we are sticking to the plan I mentioned.</p>

Mr. Ring, could you give us some indication when you will start to consolidate the newly acquired PlantCML, and maybe you can give us an idea what are the main effects here? And second question is on Airbus, having in mind the new delivery and production plans &#x2013; and I'm not looking to the current and next year, but more beyond 2010 where the plan also has been revised down. What might in this respect be the effect on reaching the mid-term margin target for Airbus; what can you do maybe beside Power8 to reach the original planned margin target here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On defense probably, we have said &#x2013; we have disclosed I think the acquisition amount, the price, with our release. So you can take from that given the sales multiples that obviously revenues will be much below, given that we will see a good EBIT contribution from that company I would not disclose you now the numbers, but I mean it is not changing dramatically &#x2013; the division obviously given that size, but what we would expect is strong growth in that business with the expected sales synergies because the major purpose of this is really to sell our products through a sales channel in the US. So &#x2013; but this is something which obviously will take a bit of time. So, since we did &#x2013; we are not more specific about sales and EBIT performance of that company. It was not a public company. I cannot now provide you more than what we said in our release, but you should expect some unorganic growth obviously with some contribution on the EBIT side. When will we consolidate? I think we should do it now. I think it's going to be with the financial closing, obviously which is imminent. So, probably in the second quarter; so you will see it shortly.</p>

          <p>Okay. On the A380 delivery schedule, we have not given any figure on 2010 and 2011; it's on purpose because we are discussing with customers to see what is most favorable delivery schedule we could propose to them taking into account our capacities. Our target is clearly in the medium-term to come back to the previous delivery reason base &#x2013; delivery base we have determined at the beginning of the program we needed. On the financial consequences, I said in my statement that we have no precise analysis of the financial impact &#x2013; potential financial impact. It means that we have &#x2013; we can't say what is impact on the guidance for 2008 and for the outlook of &#x2013; for Airbus for the medium-term. We will come back to you when we have a better assessment of the financial impact.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Can I ask a couple of questions relating to Airbus? Firstly, have you seen any significant increase in requests to defer delivery positions? Secondly, are you seeing increased take up of our back stop financing commitments, or what else explains the increased customer financing cash outflows later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first point &#x2013; and I shall leave Hans Peter for the two other one. We have some customers, very limited number of customers discussing with us on different deliveries and &#x2013; but it's not &#x2013; there is no momentum in that way; it's very limited and it's not completely new. We have always this kind of discussion with some customers; perhaps we are following that very carefully but for the time being we don't feel a strong momentum in that way. It could come, but for the time being, the situation is not very &#x2013; the pressure is not strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on customer financing, Harry, we do not expect as of today, significant or very significant pick up of backstops we would have to honor, provided the ECA support continues as it was and as it is. So we don't expect any change here. So, and so far yes, we have &#x2013; we had a good first quarter, which was actually better than we thought. And this will be from today's expectation, probably reversed in the remaining three quarters. So there might be a little bit of outflow, but it will not be a dramatically high number from today's point of view. But obviously the markets are more and more under stress in that respect, that's for sure.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Could you, Mr. Gallois, address where you are on the A350 in terms of the design and sort of the supplier selection and the progress? I mean clearly you want to get this program into the market on schedule. How do you stand with that?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the time being we are on track. On &#x2013; for the development, I could say that we have at the end of the year a very important milestone called M5, where we freeze completely the specific design of the airplane. We will see at that time if we are on time. For the time being, we have no reason to think that we are not on time. On the design, as you know, in every program of that size, we are fighting against weight. It's not something which is not normal, it's clear, but we are fighting against weight. On the supplier selection we are &#x2013; we have been a bit delayed by the discussion we had with some partners for the sale of our site, but we are now going as fast as possible. I could say that we don't expect to be late at the end of the year in the supplier selection, and you will see in the next weeks some major supplier selected. For the time being we are not &#x2013; we are not late, even if we have been a bit delayed by the discussion on the sale of sites.</p>

But we have clearly given an indication that &#x2013; on the evolution we wish to manage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Thank you. First question on Power8, you talked about it being on track at this point, but you said that you did see challenges in making the 2010 goals. Could you describe what those challenges are and specifically around some of the initiatives, overhead reductions, smart buying, lien and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Power8, as we just said, we are on track. But you are &#x2013; it's clear that some targets are changing. You were finger pointing one of them, which is the supply chain. It's clear that the supply chain is overloaded for the time being, and there is the same pressure in Europe and the U.S. dollar as us. And it's not easy to get the savings we expect, but we are working very hard on that topic. I could say also that we have to manage some element of recurring cost on new airplanes and A380 in particular and we have to be sure that we could take &#x2013; keep them in the &#x2013; at the level we were expecting. And I could say that nothing is easy and you know in such a program, the first years are the easiest and it's more and more difficult when you go to the end of the process and we know that 2009 and 2010 will be challenging years, but for the time being, as I said &#x2013; as we said, we are on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably you would need to make it through those challenges before you could move to the next level to address what has obviously been a worse situation with respect to the dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are &#x2013; in the same time, as we're implementing Power8, we are working on additional measures. Additional measures of two kinds; first is further cost savings. I have to say that it's not easy because Power8 is already changing as expected &#x2013; as I said. But we are looking at the new fields of cost savings and the other way we're working on is to increase the dollar content of our products. And I think the additional measures will be mainly driven by the increase of the dollar content with our European suppliers, which are more and more under pressure to be paid in U.S. dollar. Also, with the contract with the suppliers located in the dollar area and we are thinking of our own footprints in the U.S. dollar area. And it's clear that the U.S. tanker is a good opportunity for us to develop basis for manufacturing airplane in the south of the United States around the final assembly line we are &#x2013; we expect to build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, the site sales in Europe, how does the delay in moving through that &#x2013; how does that impact both Power8 and how you think about A350 suppliers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the sale of sites, we were expecting more cash savings than cost savings. On cost savings of the sale of sites were &#x2013; could &#x2013; we are expected to bring $230 million. We will sell two of them, Filton and Laupheim, and we wish to &#x2013; we expect to obtain the same savings in the plant we are not selling than &#x2013; as if we had sale &#x2013; sold them. It means that we have said to the unions very clearly that the savings MT Aerospace and Lat&#xE9;co&#xE8;re we are expecting to do in &#x2013; on the sites they could have bought. We will have to get them; it's clear. It means that we &#x2013; on the 230 million euro cost savings on the sale of site, we could get a part on &#x2013; not only a part; it means that the other measures have to compensate and we are working on it. On the delay, it depends on our capacity to attract investors to the two subsidiaries we are creating in Germany and in France. We expect more financial investors than industrial investors, because industrial investors so far are not a candidate. But we have &#x2013; we begin discussion with &#x2013; discussions with some financial investors and we could expect to make progress with them. I can't give you any time schedule, because it's not depending only on us, but also the capacity to attract these investors.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's clear that the site will receive the A350 part. We expected to give to &#x2013; contract with them. We are &#x2013; we have decided to invest for the A350 on the sites we are not in position to sell now, and we have ordered &#x2013; already ordered machine tools, for example, for M&#xE9;aulte, Nordenham and we will consider this subsidiary even if they are 100% EADS, at the beginning as partners for the A350, if they were both by MT Aerospace or Lat&#xE9;co&#xE8;re.</p>

          <p>That &#x2013; measures already implemented since the beginning of the program should generate for 705 million &#x2013; 750 million euros of savings, 750 million euros. In addition, measures about to be implemented, could bring around 300 million euros more and we have potential actions and new ideas adding possibly 350 million euros. But you know we have a core of 750 million euros already generated &#x2013; on the way to be generated &#x2013; because they are fully documented.

          <p>Thank you. This closes our conference call for this time. We are looking forward to talking with many of you in the coming days. If you have any question, please email Louis, Chris or myself with a list of questions, so that we can revert to you as soon as possible with the right answers or call us as you see fit although this is usually not the better approach. Thank you and a good day to all of you.</p>
