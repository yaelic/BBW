          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group 2011 Half Year Results Conference Call. The presentation, hosted by Mr. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a, Group Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Didier Valet, Group Chief Financial Officer, will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Mr. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oud&#xE9;a. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon to all of you. I'm delighted to host this conf call. I just would like to introduce our &#x2013; the presentation, our results and then leave the floor over to Didier Valet, our CFO for more detail, and we will of course answer your questions later.</p>
          <p>Just first of all, a few words on the environment and our reading of the situation and the way we see the short-term. After our first quarter, which was marked by a political upheaval in North African countries as well as the catastrophe at Fukushima; this second quarter was marked, in particular at the beginning of June &#x2013; since the beginning of June by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, very recently also in the U.S. and we've also, as we've seen very recently, the downward revision of the U.S. growth in the first half which probably shows that it is not that easy to restore robust growth in the developed economies after the crisis we encountered.</p>
          <p>Our view, it means that the adjustment and adaptation phase will take time, and to reduce the debt in itself, it is not a surprise. But probably the more brutal fear and cautious stance of market participants that we've seen in the last few weeks could last for some time, as long at least as we don't see reforms being implemented in all countries which are concerned by this level of debt and maybe the first results.</p>
          <p>It means that in terms of outlook in the short term, we take the view that we might have a 12 to 18 months period potentially aligned probably with the political timeframe and you know we have elections in a lot of developed economies &#x2013; maybe with stronger uncertainty than previously considered and potentially more limited market activity, more limited market volumes, more limited corporate activities as experienced, to a certain extent, in the second quarter than we could have expected.</p>
          <p>Regarding more specifically, of course, the Greek issue, this &#x2013; there was this European plan which was agreed on the 23rd of July, as you all know, that we see as a significant asset both from the public sector and the private sector and which in our view gives Greece the time to effectively implement the needed reforms. Regarding the private sector involvement, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale intends to contribute to it.</p>
          <p>Against this background of uncertainty, potential volatility, we continued our transformation strategy under our Ambition SG 2015 program with a particular attention on the risk management and the generation of capital.</p>
          <p>So if I look a bit more to the results, page 3 of the presentation and comment on both the quarter and the half year results. In such an environment, the second quarter results reflect, in our view, resilience.</p>
          <p>The business line &#x2013; the business line revenues, excluding the accounting impact of the debt of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, which is, as you know, something which can move; and let me just remind you that in the second quarter of 2010, it flattened the revenues. So if we put that aside and add constant <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:01) exchange rates, revenues are increasing by 2% compared with last year, which is a sign of the capacity again of the businesses to grow despite the constraints on capital and liquidity.</p>
          <p>Performances in retail banking activity in general in &#x2013; retail banking activities are good and Didier Valet will comment more in detail. Corporate and Investment Banking in the environment I've described were resilient &#x2013; progressed compared with last year but the basis for last year was relatively low. But overall, a good balance between our three different activities.</p>
          <p>Regarding the growth in International Retail Banking, we had this growth compared with the first quarter, which was marked again by the political upheaval in Mediterranean Basin and Africa. And we have effectively merged our different activities in Russia. We have now one bank in Russia from a legal perspective. It was done on the 1st of July and we have now to of course extract the synergies of this merger.</p>
          <p>Improvement continues in the business lines of Specialized Financial Services and Insurance, in particular on the Consumer Finance business. And eventually, Private Banking and Global Investment Management and Services had contrasted performances but overall rate should be good from a commercial perspective but suffered still from this unfavorable market, low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>What I would like to highlight also in the second quarter result which I think is something very positive going forward is the reduction of the cost of risk. Of course, I put aside the impact of the Greek debt. But on the businesses, quarter after quarter, we see the cost of risk decreasing and we have in mind that decrease to carry on in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Greek debt, as I've said, we have effectively in the second quarter the impact of our contribution to the assets, to the plan, I will come back to that more in detail to describe our exposure but it means a &#x20AC;395 million before tax impact, &#x20AC;268 million after-tax. Let me just say that all our outstandings have been effectively depreciated. Now we don't have any debt maturing beyond 2020. And so all the Greek debt was impacted by the 21% decrease, I will come back to that.</p>
          <p>Regarding &#x2013; so the quarter &#x2013; we have net profit of &#x20AC;747 million, &#x20AC;1.015 million (sic) [&#x20AC;1015 million] (7:58) if we take out the impact of the Greek debt.</p>
          <p>One thing which I would like also to highlight in particular because it is our main priority, it is effectively the growth of capital, and the Core Tier 1 ratio increased significantly in the second quarter by 50 basis points and stands now at 9.3%.</p>
          <p>If I look now at the half year results, the net Group income is actually stable, again excluding the revaluation of our own financial liabilities which flattered last year net income &#x2013; and on the contrary decreased the accounting figures fundamentally and despite the impact of the Greek debts at &#x20AC;1.891 billion, excluding our own financial liabilities &#x2013; our first half net profit is stable compared with last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding this capital generation, we have increased the Core Tier 1 in the first half from 8.5% to 9.3%. So it's a plus, exactly plus 74 basis points increase in just the first six months. We are ahead of schedule. I think it reflects the capacity to generate profits. Also, the capacity of the Group to monitor effectively our risk weighted assets on one hand to invest if needed on the growth of certain businesses, but also to de-leverage and Didier will comment on that, in particular regarding the legacy assets.</p>
          <p>It means that on the back of this result and despite probably this more uncertain environment that I've just described, we are absolutely confident to be able to reach 9% Core Tier 1 ratio, full Basel III at the end of 2013. We take into account the regulatory framework, the Basel III-I but also the global SIFI 1 &#x2013; document has been released very recently for consultation but I would tend to think that it will be probably decided as it stands and with the criteria which has been examined by regulators, which are qualitative but also quantitative criteria, definitely we are happy with this 9% target. There is clearly a buffer, as far as we know, with the level, the bucket to which we will, in which we will be in this global SIFI approach. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale certainly, in terms of size, complexity, risk, and interconnection is not among the largest banks internationally and that will be confirmed.</p>
          <p>So the results of the Group will carry on supporting this capital generation. We'll carry on growing, even if, effectively, as we've said, in this current environment, the target of &#x20AC;6 billion of net profit in 2012 seems difficult to reach compared with the initial timeframe.</p>
          <p>If I turn to page 4, just to take a longer term perspective, more than ever, and I've been always very consistent in that message, the banking industry needs to adapt very significantly to the de-leverage which will take place in the coming years, at least in developed economies, and also to a much tougher regulatory environment. So we are addressing that by adjusting our business models, developing different projects, altogether 50 different projects in order to be &#x2013; adjust &#x2013; to adjust our businesses to all these changes.</p>
          <p>Let me just give you a few examples, a few achievements of the very last three months. Regarding the French Networks, not only are we developing our client base, carry on developing also our credit, but also mutualizing our system. We have put in place in May this year a single IT team for Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole and this team will be in charge of implementing this project and this common system, IT system.</p>
          <p>Let me just highlight that we carry on also with the integration of the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit which is going very smoothly. Second major project, as I've already said, Russia, the merger of the entities was needed in order to carry on then developing our businesses under one brand, one legal entity but also extracting the synergies. We have now just one bank in Russia. We have two subsidiaries owned at 100%. We will migrate on the common system at the end of the year and, of course, develop the business both retail and corporate.</p>
          <p>And the third important project is SG CIB. Let me just highlight something we've said also in the past is that we've had, in terms of development, in terms of investment, a very cautious strategy. Investing selectively in a very focused way in businesses which in our view are well suited in the new world. Let me just mention M&amp;A or the capacity for example for our clients to access our U.S. dollar platform. It is in our view needed in a world of more disintermediation, and we have had already very positive first results.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we want to maintain a cost to income ratio which is competitive and well suited to these changes of regulation. And that's why you will see that the Corporate and Investment Banking business has the cost to income ratio at 60%. I consider it is the maximum level we should have going forward again in order to have a profitability on capital invested in this business which is satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Regarding the new prudential requirements, as I've said, we have kept a very disciplined approach in terms of capital and liquidity, a slight decrease of the risk-weighted asset. Didier Valet again will comment on that. In particular, we continue to decrease our legacy asset portfolio. The disposal and amortization over the quarter represented a decrease by &#x20AC;3.7 billion plus dismantle of CDO, sorry, for the first half, so &#x20AC;3.7 billion for the first half.</p>
          <p>And then as I've said, management of risk has been key. I want to ensure a very resilient contribution of the Corporate and Investment Banking business. You can see that &#x2013; you will see that in the last 18 months, it is obvious, regarding the &#x2013; looking at the figures.</p>
          <p>Last word and then I will leave the floor to Didier Valet. Last word on sovereign exposure to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and Spain &#x2013; the countries which are under pressure today.</p>
          <p>First of all, I would like to put things in perspective and remind you that in the last 10 to 15 years, strategically, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale made the decision, because we had in mind potentially lower growth in these countries to develop our business, first of all, of course, in France, regarding the eurozone and I still consider that France is offering, and we see that in the results, very interesting opportunities. And we have the benefit of the recent acquisitions we made in the last 18 months. And then in emerging market countries, where we see high growth potential, lower penetration of banking services and we think we will create value by growing.</p>
          <p>I must say in the second quarter it is what we've seen, and if I just take a country like Romania, it is interesting to see that the IMF is happy with the progress on the public finance, and Romania has been upgraded recently by Fitch, when, on the contrary, as you might have seen, some European countries have been downgraded.</p>
          <p>So as a result of this strategic decision, we are structurally less exposed to the Euro area and the so-called peripheral countries in particular. This is clearly revealed by all the figures that you might have seen and compared with European banks. That's true on the retail and universal banking activities as well as on the sovereign exposure. Regarding the sovereign exposure, you have the figures on the slide. Our &#x2013; the majority of our exposure is linked to our role as a primary dealer in these countries. We have to have minimum level of outstandings. Let me just say, I certainly do not share certain scenarios of the markets, and we've had &#x2013; we've kept a very responsible stance, not cutting exposure very brutally. We manage our exposure in order to serve our clients in a prudent and reasonable way.</p>
          <p>Regarding Greece, our banking book exposure, of course, all the trading exposures are marked to market. We had, at the end of June 2011, &#x20AC;1.85 billion of securities of exposure on the Greek sovereign. It is our total debt, and as I've said, our total debt is not maturing beyond, is maturing before 2020. So what we did is apply a 21% discount to all our debt which is potentially eligible to the exchange. It is a minus &#x20AC;395 million impact. And if we had chosen an impairment, looking at the market prices at the end of June, actually this figure would've been very similar and even slightly lower. So I think we have really an adequate mark on this portfolio and no further risk because there is not any outstanding which is not effectively impaired on that basis.</p>
          <p>Regarding the other countries, we have insignificant exposure to Irish and Portugal &#x2013; Portuguese sovereign risk. And as I've said, regarding Italy and Spain, we have also, as you can see on the slide, limited exposure. And as I've said, I think these countries are able to implement the reforms needed to reduce their debt and delivery with certain market scenarios.</p>
          <p>I would like now to turn the floor to Didier to answer more in detail on our results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. Good afternoon. If you turn to page 6 and we look at the detailed P&amp;L, I will just pick three figures. First, I'd say, as mentioned by Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, you can see that our net banking income has increased by 2.1% Q2-on-Q2 and by 4.4% H1-on-H1, showing you the capacity of our business line to continue to grow despite the economic and market environment.</p>
          <p>Second, regarding the cost base, the costs have increased by 6% Q2-on-Q2. But when we look at, with the evolution, Q2-on-Q1, you will see or you have seen that it's down by 3%, showing the fact that we have already especially on the CIB side and not just due to variable compensation stabilized the cost base of our CIB platform.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk, if we skip out Greece for &#x20AC;395 million, stands at &#x20AC;790 million in second quarter which is down by 20% almost compared to last year, I think then the decrease is even more important if we look at the first half. And so in term of bottom line, as we said, the underlying return on equity of the Group for the first half is 9%, with the impact or including the impact of the Greek <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:56) that we've planned.</p>
          <p>If now we move to page 7, just to put the first half revenue into perspective. You can see that at &#x20AC;13.5 billion of total revenues, we are let's say continuing to grow and above let's say the level of the franchisees before the financial crisis in H1 2007. When I look more into detail with each business line, the French Networks have increased their revenues by 6.6% compared to last year. It is 2.8% excluding SMC, and you can see that they have delivered a recurring and regular growth, which is a sound basis of revenues for the whole group.</p>
          <p>International Retail Banking business is up by 1.1%. So we will see that the second quarter is showing a rebound compared to first quarter. CIB at &#x20AC;4.1 billion and despite the weakness of dollar compared to 2007, these are almost I'd say at treetop level. And Financial Services, they are down compared to last year. It is almost entirely due because of the disposal of ECS, our IT leasing company that we sold during the second half of last year. And last but not least, GIMS, so Private Banking and GIMS have an increase in revenues by 2.8%.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page 8 and look at the cost of risk, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric said, the commercial cost of risk, which is of course excluding the impairments on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:36), it's full and it's at 58 basis points for the first time since the beginning of the crisis, it is in the range that we have said that year, let's say, over the cycle range for the cost of risk of the Group which is between 55 and 65 basis points.</p>
          <p>And when we dig a little bit into divisions, we can say that French Networks are converging towards the cycle average which is 33.5, the absolute basis points. International Retail Banking confirmed its decline compared to the peak we've seen last year. And the &#x20AC;51 million, if you remember of provisioning that we set aside as generic provisioning to cover uncertainty in Tunisia, Egypt, and Ivory Coast, have not been used and continue to be a cushion if necessary.</p>
          <p>On the CIB, they are clearly well below the average over the cycle since five quarters as you can see with the cost of risk which is nil. And on Specialized Financial Services and Insurance, there is a slight plateau compared to Q1 but you can see that the trend is clear. It is on the downside both for consumer finance and equipment finance. So altogether this is confirming the decrease that you can see is consistent for the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>On the legacy assets, a few words, you can see that at the bottom of the slide, the provisioning amounted to &#x20AC;130 million and with positive revenues this portfolio is in line with our expectation regarding its contribution to 2011 results.</p>
          <p>We then move now to slide nine and looking at the evolution of the Core Tier 1 ratio of the group. As Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, we've seen a strong increase over the first half. It has been fueled by, on one side, a slight drop of the risk-weighted assets compared to the level at the end of 2010, &#x20AC;333 billion down minus 0.5%. This is a result of the combination of three elements. First, we have been extremely selective in doing our lending activities. Second, and it is being illustrated by the reduction in value at risk that we have executed during the second quarter. We have a prudent management of our market risk. And third, we also have benefited from the disposals and amortization of our legacy asset position for total in the first part of &#x20AC;3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Income of capital position, of course, we have benefited as you can see on the bar chart at the bottom of the slide from the recent earnings for the first half, which is a 56 bps net of the provision for next &#x2013; for this year, dividend that will paid in May 2012, so it's a 40 bps net re-inflation of the ratio. We have recorded the 27 bps increase linked to the success of our scrip dividend proposed to our shareholders in June.</p>
          <p>You can see that the organic growth of our business lines have consumed minus 13 basis point, but this has been compensated by the legacy asset portfolio, where the capital consumption has been reduced. Thanks to the leverage and restructuring of CDOs, re-inflating the ratio by 15 bps, I will comment into detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>So as a result, you can see that the Core Tier 1 ratio of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale stands at 9.3% at the end of 30 of June, 2011, per head, let's say our capital planning compared to what we have presented you last November, when we provided as the trends and the objectives income of Basel III target.</p>
          <p>Page 10 on the legacy assets, just to wrap up. Contribution in line with expectations, let's say, minus &#x20AC;119 million after tax for the first half, so well below what we've seen last year. Amortization and disposal I really commented on it. During the second quarter, we have also dismantled further two CDOs, so for a total of five and we have already secured by end of 2013 &#x20AC;900 million of capital relief under Basel III. We have, as of end of June, already &#x20AC;300 million of benefit, which is included in the Core Tier 1 calculation I've just presented.</p>
          <p>Lastly, when you look at the BlackRock credit valuation, which is presented in appendices, you can see that in six months time, the difference between the credit valuation of BlackRock and the book value of assets has increased despite disposals, which had a positive contribution to the P&amp;L, a decrease from &#x20AC;1.6 billion at the end of 2010 to &#x20AC;2.1 billion at the end of June.</p>
          <p>If now we look at liquidity and funding on page 11. As you know, we have consistently, over the last 18 months, increased our deposit base and you can see that in the first half, we have further increased our deposits by 2%, so &#x20AC;7 billion increase across the group. On customer loans we are stable, leading to a loan to deposit ratio improvements of two percentage points from 124% to 122%.</p>
          <p>In term of short term liquidity, our liquid assets, our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:12) our cushion amounted to &#x20AC;105 billion at the end of June. In term of long-term funding program, you can see that we had issued, as of today, &#x20AC;24 billion of debt, so 93% of the program is executed and with that sense, the usual structure products issuances of our CIB business. This means that results are going to the market. That program will be executed by end of the September at the latest, thanks to these structured notes issued by our CIB business. And then you can see certain prices, which who that we have a favorable cost of funding both in euros but also in dollar.</p>
          <p>If I move now to the business lines starting with the French Networks. I will be brief. Strong loan origination, excellent deposit growth and good production of life insurance, outperforming the average of the industry, leading to revenue growth of 1%, 2.8% for the first half, in line and on track with the high end of the guidance that we set at the beginning of the year to achieve the highest between 1% to 2% growth excluding SMC. The contribution of the French Retail Banking business as you can see has strongly increased by 23% compared to last year and &#x20AC;384 million.</p>
          <p>Page 13, a look at the International Retail Banking business. You can see that the loan outstanding is increasing by 5%. It is fueled by a good trend for the Retail Banking business &#x2013; for the retail customers in Russia.</p>
          <p>In Czech Republic, plus almost 8%, supported by mortgage business especially. And in Romania, quality is down year-on-year. We have seen a rebound compared to the end of the first quarter by 2.6% showing that Romania, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned in introduction, is recovering both in terms of economic growth but also in terms of establishment by rich agencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of return of revenue &#x2013; in terms of revenue growth, you can see that we have 1.4% growth compared to last year and plus 6% compared to Q1, so the rebound is coming from Romania and also from the Mediterranean basin and Sub-Saharan Africa leading to a net income contribution of &#x20AC;116 million.</p>
          <p>Page 14, let's have a look to CIB business, where we say that revenues were sound. Q2-on-Q2, you can see that increase is plus 7.4% and this is &#x2013; thanks to a plus 11% increase of the global market's betterments. Yes, we are down compared to first quarter, but the first quarter was definitely a strong quarter especially on the equity and also on the fixed income. And I think compared to our peers, it has been recognized as such.</p>
          <p>So when we look at the trends, we've seen good betterments in the structure of products which is our strong expertise on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:25) business like for whole industry has been of course impacted by the market condition.</p>
          <p>We also have been extremely attentive to our risk reducing the value-at-risk by 9% to on average &#x20AC;41 million during the quarter. And with a minimum when the market was stressed of &#x20AC;22 million showing that we were extremely nimble to address our position to our market volatility.</p>
          <p>On the Financing and Advisory division, it is solid results. They are stable compared to last year, despite the weakness of the U.S. dollar and despite the fact that you can see as we would see in the appendices that on book, it's not increasing because of the new constraint that same can offer capital and liquidity. So we are able, I say, to extract good value from these activities especially on the structural financing, where the increase was 19% compared to last year on the capital markets, there was a slightly lower volumes especially on the Corporate Investment Grade but we've seen also the first positive effect from dollar and sterling development as well as high yield investments that we made over the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>So as a total, as we said revenue, up 7%. OpEx excluding variable compensation minus 2.8% compared to first quarter. Cost income for the first half of 60% in line with our target and contribution to net income &#x20AC;450 million at 10% compared to last year. And the net profit which is after tax is the about &#x20AC;1 billion for the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>On page 15, on the Specialized Financial Services and Insurance, the performances of the businesses are confirmed during the second quarter; with a good growth of our insurance activities illustrated by value metrics, life, personal protection and P&amp;C.</p>
          <p>Corporate financing, equipment finance and fleet management have seen also good production indicators. And the consumer finance is confirming its turnaround with new business excluding Italy at 4.7% and focusing clearly on car financing. The results &#x2013; the net group income increased by more than 70% at &#x20AC;146 million after tax.</p>
          <p>Lastly, on page 16, with Private Banking, Global Investment Management and Services, we should say that it was contrasting results in a difficult environment in terms of market activities. Why the Private Banking business has been able to have strong inflows, &#x20AC;2.1 billion for the sole second quarter, so an inflow rate of 10%. There were pressure on revenues in the wait-and-see market coming especially from low brokerage business. On the custody, you can see that cost income has improved further and the asset under custody and administration increased slightly.</p>
          <p>Brokerage was more difficult with income that was affected by unfavorable market conditions and we also set aside &#x20AC;12 million for commercial disputes, while the market share was relatively stable compared to the last year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in asset management, TCW for the third quarter in a row had positive inflows when it was marginal in the second quarter and Amundi has confirmed its increase in its contribution to &#x20AC;30 million compared to last year. So the performance is slightly disappointing at &#x20AC;59 million, down 20% compared to last year. That's it for the business lines. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a few words of conclusions. As you can see the first six months mark a first positive step in our transformation. We have businesses which have carried on implementing their objectives with certain developments, certain reallocation of capital improvement of the risk across the board. And as I've said, we remain positive on that. We'll have further benefits going forward of this transformation.</p>
          <p>We factor, as I've said, an environment which might be tougher. We don't have a catastrophic scenario at all in mind in terms of economic activity. But as I've said, we could anticipate that uncertainty might trigger less activities and corporates to be a bit more careful also in their own plans and projects.</p>
          <p>So we will carry on with this transformation, with this ambition, with this focus on capital, liquidity, cost and risks and we remain very flexible on the cost side as you can see. We will maintain a competitive cost income ratio in this period; and hence, I think we will be able to be in line with this new regulatory environment and have a good profitability going forward. That's what we wanted to say in the presentation, and now, of course, we will answer your questions with all our colleagues of the executive committee.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. We have a question from Mrs. Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Just a few questions, maybe to start with, your net income target for 2012, you said it's more challenging, is it possible to get a bit more color from where the delta is coming from? Is it fair to assume, it's mostly CIB, or is it split CIB and international retail? And also within CIB, what kind of assumptions you have for revenue growth in fixed income side, and do you still assume that the cost income ratio of 60% is achievable?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on your dividend policy, would you consider changing that in light of the more challenging environment?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on your sovereign exposures, would it be possible to get your &#x2013; the markdown that you've taken through equity for Spain and Italy?</p>
          <p>And lastly, on a legacy assets, the provisions have increased marginally this quarter versus last quarter, do we &#x2013; should we expect a change in guidance for the next few quarters, or do we &#x2013; do you stick to what you've guided so far, and are you still confident on the de-leveraging in the next 12 months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, I will take the first part and then &#x2013; and the dividend policy and Didier Valet will give you the figures on the sovereign exposure and the legacy assets. What we had if you wish is beginning of the year, the uncertainty on the Mediterranean Basin on the retail outside France.</p>
          <p>We have also compared with 2010 figures, the fact that we own now 90s &#x2013; more than 95 &#x2013; sorry, 88% of our Greek subsidiary instead of the 54% we had plugged in our financial forecast and it's a Greece, we'll carry on suffering if you wish with what happened just recently.</p>
          <p>We had also in Romania, an improvement of the country which took longer than expected, but that's for the Retail Banking business. What changed in my mind in the second quarter, and again, assuming that this fee on the market last, maybe I'm wrong and maybe in two months time, everything will be sorted out, but I have my doubt when I see the reaction of the investors and also it's fair to say, as I've said, the figures of the U.S. economy which we are weaker in the first half than anticipated, is effectively on the CIB side, potentially lower revenues.</p>
          <p>I mean, and certainly, I do not want to have our teams taking risks, which would make no sense especially in such an environment and prefer, as I've said, to have a very resilient contribution of CIB, I think it's very important. I don't want to jeopardize this evolution of additional solid revenues, additional capital, it is really the priority.</p>
          <p>So again, the change in the second quarter in my mind comes from more to CIB, more prudent assumption in the evolution of the activity and we will keep a 60% cost income ratio. Clearly, it is in line &#x2013; look at just the first half this year, again, in an environment which was not that easy. It is the cost income ratio we got with a level of revenues of around &#x20AC;4 billion, something like this for the first half.</p>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; we will not change our dividend policy with the dividend policy. And thanks, I must say, to the support of our shareholders. We were able, as I've said, to grow our Core Tier 1 at a higher level than we have anticipated, let me always remind you for perhaps our Anglo-Saxon colleagues that in our Tier 1 calculation, we deduct the 35% dividend payout provision now in our figures, it is deducted and we've said that we would, again, go for the scrip option dividend at the end of this year, that will be a proposal again. So, I mean, there's absolutely no reason to change our dividend policy when we are, on the contrary, ahead, I must say, of what we expected in terms of capital generation.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, Didier, on the sovereign exposure and the legacy assets, if you can give more flavor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Delphine, on the legacy and on the sovereign exposure, just first, you've seen on the note 12 of our financial statements the details of the Greece, of course, which is, as what I said impaired that &#x20AC;395 million and of course OCI is near because now they have moved to mark to model. But if we had valued them on the mark-to-market, it would have been a slightly lower impairment charge that we would have booked.</p>
          <p>On Ireland and Portugal, you have there also as a detail, let's say, of the unrealized losses as of end of June. It is 46 for Ireland and nine of Portugal. And when we look at Spain and Italy, on the Spain it is minus six, and on Italy it's plus 57. So you can see that altogether <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:04) are almost at zero in term of OCI as of end of June. This is what &#x2013; I think this answers your question.</p>
          <p>Regarding the legacy assets on page 10 maybe if you come back, well you've seen that here depending on the quarter, you could have let's say a plus or minus 20 or 30 in term cost of risk more than the previous quarter. But definitely, we are well below where we were last year and it was our commitment. We continue to expect that next year, this portfolio should be close to zero in term of contributions. So it won't be that much subject of discussion in term of P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And also what is important to notice is that in term of capital generation or capital relief. You can see on page 10 that &#x2013; thanks to &#x2013; half is coming from the risk-weighted assets reduction due to de-leverage and amortization, and half is coming from lower deduction from securitization. We have freed &#x20AC;0.5 billion of capital in just six months, thanks to these two elements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just last comment on the legacy assets, which I think is very positive. If you look at again the BlackRock valuation, not only, as Didier mentioned, we have in practice with less assets than at the end of 2010 in practice. A bigger difference between the credit valuation and our own valuation, but when you look at the only category of assets which is again still with a negative difference, the CDOs RMBS which has been reduced with the dismantling. The difference just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:52) all is very positive on this portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:59) because it's quite rare but we have a typo in our slide on slide 22 which is going &#x2013; showing the shadow P&amp;L. It's not EUR 20.4 billion which is the net value and EUR 19.6 billion which is fair value. I would say the fair value is EUR 20.2 billion, so there is just EUR 0.2 billion of negative shadow which also is going in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I may just come back on the CIB revenues, is it possible to get some more color on kind of what expectations you have on revenues, revenue growth for fixed income and equities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, so the &#x2013; first of all, the quarter has been fairly resilient on both global market and financing &#x2013; capital raising and financing. What we are accounting in the coming months is what we are seeing today is that thanks to the diversification of our business mix, we have still a very strong structured solution business both on equity and fixed income. The pipeline is bigger than ever, and we are still registering months after months satisfactory revenues.</p>
          <p>On the flow side which is more affected by the current market environment, it's difficult to predict what would be the second half of 2012 but we've been investing reasonably on that area, both fixed income and equity, especially cash equity and flow equity in Europe in relation with equity capital markets.</p>
          <p>So our view is that we will still rely on our structured business and on capital raising and financing which has registered a strong performance in the second quarter. And our objective at the end is to be close to the target in net revenues which we have mentioned in the FY 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, to further comment compared with what Michel said, effectively on the revenues, we might have in practice U.S. dollar compared with the figures we had in mind 12 to 18 months ago, a weaker U.S. dollar which we analyzed, everything being equal, the income. We might have a more moderate growth than expected, and clearly again because of the constraints on capital liquidity and also &#x2013; again also the environment. But then, as Michel mentioned, a much lower cost of risk also that's anticipated. So we don't have in mind such a big difference in terms of contribution but maybe a slightly lower one and that's why we think that the EUR 6 billion might be slightly delayed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I've got three questions. Firstly on Russia, just wanted to get a better feel from you guys on what kind of cost saving and revenue synergies we should expect and the timing of that? Also, if there is any kind of impact you think on the economics of Russia today as a result of the merger?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the Asset Management and Security Services business, there has been some trend of second quarter kind of positive seasonality in Asset Management from performance fees. In the case of Security Services, second quarters tended to be a bit better. We haven't seen that this year. So wondering if you could provide a bit more color on those two points?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just to make sure I fully understand your points on the EUR 6 billion target, I understand it's going to be challenging and delayed and certainly that's what was priced into consensus numbers, but how should we look at the individual divisional targets across all the different businesses? Are there some that we should still recognize and some that we shouldn't? If you could just provide a bit more clarity on that would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kinner, so I will leave the floor to Jean-Louis Mattei for Russia, Jacques Ripoll on the seasonality aspect and then Didier Valet will answer your question and give you more flavor on Insurance businesses. Jean-Louis, can you elaborate on Russia, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I will try again. So concerning Russia, we are, as you know, in the process to merge entities in this country. And we started with legal merger which has been done, which has been achieved, fully achieved on the 1st of July as we already said some months ago. And now, we are in the process to merge these institutions legally speaking &#x2013; organically speaking, if I can say. And with one big step which will be achieved the 1st of October because on 1st of October we will merge the IT systems of the two universal banks.</p>
          <p>So that means that after this organic merger, it will be possible to save costs and we will save costs mainly in 2012 and not in 2011 because, for the time being, we have to achieve what we have to achieve in terms of merger legal and organic as I've already explained. And what does it mean? That means that we'll save money because we'll have only one IT system, of course, and not two. That means we will have only one IT team and not two. We'll have only one network. That means we'll reduce number of main branches and we will save some cost on this matter. And at the same time, we will centralize even more the back offices functions. So we will disclose these figures maybe lately and not as of today.</p>
          <p>Concerning the business, we can say that due to the economic environment in Russia which is pretty good in terms of evolution of the GDP of the country for the time being, the situation is improving and we can say that some of the growth engines in Russia already started to push, like the C&amp;IB platform, we decided to create a joint venture with CIB as we have done in Czech Republic to develop the capital market and investment banking activities in Russia, it's starting very well.</p>
          <p>The mortgage activity for Delta and the universal banks is going very well for the time being. Same thing for car loans, for risk finance and for the universal banks. And globally speaking, the retail activity in Russia is going very well.</p>
          <p>What we have to improve for the time being is corporate activity, we are a little bit late for the time being due to some internal reasons and also because of the market. Because as of today, there is lot of liquidity in the Russian market and the state-owned bank are very liquid and they are offering very low rates to the corporates, that being said margin of interest is decreasing and sometimes it's not so profitable to lend a lot of money to some big corporation in Russia for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jacques?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in terms of seasonality of the GIMS division, it's true that there is a pick-up in some activities in Q2, especially in Security Services, and indeed, that's what we see in this quarter with an increase of revenues of roughly 10% on the Security Services business. And now, on the other businesses, I'm not sure that the seasonality is that high on Q2, mainly due to the fact that the main factor is more the global environment. If you look at Private Banking, for example, the level of activity that you have with your private client is very much linked to their perception of should they move in their investment, should they make some deals and should you get commissions out of it.</p>
          <p>On Asset Management, you have the same kind of situation. It's much more &#x2013; for example on performance fees, the level of the market and the level of volatility that you get that influences the revenues. So, seasonality is very much focused more on Security Services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:47) you have the aggregation of brokerage under Security Services and financial communication. This is disappointing revenues of brokerage has overshadowed I would say the strong seasonality over the normally strong seasonality of the custody business.</p>
          <p>If I come to your last question in term of division, let's say, compared to the range that we gave a year ago, French Networks, I think it should be high end of the range; International Retail Banking below the low end of the range; Financial Services in the range; CIB, as we said, slightly below the range, and GIMS also low end of the range, I would say, in term of performance.</p>
          <p>On top of that you should have in mind that also at the Corporate Center we have the impact of additional taxes which were not expected a year ago. Just to remind you that we have roughly &#x20AC;25 million tax a quarter, and due to the UK and French system of tax &#x2013; taxes. And just for the French one as it is based on the risk-weighted asset, this mean that there is a sole migration to Basel 2.5 next year even if we are extremely disciplined on the risk-weighted asset control. We'd also increase the tax that we will pay to the French state. So, that's just to give you some flavor in term of where we stand compared to last year guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Just on the performance fees. I kind of recognize it's fairly important part of the kind of profitability of the underlying asset management model, if we strip out of the Amundi stake. Just if you could give us some color on that, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jon Peace from Nomura. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I have two questions, please. The first one, and I'm sorry to go back again to the 2012 target, but I think it was a comment you made this morning about the ROE range being perhaps now 12% to 15% instead of 14% to 15%. Can we read into that lower end of the range, what you think you'll earn next year? In other words, you ought to be able to do a little bit more than EUR 5 billion as a minimum next year. And in the context to that, I just wondered if you might make a quick comment about the EBA stress test results, where they did a forecast for all banks' net income under the baseline scenario? I believe they had you with lowest EUR 4 billion for next year.</p>
          <p>The second question I had was about capital accumulation, I mean, given the market fixation with capital levels, what more things could you do to accelerate to see accumulation of capital ahead of your deadline? And I'm thinking in particular, what's stopping you selling these legacy assets more quickly and realizing this unrealized value. Is this a value which has to accrue over time as you hold the maturity or are the real bids out there that could unlock that EUR 2.1 billion unrealized gain today? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, I will leave Didier compliment in particular on the legacy asset. Let me just remind you, first of all, the figure we gave in terms of return on equity between 14% and 15% was for 2012. It means EUR 6 billion with effectively in practice a level of capital with a dividend at that point which was paid in cash. And just for 2012, and it's not the target of the Basel III and Core Tier 1.</p>
          <p>What we've just said is effectively what we had said in the past is that we have decided to pay a &#x2013; proposed a scrip option dividend. And the figure I gave on the return on equity this morning for the 12% to 15% is beyond 2012, is the target that we can have in mind for the banking industry as a whole in full Basel III terms. And what I've said is in my mind the difference between 12% and 15% will depend largely on the capacity of the banking industry to also re-price.</p>
          <p>My view is that at this stage banks have not really fully adjusted their businesses to a new environment. New in terms of capital, new in terms of liquidity, et cetera. This adjustment will be probably done progressively under the pressure of reality, I mean, lower return and effectively, the need to improve that.</p>
          <p>One thing which will be clearly on the cost side as we have seen very recently for banks which had increased probably too much their investments, is one parameter which might be on the pricing and which will make also the difference as well as the capacity to churn out more the balance sheet. The regulation as it stands will lead to more development of capital market activities with effectively less capital in the balance sheet. All this will take probably two to three years, and that's something which is going to be progressive.</p>
          <p>Regarding the stress test, I will let, again Didier Valet comment. But I just would like to highlight, again the limitation of the methodology which was fundamentally static. And for a bank like Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, which precisely is progressively enhancing its capital base, thanks to profit, thanks to deleveraging, and one fundamental assumption of the stress test was precisely the absence of any deleveraging, which in itself, of course, is an assumption, which is not that realistic, and which is reflected in our figures, just from the legacy asset.</p>
          <p>And third, with the scrip option dividend, which was not taken into account, all that shows the limitation of the stress test. And just in six months' time, basically, we've moved the figure in practice by 80, 90 basis points in practice. Didier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just to complement what Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric said, regarding the EBA also under the stress test, for example, there was certain assumption that we've discussed, but the rule was a rule, for example, no capacity to adjust the bonuses of the CIB, despite the fact that where you were dropping another stress scenario. So all these variable of adjustment, we are now taking into account, and despite that you have seen this element also. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale was still profit making by 2012 under serious stress test, which was not the case of the whole industry. So I think now with what we have generated year-to-date, you can see that we are comfortably above the 7%, which from what I read in your researches, is a safe side, I think, kind of positioning.</p>
          <p>In term of capital accumulation, why, let's say, don't resell the whole legacy book. Again, and we explained that a year ago, the valuation made by BlackRock is credit valuations which is taking into account the carry that we will get on those assets and also the convergence to par. When you look at certain prices and, for example, so have in mind that we have fully migrated, for example, on the <mark type="ph" /> CDOs (64:24) to mark-to-market in our legacy asset valuations. So now let's say we have capacity to restore, let's say, the real price and no longer mark-to-model on these assets. So if we want to fully benefit from that, we have to hold these assets to maturity. It is not our aim.</p>
          <p>As Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric said and as we have demonstrated over the last 18 months, we will gradually de-leverage these assets. We have also implemented the dismantling of CDOs, which is also an efficient way, let's say, to have certain cash <mark type="indiscernible" /> (64:58), so we will remain attentive to opportunities. And on certain asset classes, we've seen, for example, over the last two quarters more positive development allowing us to deleverage on these asset classes a bit faster than expected especially for example on CLOs or CMBS already that's a relatively supportive in term of markets last year. But on the CLO side we've seen more opportunities, I would say since the end of 2010, and we have taken opportunities to accelerate the reduction of these asset classes and we intend to continue to do so.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yeah, I just wanted to maybe to dwell a little bit on Jon's questions here on the legacy assets. Let's say, there is growing uncertainty over funding costs for banks and there is a scenario which is less and less remote whereby the funding cost of the French state and that of potentially of French banks may take hit to earnings and at this juncture maybe you're less in control as to as and when you plan to rebuild capital over time, maybe more forced into a preventive capital raise. Knowing that that would in big part serve to fund a temporary use of capital for the legacy assets. I'm just trying to understand what's your rationale behind essentially not trying to do a block sale? And we see more and more banks doing that actually and actually you're realizing their mark, so just the opportunity cost of potentially taking the risk of having to raise at the wrong time for the shareholders, I'm just trying to gauge on how you think about that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (66:57) Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, I'm sure that you are independent from your brokerage side. Just kidding. More seriously, no we are well aware let's say of current market environment. But as we also demonstrated in terms of liquidity and funding on slide 11, let's say we have the cushion which have been built and strengthened over the last 18 months. So definitely also when we look at the valuation of assets, we have certain yields that, of course, we adjust on market condition to potentially take opportunities and deleverage. So, again everything is a question of price. Also we can make without setting long-term repo to raise liquidity on certain asset classes, which is something that a lot of investment banks are proposing for, let's say, final long-term investors, and so we have also put into play this type of structure which is a way to continue to benefit from the carrying of certain assets while raising liquidity. But this is also the type of solution that is efficient from our, let's say, position and standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then maybe as a follow-up question, what are you seeing maybe at the moment in terms of your funding profile and the appetite of investors' potential? I don't know if there is any worry about getting funding done at this stage and worries about contagion going up all the way to Paris?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will let Didier comment, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, but really on the legacy asset, it's really a question of opportunity. Let me just say, and I might be wrong, but with what is developing, I see more and more cash in dollars which might not be invested in U.S. treasuries with what is being seen on the market, and potentially in the next three to six months, more and more appetite for our credit assets. So again it's not the question of strategy. We will <mark type="ph" /> sight (69:02) the opportunities.</p>
          <p>So far let me just say that what we've said on this portfolio in the last 18 months was in line with the reality we've seen. And we've just seen improvement. We're managing this portfolio in a very active, precise way, and we remain confident in the capacity to deleverage in a short period of time, and because here we talk about a question of months or few quarters.</p>
          <p>Didier, on the funding side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the funding side, well, you've seen that I would say that the market I'd say is more stretched I would say since mid-June. Nevertheless, being let's say a French bank with quality recognized by our counterparty. We continue, let's say, to have capacity to add liquidity on both dollar and euro market in good condition. We are let's say long to the Fed each night, also showing that even let's say short-term deposits prefer to be at SocGen every night than to be elsewhere. So I would say it's something which of course is a little bit more stretched but not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (70:12) for the whole marketplace but that we manage without any problem.</p>
          <p>In term of long-term funding, I would say we were, maybe I would say, let's recognize, lucky a little bit in certain windows that we faced in April in term of the pricing. As you can see, we are, let's say, well ahead of schedule in term of long-term liquidity raising. And as I said there is no need to try to go in the market long term at this stage, especially with the cushion that we have coming from the structured notes. As I said, it's something that is extremely recurring and relevant. And with this we will be, let's say, fully on track with the &#x20AC;26 billion at the latest by end of September whatever market condition are, so I think we are truly on the safe side both in terms of capacity issues, access to the markets and liquid asset <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:06).</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just got a few questions. I'm also trying to get my head around the legacy asset issue. You talked about deleveraging your positions over the next 18 months. Could you give guidance as to how much of your total portfolio you would delever it by?</p>
          <p>And then the losses you've incurred so far, and correct me if my understanding was wrong, but it seems more recently due to potential for reclassified CDOs or RMBS. Which is the one asset class within the total legacy asset portfolio where the book value is less than the fair value. If going forward would the incremental losses amount to about maybe &#x20AC;300 million for the remaining difference between the book value and the fair value, and then thereafter, we shouldn't incur any losses after that? So that's on legacy assets.</p>
          <p>And then secondly on your Basel III guidance, you've given 9% as of end 2013 and presumably that's not on a fully loaded basis. I was just wondering whether you could give your Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio at end 2012 on a fully loaded basis, or maybe alternatively give us guidance on how that 9% is made up by Basel III risk-weighted assets and Basel III common equity and what deductions you're applying there.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, perhaps you could give us some color on your experience of accessing U.S. funding in these volatile times. Are you noticing that there's any difficulty lately? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask again Didier to comment even more on the legacy assets and the funding. The 9% is full Basel III, all deduction, everything applied in 2013, and not according to the timeframe set by the regulator, and as I said, same thing for the global cities. On the global cities it's supposed to be implemented in 2016. So same thing, we all anticipate all that in 2013, so it's fully, fully, fully loaded.</p>
          <p>Didier will give more color again on the legacy assets and the funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so on the legacy assets, Andrew, you had the question about the CDOs, the &#x20AC;300 million gap between the book value and the credit value by BlackRock. Yes, this is a bucket where we know that we have further provision to set aside. The &#x20AC;300 million could move a little bit depending on the evolution of the underlying assets, let's say it's linked to the impairment loans and nonperforming loans evolution of the model. But, we feel that overall this would be more than offset by capacity that we have to realize positive item on the rest of the portfolio. As you can see that in the appendices, we have &#x20AC;600 million of asset credit quality value on the CMBS and &#x20AC;300 million on the CLOs, which just for these two buckets let's say more than offset the CDO impact. And on the CDO you've seen also that the dismantling of CDO that we have executed led us to get RMBS, which we have classified on available-for-sale with mark-to-market. We have now <mark type="indiscernible" /> (75:16) to deleverage these assets in the coming quarter.</p>
          <p>Your last point was on the U.S. dollar funding. Let's say what we can say is that the average tenure let's say of our <mark type="ph" /> CPCDs as shorter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (75:32) marketplace and &#x2013; but that's it, let's say when we look at the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (75:35) that we have on <mark type="ph" /> CPCD (75:38) market which is roughly &#x20AC;38 billion of paper that we have from this source of funding. We have also capacity to get dollars from this source of funding, and as I've said we have a lot of fixed asset flexibility overnight coming from various counterparts which each day prefer to put the money with us than to put the money elsewhere.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two quick questions on the dropped targets, and again Didier mentioned that the miss might come from two main divisions, one is GIM, the other one is CIB. Now, if I look at the GIM results for this first half annualized, I get around &#x20AC;300 million and the previous targets for 2012 is between &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;700 million. You mentioned, we might get a net profit in '12 below that &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;700 million bracket, but between &#x20AC;300 million and &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;300 million is what I'm estimating at the end of this year and &#x20AC;500 million is the lower end of the new targets &#x2013; of your targets, sorry. There is a big gap. How comfortable you are with the staying around the lower end of that target?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the CIB revenues: the old target was &#x20AC;9.5 billion in '12 and I understand the consensus is around &#x20AC;8.5 billion, &#x20AC;8.6 billion for the same year. Just wondering whether you are comfortable with that level of revenues, the consensus. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to correct a little bit, and maybe I was not clear enough. On the division that also I mentioned that is an International Retail Banking business. Also we will not be in the range of &#x20AC;0.9 billion to &#x20AC;1.1 billion, despite the fact that we said that we now have 88% of Geniki and we are likely to increase further, I'd say this percentage of ownership and thus get the full impact &#x2013; negative impact of the losses of Geniki in the International Retail Banking business. And also as also we said, Romania I would say lost one year of growth due to a recovery which took a little bit longer. And there also this is part of the explanation of the miss, I would say, that we will have compared to this low end of the range of &#x20AC;0.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Now on GIMS, we said that we are more likely to be at the low end of the range, let's say. We feel that especially if you adjust for some elements, as I said, provision for litigation, and also a poor revenue line let's say due to a brokerage weakness and still low level of interest rates, we feel that we have a capacity to return to a stronger profit already as from next quarter. And on the CIB side I will let Michel answer. But we are not there to update your spreadsheets, so maybe the moderate growth that we mentioned is sufficient. But Michel if you want to comment on the question regarding revenue at CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the guidance we spoke about a year ago was in normalized markets, and I'm convinced that in normalized market, this is something which we can achieve. The fact is that we are not in normalized markets. So for us, it's more a question of net profit, and already, you can see that in difficult markets, excluding the bad bank, we are producing more than &#x20AC;500 million net income on the quarter. And we are confident that this is a &#x2013; for the net income which is the most important achievement we have to comply with, and as Didier said, we think we will be close to these targets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've got two questions. The first one relates to Russia and the guidance that you had given of about &#x20AC;150 million of net profit. I can appreciate that you don't want to quantify the synergies yet, but compared with the guidance of &#x20AC;150 million, I don't really see what has changed, and therefore I'm wondering how we go from about zero to &#x20AC;150 million in one year, given that the cost of risk is quite low already because that would imply roughly 20% cut in the cost base which seems a little bit high given the inflation.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to the capital consumption of the toxic assets which had shrunk I think &#x20AC;500 million during the first half. Could you give us the split of the capital consumption between the 7% of RWA and the deduction? I think you said that the bulk of the drop was due to the lower deductions, but I wanted to double check that. So if you could give me the RWA for the good assets, or the better of the worse assets. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, maybe on the two topics, the &#x20AC;150 million net profit for Russia, I would say now it's a little bit rich, I would say compared also to the lower forecast we expect for International Retail Banking, certainly part of the target's been done by Russia. But I would say compared to your assumption which is to cut the costs that is also the dynamic in term of revenues, and we feel that even if we are late, as Jean-Louis Mattei mentioned in term of corporate loans, we are, let's say, on track in term of Retail Banking business and definitely we will benefit from this trend also to have operating gearing between top line and cost.</p>
          <p>On the bad bank, on the legacy assets, if we look at the risk-weighted assets at the end of the period, they were at &#x20AC;14.5 billion. And what I said is that a part of the &#x20AC;500 million is coming let's say half-half from the reduction in risk weighted assets and from the deduction. Deduction you can look at them let's say because they are essentially coming from this portfolio on the slide 26 as a big part of the bad debt deduction is coming from the securitization.</p>

          <p>Oh, good. Yes. I have a question on the International Retail division. You've had a nice rebound in North Africa. I just wondered is that the new profit run rate we should be thinking about. And specifically I wonder if that division's kind of benefited from any write-backs on those general provisions you took back in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jeremy (sic) [Kiri] (83:15), I will leave Jean-Louis Mattei to comment more in detail on the different countries, but we kept the provisioning, so we were prudent. We kept the provision. We did not see any increase on the cost of risk. But perhaps Jean-Louis, could you elaborate on the activity and what we can expect in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, concerning North Africa, as you know, we decided to get some provisioning during the first quarter. And as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned, we don't want to release this provisioning for the time being. But when we look at the figures for Q2, the cost of risk in both in the most impacted countries like Egypt and Tunisia during the crisis we faced this couple of months, the cost of risk is pretty low. And we don't need this general provisioning for the time being, but we decided to keep this provisioning.</p>
          <p>And concerning the activity, during this crisis, we faced some problems because &#x2013; for example in Tunisia, the 2020 outlets have been damaged during the crisis. But as of today, all the outlets in Tunisia and in Egypt are reopened, and the activity of the two banks is pretty normal as you know. Of course, even if we consider that the cost of risk is under control, something true is that mainly in Egypt, for example, the time being, the GDP of the country will not be at the level of our expectations before the crisis. So that means that we don't expect any increase of the cost of risk in these two countries but, of course, a certain slowdown of the economy in 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Anke Reingen from RBC actually. Sorry, I just had three questions please. The first is on &#x2013; unfortunately again on the legacy assets but &#x2013; I'm sorry if I missed this but I'm a bit confused about the &#x20AC;0. 9 billion of benefits in Basel III capital. Would this basically correspond to the 40 basis point mitigation on impacts you indicated at the end of last year? And, would the 15 basis point positive impact on the first half already be included in the &#x20AC;0.9 billion capital benefit or the 40 basis point benefit to the capital ratio? And, then secondly on Geniki, I'm sorry if I missed it but I can't really find the second quarter net loss and I wondered about the NPL ratio and the coverage ratio. And, then lastly on cost flexibility, I was just wondering at what point would you basically look at your cost base maybe a bit more proactively, especially in CIB or on some other areas like Retail Banking? Is it &#x2013; French Retail is the <mark type="ph" /> draws (86:40) first half on first half, has it somewhat to do with a seasonality? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will leave Didier comment on the capital and Geniki more detail. Again, on the cost/income, as I said on the CIB business, clearly our policy has been different; you can see that. The 60% cost/income is in line with what we've said, while we carry on investing in certain new businesses and IT systems. So, Michel will give you even more flavor on that in a minute. On the French Retail, we are going through a big project which is to merge two systems. There is a cost behind this project. I think it makes sense to do it because we have in mind to save on a yearly basis more than &#x20AC;200 million once we'll have a single system. I think it makes sense to do it, hence, and the cost of the project are there, but as you can see, we maintain a competitive cost/income ratio despite of this cost of project. Really, I think that making the bank able in the next three, four years precisely to deliver reasonable profitability while the capital base is increasing very much is a major strategic objective, and in the French Retail in particular I think these investments make sense. At the same time, we carry on saving, making productivity gains on the back offices, et cetera. It's something we carry on doing and that's why the cost income remains competitive. Perhaps, Michel, again, the cost flexibility on CIB, how we see that and then Didier on the legacy assets and Geniki.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>First of all, so on CIB the progression of cost in Q2 versus Q1 is minus 12%. So, already we've been, I think, demonstrating a strong control of the cost and year-on-year, it's plus 8%. But, we are indeed confident we will achieve a cost income/ratio below or at best &#x2013; at maximum at 60% for the year. We have invested, as we said, in initiatives and in also in our IT architecture but that has been very reasonable investment and the buffer we still have for the end of the year &#x2013; in between now and the end of the year is on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (89:38) side. So far, we have achieved 50% of our target for the year, and we could very well slow down if the market continues to be what it is.</p>

          <p>So, Anke, just to answer your first question on the legacy assets so the &#x20AC;0.9 billion of capital relief we expect from the dismantling of CDO. You can split that in two parts, so 35 &#x2013; &#x20AC;350 million roughly that is coming from the dismantling which has been done so this is the benefit that we expect from the Basel III, so on the Basel II it's roughly high profit because we have just half of the deduction. So this is what has participated to the 15 basis point increase on Page 9 coming from the legacy assets. The second part of the &#x20AC;550 million left will come when we will stop to sell the underlying RMBS. So, we are actually in the process to deliver as we started. So, this is a process that would take place in the coming quarter but of course that will tend to execute rather sooner than later and of course, having this end of 2013 target, of course, but we believe we can execute that faster than 2013. So that's how you can speak to the &#x20AC;0.9 billion so <mark type="indiscernible" /> (91:04) which is already secured just by the dismantling and on the Basel II. It's just 50% of this impact which we have, which has benefited because you know that the risk-weighted assets chart will double on the Basel III on these assets. The rest to come when we will divest the underlying RMBS. On Geniki, the last Geniki for BHFM for the Retail outside France is minus 733 &#x2013; 73 &#x2013; sorry, 73, on the net income after, I'd say, provisioning of &#x20AC;99 million, I would say in line with what we said in the previous quarters. So, we're expecting at Geniki roughly &#x20AC;100 million of provisioning run rate <mark type="ph" /> for the third quarter (91:54). In term of NPL, the level as of end of June to that 37; this is 0.6% and the coverage ratio is at 63.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon. A few questions on my side. Sorry, can you hear me? Okay, sorry. A few questions on my side; first one would be, do you think you have more room to dismantle more CDOs going forward or the 350 are the maximum that you could do? The second question would be on structured credit <mark type="indiscernible" /> (92:39) asset disposal, do you think &#x2013; what is the breakdown right now between high-grade securitization and low-grade securitization in the total assets that you have disposed of so far? And, also coming back again on legacy assets, in light of the current environment and the fact that there's less liquidity in the market and also more banks willing to sell structured credit, what's the outlook for you in terms of potential asset disposal going forward in the structured asset front? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yes, regarding the dismantling of CDO so we've executed three and launched two further. I would say we have capacity to continue to execute some but we will need to buy in at certain junior tranches to get the control of two, three or four that we can execute so it will take a little bit longer. So that's why in term of capital relief, the priority in the coming quarter will be more on selling the underlying RMBS that I mentioned that we have innovated from this dismantling. And, to be able at the same &#x2013; I hope by end of this year, maybe beginning of 2012 to dismantle further CDOs. Your question was the typology of asset that we were selling so between high-grade and low-grade, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:01).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question, it was....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. That's what is &#x2013; that what was the breakdown between high-grade securitization and low-grade securitization in the total assets &#x2013; securitized asset that you have disposed so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact, it is relatively well diversified. As I said, when I look at the total, let's say, &#x20AC;2.150 billion that we sold year-to-date, there is roughly &#x20AC;900 million which are CMBS and within that there are two <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:33) but they are also CMBS in that half so that were sold so they were clearly not what we can call high-grade structured credit assets. On the CLOs, it was essentially CLOs which had been upgraded so &#x2013; which <mark type="ph" /> however, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (94:49) not I would say AAA rated so &#x2013; and you can see that from the leverage detail that we provide on a quarterly basis. So, it was not just I'd say the best of the breed; if it was <mark type="ph" /> your another (95:04) question that we sold in the first half, I'm getting that clear what is poorly rated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (95:11) in our, let's say in our portfolio. So, it was well diversified and we're actually attentive to that.</p>
          <p>Your last point was &#x2013; yes, demand of the capacity on structured assets due to the fact that different, let's say, players between <mark type="indiscernible" /> (95:26) they were intending to sell. I would say we continue to see good demand, let's say, for the assets. For example, without providing any insight on what we made in July, and I said July was not an easy month from the marketplace. Nevertheless, let's say we were exactly on track with what we have made, let's say, year-to-date in term of the leverage capacity. So, this show that we can continue to deleverage even in difficult market condition, even with the supply that will come from other parties due to the fact that we are well marked and that, let's say, we continue to have certain appetite on this asset as I said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just a follow-up....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that there is overall a search of yield. And, I'm not sure that there will be a big change of that situation in the coming months, while at the same time there is more and more fear on one hand on sovereign bonds. And, where there is a lot of cash available at the end of the day, which needs in a way or another to be reinvested. So, we don't have the feeling I must say that there will be, in the coming months, a shortage of appetite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I just have a follow-up, just another question actually. I want this quickly done, if I may. What's your view around that, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (96:50) is now clearly trading at a relatively cheap valuation. If the environment was to remain as extreme as it is today, would you expect this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (97:00) to face the strong <mark type="indiscernible" /> (97:00) this year? It was &#x2013; if this was not to be the case, would you really consider cancelling the script option and probably &#x2013; and how would you <mark type="indiscernible" /> (97:10) opportunity of holding more cash and capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again it's absolutely premature to comment on that. We keep in mind to have a script option dividend and we'd see at the end of the year but at this stage I don't see why we should change our &#x2013; we should change this view which is something which is on top of that pretty well received by our shareholders so I don't see why we should change that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember that the last proposal was made let's say <mark type="indiscernible" /> took place (97:50) end of May so it was originally June when markets had become shaky and despite that we were able to get so these 68% success rate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Didier and Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. What is your current amount of U.S. commercial paper reliance please? I think you've given this number in the past. More broadly, can you just remind us &#x2013; in the past, post Lehman's, potentially last year, what you have done, what process you've gone through when short-term dollar markets have shut down? This is your first <mark type="indiscernible" /> (98:35), the ECD, euro-dollar window or what is that process? Secondly, coming back to an earlier question, could you give more color on the drop in the revenue margin on AUM at the private bank please? It seems quite steep at almost 15 basis points. Is there anything else there that has to be taken into account, excluding less transactional activity from clients? And, then finally &#x2013; sorry if I missed this but can you give the usual breakdown of NPL ratios and coverage ratios in International Retail by country please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I &#x2013; I will ask Jacques to answer on the private side, Didier on the short-term funding and perhaps the main countries because of the way <mark type="indiscernible" /> (99:29) a bit boring if we go through all the countries but Didier also on the NPL of most countries. So, Didier, first of all the funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (99:39) well, as I said earlier, I'd say our reliance on U.S. CPCD as of end of June was &#x20AC;38 billion and let's say I will not provide you a day-to-day update because I think this is not the rule of the game. But, as I said, we continue to have good access. Clearly, the tenure has been shortened really but it is a market environment which was in that direction. And. as I said, we continue to have extremely long position <mark type="indiscernible" /> (100:03) showing that we have let's say this excess buffer and cushion which make us so comfortable with our dollar position. Maybe before giving the floor to Jacques, I would commence on the NPL. So, on the key countries, I already commented on Geniki, on KB. On KB, NPL went down from 4.8 to 4.7 coverage ratio up from 72 to 73. For BRD, we have NPL which has a slight increase from 11.9 to 12.7; coverage ratio in the mid-40s, stable; and I think maybe with Russia, you will get what you need on Russia, the whole &#x2013; I don't have Russia as a whole <mark type="indiscernible" /> (101:01) which is the bulk of it, I would say. NPL slightly increased from 9.2 to 9.4, but so also was the increase on the coverage ratio which has increased from 68 to 70 so you can see that for most countries, we have strengthened our <mark type="ph" /> resilient (101:20) policy so for Czech Republic, Russia and Romania and Geniki, I already mentioned that to Anke in the previous questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, on the private banking side, not much to comment on that one. The quarter has been marked by some rather low activity on the brokerage side, same thing, low appetite of the clients on the structured product and low opportunity on the treasury side. We have also to keep in mind that the assets of private banking have increased very strongly in the last quarters and even 10% on an annual basis this quarter, which means that the margin versus AUM is also slowing down because of the fact that new assets that come in tend to have lower yield at the very beginning of the relation.</p>

          <p>Hi there, just a few questions. What is your position now on the disposals from your underperforming businesses? And, second question is related to that. What are your plans for a TCW IPO now? And, then thirdly, can you give us a bit of color on this Newedge litigation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not change, again, my comments on the disposal. It's clear that we will refocus certain business and dispose off some, but we'll not announce in advance. What I can just &#x2013; what I just would like to highlight is, again, the way &#x2013; meanwhile we managed the capital and if I just take, for example, the financial services, they are absolutely in line with what we expect in terms of performances and improvement. While you will see that the outstanding do not increase and it's &#x2013; really there is a significant refocusing &#x2013; I would say organic refocusing which is being done in this business, which we have highlighted as one where effectively we would like to do so. I will not comment on TCW except that, again, the performances are good. I'm happy with the turnaround which happened in &#x2013; with the new team and we've had now, in the last three quarters, good performances. Newedge, we are not going to comment on a small item. We highlighted it is a &#x20AC;12 million item but, again, it's a litigation and usually you don't enter into the details of such things. It's a one-off item which is, at the end of the day, not that big.</p>
