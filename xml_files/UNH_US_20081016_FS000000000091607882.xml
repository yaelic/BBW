        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us today.  We moved our call a few days ahead so we could provide more timely information given the turbulence in the capital markets these past weeks.  This morning we are pleased to report an improving picture in our business performance in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We reported earnings per share of $0.75 with key financial metrics in line and in some instances stronger than our most recent outlook.  Our balance sheet is very strong and our investment portfolio is positioned conservatively in highly liquid securities and a high cash position.  We've realized a net capital gain of $58 million on this portfolio year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter earnings per share of $0.75 includes the realization of $0.02 per share in net capital losses.  The quarter also includes the absorption of $0.03 per share for estimated cost of resolving a legal matter.  And finally, we saw a benefit of $0.02 per share from a change in the estimated net cost to settle two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices.</p>
          <p>The third quarter performance was influenced by better than projected growth in most enrollment categories and improvement in clinical care and operating cost trends.  Fourth quarter net earnings are projected to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.80 per share.  We have not projected any meaningful capital gains or losses on investments in these numbers.</p>
          <p>One of the purposes of holding our call earlier is to address questions related to the financial strength of the industry and our enterprise.  So, we will begin this morning by focusing on our balance sheet, capital base and liquidity, which are strong across the board.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operations on an adjusted basis of $2.4 billion excluding the settlement payment.  This is consistent with our full year cash flow outlook approaching $5 billion as adjusted.  This exceptional cash generation allowed us to fully fund previously announced legal settlements and to reduce our debt to debt plus equity ratio from 40.4% to 39.2% over the quarter.  We expect that ratio will be lower by year end depending on market conditions.</p>
          <p>We will remain regular active participants in the commercial paper market.  We ended the quarter with less than $600 million outstanding.  Our commercial paper program is backstopped by a $2.5 billion bank credit facility that extends through 2012 and is supported by 26 financial institutions as well as further support from a 364-day credit facility.  There are no balances outstanding under these facilities.</p>
          <p>With respect to future liquidity and debt refinancing, we have term debt totaling $900 million due before the end of the first quarter of 2009 and approximately 450 million in the third quarter of 2009.  We expect to refinance those bonds in the fixed income market by then but could repay them entirely from our cash flows if needed.</p>
          <p>Our investment portfolio performed well on a relative basis in the third quarter.  We had small positions in issuers such as Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and AIG.  As previously discussed, our net realized losses were $45 million, including net losses of $67 million from sales and other than temporary impairments realized subsequent to September 15th in response to market conditions.  This $45 million net loss represents 0.2% of the total of the $20.4 billion cash and investments on our balance sheet.  That brings us to a net realized capital gain of $58 million through the first nine months of 2008, a distinctive accomplishment in this period of capital market turbulence.</p>
          <p>We had a net unrealized loss position of $282 million on September 30, or 1.4% of the total portfolio value and the clear expectation and intent to hold these investments to their maturity.  We continue to be well served by the philosophy of having a large fixed income investment portfolio that is highly liquid with $6 billion in cash and cash equivalent, highly diversified and characterized by strong credit quality with over 80% of the portfolio and securities rated AA or higher.  Our practice is to hold investment grade bonds; more than 99% of the portfolio is investment grade. The less than 1% that is not resulted largely from a recent acquisition that has not yet been brought fully into line with our portfolio standards.</p>
          <p>With respect to overall capital levels, we have regulated capital of more than $10 billion at September 30.  We project this will increase to approximately $11 billion by year-end, which will put us at 580% or $9 billion in excess of the minimum regulatory risk based capital level at December 31, 2008.  Given the conservative profile of our investment policies, we believe we are more than adequately capitalized even amid the unprecedented volatility of the broad capital market.</p>
          <p>We'll now shift the discussion to our third quarter performance in two simple sections, our health benefit businesses and our health services businesses.  Earnings from operations for our health benefit businesses, which include UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice were $1.2 billion.  This was an increase of more than $100 million from the second quarter of 2008 and an 80 basis point improvement in the overall operating margins to 6.8%.</p>
          <p>UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits business performed better this quarter.  Risk-based enrollment grew on a same-store basis for the first time in a number of quarters.  Fee-based business declined by 25,000 people as anticipated in response to employment attrition, which we expect will continue and accelerate.  Sequentially, the traditional UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased by 10 basis points to 83%, a performance slightly better than we projected, while operating costs decreased sequentially in response to continuing cost reduction efforts initiated two quarters ago.</p>
          <p>While it is still very early, we have made progress in engaging more closely in local markets.  Our customers are telling us our service and resolution disciplines are steadily improving.  Our regional structure is in place and stronger leadership teams are focused on improved execution.  Further integration efforts across UnitedHealthcare are moving forward steadily.</p>
          <p>We are addressing pricing and underwriting in a disciplined fashion and have taken the steps we discussed in our last quarterly call.  We brought back a past company leader to resume national underwriting oversight responsibility.  We are taking action on a market-by-market basis to address product positioning, reduce new business discounting, hold the line on case level negotiations and work to lower medical cost trends.  We are pricing customer renewals to their expected trend.  These improvements will advance steadily and increase their impact as more of 2009 matures.  We expect these underwriting disciplines combined with more locally engaged fundamental care management will ultimately improve our year-over-year margin trend.</p>
          <p>We also continue our focus on care provider relationships.  We have put resources back into local markets to better serve those relationships and our local market leaders have been specifically tasked to rebuild our relationship equity on a market by market basis.  We quantify these efforts on a relative basis through surveys and we align compensation to the performance improvement.</p>
          <p>Our medical cost trends have remained stable.  We continue to see 2009 commercial trends in a corridor of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points, with in-patient unit costs our biggest concern in specific markets.  While we believe our UnitedHealthcare business is steadily strengthening, we clearly expect first quarter 2009 enrollment levels will be down significantly comparable to first quarter 2008 and possibly greater.  We are of course addressing enrollments, but our greatest near term priority is optimizing our product alignment, premium yield, and medical cost trend in each market.  We are confident profit and growth will quickly follow.</p>
          <p>Our Ovations senior health benefits businesses are also steadily improving.  This quarter our Medicare Advantage business grew by 25,000 people, bringing our organic year-to-date increase to 80,000 and the total increase to 110,000 members to date.  Medicare Supplement business also increased 110,000 year-to-date, with 35,000 member growth in the third quarter.  And our Medicare Part D business grew by 20,000 members in the third quarter.  These are all encouraging signs.</p>
          <p>We are much better positioned as we head into 2009.  Benefit adjustments have been made across the Board and particularly in our Special Need Plans.  Our distribution disciplines are improved.  Our Part D auto assignment market position is much better.  We obviously cannot predict the ultimate mix we will achieve by the end of the enrollment season, but a realistic perspective on 2009 might have us with growth comparable to 2008, but with a clearly better business mix.</p>
          <p>Ovations is committed to much more effective fundamental medical cost management performance across our senior markets.  This is a result of consolidating and integrating our in-market care management efforts with our UnitedHealthcare management resources on a regional basis.  This will be important to Ovations' 2009 performance.</p>
          <p>AmeriChoice continued its strong performance in the quarter.  Total Medicaid membership grew by 85,000 people this quarter, bringing year-to-date expansion including Unison to 630,000 people.  On an organic basis, we are up 250,000 people this year and accelerating with recent wins positioning us for strong growth and performance in 2009.  We are currently building staff to support growth in markets like Tennessee, where we will provide behavioral medical benefits to more than one quarter million new people by early 2009.</p>
          <p>Our services businesses include OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions.  They all serve the healthcare marketplace broadly and continued to be an important dimension of growth, diversification, and innovation for UnitedHealth Group.</p>
          <p>On a combined basis, these businesses posted third quarter revenues of $4.7 billion and a sequential 3.5% increase in earnings from operation with total operating earnings of $323 million.  These businesses also realized a modest decrease in overall operating cost in the quarter.  Operating margins improved sequentially for OptumHealth to 13.5% and Ingenix to 14.9%, while Prescription Solutions margins remained flat at 3%, which represents a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year.</p>
          <p>Key developments include continued progress in health banking, the preparation for launch of an updated consumer portal business, and steadily stronger consumer demand for mail service pharmacy and generic drugs.</p>
          <p>Medical costs at OptumHealth improved sequentially.  We saw improvements in third quarter behavioral cost trends, but we expect the economic climate to remain a factor in behavioral health utilization.  OptumHealth is also significantly impacted by UnitedHeathcare membership trends, which have been the largest factor in OptumHealth's 2008 performance.  This will also remain a factor in 2009.  This higher margin membership is being replaced by lower margin Medicaid and government program business.</p>
          <p>Ingenix has actually had an important growth year advancing meaningfully in its consulting services, government market businesses, lines, and data and analytic services.  Sales growth of 45% year-to-date across the payer, provider, government and other market segments has been offset by the sharply higher level of CRO project cancellations as pharma companies respond to their own market pressures and narrow their development effort.  We have seen this trend at times in the past and expect growth to resume in the future.</p>
          <p>Prescription Solutions continues to grow steadily and mature its operations.  It has made significant progress towards insourcing specialty pharma services for all of UnitedHealth Group.  Organic membership growth outside the UnitedHealth businesses exceeded 400,000 people year-to-date as Prescription Solutions steadily emerges as a full-line large scale national pharmacy benefits manager.  We were gratified that JD Power &amp; Associates gave Prescription Solutions its highest rating among mail order pharmacies for 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, the negative economic climate and outlook severely limits our visibility for 2009.  We are assuming employment levels will be challenging and will accelerate member attrition.  We are seeing selective examples of price discipline strengthening for commercial risk products in local markets, although it is too early to conclude this forms any real trend.  We will continue to be vigilant in our pricing disciplines in both risk and non-risk benefit product and are assuming lower membership in both categories as we enter 2009.</p>
          <p>While we're better positioned in Medicare and Medicaid entering 2009, we can't know the membership mix we will ultimately achieve in Medicare or what state level rate actions will impact our growing Medicaid business during 2009.  We are comfortable with our commercial medical cost trend outlook for 2009 at 8% plus or minus 50 basis points.  We continued to view our consolidated 2008 medical care ratio as within a range of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.  Clearly there are real scenarios where that range could move slightly higher in 2009, driven most significantly by our ultimate product and business mix across our healthcare benefits businesses, including the level of growth achieved in public and senior market product.</p>
          <p>Our comments focus only on the full year because the growth in offerings that have quarter-to-quarter swings in benefit usage, like high deductible consumer products and Part D benefit offering has increased quarterly volatility in these ratios over the last two years.  And we are confident our operating cost performance in 2009 will continue to improve meaningfully and better match our business levels than in 2008.  We've already implemented actions to achieve more than 400 million in run rate operating cost and there are substantially more opportunities.  Areas for additional savings include benefits from merger integration, reductions in administrative staff and overhead areas, and further repositioning in our technology organization to increase efficiency and reduce capital spending.</p>
          <p>We will continue to size our staffing to match the growth profile in our benefit businesses for January 1, 2009, while continuing to advance customer service, market level responsiveness and our innovation agenda.  Our overall financial position is strong with a conservatively constructed investment portfolio and capital position significantly in excess of any regulatory company action level.  Our operating cash flow capacities will further fortify that strong capital and liquidity outlook for 2009.  We can expect 2009 investment income will be less than 2008, particularly in the first quarter, while scheduled debt replacements will be at higher overall interest cost.</p>
          <p>Given those basic themes from this business, we see 2009 at an operating earnings level prior to investment income that plays out relatively flat for 2008 with clear room for upside if we perform to our plan.  While this mix translates into a positive per share earnings scenario given currently projected share count levels, the performance range in this environment should be quite wide.  We see an overall revenue range from 84 to $86 billion and a per share earnings outlook that could range from $2.90 per share to $3.15 per share.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations should continue to be very strong in relationship to net earnings.  Share repurchase activity will clearly be an important component of overall results, but market factors will influence the specific level and timing of repurchases in 2009.  In 2009 we will begin to match the practices of many Fortune 50 companies and move to annual rather than quarterly financial guidance.  This should serve to create a conservation better aligned to long-term trends of the business and is consistent with the many reforms we've embraced.</p>
          <p>Finally, many have asked about healthcare reform and its implications for our business in 2009 and beyond.  On balance, our perspective on this is that we are an important enabler of reform and a committed participant in the reform process.  We support universal healthcare coverage as a broad policy goal and have a proven record working with the Federal Government and many state governments to implement existing Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The expansion of health insurance to those Americans who currently lack coverage will present additional opportunities for public-private collaboration.</p>
          <p>A number of commentators now believe that the pace and magnitude of change will be less than some had previously anticipated.  The reasoning is very basic.  There are now meaningfully fewer financial resources to dedicate to this important effort than just a few months ago.  And the priority of this issue has been overshadowed by even greater public concern about economic security issue among the current turmoil.</p>
          <p>First generation efforts will likely focus on reforms that do not require near term funding or significant disruption, such as information and transparency, children's health initiatives, coverage policies for individuals and the like.  In fact, we think Medicaid SCHIP expansion may well be the first major funded priority in healthcare for a new administration and that is an undertaking we can enable very effectively.</p>
          <p>We ultimately anticipate pressure on Medicare Advantage and Medicaid rates, but we are well along in preparing to respond with more effective care management practices and network strategies that will allow us to advance a better cost structure and thereby continue to diversify and grow in Medicare and Medicaid in a measured and profitable fashion.  We remain flexible and adaptable to changes in the market and are more engaged than ever before in a rational and staged change agenda as a partner in making reform work.</p>
          <p>Before taking questions, let me briefly sum up the key points of this morning.  The third quarter performance improved from a core earnings perspective with very early signs that actions we are taking across the business should translate to steadily improving results quarter-by-quarter.  Our financial position is strong and we are committed to keeping it that way.  Our business model does not rely on investment income or excessive leverage.  We focus on earnings from the products and services we offer and seek to maintain a capital structure that is both prudent and efficient.  We are managing our capital and our operating resources conservatively, focused on retooling our benefit businesses along fundamental performance themes and creating higher growth in our services businesses.  Our goal remains driving broader solutions and innovation across the healthcare landscape.</p>
          <p>We are understandably cautious entering 2009 given the economic and political climate.  But at the same time our internal improvement momentum is building and we believe we are better positioned as an enabler of national healthcare agenda than any other enterprise in the marketplace.  This is a first look at 2009.  We are holding our investor conference on December 2nd in New York at which we can discuss further our progress and what we see for 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>And at this time I'd like to open up for questions.  I am joined in this room by many of our senior business colleagues.  And John Penshorn, Brett Manderfeld, Mike Mikan, as well as Gail Boudreaux, Bill Munsell, Tony Welters and others will continue to be available after this call to respond any additional questions you may have.  Now we will return this to the moderator and take questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  Would like to just get a little bit more color on the prior period development you reported in the quarter, the 130 million, can you tell us what drove that and what impact it had specifically on the commercial MLR?  And then Steve I think you mentioned the initiatives that are going on within the company to improve the trajectory of commercial margin as you move into '09?  Can you give us some idea of where you expect that commercial margin to &#x2013; or the commercial MLR to come out in '09, just down, flat, up and what initiatives exactly are taking place there and how they are going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Justin.  Your first question on development, Mike you want to respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, it's pretty much split evenly between the government businesses and the commercial business.  It had about a 60 basis point impact on the quarter for the commercial business.  There was slight development in the other businesses as well, but most of the development came from the government and commercial businesses.  And what's driving it mostly in the commercial business is coming out of the West Coast.  We've seen some improvements there and in the government business.  It's spread pretty evenly in the Medicaid business and we are seeing some favorable development out of the Evercare institutional business, which we saw significant trends early in the year.  That should summarize it for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Justin this is early so we are really not offering guidance on the 2009 MLR.  We just offered a theme; we had indicated &#x2013; kind of grounded you in the consolidated care ratio for 2008 and I think when we meet in December we will have more to say about the more specific care ratios for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just Mike when you said the West Coast helped the prior period development in the commercial space, can you tell specifically what happened on the West Coast, was it inpatient utilization or was it pricing getting better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I would say these vis-&#xE0;-vis what our trends were &#x2013; that were embedded in our reserves, they have come out more favorable &#x2013; quite favorably and it's come across the board.  We took significant actions around bed day management, strong contractual &#x2013; contracting efforts as well and those actions that we've taken have improved our outlook now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good morning. Stephen, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like that the sort of the biggest area of concern or unknown is the economy in terms of the impact on your business and so I am curious if we look back to sort of that last downturn 2002 period several of the UnitedHealth Group businesses performed particularly well.  So I am curious what's different? Can we use that period as a proxy or which businesses specifically other than membership attrition obviously would you expect to be impacted by the downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Josh I am going to keep this broad.  But I think if you just stand back and look at the economic climate in total, in this country, and you look at the trends of employment levels et-cetera, we just think it is prudent to make sure that we are responding to those trends.  We are seeing evidence of that on a day-to-day basis in our businesses and to be cautious with respect to positioning for 2009 given the fact that I think this economic climate has moved swiftly and that we are exercising that caution.</p>
          <p>I don't want anybody to get the impression that we aren't intensely focused on our businesses, that we don't see areas of clear executional improvement across the spectrum of our businesses and that we could perform better than what I am suggesting in this.  And I will tell you our clear focus and intent is to perform better, but I think in terms of establishing kind of a very early themes with respect to an '09, I think that it's very appropriate for us to kind of set a grounding in this range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I think I get the gist then.  Can I just sneak an MLR question, it sounds like the biggest negative drivers this year have been the SNIPs, the PDP and the Behavioral Health.  It's fair to say that the SNIPs and PDP were fixed for the bidding process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; Simon, do you want to respond to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Josh, so, for the chronic special needs plans, we substantially adjusted the 2009 benefit to put their economics on a more sustainable basis.  So while their overall performance will still be affected by the risk profile of our legacy of chronic SNIP members, 2009 chronic SNIP benefits have largely been aligned with those of our core HMO products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And the PDP I saw obviously the bids were up again?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I could just ask a question just again on the 2009 outlook and in the discussion that you just had earlier, if we look back to the last recession or sort of quasi-recession 2001, 2002, you actually grew EPS by 40% in that two-year period. I mean isn't it fair to say that what's different here is that, you do have a deeper economic downturn, but the primary headwind is the industry cycle itself and the pressure on pricing and the downward pressure that that's putting on underwriting margins.  And I guess on that front, my question is, do you have a line of sight that that will improve materially in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would agree that pressure in the marketplace plays into our thinking and that in combination with a troubling 2009 economic outlook is clearly what part of our broad calculus.  So I would agree with your basic premise there Matthew. Gail, do you want to respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Let me address the pricing question; as we discussed in our last call we've taken a very disciplined approach at pricing and our strategy remains what we have said before, which is to price to our forward view of costs.  I think we've got a pretty good handle on our costs.</p>
          <p>So I guess the answer I would say is we have got a pretty disciplined cost structure. We've already taken the actions that we talked about; one is increasing our renewal pricing.  We've been holding the line on our case-by-case negotiations, and we have reduced our new business pricing.  And I think another important part of it, we are also continuing to work at the market level on managing our medical costs and ensuring that we've got our products appropriately positioned through our regional local structure.  So from that perspective, I think we've taken the actions that we talked about and while we are cautious in our outlook, feel that we have got some good momentum there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I could just sneak in one more there on the outlook for January and as you think about commercial enrollment maybe being down comparably to what you experienced coming into this year.  Is the composition of that though &#x2013; I mean coming into this year if my numbers are right I think you lost about 550,000 commercial risk-based lives and the fee-based enrollment was approximately flat.  Are you looking at a change in the composition of where you may see an enrollment drain going into 2009?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are not trying to give you first quarter membership direction.  I think we tried to suggest that we are seeing that it could be at a level of 2008 or it could be worse than that. I would say there will be more fee in that mix and I think that will be safe to say, but I think giving direction beyond that right now Matt is something we are just not prepared to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good morning.  Just wondering if you could elaborate a bit just on the comment you made about seeing some select improvement in commercial risk pricing so far? Maybe if you can elaborate whether you are seeing that more from select blues or more on the public MCO competitor side?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Overall, the pricing environment is still competitive but we believe it's pretty rational.  When we take a broad-based perspective on the market, we haven't seen any intensification in the competitive environment.  But we are seeing some firming in selected markets and I'll use the example of the Southeast and as well as the Midwest; the West certainly remains competitive.  I think it's too early to tell in terms of small group pricing because those renewals are in the process of occurring right now and those rates are being filed.  But again overall, we think that the environment is pretty stable and we do see some examples of firming.  We have been very disciplined in our pricing as I said before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I could just slip in a quick follow-up just around Medicare Advantage rates, and Steve maybe just get a sense of your thinking on how significant cuts would have to be for you to maybe think about pulling back on the level of focus or attention that you have on MA. Maybe thinking about relative to traditional FFS, if we went back to 100% of FFS would you still be comfortable or if we took it all way back down to 95%, have you thought about some ranges relative to FFS where you see the business just becoming much less attractive or still staying attractive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are very focused on that marketplace and the needs of that marketplace and if you look at the demographics and the response that is required, the assets of this organization are just ideally positioned to respond to that in the near-term and the long term.  Whether we calibrate at what particular stages we may take a different view in terms of how we mix that business, I don't think we are prepared to respond.  But I will tell you we are positive about that business, we recognize that there will be rate pressure.  We have been anticipating that for some time in terms of how we generally manage and position our product alignment and our rates, and how we are going after the care management dynamics, and the cultivation of networks to respond to that on a long-term basis.</p>
          <p>So, there has been a great deal of positioning in terms of that business for some time and we are beginning to see early evidence of how that can be effective.  I'll let Simon respond in terms of what we might see in terms of how quickly rate pressure might come on us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  So, it's got &#x2013; just building on what Steve has said we are obviously planning on the assumption that there will be further rate pressure from 2010 and beyond.  But in some ways it's worth remembering that's not new. For several years now, the industry has had to deal with annual gap between Medicare rate uplift and Medicare medical cost trends.  So, as happens every year, there are four main dials on our control panel that you can adjust.</p>
          <p>First, your annual benefit and there is no doubt that large reimbursement cuts would mean significant cuts to Medicare benefits for 10 million local and politically engaged seniors. Secondly, there is the effectiveness and the intensity of your medical cost management as Steve talked about, and we think we have got further scope for gains here. Third, there are your operating costs and scale efficiency is going to be particularly important there.  And then fourth, yes your margins and we've made selective adjustments for 2009 where we feel there is a justified growth opportunity.</p>
          <p>So, I think to be fair, the question is what sort of companies are going to be most durable in this environment.  It's going to be those with strong network purchasing power and a well-developed clinical care model for seniors; those that can harness operating scale efficiencies, those who are well diversified both geographically and across the full range of Medicare services.  Remember we're the market leader in products in the traditional part of Medicare, not just Medicare Advantage so as the market moves back in that direction we would expect to see faster growth in our Medicare supplement and our Part D businesses.</p>
          <p>And then finally, as Steve said it's going to be about how organizations can evolve and adapt.  We can retool our underlying care management competencies and our consumer engagement platforms, but whatever the evolving Medicare financing platform looks like because regardless of how the policy evolves, the underlying demographics aren't changing.  The fact is Medicare spending is going to double over the next decade and the rise in chronic conditions is going to increase the demand for the kind of services we offer, not reduce them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  A couple of questions on the investment portfolio, I'll just focus on that for a minute here.  So, could you update us on the performance of the portfolio kind of -- as current as you can get us through October given the market conditions, just some broad comments on that?  And then, maybe also update on the mix, if you could break down for us kind of treasuries, munis, and then corporates' equities and private equity or VC, just kind of broad mix where it stands today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would be giving you an estimate. As you know John, it's changing every day.  But as we've seen the &#x2013; you use any one of the indices that are out there, they would say that the market is down roughly another 2 or 3 points month to date.  If you extrapolate that across our portfolio our unrealized position may be down another 1% or so.  And if I break out the portfolio &#x2013; I'll try to do that for you, we've got as Steve said, $6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, roughly 30% of our portfolio; we've got 1.5 billion in U.S. government and agencies which is roughly 7% of our portfolio; mortgage debt securities of 3 billion, roughly 15% of our portfolio; all three of those categories are average AAA quality.  $6.6 billion of municipals, roughly 32% of our portfolio; and the balance is made up of corporate debt securities of 2.7 billion roughly 14% and then some venture investments and our employee savings plan is the delta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And so, you think kind of net unrealized position down 1%, so that kind of netted against probably I assume the treasuries could give you some unrealized gain that you are netting against, is that the right way to think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the area to focus in on it is that &#x2013; is where the market is I think rightfully focused in is the corporate debt securities.  We feel confident in our position there.  We are right in line with the indices that have been quoted of down 6.4% of that 2.7 billion, which is roughly 172 million of the 280 million unrealized gains and we are tracking it closely but yes, I would agree with you in this case.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've stated before that we believe that there is a correlation with the economy especially employment and help expenditures, we think there is roughly a 2 to 4 year call it a 3-year lag in health expenditures from the economy.  So, as the economy enters into a recession, we believe that utilization or health expenditures, we will see that decline roughly three years after that.  We do believe that our products are appropriately matched to that type of economy and we think that in the short-term you may see some differences in utilization depending on the market actions that we've seen in the marketplace today in this tumultuous time.  But we really haven't seen anything different from what we've expected.  So, overall we expect utilization to be roughly comparable to what we've been seeing to date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question.  I guess given I only have one, I need to go back to understand what you are talking about Stephen, sorry to press you on this point.  And when you say that membership could be flat with 2008 first quarter or maybe worse, are you talking about the number reported at March, or are you talking about the number you reported on January 1st, because there could have been attrition or gains within the quarter that we don't know about?  And that's -- and it may make or say 12/31/07, in other words do we go back to the end of '07 to start our counting or do we go back to the end of first quarter '08 to start our counting?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we intended was to suggest that basically it is what we experienced in the first quarter of last year &#x2013; that is the first quarter of 2008.  And, I would compare that &#x2013; we really speak largely in quarters to what we expect in the first quarter of 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, end of quarter -- end of quarter and okay, thank you for the clarification.  And can I follow-up on the comments that you've made &#x2013; I think Mike made a comment about this and so did Gail about the correct positioning of the product mix, the focus on the local &#x2013; the refocusing on local and regional expertise that the company abandoned and when it went national, standardized decisions et cetera. Can you give me an update on where you are and why you think your products are well positioned for today, how much of that transition has taken place?  And just how different the company is at the regional and local level today than it was using product mix for example as a proxy or any other that you might choose?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would be happy, I would suggest that it is early, but I think there has been some nice progress made, even the fact that we are very &#x2013; in the very early stages of it.  Gail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Sheryl.  Let me give you a quick update on where we stand on the regional structure.  First, the structure and leadership already in place and we've aligned our organization to support the model and that includes our network, our clinical and our provider relations resources.  And while as Steve said it is still early, we are already seeing more engagement in local decision making and better execution of our strategies at the market level and as you know that's where health care purchasing decision are made.</p>
          <p>So, what does that translate into?  It translates into stronger sales, better relationships with our distribution partners, and more effective positioning.  And an example of the more effective positioning, we launched two products this year, Simply Engaged and our Edge products and those products are actually very well positioned given the focus on affordability at the employer level. Simply Engaged is an example of a product that incents our members to engage in health and wellness activities.  And the other product is focused on getting members to premium designations.</p>
          <p>The issue on positioning is a great one because the product &#x2013; Simply Engaged product is extremely popular in the Southwest.  It's been positioned appropriately against the market dynamics there, whereas Edge is probably our top product in the Florida market, and again based on the competitive dynamics there.</p>
          <p>And the other piece of our regional structure that we put in place and I think we talked about on the last call is, we moved to four consistent geographic regions across our benefits businesses. That's both for UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, and our AmeriChoice business, and what we are seeing there is better coordination and the good sharing of resources, and how that translates again is as we face out to the provider community that allows us to more &#x2013; to better leverage all of our UnitedHealth Group assets and that's in our clinical management and our affordability programs, which Simon talked a bit about in Ovations, but clearly our focus again as we enter a market where clinical care management is going to be continually important.</p>
          <p>I guess the last piece that I just want to point out in terms of early momentum on this model, as this gives our regional leaders a real clear line of sight and I think accountability for these programs and results at the market.  So, that's how I see the regional model playing and what we think are some good early indicators of good execution at the market level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And what impact have you had on your premium trend, when you say the pricing can you characterize it as your premiums are equal to at cost trends slightly below, 50 basis points below et cetera?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of premium trends, we are again focused on pricing to our forward view of costs for 2009; we've got a good look at that.  In terms of 2008, we're essentially on line with the guidance we gave in the second quarter on premium trends.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  Most have been asked, but with respects to Medicare for next year, when &#x2013; at what point will you be able to assess based on evaluating your competitors' product offering and pricing and what the risk of selection bias is in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, you want to respond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was it selection bias in a particular product you were thinking of Charles or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Medicare Advantage and the PDP would be the most important ones.  For example this year as you know, Humana wound up with about 180,000 very high drug users they weren't expecting last year this time and the year before it was Sierra who was hit. And so, each year as you see what your competitions' product offering and pricing looks like, I assume you compare yours side-by-side and assess whether you or somebody else will attract an unusually risky pool of customers.  And so, I'm just wondering at what point you go through that process and are better able to size up the potential risk going into '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so taking the two in turn then, on Part D we have had a modest stream of increases in the four dollar range on our most popular plans.  So, we think we're in headlines terms probably in the middle of the pack there. We don't think we're likely to be likely to be spreadsheeted as it were.  On the auto assigned elements of Part D which gave rise to a significant part of the selection effects that you we were talking about earlier in 2008, you'll see from our bidding that we took a very selective approach to which regions we thought could be economically viable for us in 2009, 8 new regions fell into that category.  But in certain other large regions such as New York, California or Florida, our assessment was that the economics weren't viable, so we didn't bid to come below the auto assigned benchmark.</p>
          <p>As for Medicare Advantage, we have in selected markets improved some of our benefits on our HMO products.  We have adjusted downwards some of our chronic SNIP benefits as we talked about.  And one of the main dynamics I suspect will be the impacts of the decision of some competitors to put premiums on some of their products may have.  Whether that will create risk election effects for other plans I don't know, but we don't see why that should be a main consideration or main issue for our MA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At what point would you know, is there a way predict by actually evaluating your product and pricing up against your competition now and have a team of actuaries kind of assess how the populations might behave and whether you would attract a healthier or sicker population or do you need to actually wait and see the behavior in the first two quarters of '09 to make that assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we do that continually as the information available to us evolves.  So, obviously in the course of the last few days we've been able to assess how we are positioned competitively on a county-by-county basis across the products then towards the end of the year, the beginning of January we will get CMS risk scores for some of the new auto assigned Part D members for example and we will also see some risk adjustment catch-up for some of the Chronic Special Needs Plan members for whom we were under compensated in the first year &#x2013; this year.

          <p>I guess I might comment, actually as we develop these &#x2013; our proposal positions kind of going back into the middle of the year, we actually do what I'll call kind of game theory in terms of what would likely happen in the marketplace, what could happen in the marketplace and it influences our proposals going right in from the beginning.  So, we are kind of doing this I would say even in advance of actually knowing and I would suggest that nothing has necessarily played out differently then we anticipated and we were clearly not &#x2013; our goal is not adverse selection.  So, I think that we are pretty comfortable with where we are at the moment.  And as more information becomes available, if that view changes, we will update and we will clearly address this in December.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  My question is about the pipeline for Medicaid opportunities in context of the economy, and I was wondering &#x2013; there is these two competing factors: states being pressured fiscally because of the economy, but then it is being offset by a growing pool of Medicaid <mark type="inaudible" /> eligible lives as the unemployment goes up.  Are states looking to managed care for solutions or is that likely to be more difficult given their budgetary challenges now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see obviously that Medicaid business long term is a good value proposition for states as they look at health plan programs as a more efficient option than fee-for-service.  And in the short run, there may be some challenges around the budget and eligibility cutbacks on an overall basis, but we think there will be additional opportunity and we are actually seeing our customers engage with us in the discussion around adding beneficiary types that are not yet in managed care programs such as dual eligibles, people with disabilities and the long-term care business which typically have higher margins in the early years.  So, we see this as a great opportunity.  We also across the UnitedHealth Group businesses see that areas such as behavioral health and other carve out or consolidation opportunities around prescription drugs is a great area that we're positioned very well for in our sister businesses.  So, long term we see that this business will continue to grow and provide positive opportunity on the margin side for our business overall.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  Just a follow-up, are they looking more for risk-based offerings or are they still sticking with the fee-based services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are they looking more to move to products where you take on the risk, so that way they get an immediate saving, assuming that they can pass on that risk to you and you manage it adequately through medical management so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes.  The answer on that is, yes.  The managed care risk-based programs have shown that there is a &#x2013; that is a more efficient and cost effective mechanism for states to utilize and we see that more and more of the eight categories that are not in managed care today will move to a risk-based product in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  In terms of the 2.90 to 3.15 estimate, did you take into account any changes in medical utilization, perhaps more in network utilization or higher generics from the weaker economy?  And then second, if you could go through the components of healthcare cost trend as you see them today and what changes you see going into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I'll just start in terms of the broad strokes is that obviously we have presented a very wide range in our outlook and therefore that translates obviously to similar variation in terms of what could occur in terms of utilization and so forth.  So, I think you &#x2013; those scenarios are incorporated in and it is exactly for those kinds of reasons that we have established kind of the breadth of it. And so, I think we have considered them and that's why we have kind of signaled the scenario and ranges that we are suggesting and suggesting that some of them could actually increase. The ones you are actually talking about generally would mitigate those expenses.  And Mike, do you want to go through the components?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, broadly speaking I'll go back to my earlier comments, in the near-term, we are not expecting really any different behavior in terms of utilization.  To speak to generics, we do think that our products and especially in the senior space that seniors will in a downturn that we're seeing will use more generics which is good for everyone.  With respect to medical trend components as I laid it out again in the first quarter we wouldn't come off those trend assumptions for 2009.  We are prudently anticipating an uptick in unit costs, but outside of that I would expect again utilization to be comparable to 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  A lot of my questions have obviously been answered at this point.  But just could you give us some color on your comments; expanding your comments relative to cash flow and net income levels next year.  Just in light of the enrollment pressure you are talking about as well as investment income and interest expense, as we are thinking about the cash to net income next year &#x2013; cash flow to net income, where do you expect that level to sort of settle out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it'll be in the range of where it will end up this year, around 1.3 times net income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, the enrollment losses wouldn't really impact that in anyway from lapsed claims?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does, but as you know, we had enrollment losses this year.  I think you've seen it for some time Doug that we think over the long-term this business will generate somewhere around 1.3 times net income.  And I don't see any reason that would be any different next year.  We will continue to manage cash flow tightly and we think there is opportunities to do better.</p>

          <p>So, I would like to thank you for your interest this morning and particularly your flexibility in terms of participating on short notice.  I'll just leave you with a couple of thoughts.  We are encouraged by the early signs we see in the third quarter and that the actions that we are taking are improving the performance of our businesses, particularly in our benefit businesses and expect those actions will continue.  We are committed to a very strong financial position, and have been for many years.  We really don't look to the investment portfolio as the source of earnings.  We really look to our products and services, and we are going to continue that position and continue to focus on our balance sheet and our financial strength.</p>
          <p>And while we are appropriately cautiously about 2009 given current market conditions, we have very good momentum.  And we're well positioned as we continue to drive execution in our businesses and we are beginning to see some of those results.  And we're hoping to then see you in December.  And, thank you very much for your participation.</p>
