        <plist>
          <p>Good morning -- led by cash flows of $2.7 billion and earnings of 89 cents per share.  Driven by a strong combination of growth and performance from our services businesses and increasingly effective ongoing medical and operating cost control.</p>
          <p>These results reflect the efforts of our 75,000 people and consistently delivering value and it was to our customers and the health care community across a broad spectrum of need.</p>
          <p>Based on our performance to date we're confirming 2009 earnings of approximately $3.15 per share.  On revenues of about $87 billion.</p>
          <p>While this includes an elevated level of H1N1 medical costs in the fourth quarter, our outlook could be negatively impacted if the prevalence of H1N1 is sustained at a high enough level throughout the entire quarter.</p>
          <p>Today we'll discuss these results and our 2010 outlook against the backdrop of a challenging economy and proposed health care reform legislation.  To begin with growth, the services side of our company increased revenues by $723 million in the quarter.  A strong 15% gain year-over-year.  In Genix <mark type="ph" /> was up 26%.  Prescription solutions grew 16% and OptumHealth expanded by 9%.  These businesses had solid and consistent growth driven by demand from services from physicians and care providers from across the public sector, from Pharma and from unaffiliated payers.</p>
          <p>We provide a diverse range of innovative service that is help optimize the health care system improving health care quality and consistency, transparency and accountability, and affordable access.</p>
          <p>Examples of these services include large scale disease prevention and Wellness programs.  Health care financial services.  Managed behavioral health care in a benefit parody environment.  Specialty pharmacist care and health care systems and data analysis.</p>
          <p>In health benefits our third quarter revenues grew 7% or 1.4 billion year-over-year.  We grew organically by 900,000 people in public and senior benefit programs through the first nine months of this year.  Which includes 275,000 people in Medicare Advantage.  And growth of 460,000 people in risk based, state Medicaid programs.</p>
          <p>These results underscore the importance of our balance and diversified approach to the health care benefits market.  Third quarter pressure on our commercial benefits businesses reflect our nation's broader economic and employment challenges.  Participation in our commercial benefits decreased by 275,000 people this past quarter.  With employment attrition driving more than 80% of this decrease.  Absent employment attrition, the number of people served in fee based products actually grew in the quarter.  And over the past six months and the decrease people served through risk based products was also significantly smaller than reported.</p>
          <p>Inside our fully insured loss numbers we continue to improve our customer retention and to expand the update of new products and programs.</p>
          <p>Turning from growth to marks, we earned a net margin of about 4% of revenues through the first nine months of the year.  After accounting for $1.5 billion in income taxes.  With a net margin of 4% our businesses drive their financial results by averaging modest earnings per customer while serving very large numbers of people with an ever increasing array modern and innovative benefits and services.</p>
          <p>A third quarter operating margin was stable year-over-year, through steady performance reflects success in advancing possibility in the two key areas of operating costs and medical costs.  On the medical cost side our medical trends continue to track to our expectations reflecting long standing colonial care management skills and ever-improving technology application for both forecasting cost and in managing care.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated third quarter medical care ratio of 82% increased 30 basis points over last year's third quarter performance.  In addition to H1N1 flu costs this increasing reflects elevated initial medical costs providing service to new Medicaid members who had not previously been in a coordinated care plan.</p>
          <p>Third quarter results included $190 million in favorable development in our previous estimates of medical costs.  So adjusting that historical medical costs were well controlled.  This compares with $130 million in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our businesses continue to improve clinical resource utilization and realize the benefits of our operating scale we'll been focusing sharply on operating costs the past 18 months as we have said on these calls.  Is the operating cost ratio of 14.5% improved by half percentage point year-over-year as adjusted reflecting faster growth in revenues that head count and similar related operating costs.</p>
          <p>We'll continue our efforts to lower our operating costs to support health care affordability.</p>
          <p>Looking at margins by business group, all of our year-over-year growth in operating earnings this quarter came from our services businesses.  Which improved by $109 million in total.  Prescription services was by far the best performer in this quarter as it continues its path of growth and improved scale, business maturity and growing specialty pharmacy programs.</p>
          <p>It's growth has been driven by ovations and AmeriChoice as well as unaffiliated customers.  In Genix <mark type="ph" /> and OptumHealth extended their bee -- costs at OptumHealth were in line with our expectations for this quarter.  Both businesses have effectively aligned our operating cost to business growth experience this year.  Our health benefit companies overall operating margin of 6.2% decreased 60 basis points year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Principally due to shifting mix as well as some unusual H1N1 medical costs.</p>
          <p>We estimate that we incurred about $60 million in H1N1 related medical costs in the third quarter, and costs of the H1N1 virus are also a significant factor in our fourth quarter outlook.</p>
          <p>UnitedHealthcare's third quarter ratio 84.6% increased 80 basis points year-over-year largely due to its share of additional H1N1 costs and the increased concentration of COBRA enrollment.  Looking ahead UnitedHealthcare just above 86%.</p>
          <p>Anticipate our consolidated ratio will be in the mid 82% raining.  Compared to 80.8% in fourth quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Our commercial benefit pricing remains balanced, discipline ed and fair.  Our fourth quarter expectations include higher than typical flu cost this fall, continued COBRA impact and seasonally higher medical expenses typically experienced in the final three months of each year.  Let's turn to health care reform and the continuing legislative process in Washington.  Our views priorities and approach have remained the same throughout this year.  We're committed to helping modernize the health care system so it better serves all Americans at a lower cost.  That's why we continue to advocate with policy makers for coverage for all Americans.  And it's why we continue to believe that universal care will only be sustainable if legislation effectively tackles the underlying cause of the problem, namely that health care in this country costs too much.</p>
          <p>We have been consistent even aggressive with policy makers, that reform legislation must address access and cost and do it systemic if we're to achieve a high quality and economically sustainable health care system.</p>
          <p>We have been concerned with some proposals in congress which not only fail to adequately address the fundamental cost drivers, but would in fact lead to higher costs.  This would place even greater pressure on already overburdened citizens and employers.</p>
          <p>And this is not a future problem that might occur at a later date there are proposals that would add new taxes on benefits and health care products and services and one that is cut Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals.</p>
          <p>They would likely increase costs on the health care system.  And shift that burden to the private sector and negatively effect the health benefits of the 160 million Americans who currently have health insurance, primarily through the nation's employer based system.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting our company alone already pays more than $1 billion per year in state fees assessments and premium taxes that are built into health care costs.</p>
          <p>Insurance reform proposals that fail to fairly bring everyone into the system will be stabilized insurance markets, and coverage pools.  Causing costs to rise on businesses and the citizens who already are participating responsibly.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to engage actively with leaders in congress and the administration.  I was in Washington just last week for meetings and will be back again this week.  We're bringing practical solutions innovative ideas, information and data to the debate to ensure we modernize the nation's health care system and reign in rising costs to pressure coverage today.</p>
          <p>As commercial enterprise we continue to invest in practical innovation that leads to better service and better medical outcomes and lower costs through better use of our great health care system.  Those capabilities have increasingly, increasing and enduring value.  And to be sure we will assess the positions of our businesses and their participation in our existing markets and will take whatever actions are necessary to respond to legislated changes and the best interests of customers and shareholders.</p>
          <p>Our nation continues to weather a fragile economy and we cannot lose sight of the impact of health care legislation on job development and global competitiveness of the American economy.</p>
          <p>However as I said earlier we continue to believe this is the time to modernize not just reform health care on a truly systemic basis so that universal access can be sustained without significantly greater cost to taxpayers and those currently with benefits.  Now we'll offer you a perspective on the cross currents we foresee as we conclude this year and enter into 2010.</p>
          <p>Our concerns are consistent with those of our last quarterly call.  The economic recovery appears to be slow developing and uneven at that.  Unemployment continues to rise and the debate over additional stimulus spending suggests the government concern that renewed economic strength is not imminent this. Backdrop will impact demand for some of our businesses.</p>
          <p>We expect our fourth quarter commercial enrollment loss to be somewhat better than the third quarter with employer based attrition in the most significant factor.  In 2010 we project our commercial membership decline will slow meaningfully as compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Our reputation for service and value has risen sharply and that trend will continue to accelerate.  Customer retention is strongly improved and our broker and consultant relationship continue to strengthen.</p>
          <p>In our commercial risk business we expect a continue to maintain steady pricing disciplines in response to prospective medical cost pressures of the much of this pressure is driven by insufficient government reimbursement to care providers and further shifting the cost to the commercial sector.</p>
          <p>Our public and senior markets businesses should increase the number of people they serve next year, again led by Medicaid and Medicare Advantage.</p>
          <p>Growth in these two programs will likely be slower in 2010 than in 2009.  As we expect fewer new people from large, new state programs and Medicaid and our Medicare Advantage benefits have been reduced in response to dramatic government driven rate cuts to that program.</p>
          <p>We remain cautious about the state Medicaid reimbursement environment, and we're exposed to meaningful portion of the 5% rate cut that CMS has signed through the Medicare Advantage program for next year.  We have plans to offset the impact on margin beyond the benefits design changes we made for 2010.  By improving performance across all elements of our Medicare Advantage businesses.</p>
          <p>However we will, we will not zoo assume a perfect match-up on those plans in our 2010 outlook.</p>
          <p>We expect growth in revenues from each of our enterprise services businesses, mixed shift and economic circumstances, including loss of membership with the UnitedHealthcare will likely challenge OptumHealth margin performance.  Prescription Solutions will effectively discontinue its use of performance based pricing in 2010 and that will impact its margin percentage in earnings.  We anticipate that Engenix <mark type="ph" /> will continue to be our highest margin business next year.</p>
          <p>In total we expect 2010 to be a somewhat more difficult year than 2009.  We will see membership and local competitive pressures in risk business, the loss of commercial risk business over the course of 2009 creates headwind on margins, dollars for UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth for 2010 and H1N1 flu will remain a risk and operating cost control will be key to preserving our margins.  Our preliminary estimates are for revenues to grow somewhat, somewhere in a range centered around $89 billion for operating earnings to decline year-over-year and for 2010 earnings per share to be in the broad range of $2.90 to $2.10 per share.  While there clearly could be down side to this range there could be upside as well.  Cash flows from operations should continue to be solid in relationship to net earnings this year and next.</p>
          <p>Share repurchase will be an element contributing to earnings per share but market factors including the status of health care reform will influence the timing and level of repurchases in fourth quarter 2009 and in 2010.</p>
          <p>As in the past, we will refine these numbers and further delineate them as we get closer to 2010.  We have made no adjustments to accommodate health care reform and health reform legislation if signed into law, may necessitate a revision in our 2010 outlook.</p>
          <p>So let me briefly summarize the key points from this morning.  Third quarter results provide a good measure of it our diversification and internal performance discipline.  Our services businesses delivered all of the year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter.  All business groups performed well relative to our expectations and operating costs were well controlled and our care ratios were solid.</p>
          <p>Our innovation, service and the overall value we provide our customers continues to strengthen as measured by growth for many of our businesses.  We're concerned about some directions, health reform is taking but will redouble our efforts to help achieve meaningful sustainable changes that address fundamental issues of affordability and access.</p>
          <p>We're understandably cautious about the challenging environment for 2010.  We will pursue our goals in 2010 working to perform at the highest levels possible.  In the longer term, the outlook remains compelling.  Large and critical human social needs are still to be addressed.  The health care system cries out to be made more efficient, modernized and effective and an integrated system.  Our nation's health care resources need to be used optimally and appropriately for the benefit of the most people possible.  Our company has the capability, the resources, market positions and insight that enable us to play a meaningful role into meeting those needs.</p>
          <p>Finally should health reform affect our long-term positioning we'll move thoughtfully on behalf of our customers, owners and other stakeholders.</p>
          <p>This is a first look at 2010.  We plan to update you on our progress at our annual Investor Day which will be December 1st in New York.  And with that we'll open up this call to your questions.  But with one understandable caveat first.  I suspect many of you are interested in how various policy proposals might affect our business for the industry.  Since so much is in flux right now and sensitivity on these issues are as high as they have ever been we appreciate your understanding of our reluctance to speculate or respond beyond broad directional theme.  As usual we ask you to limit yourself to one question, topic today in deference to time and I thank you for your interest in United Health Group.  If we can begin questions.</p>

          <p>Your first question with Gregory -- from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question was on Prescription Solutions and another strong quarter there and exceeding estimates again. One if you could remind us how the Part D earnings earnings are allocated between Prescription Solutions and Innovations and second of all how much earnings -- is driven by performance based pricing you been mentioned you won't renew for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would offer the Prescription Solutions continues to grow in its capabilities and maturity as a business.  I think a lot of this is a reflection of that continued strengthening of that business.  But I'll ask Jackie Kasakoff <mark type="ph" /> and perhaps Larry and Tom to respond to the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Prescription Solutions has a third party contract in terms of it's service to ovations.  So we work separately in that regard and are right Prescription Solutions has had a good 2009.  We benefited from improvements in mail and generics penetration rates higher than anticipated Medicare membership growth.  New external earned sales of nearly 600,000 lives, improved client retention, and in addition performance based pricing and network contracting that came in earlier and greater than anticipated and has greatly benefited us in our Part D business.</p>
          <p>Excuse me -- these network contract savings have already been built into all clients 2010 pricing and we're not likely to change the magnitude of it contracting improvements in 2010 that we saw in 2009.</p>
          <p>Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of relationship to our Part D products?  In regard to the performance pricing changes, ultimately from a Part D perspective we see minimal change in our 2010 bids.  We submitted our bids which were approved under a range of the standard margin that we have used in the past and we continue to expect we'll fall within that same margin in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess Jackie just in terms of that, the Part D question is it fair to say that more than 50% of the Part D earnings show up in Prescription Solutions rather than Ovations <mark type="ph" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not am question we're going to answer right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay.  And then my second question was just on your contracting.  Hearing a lot of anecdotal evident there are a number of community hospitals that are feeling, you know, the economic pinch and looking to get pricing from managed care this year.  I'm wondering how you are approaching your contract on both the commercial and maybe Medicaid side this year with a lot of these community hospitals that may be on the brink.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that there is a particularly different approach in terms of how we have been responding to our relationships with the delivery community.  And facilities that had been under pressure, for the last several years, just continue under those pressures.  I'm not sure there is a particularly distinctive approach we're taking with transport to the relationship with the delivery community.  We think it has been constructive one and increasingly we're sensitive to those kinds of issues as we engage with them and continue to try to maintain and build our network.  I would ask to limit these to one question each.  So with that, I think we'll move to the next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  Good morning.  So I'll give you the one question, just looking for your 2010 and longer term target for the UHC loss ratio at about 84.5%.  It is well above your peers and above historical norms.  I'm wondering if you see this as a new equilibrium or if you target improving that loss ratio next year and over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we, you know, this does ebb and flow over time.  If you really take a look at this over a long enough, you know, continuum of many years these patterns do establish themselves.  I think we endeavor to improve our performance relative to our specific book of business.  As an ongoing kind of concept of the business.  But if there is -- I ask if there is nothing I think that is specific to this.  I would say that Nix also represents a significant element in this and that's why I reference our book of business.  But beyond that, I would ask Gail or Mike if they --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gail Boudreaux:  Now, I think you have hit the critical parts.  The impact is really mixed.  You know, we have talked about where -- we have held our trend in line with our expectation and we continue to monitor it.  So I think that really hits some major points where we would track our loss ratio as you think about, going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would finish that by saying, I think it reflects the book of our business but I would also tell you we're always looking to improve our performance.  And I don't think that will ever change.  Next question.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclay's Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Question relates to your customer contracts on the commercial side with, I guess large groups, small groups and then individuals.</p>
          <p>What sort of contract terms do you have in the case you guys would incur additional fees or tax that is thank you didn't know about when you originally signed these contracts?  I.e., can you go in the middle of a contract and reprice I guess effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't know if I want to get into specifics of that. I mean, we maintain relationships with customers that are, and we have endeavor to have them multi-year and to be responsive to the different factors in the marketplace.  You know, typically, there is not an element of that nature in terms of change in our relationships.  But I would also say if this is a question that is, comes from the reform agenda there is also never been a circumstance quite like this.  So you know, I would describe our relationship with our customers as being contractual and non-contractual in nature and kind it leave it at that if that's where you were headed.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to step back again on your commentary on 2010 and look at it more broadly.  It seemed like you, you seemed like you would be applying a 10% drop in op earnings for 2010.  I was wondering if you could help us understand kind of order of magnitude in at least your biggest businesses, commercial and Medicare kind of the contributing factors and maybe so we could understand order of magnitude from those businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, this is, you know, we're giving you, as we typically do at this time of year a broad directional sense of 2010.  There are a lot of factors, and we have delineated several of them in the script, including the commercial headwinds in, into 2010, just from the commercial membership reductions from 2009.  We expect 2010 membership performance to be necessarily better, but not necessarily positive.  And pressures from Medicare that are well established a rate environment in the Medicaid marketplace.</p>
          <p>We have the beginning start-up of our TRICARE business.  I mean, there are a number of factors, build the introduction of efforts around 5010 and ICD-10.  So I think there are a number of factors that lead us to kind of set on this outlook at this time.  And we really can't give you anything that would be more delineatable than that, but I actually think that's quite a robust list.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cohen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, just delving into Medicare Advantage a little bit.  Could you talk about, you said it is not going to be a perfect match and there is a broad range of assumptions out there.  Can you comment on that and kind of your long-term strategy there.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I will, I'll give this to Larry Renfro but I think our long-term strategy for one is we think this is a very compelling marketplace.  There are perhaps more challenges to the Medicare population than perhaps any other in all of health care.  And opportunities to make it perform better.  Both in the government fee for service version and in the private sector version.  And that will take a very focused efforts around opt mull care management really focusing on that population.  Better application of technology, modernization of the products.  So we think there is really a real future in the, meeting the needs of it that population.  In terms of the nearer terms to 2010, we have a number of programs.  Larry, you want to --</p>

          <p>The three main focus areas that we're concentrating on now, medical cost management, operating costs and growth.  And what we're trying to do is to beef all these areas up in order to get as close to the number that we're trying to fill in this gap.</p>

          <p>Okay thank you.  I just wanted to confirm something that was in the press release.  The numbers you disclosed about the favorable development.  We're talking about the 2009 numbers.  You numbered as 190 as net favorable development and we talked about the 2008 you talked as total development.  I want to make sure those two numbers are comparable or whether you are making a distinction there between net development and total development as far as what might be reaccrued.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes, good morning.  Just curious about the share repurchase outlook.  Your buybacks were quite limited in the quarter.  And it was not clear from your comments if, you know, you have reflected any amount of significant share repurchase in your EPS range for 2010.  You reference health reform.  Can you just comment on what your thinking is there.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  And I'll let Mike handle most of this. But I do think we are largely on track for our share program in '09.  And we did offer that it will be a factor in 2010 as we see it.  It could be influenced by external factors.  And we always leave that open.  But, Mike</p>

          <p>Mike Mikan: Matt, it's Mike.  We entered the year expecting to purchase more than $2.5 billion shares in 2009.  On year-to-date basis we repurchased 66.5 million shares and so that's a substantial portion.  We still expect or planning on, depending on market conditions to repurchase more than $2 billion this year.  Some of it is just timing, Matt, on dividends.  And we did have a large debt repayment in the third quarter.  And we're going to continue to maintain a conservative financial position during the economic climate and the environment that we're operating in today.</p>

          <p>Mike Mikan:  Justin as we closed in the second quarter we incurred incrementally $50 million of HIN flu related costs.  We did see as I'm sure others did as evidenced by the CDC influenza like illness an acceleration or elevation in the later parts of the third quarter.  And that's pretty comparable in total costs of what we saw in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of by category, we are seeing a significant elevation in the commercial book of business.  And in the Medicaid business.  We're not seeing the same level of -- or elevation in the senior business.</p>
          <p>So you can get the order of magnitude by business.  And we're going, we continue to believe that we're going to see an elevation as we are seeing in to the fourth quarter and at some point in time we'll peak.  And some side from there in the quarter.  I think if you look at the elevation as we entered into the third quarter, we're expecting that to continue well into the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>You know, generally, we are, we're not into getting into that kind of level of a metric.  The next thing you know we'll be quoting quarter by quarter flu PMPM metrics.  I'm not interested in responding at that level of detail.  I think suffice it to say we have a tremendous amount of resource focused on monitoring our cost on that and mitigating them as best we can but also responding to the needs of customers during those, during these kinds of times.  I think our programs, as it relates to influenza both on the vaccination and so forth are quite progressive.  And I think that we have had a pretty good handle on these costs through the course of this year.  We have provided for them in the fourth quarter.  I don't know if anybody can fully predict how a effort like this is going through the country.  But I think that we have done a pretty good job through the course of this year.  And I think that we will, we'll see how it plays out in the fourth quarter.  But I don't think we are, really should be responding on a kind of PMPM basis basis on a particular item as variable as this might be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry to go this place again because we have discussed this in the past.  But you run  a very fine company but your capital management is just way off base.  If I was a director of UnitedHealthcare, I would be facing a recurring dividend, particularly in this environment where there is an above average amount of uncertainty -- you are constantly reference cautious about a challenging economy, et cetera, et cetera.  What do you think your stock would sell at if your board of directors approved a 40% payout of your guidance number of 315 for this year.  I calculate that to be a dividend of $1.26.  The S&amp;P 500 -- it yields 2.2%.  $1.26 dividend and 4% yield your stock would be trading $31.5.  Up 26% from where it is.  I think your capital management program is depressing the value of the stock.</p>
          <p>Okay?  And it's as simple as that. We have had this conversation before.  And sometimes it pays to, you know, turn a leaf and take a new policy.  I have in front of me the results of your historic buyback programs and it really hasn't really done anything for the shareholders.  I believe we have spent 15.6 billion from 2005 to the end of the second quarter of 2009, and average price of $43.93.  Okay?  So it's really not done anything.</p>
          <p>There is consistent insight, exercise of options and sales with the exception of the CEO which I admire for his large stake.  But it would is seem to me if you paid a dividend of 40%, that would still leave you 60% of $5 billion with $3 billion to build the business, to buyback shares and to do other things.  And I think for a company of that size, to take 1 hundred zero approach meaning no dividend and all directed to repurchase with a repurchase has been kind of floored and miscalculated it is a mistake and I say this constructively because I admire you guys you fine a fine company but I can't find many companies that don't pay dividends.  It seems your company.  While the company says our stock is undervalued -- with your buying.  I'm sorry if I'm overbearing but it is getting very frustrating to go me that you will respectfully take the questions but I don't get a good answer why there is no cash dividend of consequence.  Your shareholders are suffering from coupon shock.  There is no return on short-term --</p>

          <p>We think it is very important in terms of the deliberations about a capital structure, particularly in the backdrop of a challenging economy and an economy that could be challenged for a considerable period of time.  And an unknown around health care reform.  And I think that we have taken steps.  I think in terms of the position of our investment portfolio, the position of our overall capital structure relative to debt.  The reduced level of share repurchases that were made in 2009.  And I think that as this run s it's course, health care reform clarifies to some extent.  We will then look at what the capital structure should be going forward.  And I think that's the way we responded to you in the last --</p>

          <p>If you allow us to go through a thoughtful process relative to where our capital could be allocated going forward given the diversity of our business, how health care reform could play out across the spectrum of it our businesses and market opportunity, we will then set a capital direction going forward.  Which may very well include the dividends.  But I'm not committing to that at this point in time.  And I think that, I think we could all at this point in time put a general timeframe around what health care reform in terms of this phase might be in terms of timing.  And that's our response.</p>

The Cadillac tax proposals alongside other tax proposals are just one of several competing versions of how to fund health reform and nobody knows at this stage exactly what will emerge from the congressional debate still to come.</p>
          <p>But on the general question of impact it -- obviously congressional budget office joint committee on taxation have said ultimately the taxes wind their way through to consumers either directly in consumers prices or if the form of reduced benefit.

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is about COBRA.  You didn't say anything about COBRA and its upward pressure on MLRs.  Can you -- what MLR it is running at and then going forward into 2010, do you see at least in the back half of the year some tailwind out of the stimulus subsidized populations starts to roll off.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Anna, this is Gail Boudreaux.  Let me put a little bit of context around COBRA.  I think as we talked about the last couple of calls our COBRA membership has continued to grow over the nine-month period.  We started the year at 1.5%.  We're now over 2% of COBRA in total.  We continue to track that certainly as unemployment continues.  In terms of the take-up rate that take-up rate remained consistent but we think the stimulus has had an impact on COBRA.  Overall, as we think about the -- of stimulus at this stage, we don't really have a prediction on COBRA declining dramatically.  I think we'll have to see how unemployment continues to track along with attrition.  In terms of the overall cost structure, we feel that we have still got it covered within our medical costs ratio of 84 plus or minus 50 basis points.  So we continue to follow that and we have also been watching those members quite closely and trying to get them involved in our care management program because we think we can add real value to them and help them manage to their care.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone Steve you mentioned in your comments the -- from the commercial and government payers.  And I just curious your sense as to how well understood this is by employers and if you look out three to four years how does the industry manage that dynamic with those employer customers as that subsidy potentially expands because of things like the industry tax, the $6.7 billion being proposed.</p>
          <p>I mean, do they realize kind of where their payment rates are for providers versus the government.  Do they fully understand that differential.  Just from a customer relations standpoint how does the industry manage the expansion of that over the next three to five years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the answer to that somewhat varies by the size and sophistication of the customer.  But I would say on the upper end of our customer base they do understand it it.  And understand it increasingly well.  And I would suggest that the activities that have been going on over the course of the past year in terms of the reform, the national reform debate, have elevated the consciousness of the, of this and employers are quite engaged with respect to the, their concerns about the level of cost shifting and the cost shifting that may occur going forward.</p>
          <p>So I think the larger employers are, were already attuned to this. Their sensitivities have increased.  And I also believe it is moving down market as smaller companies are realizing that impact.  We do see employers engaging, participating and expressing concern with respect to the overall cost elements of the, at least the proposed legislative initiatives at this point in time and the amount of shifting that they represent in terms of coming into the private sector to support the expanded program.  And so I believe that they are getting increasingly engaged on this.</p>
          <p>How we work with them is, you know, just continues to be an advocate of a more modern system, a more reformed system where there is good transparency with respect to cost and accountability.  And to really get behind the kinds of things in reform and modernization that we have been advocating in terms of focusing on cost, changing the way care is paid for, moving away from volume and more towards value.  And employers are embracing that.  And more and more amenable to participating in programs where these new more modern approaches are engaged.  And so in many, in some respects, the sensitivity or visibility on this has actually increased the amount of innovation and change.  I don't know how else to answer you beyond that and I think it is going to be sustaining.  I think employers are dedicated to maintaining benefits and to do it in a progressive way.  And I think the reform activities have kind of brought a new energy into that.</p>
          <p>It is a challenge but I also think we have got a lot of solutions for it.</p>

I think the key thing for larger employers, strong network t strong cost position they very much value -- clinical programs ability to use data to drive healthier behaviors.  If we were still very good positioning around our service improvements sour metrics are at the vast -- we have spent a lot of time in terms of positioning our products at the local market and that's paid off.  There is a real focus on affordability.  And I think our leading position in consumerism has really helped as employers look to make sure that employees are gauged, thinking about healthy behaviors.  Some of the emerging trends, which I think tie very well to our innovation agenda, things like our connected care.  Employers are looking at onsite clinics for example in biometrics testing.  This is all to drive better outcomes to help manage the cost curve.  As we look at that.  Across both large and small employers we see a real focus on affordable products.  And I given you two examples.  We launched a product catalyst and simply engaged in our local market and I think we're seeing very nice traction on that.  And on national accounts we're also seeing in addition to unit cost focus a real focus on driving better behavior across our clients.  And I'll ask Dawn to maybe add some comments around OPTUM and any things you are sure.</p>

          <p>Sure.  Dawn here.  As we approach a selling season we saw a couple of things.  One is because of the interest around cost management we saw an increased level of activity around the products and services that we offer.  From wellness to prevention to really integrated solution that is get at transparency, consumer behavior change and ultimate cost management that are decision making better outcomes.  And I think the capabilities that we're able to deliver whether our -- or can integrated clinical behavior model not only help UnitedHealthcare in their selling approaches in the commercial marketplace also, also our independent selling efforts to large employers.  State based programs.  And even independent health plans.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  I just want to get more clarity on the 2010 guidance if you can.  You talked about giving or targeting the same margins in Medicare and having that approved in your rates.  Are you expecting lower membership in Medicare then to contribute to the lower earnings for next year.  And then on Swine Flu, can you give me sort of how much you expect Swine Flu or H1N1 to affect the numbers in 2010, on the commercial side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I don't know if we can offer specifics on something as granular as Swine Flu in 2010.  But Larry, I might ask you to respond to Medicare.</p>
          <p>Larry:  Sure.  Earlier when we talked about the 5% rate cut, you know, that was the number that we were talking about that is the gap.  And I think that, our position on the, what I'll call the growth for next year, it's early innings for us to give a firm commitment or a thought on this, but I will give you a direction.</p>
          <p>And that is we believe the industry is going to grow and we believe will grow slightly.  But it won't be the type of growth that we had in 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  Some of your peer companies have talked about an issue with provider upcoding or, you know, revenue maximization from provider groups.  Wondering if you are seeing any of that in the third quarter and whether, if you are seeing it, you could speak out whether it is more prevalent in Medicaid, Medicare or the commercial business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might ask Mike to respond to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Matt.  I would start with -- we have seen coding intensity in our cost trends for years now.  That has not changed per se.  We monitor it regularly.  We analyze it by major category on an in-patient,out patient and physician level.  We manage it on, analyze it by type of service as well as admission by geography and by line of business so we have got a good grasp of, with data over time.  So we understand where there are variations.  Any time that you note variations whether in a local market or by a line of business or type of service we aggressively manage where we note those variations.  But in aggregate we're not seeing any -- in the what I of change in coding intensity.</p>

          <p>Well, actually, if there really aren't anymore questions maybe we should just wrap this up.  I want to -- obviously be aware that John Penshorn and Mike Mikan and others will be available through the course of the day with questions.  We thank you for your participation in the call today.  I can assure you year a very focused enterprise.  We're focused on performing.  We have been aware of the challenges through the course, as far back as the first quarter, as far as what 2010 could be.  We have real traction on those but it being realistic about the overall climate we're N I assure you that we will put our best performance into 2010 and hopeful that reform efforts proceed in a constructive way that really does advance the agenda for the entire nation.  So thank you very much for your participation this morning.</p>
