          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss third quarter 2010 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site, www.Petrbras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding I'd like to draw your attention to the slide number two. We may make forward-looking statements which are identified by use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras' management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, and Brazilian legislation. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues relating to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, Almir, please begin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss third quarter results. This quarter financial results were characterized by growth in domestic demand, flat globalization prices, lower import costs, and a stronger real. Operating expense increased largely due to non-recurring items and a charge related to collective bargaining agreement. Production of oil and gas was up 2% for the nine months of 2010 versus the first nine months of 2009, up by 1% from the prior quarter. As a result of these factors our third quarter EBITDA was down 7%, although our net income showed a modest 2% gain.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we completed our public offering for R$120 billion and acquired the rights to an additional 5 billion barrels of oil. The offering de-leveraged our balance sheet and has given us the equity cushion we need to continue investing to meet our long-term guidance. Next please.</p>
          <p>Upstream highlights since our last call improved due to arrival of the Tupi Pilot and an important discovery in the frontier area, the deepwater Sergipe-Alagoas basin. In downstream we completed our conversion of the upgrade of the Revap refinery and our gas and power business we have met record demand for gas and thermoelectric power, validating the result of a multi-year investment plan. Next.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of this year, the total oil and gas production was 2,568,000 barrels of oil equivalent <mark type="inaudible" />, up 2% year-over-year. From the prior quarter, Brazilian oil production declined 1% largely because of maintenance shutdown in P-35 and P-33. These shutdowns occurred one month earlier than we originally planned, reducing production by 21,000 barrels per day during the month. Next.</p>
          <p>The next slide is a review of units that have been or will be installed in 2010 and 2011. Most of the production increase came from the FPSO Capixaba. For the remainder of the year and the next, we will install another 420,000 barrels of oil per day of capacity. The next unit to begin production will be FPSO Cidade de Angra dos Reis, better known as Tupi Pilot. In the pre-salt, we continue to progress with results meeting or exceeding our expectation.</p>
          <p>We acquired the rights &#x2013; next slide please, yes. We acquired the rights to produce up to 5 billion barrels of oil in the block not previously under license. In this new area, from now until 2014, we expect to invest between 6 and $8 billion in exploratory work and initial development spending. We will give more specific guidance regarding investments and production from this acquisition when we update our business plan, which will most likely be in March or April of next year.</p>
          <p>I have already mentioned the start-up of the 100,000 barrels per day Tupi Pilot. It is worth noting that we have put into place the first commercial system of the sub pre-salt only three years from discovery. We will be concluding an additional five wells in the pre-salt area by the end of 2010 bringing to 16 the number of wells drilled in Santos pre-salt this year.</p>
          <p>Delivery of deepwater rigs ordered between 2005 and 2008 are ongoing, with two additional rigs due to arrive this year. This will increase our pre-salt rig fleet to 10. The Guar&#xE1; extended well test is scheduled to start up by the end of November, with the FPSO dynamic producer already in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Next. During the quarter, we also concluded the upgrade and conversion of the Revap refinery at a cost of $2.5 billion. With the completion of the new coking unit, we'll process an additional 18,000 barrels per day of our own domestic crude oil, while converting an additional 30,000 barrels per day of heavy fuel into diesel &#x2013; 55% diesel, 5% LPG, 20% coke, and 10% of cracker unit. This production is then hydrotreated, creating our S-50 products that reduce importing high quality diesel while exporting fuel oil.</p>
          <p>The Suape petrochemical plant representing an investment of R$1.3 billion is now pre-operational. This plant has the capacity to produce 700,000 tons per year of naphtha-based petrochemical to produce polyester materials. The Abreu e Lima refinery construction is fully under way and will be centrally contracted with basic engineering for the Premium refineries. Next, please.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress not only with our upstream and downstream operation, but also with our investment in technology and research. These investments ultimately lead to a greater opportunity and higher return. We completed the expansion of our research center CENPES, more than doubling its size. Over the past year we have had many companies announcing plans to establish research centers in Brazil as they recognize the country's long-term opportunities.</p>
          <p>As you can see, Schlumberger, FMC, Baker Hughes have already established centers here. Halliburton, GE, IBM, and others are in the process of doing so. In addition we are partnering with more than 120 Brazilian universities; all of this is creating one of the greatest concentrations of energy research in the world. Next please.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to volumes and prices, which are the key determinants of our results. As one can see from the graph in the left, the average price of Brent and our own heavy oil declined slightly quarter-to-quarter. The right heavy oil differential is still at historical low levels, which hurts our downstream profitability while increasing our upstream returns.</p>
          <p>From the graph on the right, one can see that the average realization price for products remains flat, with most of the increase in price related to the strengthening of the real. The gap between Gulf Coast price and Brazilian realization price widened during the quarter as a result of a slightly lower international product price, a stronger real and a stable price in Brazil. Next please.</p>
          <p>Lifting costs before government take increased by 8% quarter-over-quarter, largely as a consequence of the charge related to the annual collective bargaining agreement and volumes negotiated in the third quarter, which was responsible for 70% of the increase. Increase in well interventions in our major fields in the Campos basin also added to higher lifting costs. Next, please.</p>
          <p>Accelerated Brazilian GDP growth is reflected in higher product sales. Year-over-year sales are up 11%, reflecting the exceptional growth of the Brazilian economy. Of note is growth in jet fuel, up 18% year-over-year as growing income and the stronger real stimulated air travel.</p>
          <p>Gasoline consumption increased 16% year-over-year as the higher price of sugar reduced ethanol supply causing the flex fuel fleet to consume more gasoline. Quarterly changes to refinery output are largely a matter of the timing and duration of the annual maintenance of distillation units in our refineries. Diesel and other products recovered from lower throughput level in the second quarter when the Replan distillation unit was halted for 90 days for programmed maintenance and expansion. Next please.</p>
          <p>Last year was characterized by a recovering economy and abundant rainfall. This year the opposite occurred, a rapidly growing economy and reduced rains. As a result Brazil's system operator called upon Petrobras to generate electricity from its gas-fired thermoelectric plants. Generation increased from virtually nothing one year ago to as much as 6,200 megawatts in October. Due to this thermoelectric demand, natural gas consumption in Brazil nearly doubled from year ago levels, which is 80 million cubic meters per day. The increased utilization reflects the near completion of our natural gas system. Petrobras now has the resources to meeting thermal demand from domestic production, Bolivian imports and LNG, with the increased structure to supply and distribute gas molecules when and where needed. Next please.</p>
          <p>Turning to financial results, net revenue were higher largely because of growing sales volume in Brazil, where higher demand was met largely with incremental imports, which costs less than the prior quarter because international price were approximately 2% lower and because of the average appreciation of the real by 2%. The reduction in costs from lower imports price was partially offset during the quarter by the effect of inventory averaging, which added R$580 million of costs in comparison with the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The higher revenues partially offset by higher costs of goods sold increased gross income by 1% over the second quarter. Operating expenses increased by 27% from the prior quarter due to the costs associated with annual negotiation of collective bargaining agreement. The termination of Barracuda project finance and miscellaneous items added some costs too. The combination result of these factors will add to a 13% decrease in operating income when compared to the second quarter, while EBITDA of R$14.7 billion was 7% lower. Next.</p>
          <p>The 6% appreciation of the real from the second quarter to the third quarter and the best financial results. From an expense of R$630 million at the end of the quarter, the second quarter financial results recorded a gain of 1 billion &#x2013; R1.96 billion in the third quarter. Income from equity participation and minority interest expenses were also affected by the revaluation, although the net result was flat. Tax increased as a result of higher operating income. The net effect of lower operating earnings and higher financial results was 3% increase in net income. Okay, next please, yes.</p>
          <p>Operating income for the Brazilian E&amp;P was affected by the 1% decline in production by the 2% decline in the international crude oil price. Sales volume was higher due to the sales from inventory. Operating expenses increased largely due to the charge of R$225 million resulting from the collective bargaining agreement and a charge of R$480 million associated with the eliminating of the Barracuda project finance structure. Next please.</p>
          <p>Operating income for our Brazilian downstream segment improved as realization price in Brazil increased relatively to international levels. Cost of goods sold declined due to lower import costs and lower international transfer pricing. Refining costs increased by R$313 million in the third quarter, as an increase per barrel of 22% during the period from R$7.03 per barrel to R$8.55. Of this increase 8% is attributable to the collective bargaining agreement and programmed maintenance charged to operating expenses. Next please.</p>
          <p>Operating income from gas and power and international were down slightly from the prior quarter, while distribution improved. Gas and power declined due to the lower margin on gas sales to thermoelectric plants. Operating income from power was down to the high acquisition costs, largely offset by generation income. Income was also aggressively affected by several non-recurring items.</p>
          <p>The international segment <mark type="inaudible" /> declined largely on the basis of R$83 million of exploratory expense and R$127 million of direct holder expenses. Third quarter operating income from distribution increased R$526 million from the R$390 million in the prior quarter. Most of the increase was due to the absence of extraordinary tax position of R$110 million taken the second quarter. Next please.</p>
          <p>Capital spending increased to R$56 billion during the first nine months of 2010, an 11% increase from the same period of a year earlier. Most of this increase was concentrated in refining, particularly for upgrades, regulatory spending and logistics. Investment in our international segment declined as capital spending remains focused on Brazil. Gas and power investments also declined as the major infrastructure is completed.</p>
          <p>Next please. This slide reconciles the source and use of cash from our recent offering. As you will see, we raised a total of 120 billion of which R$5.2 billion came through the exercise of the GreenShoe. The GreenShoe proceedings are not in our cash balance in the third quarter statements. We paid R$74.8 billion under the assignment agreement, of which R$67.8 billion was paid with the government securities and R$7 billion was paid in cash. The federal government, BNDS, and the sovereign wealth funded together put <mark type="inaudible" /> shares worth a total of R$8.3 billion, R$5.5 billion above the value of the assignment agreement. Including proceeds from the greenhouse, we will retain R$45.5 billion of cash and government securities. We ended the quarter with R$58 billion of cash and equivalents, including R$10.7 billion of government securities with a maturity greater than 90 days. The cash portion of the offering has reduced our net debt to net book gap to a comfortable 16% and we will now begin to lever up our continued investment plan.</p>
          <p>The insurance cost of the offering were charged directly to shareholders' equity and did not pass through the income statement. With that overview we'll now be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The floor is now open for questions from investors and analysts. We remind you that each participant will be allowed to ask two questions only. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  The first question is from Marcus Sequeira, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have two questions, quick questions. One about refining, we noted an increase in use of domestic crude oil during the quarter. I believe it was a function of Revap and also increased light oil production. I would just like to know if we &#x2013; could we assume that this level is sustainable going forward and what kind of levels could we expect within the next 12 months? And then on Tupi, just like to check if the pilot platform will &#x2013; will it begin to ramp up after the commerciality is declared, so only early next year and how quickly you believe that you can bring that platform to peak production? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Marcus. Let me have <mark type="inaudible" /> helping me in the first question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with the new investments in Revap, the conditions for having more domestic crudes processed in Brazil, the conditions will be given and for Brazil conditions to keep the upper amount for Brazilian domestic crude being processed in our refineries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, can you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Tupi, &#x2013; sorry, sorry, sorry, regarding Tupi, we planned not to reach the peak production of 100,000 barrels per day in the second half of 2012. In 2011, the average production will be 50,000 barrels per day and reaching 75,000 by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Would it be possible just going back to refinery, if you have an estimate of how much of your, how &#x2013; what's your goal for domestic crude using your refineries within the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the estimate of increase in domestic conditions to increase domestic processing, domestic crude processing would be around 15,000 barrels per day. But that will of course depend on the economics of refining and margins of course, but we expect that this amount will be stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is through Christian Audi from Santander. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of quick questions. First, Almir, do you expect projects or the end of project financing projects like Barracuda, are there any other ones coming up that could impact on a non-recurring basis for example 4Q results for this year or do you foresee any major projects also potentially impacting 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, this was an exception due to the kind of structure of the project financing. We don't have the &#x2013; we don't expect to have this happening with other project financing. We just ended the two largest project financing we had beyond the Barracuda, that is Marlim, Marlim, and Nova Marlim and we had no more extra costs in this. We are ending all our project financing structure and for the main ones, the Barracuda <mark type="inaudible" /> was maybe the last big one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And then on the &#x2013; can you just remind me on the collective agreement, how much above the inflation was salary &#x2013; salaries increased?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, I am looking to my colleagues here. No one knows how much they were <mark type="inaudible" /> salary increase above the inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or just what the overall increase was, Almir, do you have an idea of that, was it 3, 4, 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe it's &#x2013; the salary increase was in the range of 9% and inflation was in the range of 5, so that is  4% of the <mark type="inaudible" /> here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then the other question was &#x2013; this is a &#x2013; this question, best suggestion about the &#x2013; when we look at your profitability and the impact lifting costs and refining costs can have on it, there's often volatility added to it because of planned shutdowns of platforms, right, that impact lifting costs, as well as scheduled maintenance shutdowns of refineries that impact refining costs and we oftentimes don't have any ability to see these coming on a quarterly basis. So, I was just wondering going forward if there is any possibility to give us some type of a guidance, for example, of potential quarters where maintenance shutdowns may be particularly heavy in refining or there may be a particularly bigger number of platform shutdowns so that we can better assess how lifting costs and refining costs could go up or down and therefore impact your overall EBITDA margin. Is that something you think will be possible to provide the market going forward so as to better prepare the market for volatility in your EBITDA margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, let me have <mark type="inaudible" /> giving out some information on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding DMP, we have shut down in P-27, that will be in the fourth quarter of this year. The production loss will be 8,000 barrels per day. And P-54, it's a partial shutdown for maintenance. It will be five days, around 50,000 barrels per day loss of production in these five days, and maybe P-40 is three days and the shutdown is partially shutdown, 90,000 barrels per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's for the fourth quarter, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, for fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the downstream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we will have shutdown of our cat cracker in Revap and also distillation and hydro equipment in our producing refineries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Almir, are those significant just in terms of like quantity or maybe you can give us a sense of percentage wise how as a result of these, how much your throughput would be down by &#x2013; would it be a 10% decline in throughput because of these, are you able to give some sense of that for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's precisely, I mean their impact in interrelation of shutdowns of each producing unit and each refinery, they're very not particularly straightforward. So, that's we don't announce that on a regular basis, the market impact, that's not so straightforward. We can &#x2013; what we say is that, regarding that we have more <mark type="inaudible" /> in each refinery. Each period, we will have some specific units shut down with different impacts. So if we find a relevant one, we will work on it. But that's not the case now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. And then, the last question, Almir, is do you have a sense as it relates to the new strategic plan and when 2011 targets for production and CapEx would be announced, I know that's a process that takes a while. But what's your best read in terms of when the market should expect some type of an update next year of the plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, we are working to have these released in the first quarter or Q2. These results are our target now, we are working on the process, but as you know large company to review and reshuffle all the projects. We have more than 608 projects in our five-year plan. We have to review all of them, see which is the priority of each one and how much we are going to &#x2013; we have resource available for our investment and we choose the best return we can get from this investment. So, it's a long job. At this moment we expect to have it done by end of first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a very last question. Do you have any update? I know there was some media noise or President-elect Dilma talking about Premium I refinery and Premium II. Do you have any updates or what's the latest in terms of your expectations of when these refineries could potential come online or their construction potentially begin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not changed our targets, but let me <mark type="inaudible" /> the planning, right from the <mark type="inaudible" /> if we still hold on that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I had two quick questions. The first one, in the Portuguese call, there was mention of project <mark type="inaudible" />, and if I'm not mistaken <mark type="inaudible" /> basically indicated that you guys can't start up things very very quickly because of questions regarding oil quality and whether the oil actually fits with the production units that you have on top. I just wanted to follow up on that question and ask you a follow-up question on the following terms, as of yet do you have conviction that the oil quality is not compatible or is this something that you guys are still testing, that's the first question on that side. And the second question, just moving back to the reserves and the whole discussion about BT, I just wanted to check one point, BT indicated that they see K-90 reserves of about 5.5 billion barrels on the <mark type="inaudible" /> alone and I frankly wasn't expecting to see anywhere near that number becoming reserves at the time of commercial declaration. Can you guys comment on that, do you guys think it's possible that it might be that big or is that number a little bit too high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gattass, I'll have <mark type="inaudible" /> speaking about these two questions but we had released a note about Tupi and the potential with the reserves and volumes there. We still are completing two important wells and after that we will have some numbers. So, it's difficult to say anything from this point, but let's have <mark type="inaudible" /> on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding your first question, really one way to find oil with a different quality than that platform which you <mark type="inaudible" />, sometimes we have to adapt the platform. We cannot connect straight the well into the platform. That's the case of <mark type="inaudible" /> that will be connected to P-42 and <mark type="inaudible" /> to P-48 Barracuda and Caratinga, respectively. We have H2S in these coordinates. So, we have to adapt the platform to defuse these two wells. In the case of <mark type="inaudible" />, that I mentioned that will start production in the first half of 2011. If we discovered light oil, it is 24 to 28 degrees API and we are using the FPSO Cidade de Santos, which is producing CD, which is quite the heavy oil. I think it's 14 degrees API. So, it would be very nice to discover oil of the same quality, but the platform has the capacity to process it, but it's not always the case. Regarding Tupi, we will keep our estimation of 580 billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent and we may book reserves only after declaration of commercial feasibility. And that's what I can tell you.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. My question is regarding your CapEx for the third quarter. Can you let us know how much of that <mark type="inaudible" /> is for the compares and if you have, on Premium I, I suppose no, and if you could give us anymore clarification or insight on the CapEx estimated for the Premium I financial and Comperj going forward? If you have any news about the latest business plan? Just to summarize, would you expect the new business plan to come by March or maybe by June of next year? Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Subhojit Daripa, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I think, it's Subho. Guys, two follow-up questions. One is on the &#x2013; on the production side, the Barracuda project, when I look into the slide 6 and you put out the expected platforms of 40,000 that will be adding production in 2011. I don't see the Barracuda project being added here. Could you provide an estimate of how many barrels do you think that you will be adding on average for 2011?</p>
          <p>All of these prospects are that <mark type="inaudible" /> just mentioned, this is point number one. Point number two is on the refinery side. I think a few months ago, now I'm not sure if it was Gabrielli or someone else was saying that a lot of the cost on the refineries was due to the infrastructure surrounding the refinery, not the refinery per se. So, could you give us an idea of how much would be let's say the extra refinery cost, if it's 30% of the total, 40%, how much is related to the lack of infrastructure of the locations where the refineries are going to be built? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the DMP question, the platform we mentioned is Barracuda, the production. <mark type="inaudible" />, can you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. While we have <mark type="inaudible" />, which will start production in the first half of 2011 and the production will be 20,000 barrels per day. The other two is <mark type="inaudible" /> that will produce it to Barracuda and Caratinga platforms. We are still in the evaluation &#x2013; in the conceptual design phase, because we have H2S in the gas. So, we have to adapt the platform, I don't have the numbers but there is talk that production will begin 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" />, these are related to marginal fields, so this is related to &#x2013; I meant, is this the same sort of a reservoir that you're currently drilling or is it deeper &#x2013; is a deeper objective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of <mark type="inaudible" />, if there are connectivity between these two areas, there is a while, may be quite a big, it can reach maybe 300 million barrels of oil equivalent. So, if you have to collect more data and then start production and see if there is connectivity between these two reservoirs. In case of <mark type="inaudible" />, it's a separate reservoir, it's in BMC 36, close to Oliver oilfield and it's &#x2013; we are producing 20,000 barrels per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's average, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20,000 barrels per day. <mark type="inaudible" /> is not average for the <mark type="inaudible" /> average for the project. So, it will start in the first half, I don't know <mark type="inaudible" /> for the year. I don't have this number.</p>

          <p>Do you think that by March &#x2013; by April when you release the new plan, you're going to be able to give us a better, let's say a more precise estimate of the CapEx related to the &#x2013; all these refineries, because up to now it's, correct if I'm wrong, is still up in the air, right?  It's still subject to changes and better accuracy on the estimates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fact is that we are working hard to reduce the cost of these refineries and so precise information, we hope to have that by &#x2013; when we announce the next business plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, <mark type="inaudible" /> is really hard working with <mark type="inaudible" /> and trying to bring down the costs of this refinery construction. We were very successful in doing that with platform P-55 and 57, that when we received the original proposal was much higher than they ended up costing us. And the experience we had these being applied to other platforms now. So, all our engineers are dedicated to building this refinery, they are working with this purpose to reduce the CapEx cost of these refineries.</p>
