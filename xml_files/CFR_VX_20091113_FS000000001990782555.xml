        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We're going to change the schedule a little bit, because I have to and I've got to apologize now, I have got to actually go and see people in London that have flown over from the United States. So I just thought I'll just have a quick introduction and explain and thank Norbert, because I don't think he is going to be willing to be at the next analyst presentation. I had to ask him to please be present today.</p>
          <p>And then we'll have like 10 minutes of questions that if you wish to ask me questions, but then I'll go and then Richard and Norbert can stay but Richard can go through the numbers and other explanations.</p>
          <p>About six months ago, Norbert came to me and he had been diagnosed with diabetes and his doctor actually said he has got to quit in November. Being a loyal friend that he is, he said that he'll stay through the budget cycle, which obviously is very important in March of next year.</p>
          <p>Now I had absolutely no intention of wanting to be the CEO again and I said to Norbert, I gave him a few choice words, because I wanted to retire before him. But now he has succeeded in leaving in March. On the other hand he is staying on and helping us especially with the supply chain management, the whole IT project obviously, his baby, Montblanc and then obviously he stays on as a Director.</p>
          <p>Now to bring in a new CEO at this stage, let's say from the outside, for the next two years we would have had to teach the individual what's going on, because if you change companies, things are not that easy, especially we are dealing with Germans, with French, with British, with Chinese, with Americans and groups of culture, different cultures. We have a great number of very capable people heading the Maisons.</p>
          <p>Now in a normal situation, their Cartier wouldn't report to anybody else, because it's a major company. Here, we've been friends for many years and it's not reporting as such as a coordinating structure, roughly half of Cartier's business has been watches from the day, from 1975 whether then &#x2013; but I started with Cartier in 1975, '76. So you know the people.</p>
          <p>And so I will be taking over from Norbert but obviously we have Richard, Gary Sage and Johann Rupert, people that will carry on. Norbert will be there and I don't think people must read too much into it. The difference is this time that I am coming last count we had over &#x20AC;1 billion in cash. The last time I came after the prior crisis we had to pay dividends out of borrowings. So this is not an internal this is &#x2013; in 2003, we had some issues.</p>
          <p>Yes, we have problems. Not Richemont, but the world and if you ask me to give you an indication of where we are going, I don't know, because as Alan Quasha says, we've never really known as many intelligent people that whose counsel we value to differ so diametrically. There can be a very good case and cases are being made for further contraction and further joblessness and recessionary &#x2013; economies in recessionary phases when the various central banks start tightening.</p>
          <p>But highly intelligent people can also argue that we could get into a very high inflation scenario. So what we are trying to do is we are not telling the Maisons to budget and to run themselves for a disaster scenario. We are telling look, it could get worse, don't be overly exuberant, but plan for normal growth and we've got the balance sheet to cover your backs. And luckily we have a lot of liquidity not only in the company but crudely put, in the holding companies, so that we can give our colleagues the managerial flexibility not to have to tighten down everything.</p>
          <p>And secondly this is very much a desperate different market. The Anglo section countries are very badly &#x2013; the United States, the consumers are doing the logical thing, they're saving. The UK domestic market is also under stress. But what we've got about 294 stores in China &#x2013; is that about the number, 296, they have opened two since I have gone to bed so it's 296 stores in China. And there we are seeing good economic growth.</p>
          <p>The BRIC countries in general are doing well. It's not doom and gloom but it's caution. And I want to thank my colleagues Norbert, Richard, Gary Sage at the back there and the heads of all the Maisons that in the period we had a 15% decline in sales and with the commensurate, the operating leverage drop in operating profit that our cash position has actually improved substantially. I think Gary you showed us the magical &#x20AC;1 billion few days ago. Now this is without the cash of BAT coming in so I want to really recommend all of our colleagues and say thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Now, please do not ask me what the Christmas sales are going to be and please don't ask me what we're going to buy. I've no idea what the Christmas sales are going to be. What I do know is that there has been a serious destocking, especially in the United States, but still we suspect there is not too many watches in the market.</p>
          <p>We were less hit than some of our competitors, if you recall about a year or two ago, I said I suspect that we will be saved by our lack of capacity. Well, that's actually happened. We didn't actually have enough capacity to flood the market. So hopefully, for the whole US economy we'll see a pick-up because the inventories are very low in the whole of the US system. The people have managed to get their working capital under control. Let's just hope that there is some uptick.</p>
          <p>I think finally I just like to thank Norbert for the unbelievable job he has done. When he came here, we had no supply chain management to speak of, we did but we didn't have visibility and not only that, the company has grown dramatically. I am sorry that he is leaving temporarily if I can put it well, he is leaving in March. I suppose he'll be less here but I'm not sure all the Montblanc people are going to enjoy his retirement, because I'm bloody sure he is going to be giving them hell in Hamburg. Thanks, Norbert.</p>
          <p>Even though it's only in March, and I'm very glad that you're going to still stay to help us through the budget cycle. Any questions, I'll gladly take sitting down and I've got about 15 minutes. So it's the wrong way around, but if you have questions you'd like to ask them now, I hope I'm not going to contradict what Richard has got to say later on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. I've got questions on the group strategy for you, Mr. Rupert. If I remember correctly at the time of the annual results in May, you made two important statements. One, you took a rather pessimistic view of future luxury demand in Western Europe, and &#x2013; sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Future luxury demand in Western Europe, and two, you suggested that Richemont might need to change its product offering and maybe the pricing architecture to change &#x2013; to address changing consumer behavior. Could you update us on these two points and what measures do you intend to take to address these issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The first one was not an indefinite change in consumer behavior in Europe. It was more that our customers worldwide would not &#x2013; those with money would rather, would try to be more discreet in spending and we have seen that. It's across the board. It's not only the days of bling may be over for a very long time. However, they will buy fine handcrafted artisanal products and we've seen a continuance in demand.</p>
          <p>Secondly, whilst European &#x2013; should I say inhabitants and citizens may spend slightly less. We have seen traveler, increase in the obvious Chinese travelers coming into Europe. In terms of more welcome products, I think in the next week or two you'll see Cartier coming out with a beautiful Must range and to give you an idea at one of the central product committee meetings one of the designers said to my son, at last now I can afford to buy something that I've designed. So I think it's going to hit a sweet spot. It's &#x2013; the products are beautiful, but the pricing will be more accessible. And I think the launch started yesterday, was it? The launch started yesterday. There is some, sorry, Sophie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was the 10th of November.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>10th of November, sorry. And I think it will also help work the traffic through the source. So I'd like to comment now for Maisons team for the speed with which they've reacted and the quality of design and product. Any other questions? Antoine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't resist it with the pile of cash building up. How do you look at the payout going forward, the dividend payout? We've had almost a Calvinistic approach to the payout in the previous year. Should we expect now that the cash pile is a little bit higher, a higher payout, should we expect a stable payout? Do you look at the payout as the key metric, how do you look at the dividend policy for the current year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Antoine, you have been around here a long time, not to ask a dumb question like that, okay? Now three or four years ago I said we will try and grow it by about 14, 15% a year, but we will increase the dividends. A Richemont shareholder this year wasn't Calvinistic. It was an increase in the types of dividend paid to the shareholder, you take BAT, take Richemont together. And we look at the sustainability of the earnings.</p>
          <p>And in good times our dividend payout ratio, the coverage may be higher but in bad times it may be less. In other words, our coverage may be lower, but right now without having a strong balance sheet Norbert and Richard and Gary and Beck and I would be very loathe to tell our colleagues go ahead and plan for it because what happens if the working capital goes up and we get it on a rebound. I don't want to get into a situation where I've got to ask banks to bail me out.</p>
          <p>They may not even be there to bail me out if things really get bad. So I'd like to think if you speak to my colleague, Georges Kern <mark type="inaudible" /> is coming next week but we saw George this week and he said to me after a very long discussion especially at lunch, what must I do, how can I plan if we don't know where it's going. And I said, George, plan according to your plan. Plan according to &#x2013; I'm not going to tell you what, we'll cover your back.</p>
          <p>So this is a way of covering our colleagues' backs, if they are wrong, and we look at it that way rather than a cash pile, and trust me, I have been in a situation where we didn't have a cash pile. And now, this situation I prefer our situation at this stage. And one of the big bugs there is that I've got everybody blames greedy investment bankers. This is nonsense. Everybody is to blame.</p>
          <p>The accountants who took reserves away from investors and bankers. I ran a bank, we had &#x2013; our rule was we have enough hidden reserves the income upon which we can pay the next year's salaries, fixed costs. So we didn't have to do business. Things were bad. We weren't forced to do business. So out came the new rules, everything brought on balance sheet. Then, activist shareholders arrive and say you've got a lazy balance sheet, buy your own shares back and give us dividends.</p>
          <p>Luckily, we had enough control over the situation that we didn't have to do it, but a lot of friends, we said come to that. And those famous last words, if you need the capital, we'll give it to you. Yes, right, okay. So people bought their shares back at the top of the market and they're in trouble.</p>
          <p>Fund managers were put under inordinate pressure, by pension fund trustees chasing IOU. So I mean I can go on and on and on. This thing was not just, it was endemic to society, but part of it was this lazy balance sheet nonsense. I remember a time when I was involved with some German automobile companies, I remember a time where they had enough cash to set out at least one year, one five-year cycle. Those are the good synergies in the '80s, they had enough hidden reserves to set out one big downturn, a five-year cycle. I'm not sure whether any perhaps Toyota, but we've changed the pressure on management, changed behavior, so that management and corporates are more vulnerable. We're not going to fall into that trap, it's not burning a hole in our pocket. Our shareholders can expect higher dividends as a combined situation than last year and we try to run the business that way. Any other questions? Yes, sir?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. I was just wondering if you see your pricing strategy medium term and if you anticipate the high-end demand to sustain in the face of higher tax rates that we are seeing coming up in the West. I remember that you were mentioning last time high-end Jewellery was actually sustaining much better than the rest of the business, and if you still see this going forward? And how you reconcile aspirational consumer demand and the fact that you're moving towards successful price points? Is that a temporary measure or do you see this as a strategic development for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are two, three very good questions. Obviously, if the tax rate goes up it will affect and I do suspect that it will go up. But on the other hand I lived in New York in the 70s when we had to have the municipal assistance cooperation, because nobody wanted to buy the bonds, remember Alan and I worked at Lazards and Felix to form the big neck. I think 10,000 individuals pay what, 80% of the tax in New York City on Manhattan, Alan? Something like 10,000 individuals. Now the Chinese have got a saying, don't scare the donkey that carries the china. You see these folks decide to move to Florida, you've got a fiscal crisis.</p>
          <p>Will they increase the taxes? I suspect yes. Will it affect disposable income? Obviously. Will they buy less jewellery? Absolutely. Is the high-end resilient? Not quite. People are postponing purchases. And I have absolutely no problem in working capital even though it's tightly under control but I said to Bernard, do not lose the artisans. You can't replace them. And for clients, this is exactly the best time to buy high jewellery. Not because of pricing necessarily, but because the artisans have got more time, so if you find that Sotheby's and Christie's, the highest prices or the between the war prices, the 1930s, shortcuts, I never figured it out that you pay the most for a pair of furbies that are in the 30s until the gentlemen and ladies from Van Cleef explained to me that's when they did the most resetting because the artisans had time.</p>
          <p>So our clients will realize that in terms of investment value and in terms of purity probably now is the best time to buy and to ask for these type pieces. And people are not silly they will figure it out. So I have no problem, I don't want to have a old bunch of steel watches out in the grey market in America, but if they carry on making beautifully bespoke high jewellery, we'll sell it.</p>
          <p>The lack of demand is not there in other regions of the world. There is still demand and very good demand. It's really in the United States and Anglo section countries where we've seen that postponement of purchase. Sorry, the third one is the Welcome Jewellery. We try not to call it excess we try to say Welcome Jewellery. I do think it will be a success, yes. And having seen the product especially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Zurcher Kantonalbank. I have two questions if I may. First, regarding communication costs. You have decreased price substantially in H1. I know there was an issue because there was no SIHH but still you have decreased it, I know I mean Cartier has a very strong brand value. So you definitely can afford this. But what's your view on this for looking into the future in terms of communication costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We try to look at communication costs as a percentage of sales and even if it looks less, today you get more because the various media companies have also realized that they have to go to come to the pot. My view, I don't think one should play around with communication costs as a cost saving tool. One should consistently support the Maisons. We've never applied pressure on them to do so. If sales pick up, communications costs will pick up obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I add one thing. The brands have been obviously cautious in the first half and it's fair to say that you'll probably see in percentage term a rise in the second half which of course contains first of all the launch of the Cartier, the Must which is a major issue and Cartier being the company which is the biggest by size has the biggest budget for communication, but although from the other brands and then of course in the second half you have the SIHH. The Christmas business for us is very important and in the Christmas period I think we want to be seen and our watch brands will spend more money in the second half than in the first. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you've got your job to do which is try and figure out 0.05% and 0.5% and so forth. But I think it's more important to understand the philosophy because hopefully your plan stand by tomorrow, a sale tomorrow and buy the next day because all you making truly wealthy are the traders.</p>
          <p>The philosophy is not to mess around with communication costs, but as you correctly pointed out, Cartier has a high low effect. The bigger the brand, the bigger the high low effect. They &#x2013; if we make sure, we meaning the Cartier management, if they make sure that they have a consistency in communication that when they advertise, there must &#x2013; there is a high low effect over the watches and vice versa. So Cartier can afford to get less than to get a four &#x2013; kind of 40, get away with less as a percentage of sales than a pure watch brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, I know that you are a very busy man. So what's your best guess for the time horizon that you want or have to do this year <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am a very what man?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Busy, very busy man.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Busy. How long is this recession going to last? No, in the whole seriousness, I like working with my colleagues, it's fun. So I don't consider this a job. It's fun, it's fun working with creative people. I hate to admit what he did was not fun. Beating up people to introduce his SAP is not fun, a German engineer is far better than me at that, okay. And that part wasn't fun and he did it brilliantly.</p>
          <p>The fun that we have, product committees sitting with creative people, that's fun. And it's not really &#x2013; it's not believe me, I've done other things that I've liked a lot less. So how long I couldn't tell you. I would say it's a minimum of two years, but done, then think I think this thing is going to last two years. That's why I'm scared to say how long. The big problem is if you look at the various Maisons that we've got, obviously Bernard is going to get to retirement age some stage. How old is Bernard now, 63, 62, he's turning 63 sooner or later.</p>
          <p>Then we're going to have to move somebody there. So you can see that it was just unfortunate. I would have loved to have seen him here for another two years which was our agreement, but I don't know how long it's going to last and it would be totally unfair to take somebody out of a company now at this stage.</p>
          <p>We're now all facing issues as we sit here and to bring a new person in our folks, this is a complex business. Just to understand the politics is at least a PhD course in French, German, Italian &#x2013; yes, in international &#x2013; don't laugh, I have often said oh that we are air traffic controllers of eagles. You know you've got to know the sky and you've got to know &#x2013; it's &#x2013; this is a special business. What it's like, I guess it's like running an investment bank. We've got a lot of talent, self-driven people. And so, it's unfortunate but it's fun, I can't tell you.</p>
          <p>If you tell me whether it can be tied to inflation or a recession, if anybody can tell me that because as Alan and I've discussed, I mean you've hit the most incredible arguments both ways. But right now &#x2013; I've been involved with the Group since about '75 so I know all of the individuals. You don't have to &#x2013; if somebody calls you, we know how we think. I mean, Norbert and I have now been what 25 years &#x2013; 22 years, Richard I've known for 30 odd years. We know how we think. You don't have to call somebody and spend half an hour on the phone trying to be nice, neither do they. They call and they say this has happened, you say oh God, will they fix it this way and it's &#x2013; I don't know how to put it. We don't have to have a honeymoon at this stage. Any other questions? Right.</p>

          <p>M&#xE9;lanie Flouquet, JP Morgan. I'm told I have to introduce myself. I have several questions. The main one is really to &#x2013; this crisis was worse than any on topline that we can see any way from our side. You've done a very good job on EBIT to limit the damage, but on topline it has been quite a lot worse. I wondered what you read this to be &#x2013; is this a question that is just in deeper that we will recover or is this &#x2013; are we paying the excesses of the past, was there an element of double? Had we gone too far with price increases which was a bit to Luca's question on Welcome Jewellery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you expand on your view on this? How long will it take to actually recover the heyday sales, can we recover them? Will we get the pricing power that we have had in watches for instance seen the past five years back or do we have to decrease prices there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is, Melanie, we've discussed it before. The other question brand equity, why are consumers willing to spend more on a BMW or Mercedes than on a Chrysler or a Ford. They have the same amount of steel, glass, leather but there is more perceived value and beauty but very importantly value afterwards. Very interestingly a friend of mine started automobile leasing in the United States, a man called Mike Pascucci years ago, decades ago. I didn't know it but he said to me he could never ever write one lease on a Ford, a Chrysler or a General Motors product.</p>
          <p>That's why General Motors had to start GMAC. You see, he said the moment the car left the dealer floor, the price automatically dropped by the embedded costs of and those basically see even less, the medicare. I mean General Motors was an unfunded pension fund debt assembled cost. And the consumer is not stupid, consumer is highly intelligent. They took one look and they said and he could not afford to write a lease. So in whole of his leasing business he never wrote a lease on any of those American cars or European and Japanese cars.</p>
          <p>Now when people come in to buy luxury goods products they want to see an investment value. It's not just &#x2013; and that means you need more artisanal and rarity. The pricing tower will always be there for beautifully made products that people know that their grandchildren consider it an option if they need to. Did the pricing go too far? Yes, absolutely. And I don't think anybody will dispute that fact. Will it come back? Well, if we are tied to inflation you're going to be so glad that you bought that stuff two months or six months ago.</p>
          <p>So I really couldn't tell you. That's what I said to Bernard. I said Bernard, keep on going. Please believe me, if inflation picks up, you are going to be seeing people running into your stores, buying high jewellery. It is not only gold. You are going to see it. I don't know, I'm not going to bet on it, but in general, Melanie, you're right. Then you've got to be more efficient.</p>
          <p>Our job is to make our wholesale clients make money by giving them better service, we're talking watches now, so their turnover per square meter and square foot is better, then they will have us and we'll continue. It's right that diamond prices are down, but the gold prices are up. So, yes, I don't know where these things are going to end up.</p>
          <p>As long as we keep the brand equity pure, you will have pricing power. But I think, Melanie, the key thing is that pricing power is a relative concept. You could have more pricing power than your competitor. You don't have to have absolute pricing power. OPEC's got that. We don't have it. Relative pricing power that when somebody walks in the door to buy that product and that product is what we can try to achieve. And that again works with communication and consistency in communication. In some countries we're going to have to gain market share where the markets are sluggish and in other countries if we gain market share in greatly growing economies we're going to be very happy and luckily a number of our Maisons started early in places like China.</p>
          <p>So that not only is the brand awareness there but the desirability is also there. And they are relevant to the consumer. So we're lucky. Sometimes you needed the luck. And we're lucky that we're well positioned in some of the growing markets. Okay, M&#xE9;lanie, one more.</p>

          <p>I have a follow-up, sorry, on the US. There has been statements from the Group, I think from Norbert, notably that the US media has said this quarter that will take quite a while to recover. What is your view on the US consumer in the past you &#x2013; a while ago you had been very bullish on the structural growth prospect for the luxury goods sector in that market. What's your view now for the medium-term?</p>

          <p>I will never bet again &#x2013; I will never bet against the United States of America. A lot of people have gone bust that way. I happen to agree with Roubini that there is a huge carry trade going on, because it's a one-way bet, borrow in the dollars and go abroad. Obviously it's hitting us. If you look at the &#x2013; you know the business well enough to know what the exchange rate is doing to us, we've got a weak dollar and a weak yen, not a great scenario. And you know, the Fed is not going to put an orange light between the green light and red light.</p>
          <p>They are not &#x2013; I mean it's not their job to say, whoa, slow down, now we are going to put the red light on. I was in Wall Street and I was a very junior gofer, as they say gofer coffee, gofer tea you know when Mr. Volcker, Paul Volcker, raised the discount rate by 1% in the middle of an IVM issue where we were on the Maison level, and some na&#xEF;ve people said how can he do that, didn't he know that we've got $1 billion issue and I'll never forget, I think it was Felix who said, no, you know as damn well we've got the middle of this issue and he just wanted to show us who is boss. Now that was after this disaster, this Blumenthal era with inflation. Now the Fed is not going to and there was a very interesting article by, I think it was the Chicago Fed, where I said they will act when we don't think they are going to act.</p>
          <p>Now one day they do something, that dollar could go the other way and serious disruption could take place with all of these carry trades that are carrying on. I don't know but I don't want to be in a position where all of our shareholders are hurt in the process. So you ask me the United States of America, the United States of America don't have $35 work weeks with bridges that are connected by a viaduct they don't have the concept of viaduct.</p>
          <p>They don't take half of May off to go on holiday. They don't have the demography like Japan or for that matter parts of Europe. They are a welcoming country, they allow immigrants, their democratic &#x2013; demography is better, and they've got a habit of fixing things. Bankrupt, fine, go bankrupt. You go bankrupt in Germany or I mean that's it. You're tainted, goodbye, you &#x2013; I mean you basically go, you're out.</p>
          <p>The society can restructure itself. Is it under stress? Yes. But remember one tiny little thing, their debt is in a commodity that they can price themselves. So ultimately if the dollar depreciates, c'est la vie. I'd be more worried about holding a lot of dollar debts like China. I am just talking as a central banker and I believe the United States will be back quicker than most people think. Is it going to be very painful? Yes. Is it very painful right now? Yes. Are our trade partners suffering? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I am surprised, Gary and I &#x2013; we had a discussion yesterday.</p>
          <p>I am surprised that we haven't seen more bad debts coming out of the United States which we haven't. I would have thought that we'd have seen a lot of liquidations and a lot of bankrupts by now, we haven't. Will there be structural changes? Yes, but that's the American way. But I brought out that bridges and viaducts and in all of August you've gone and then &#x2013; I mean at least we used to work in night. Now May has got two viaducts.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you all. So I've not much to say now, I think that everything has been said. So you may have just some detail and we may start with financial highlights.</p>
          <p>Reported sales down by 15% as expected. The only positive factors are the underlying trend has improved monthly ever since April and retail sales has consistently outperformed wholesale. Geographically the only area that continued to show growth albeit to a lower rate was Asia-Pacific. The Americas showed the weakest performance. However, as the result of realistic forecast and a disciplined approach to production management and investments, cash flow from operation rose to &#x20AC;321 million, leading to a substantial net cash of &#x20AC;902 million. Of course as far as operating profit is concerned with lower sales and lower gross margin, the operating profit declined to &#x20AC;390 million.</p>
          <p>We are continuing with our action plan detailed last May and I shall briefly review this again later on during the presentation. It's our view that we faced very strong comparatives. Last year most of the growth varied between 14 and 24% at constant rate until September, when the rate of growth declined to single-digit. We hope that this first six months of our financial year that have been fully impacted by the peak of the financial crisis represents the worse of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Our sales number reflects the importance of wholesale in our business model given the weight of watches for Richemont. Wholesale is known to amplify trends, both upwards and downwards with a phenomenon of stocking and de-stocking. Wholesale are so large beyond retail, both points will be reviewed later. Swiss Watch exports through September declined by 26% leading to a similar rate of decline year-to-date.</p>
          <p>These statistics confirmed that there are no signs of an imminent recovery in the Watch segment and that the lack of visibility regarding demand for Christmas has led retailers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
          <p>The other important factor is currencies. The yen and US dollar strengthened versus the euro. Overall currencies played in our favor and reported sales were above organic sales, a trend that is likely to reverse in H2 with a weaker US dollar. As to the stronger Swiss franc this negatively impacted our gross margin. It is again this difficult environment that we shall now review the Richemont results starting with sales.</p>
          <p>Sales in Western Europe, our biggest region with 32% of Group sales, decreased by 22%, bringing sales back to the September 2007 level. Wholesale greatly underperformed retail. Sales with local continued the decline while sales with third-party nationals not only from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia experienced a slowdown due to the non-repetition of exceptional high-ticket high jewellery sales.</p>
          <p>In Russia and the CIS market, wholesale sales were particularly impacted by liquidity issues. Overall sales declined and as a result this market reduced its contribution to 2% of Group sales. Sales through Russian nationals globally are estimated to contribute some 6% of Group sales.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Middle East fell by 10% after plus 49 as constant rates last year. This region contributed 6% of Group sales. We estimate that around 10% of Group sales are made with Middle East clientele.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific remains our second important region after Europe. Its proportion of sales has risen to 32% of Group sales from 26% the year before. After four years of continued strong double-digit growth, sales decreased by a modest 2% at constant rates. Reported sales however increased by 6% and retail sales by 14%.</p>
          <p>There were notable differences between main markets and channels. Wholesale sales only leveled off in August, while retail sales turned positive in July consistently between wholesale. Both channel experienced a lower rate of decline month after month confirming that Asia-Pacific is not only the most resilient region but also the first to recover.</p>
          <p>Sales in Singapore and Taiwan and to a lesser extent Hong Kong were down while in Korea sales grew by 22% with the return of Japanese tourists due to the appreciation of the yen. In Mainland China sales rose by 3% after plus 30% last year and plus 53% the year before. Mainland China has increased its contribution to Group sales to 8% and ranks number five after Hong Kong, Japan, the US and France.</p>
          <p>The renminbi versus the euro plus 11% over the period has further boosted tourism of Mainland Chinese abroad. Hong Kong has become our number one retail city, well above Tokyo and Paris. We expect this region to continue to outperform the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>Now the Americas. This region contributes 14% of good sales, and the US 10%. After seven years of double-digit rate growth at constant rates, sales momentum in the US slowed in August '08 and turned negative in September '08. Remember that sales declined by 35% for the second half of the year ended March '09. So trend wasn't until the rate of decline which Robert in April '09 minus 52% in dollars. We have never seen such a strong decline. Thereafter the monthly decline in rate has eased such as sales for the half-year and even down by 42% at constant rates. It was looking that retail is not as bad as wholesale.</p>
          <p>As the US dollar, its appreciation against the euro until May '09 helped soften the decline when translated into euro, but the trend has reversed quite strongly since August. Despite the US economy which is forecast to grow between 20% in 2010, we expect the cautiousness of our client to continue in the short-term. We therefore maintain a negative view in this market.</p>
          <p>Out of the 13 boutiques to be closed, 10 have already been shut down leaving a total of 79 internal stores in the US. However, since December '08 it was very difficult, minus 16 in dollars and if difficulties continue to improve, we may expect a further improvement of current trends.</p>
          <p>Finally, Japan. It's consolidation to Richemont sales represent 12% of sales, only 2 points more than the US. Sales declined by 25% in yen, but only by 9% in euro, given the strong acquisition of the yen over the period. With the yen rebound, with so many Japanese tourists shopping aboard, especially in Korea and Hawaii. Overall, we estimate the contribution of Japanese worldwide sales to be in order of 16%.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the sales by product line at constant currency. All product lines have a similar performance except for leather. That proved to be the most resilient category due to its retail exposure, shorter product lifecycles and more accessible price points.</p>
          <p>Sales of leather goods were 11% despite the commendable performance of Chlo&#xE9; and Lancel. Watch sales are down by 20%. The evolution of the sales of watches, our core business has been worse by the wholesale element of the distribution.</p>
          <p>Many retailers have opted to massively destock. This decline compares to minus 24% in near term for the Swiss watch exports or CHF500 and above segment over the same period.</p>
          <p>Jewellery sales declined by 20%. This is mostly due to non-recurrence of exceptional high ticket high jewellery sales so far. As our jewellery lines were more resilient, Writing instruments remains a difficult market, particularly in the US and Europe. The decline of 22% in other primarily reflects lower sales at our manufacturers of watch components to third parties.</p>
          <p>Retail sales represents sales in our directly operated stores. They do not include sales to our franchise stores, which are categorized as wholesale. They declined by 13% at constant rates, 7% at actual rates, more or less harder rate of decline at wholesale.</p>
          <p>As a result, the rate &#x2013; the weight of retails rose to 45% of good sales. The resilience of retail is attributable to the absence of destocking carried out by third parties. All our Maisons are showing much better performances with our retail network. Watch sales in Cartier retail network for instance are down by a low single-digit at constant rates and up in euro terms.</p>
          <p>Here is our P&amp;L. Sales decline at 15% in euro terms and 20% at constant rates. The average operating profit decreased to &#x20AC;390 million or 16.4% of sales. The decline was contained, thanks to a lower operating expenses resulting in an operating gearing of 2.6 times.</p>
          <p>The gross margin decreased to &#x20AC;1.5 billion in percentage terms. The decline was contained to 250 basis points representing 61.5% of sales. This decline is a result of lower production volume on manufacturing fixed costs and a stronger Swiss franc. These negative points were partially offset by '09/'10 pricing power, higher proportion of retail sales, lower high jewellery sales and translation gains at sales level.</p>
          <p>In this negative context, Cartier managed to maintain its gross margin percentage while Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Alfred Dunhill, Chloe and Lancel increased theirs. The Specialist Watchmakers with a substantial investment in production suffered most.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses declined by 7%. Selling and distribution costs, 56% of the total effects were flat in spite of the extension of the network. This was achieved thanks to a combination of actually first, the slowdown in stores openings, second, lower variable expenses including lower compensation leases and third containment of all &#x2013; of other costs.</p>
          <p>Communication costs declined by 31% to reach 9% of Group sales. The decrease reflects strict control but also better negotiated rates and the timing of the SIHH Watch Salon now taking place in H2. For the full year this ratio will be more in line with the past given the seasonality of our business and the SIHH Salon to be held in January 2010.</p>
          <p>All our Maisons exceeded the sales targets. The Jewellery Maison and the Specialist watchmakers generated a contribution margin well above 20%. This performance was partly offset by lower reserves at branded, especially at Montblanc, 12% of sales and at our non-branded watch component manufacturers.</p>
          <p>The Jewellery Maisons, Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels reported a decline of &#x2013; in sales of 14% led to a lower contribution of &#x20AC;349 million. The contribution margin, however, remained strong at 29% of sales. Watch Maison surpassed the sales and profit targets. The limited reduction in profit margin underlines the strong brand equity of Watch Maisons and a successful penetration of gross markets especially for Cartier.</p>
          <p>Reported sale of the Specialist watchmakers declined by 17% in euros impacted by less demand, especially, from watch retailers following years of extraordinary growth. The operating contribution declined to &#x20AC;133 million due to a lower sales &#x2013; a lower gross margin rate linked to under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, a stronger Swiss franc and the integration of Roger Dubuis which is currently loss making. The contribution margin was 20% of sales.</p>
          <p>Panerai, IWC, Piaget, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin posted contribution margin well above 20%. As for one Montblanc high exposure to the US and Europe 45% of sales as well as to wholesale business has made this more sensitive to the economic slowdown. Reported sales declined by 16% and the operating contribution decreased by 6% to &#x20AC;29 million. As a result the operating contribution margin slightly improved to 12%.</p>
          <p>15 underperforming stores have been closed in line with our plan mostly in the US. The importance of Asia-Pacific in particular Mainland China, which is a first market for Montblanc should help going forward. And so given that Montblanc is a most exposed Maison to the Christmas season, the resilience of its retail sales combined with an improving feel good factor should lead to a better second half.</p>
          <p>Reflecting changing &#x2013; changes to IFRS, the segment in our groups, Alfred Dunhill and Lancel and both Chlo&#xE9;, Shanghai Tang, Ala&#xEF;a and Purdey. As you know the Fashion and Accessory segment is now overseen by Martha Wikstrom, the CFR Board Director who has considerable experience in that field. The losses of &#x20AC;28 million are primarily due to our non-branded watch component manufacturers subsequent to massive reductions in orders principally from third parties.</p>
          <p>Within these business areas, the Fashion and Accessory Maison has generated a loss of &#x20AC;9 million. Alfred Dunhill and Lancel reduced the losses whilst Chlo&#xE9; remained profitable. Sophie?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Good morning to you all. It's nice to see you again. As usual, I'll start with the Cartier, but despite this external difficulties has met its internal targets and remains the world's most powerful jewellery brand and number two in watches.</p>
          <p>Downturn in sales was limited. Thanks to growth in Asia-Pacific, resilience of retail and success of high jewellery watches, new Ballon Bleu, watch in steel, the new Baignoire &amp; Santos 100 Carbon watches as well as Bijoux collection, in particular the revisited trinity line.</p>
          <p>Whilst Cartier reported negative wholesale for watches; they were actually up in retail. High jewellery sales are down so far last year, but remember there were some exceptional high ticket sales in 2008. This is reflected in lower sales in Europe.</p>
          <p>Cartier reinforces status as king of jewelers through many initiatives, notably a new bridal offer with an exclusive customer service, rejuvenated trinity line in this month's high jewellery theme <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>It's been a tradition exhibition in Beijing Forbidden City, at the invitation of the Palace Museum displayed over 3,000 pieces and shows the prestige enjoyed by Cartier along with Chinese.</p>
          <p>In parallel, Cartier further developed its watch offer in a high watchmaking with new models such as Historiques American to be on Geneva hallmark. In the mid to high end we've revisited Baignoire and in excess welcome with the new Must collection. The entry price of this new Must watch, steel case and steel bracelet will be &#xA5;240,000 in Japan and &#x20AC;1,900 in France. This collection is expected to stimulate sales with traditional, western and Japanese <mark type="inaudible" />. New models also tend to boost sales of existing lines by generating traffic in the stores and additional editorial coverage.</p>
          <p>Focus on growth markets of China, the Middle East, Russia and CIS countries continue. This half year saw opening of 11 stores including the Hong Kong Heritage 1881. A number of watch component sales remain stable despite openings in growth markets. In watch and jewellery manufacturing, Cartier has made real progress in improving its flexibility, creativity and productivity while increasing its level of integration. Its cellular manufacturing organization has made a lower impact on gross margin of the underutilization of its manufacturing capacity and the faster adaptation to demand.</p>
          <p>Overall Cartier has managed to contain the decline in sales in spite of a strong negative impact of wholesale on watches. Even more commendable is a generation of free cash flow and limited decline in profitability thanks to the proactiveness of its organization. With easier comparatives and so many launches in particular the new Must collection in high jewellery theme we expect Cartier to continue to improve.</p>
          <p>Despite strong comparatives, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels managed to deliver sales and profit above expectations. This performance was driven by Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Growth rate did not however compensate for declines elsewhere, given that these two regions penetrated fairly recently represent about a third of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels sales. However, this under-penetration represents a growth opportunity for future.</p>
          <p>Lower high jewellery sales in the phase of exceptionally high sales last year must a satisfactory performance from the Perl&#xE9;e and on the Bijoux line as well as the excellent performance from watches.</p>
          <p>Emphasis on creativity is underlined by three launches of spectacular and graceful designs; in May '09, Une Journ&#xE9;e &#xE0; Paris Bijoux collection for first time ever supported by an online launch; the Oiseaux de Paradis Creative Jewellery collection, previewed in Moscow, with a full launch from now until January 2010 and the California R&#xEA;verie high jewellery theme introduced in Los Angeles last month.</p>
          <p>While cost have been under scrutiny retail opportunity have been seized in Wan Fu Jin in Beijing, Dubai Mall, Hong Kong, Heritage 1881 and Milano where Van Cleef &amp; Arpels had no presence. We are pleased to say that in the last two months to October retail was ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>Now our specialist watchmakers who all exceeded their profit targets. Notwithstanding to international success over 40% of our sales are still generated in Europe. We started Piaget who had a second best performance among the specialist watchmakers. This is a result a strong exposure to Asia Pacific, 60% of sales and to higher retail sales, notably, boosted by the success of Piaget Polo 45, the Altiplano and Magic Hour watch.</p>
          <p>Piaget's ingenious creativity is underlined by the June launch of Limelight Paradise collection composed of 71 jewellery pieces and 11 watch models. And seen walking the world in warm seas and tropical flowers. This creativity is further underlined by the introduction this month of the revolutionary reversible Limelight Twice watch. For this work of art that displays diamonds for evening and white gold for the day. Piaget had to develop a special club, a new way of integrating the bracelet into the case and a hidden time-setting push-button.</p>
          <p>The refined advertising campaign highlights the elegance and expertise of Piaget's extra refined movements for men's watches. While for jewellery it underlines sensuality and charm.</p>
          <p>Piaget's profile is being further raised by two exhibitions. Piaget in belle histoire and the new Hong Kong Heritage 1881 store and the celebration of 30 years of creativity of the Piaget Polo watch in the Geneva boutique. Piaget is in the process of gradually internalizing its stores in Mainland China following the takeover of Heritage. It has now 12 boutiques in Mainland China and 64 altogether.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Vacheron, Vacheron Constantin. <mark type="audio gap" /> Major PR event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York sponsored the exhibition <mark type="inaudible" /> museum a legacy of collecting and launch for more pieces of M&#xE9;tiers Masques. It also celebrated the 30th anniversary of Kallista with four new HJ master pieces, and opened its fourth internal store in Hong Kong Heritage 1881. It now moves the retail network of 20 stores including 10 in Mainland China.</p>
          <p>Now, Jaeger-LeCoultre that achieved reported sales up in Hong Kong, Japan and the U.K.</p>
          <p>Main launches over the period were the Grande Reverso in June and the Compressor Diving Navy Seals in September. This half year saw the international introduction of Hybris Mechanica 55, the most complicated wristwatch ever, with 26 complications, chiming hand has complete <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>This technical feat further underlines Jaeger-LeCoultre several fair in high watchmaking. The sponsorship of Venice Film Festival for fifth year running led to appreciable editorial coverage. Jaeger-LeCoultre, enlarges retail network to 29 boutiques with the opening of the external Abu Dhabi and Cannes boutiques.</p>
          <p>Next, Officine Panerai, sales were particularly resilient in Asia-Pacific, where the Maison is still under-represented, hence more potential to grow. Panerai enjoyed an excellent performance from its retail network, with reported sales up at double-digit rate.</p>
          <p>Sales were mostly driven by the new Manifattura collection further supported by the new P9000 in-house movement, featured in the Luminor 1950 Marina 3 Days Automatic introduced in April.</p>
          <p>Its distribution network in the Middle East was concerned with the opening of Doha and Beirut external stores, bringing the total to 10 store to 11 stores worldwide. Following the success of Galileo's Telescope held in Beijing last year, Officine Panerai, sponsored Galileo, the Medici and the Age of Astronomy exhibition in Philadelphia, USA.</p>
          <p>As expected, Baume &amp; Mercier with three quarters of its sale in Europe and the States and no retail, faced a challenging year. To meet these challenges Baume &amp; Mercier has further enriched its Hampton and William Baume collections. Visibility continues to be improved with the new advertising campaign of the high-end offer and PR events such as Fotografia Italia exhibition in Rome. David Duchovny and Evangeline Lilly will be the new Maisons ambassadors.</p>
          <p>IWC, the decline in sale has been tempered by growth in Asia-Pacific in actual terms. This is thanks to a strong resilience of iconic Pilot and Portuguese lines, a balanced product offering in the steel segment, good acceptance of new products such as the Aquatimer collection in collaboration with the Charles Darwin Foundation and strong support from retailers in connection with dynamic trade marketing action plans, meaning more marketing actions together with trade. IWC presence in Asia-Pacific is further raised with the opening of new flagship stores in Hong Kong Heritage 1881.</p>
          <p>Next Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne, this half year has been challenging, especially in the US and some European markets but Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne is showing some positive signs. This period was marked by three important launches, the Datograph Perpetual, the Richard Lange Pour le M&#xE9;rite in platinum in July, that was the Grand Prize Watch of the year 2009 and Best Men's Watch 2009 award at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie in Singapore and the striking lange Zeitwerk, another example of German high performance engineering.</p>
          <p>The new Zeitwerk is refocusing attention on the whole brand and this engineer's creativity made Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne to be ranked top of German's luxury brands for the second year running by Wirtschaftswoche magazines.</p>
          <p>Finally Roger Dubuis, this Maison successfully completed integration into the Richemont distribution platforms and now enjoys global distribution paving the way from an international expansion. Middle East and Russia were the latest markets to be re-entered. At the same time a customer global service network is being reestablished. Overall the combination of new management and belonging to the Richemont Group which was trade retailers, more work to improve in marketing efficiency and to reinforce brand awareness is being carried out.</p>
          <p>The unique combination of movements of highly demanding technical contents bearing the Geneva Hallmark with striking designs makes Roger Dubuis extremely relevant to the new clientele of the growth markets. This is perfectly illustrated by the new Excalibur Double Tourbillon Skeleton and Kingsquare Chronograph launched now.</p>
          <p>As expected, Montblanc faced challenging half year. Reported sales decreased by 16% caused by double-digit declining sales except for Asia Pacific, retail and watches. Mainland China continues to be success story with reported sales up by 9% in the period. With 14 internal stores Mainland China generated a quarter of Montblanc retail sales worldwide. Despite the closure of 15 internal stores, retail outperformed wholesales in all markets. Retail did particularly well in Europe and Asia Pacific. Only three stores were open including the Hong Kong Heritage 1881.</p>
          <p>Product-wise the carefully managed diversification is a confirmed success. Sales of pens hampered by the difficulties of the trade, weight of western clients and the continued closure of point of sales around 50 over the period declined to 48% of Montblanc total sales.</p>
          <p>Sales of watches have been more resilient. We've reported flat sales in Montblanc's retail network &#x2013; in Montblanc stores, yeah. The period was marked by the launch in July of the Nicholas Rieussec Steel Automatic watch successfully introduced in all markets &#x2013; in all major markets of the Meisterst&#xFC;ck with UNICEF Signature for Good writing instruments collection and the soft level Meisterst&#xFC;ck collection.</p>
          <p>Montblanc is further raising its visibility by selected PR events such as its Culture Arts Patronage Awards in 11 countries. And in the last three months to October retail was ahead of last year and demand for the newly introduced Rieussec Automatic watch exceeded supply.</p>
          <p>Dunhill, Alfred Dunhill reported flat sales, retail 67% of global sales consistently outperformed wholesale. Retail sales were up in Asia-Pacific, it's number one region and in Europe it's third market. Wholesale sales were down worldwide, especially in Japan. Reported retail sales in China, its number one market grew by 17% to reach a third of worldwide retail sales.</p>
          <p>Reported ready-to-wear sales were up from last year and leather was flat thanks to the success of the new carbon fiber collection. The Lifestyle communication focusing on products continues to be success. Alfred Dunhill is looking at a number of initiatives to further its profitability and service level with its boutique and the trade. It is not only looking at reducing the number of SKUs to focus on bestsellers.</p>
          <p>Alfred Dunhill has significantly reduced its losses to reach breakeven in its core business despite a very challenging environment. It's positioning in China gives us confidence in the future.</p>
          <p>Lancel, despite a tough environment in Europe, the Lancel retail sales rose by 3%, exceeding expectations. They were driven by the continued success of the Adjani and Premier Flirt bags, as well as the promising start of the Angelina bag, strategically priced at around &#x20AC;300. The sales momentum is also being supported by the gradual upgrading of 19 stores with the more luxurious concept.</p>
          <p>Stores renovated under this new concept, have seen a 30% improvement in sales. The commendable performance of retail in Asia wholesale up 34% from last year, was overshadowed by the decline of global wholesale sales. Lancel, overall reported sales slightly down. The re-entry into Harrod's last month as well as a grand opening of product sales in Japan with Sumitomo overwhelmed <mark type="inaudible" /> in China.</p>
          <p>It shows that that the perception overall sale is improving. Visibility and legacy will be further enhanced by the traveling exhibition in key markets, our vintage products portrayed by the Harcourt Studio to celebrate 130 years of existence.</p>
          <p>The 21% growth in retail sales experienced of three months October. The positive developments expected from with our joint venture &#x2013; from our joint venture partner Sumitomo in Japan, as well as from our distributor <mark type="inaudible" /> in China, convinced us that Lancel is on the right track.</p>
          <p>Finally, Chlo&#xE9;, it reported lower sales particularly in wholesale in the Americas, masking growth in Japan and in its retail network. Its performance has been effective by the importance of wholesale, the weight of Europe and the limited presence in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Overall sales and profit, thanks to strict cost control ended above expectations. Ready-to-wear really for the decline in sales but leather was resilient with reported sales up by 9%. Leather now represents of 50% of Chlo&#xE9; sales. The Paraty bag and Catlyn boots did particularly well. The new Marlow bag introduced this summer and the new fall/winter collection nine stores are enjoying an encouraging start. The new shoe collection is also fairing very well. As a result Chlo&#xE9; is renewing with positive editorial coverage from the press. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sophie. Now let's finish with some financial figures. Net profit from parent and subsidiaries, net finance income amounted to &#x20AC;24 million. This income relates primarily to net ForEx gains and positive mark-to-market accounting of hedging program as well our gains on our holdings in BAT and <mark type="inaudible" /> for the purpose of hedging remaining stock option granted prior the reorganization of the Group.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate of 17% is consistent with our mid-term expectation. We continue to benefit from profit proportionally higher earnings in lower tax countries like in the Asia-Pacific region and Middle East. Net profit from Parent and Subsidiaries decreased by 36% to &#x20AC;343 million representing 14.4% of sales.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow from operation was almost &#x20AC;100 million higher than last year. Thanks to a less absorption of working capital, it reached &#x20AC;321 million despite the reversal in sales trend and lower operating profit. The increase in working capital was contained to &#x20AC;228 million, primarily due to production cutbacks including short time working that led to a 19% decline in work-in-progress.</p>
          <p>Overall, inventory declined by 2% despite lower sales. The acquisition of Roger Dubuis and the stronger Swiss franc. The rising was only in finished goods with the new products really to be launched for the Christmas season. The stock retention on gross inventory has gone from17.9 months in September last year to 20.3 months this September. The decrease in debtor balances has been more or less compensated by the decrease in creditors. The collection of debt balances is being tightly monitored and the average recovery rates have not been impacted.</p>
          <p>Despite the absence of dividend from BAT, free cash flow inflow rose to &#x20AC;356 million. This achievement results from a much reduced CapEx as we shall see next slide and the net inflow of &#x20AC;35 million rising mostly from the sale of BAT and Reinet shares not needed to add remaining obligation under our executive stock option plan.</p>
          <p>The &#x20AC;118 cash inflow in respect of government bond funds relates to the new accounting treatment of our cash and equivalents. The lower tax payment reflects primarily lower taxable profit. Gross investment in fixed assets declined from 124 million to &#x20AC;50 million accounting for 2% of sales. They were primarily targeted at the gross markets of China and Middle East as well as at our strategic watch movement component facility at <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Next fixed asset investments amounted to &#x20AC;48 billion, compared with a depreciation level of &#x20AC;87 million. For the year as a whole, we confirm the anticipated gross tangible fixed assets investment to be around &#x20AC;165 million.</p>
          <p>By segment around 40% of the investments were made by the Jewellery Maisons and around 30% by the specialist watchmakers. By geography as planned, apart from investments in manufacturing in Europe most were made in Asia-Pacific and Middle East.</p>
          <p>By nature, 52% of our investments related to retail, the most notable retail investment during this year were. In Hong Kong 1881 Heritage complex, the new boutique of Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Montblanc, Dunhill, Vacheron, Piaget and Shanghai Tang.</p>
          <p>Cartier new store in Ion Orchard in Singapore and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels new store in Milan. We're manufacturing 42% of our investments related mostly to Val Fleurier and the completion of the extension of the Jaeger-LeCoultre manufacturing facility. It does not include the intangibles relating to R&amp;D for watches. The majority of other only 6% of the total investments relate to investments in SAP and our salaries platforms.</p>
          <p>After the cash payment of &#x20AC;71 million in ordinary dividends at the end of September '09 and the transfer of &#x20AC;351 million to Reinet in October 2008, Richemont's balance sheet is very sound. Inventory at &#x20AC;2.4 billion is our biggest asset, representing 33% of our total assets followed by cash and short-term government bond funds, 26% and fixed assets, 20%.</p>
          <p>Our gross cash position amounts to &#x20AC;1.9 million and our net cash position to &#x20AC;902 million. Equity represents 70% of our balance sheet. There is a net debt of the mergers implemented to protect primarily our cash better so our margins.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses declined by 7%. 41 internal stores were closed and we're on track to have some 60 closures overall by March 2010. The hiring fees and no replacement close are maintained, the tight control of other expenses will continue. On the other hand, the rollout of the SAP backbone, goes on with a complete integration of our European organization to be achieved by June 2010.</p>
          <p>Non-strategic CapEx has been frozen, limiting gross fixed assets to selected stores opening in gross markets and watch movement production. It's the lowest amount ever since financial year '04.</p>
          <p>Our manager is being focused on inventory reduction, three Maison we started to shorter working time over the period, that's why for our non-branded watch component manufacturers, given the major reduction in orders. This temporary measure contributed to the generation of a strong cash flow from operation, &#x20AC;321 million.</p>
          <p>Protection of our cash flow is our priority and by avoiding building up of inventories and power supply to our retailers, it protects our brand equity as well. Obviously less or so cumulating sales with many new products being launched principally this month ahead of the all important Christmas season.</p>
          <p>A year ago we told you that we were preparing for poor performance from the western and Japanese markets. Reported half year sales declined as expected. However, underlying monthly trends are improving and retail sales consistently beat wholesale. Reported October sales were 10% below last year, retail down by 2%, plus four at constant rates and wholesale down by 15% minus 11 at constant rates. This improvement coupled with the many launches now taking place are positive factors but will not be enough to avoid a decline of sales portfolio.</p>
          <p>However, we are confident that our strong position in the BRIC countries and more generally in the growth markets will help us to improve our relative position and to eventually recover. Richemont's exposure to the clientele from growth markets is well above 50% of total group sales, benefiting from a significant cash flow from operation and the strong balance sheet Richemont has Maison with strong brand equity and Heritage to continue to take advantage and profit from the long-term prospect of our industry. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The q-and-a section will start. It's likely to be shorter, as Mr. Rupert started earlier on. Maybe we have about 20 minutes for questions. For benefit of listeners of conference call and webcast, could you please introduce your name and also your company name.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Thomas Deitz from RBS. Just two questions. The first one, on the overall sales trend. Last presentation you said that you were expecting a single &#x2013; double-digit decline in sales for this year, about flat next year, and a recovery thereafter, has that changed? And second question with the 60 store closures, can you tell us how many sales have been far away from that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say it. I mean, you can ask &#x2013; we can only repeat what Mr. Rupert said, you can ask a million times how the future will be and we'd tell you we don't know. May be we were a bit more pessimistic with the figures of just many, obviously that is the case. We have had obviously very dramatic decline in the November, December last year especially in retail, which was the aftershock of the crisis which some of you call as created and hopefully, if you don't mess around before Christmas again in a major way, we will have a better Christmas business, hope is not knowing again.</p>
          <p>So no, on a serious note Christmas business should be better than last year, of course, but then it's like when you are beaten by your wife every second day you are already happy when it happens only every fifth day. It's a little difficult environment, we have lit off enough.</p>
          <p>We are not encouraging our Maisons even they try every day to say the crisis is over, now, we want again higher spend, build new factories. As a matter of fact, we have people who already want to expand factories again and we discourage this in a major way by saying no. Okay, by saying no. So but then again, I think, we might want to be a bit more generous with CapEx spending because there are opportunities, especially, on the retail environment when other people close stores in AAA locations for which you normally have no access to and we are in the middle of all that. So the rest is crystal ball, quick.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have major small stores, obviously, which we are not profitable. You have heard that Montblanc closed quite a few particularly in the States, which Montblanc has acquired a million years ago when it was a pure pen company, and which are still in pen, in malls today which do not hit the ambitious views Montblanc has on the future. So you have two small stores in the wrong mall, which are making no contribution, you close them, but it's not &#x2013; we haven't closed big stores, obviously not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it's impossible to say that you lose sales because we close stores inevitably that happens to some extent but customers have alternative sources from either franchise dealers, from other stores in the same time which is often the case or when they are traveling. So it's very difficult to put a number to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are opening new stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We closed new stores, which didn't fit in our strategic vision for the future. Of course it also consolidates short-term results but we open stores at the same time and bigger ones generally speaking. So it's not like how we are closing stores. We are closing stores in order to save our backs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. M&#xE9;lanie Flouquet from JP Morgan. Just a question on something you fully can control, OpEx, could you tell us a bit what you are expecting for the second half and maybe for 2010 on that line which is <mark type="inaudible" /> than topline, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our operational expense come on two legs, most of them any way, quite a bit of it. We have today round about 1,000 people less than in the very peak. And we will be very cautious in hiring, that's &#x2013; my CEO thinks that's micro management and yes, it is micro management because right now I am approving personally every replacement even which I have no idea what I'm doing. But I'm making it difficult for the brands even to come and for my HR Director, who's sitting behind there, this woman been working sometimes I just throw him out of the office to buy time okay.</p>
          <p>So now what I'm saying is, we are very careful with OpEx, we try to control this, but we are not panicking to cut into this structure so much that we will regret that. I think, our main issue is, it has been over the last period since the crisis started, cash generation. And you see again, it is very difficult to focus brands, brand CEOs, and brand organization who have been growing since years. And somehow cash anyway is a kind of an abstract thing for these guys, because we have the bank, if somebody is cash negative, the guy behind there, he has to pay and over there as of.</p>
          <p>So now, I think they understand cash flow management. Those who have not yet looked at it so much. And that was our focus much more than, okay cutting costs by all means and cutting into the bone structure. Careful, yes, yes, careful, yes, we have &#x2013; but we have not taken the axe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be more specific, because I know you, and clearly we warn you, we told you that part of the savings 97% is related to communication and we told you that in second half, we will not have the same decline that we have had in the first half because we have the one-off saving of the <mark type="inaudible" /> so that's the first point. Second point, following what said Mr. Platt, if we maintain good cost control without restructuring the organization, we may expect a decline in the OpEx much much limited in term of percentage compared to the first half.</p>
          <p>But hiring freeze, salary freeze, so slow decline of head count even though we are opening stores because of stores, remember that very important also to know that we are not cutting costs and cutting investment blindly because we have to protect our cash. The good example for me, the 1881 opening in Hong Kong, Heritage, which is very, very successful and probably the payback will be less than two years, or the brand, it just proved that we are ready to take opportunity when it arises. That's very important as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Shouldn't we expect a convergence of your depreciation charge and your CapEx having reduced quite a lot at some point? So is that not going yes, you are cutting less cost that your CapEx having come down quite aggressively you are going to see a decrease in the depreciation charge at some point that is quite significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as you know M&#xE9;lanie that is long effect right depending on the depreciation rules of course especially if &#x2013; but I don't need to explain your basic economics, so you know that as good or better than me. We build a lot. And when we started in this year like most &#x2013; people in economy, we didn't know how it goes so we were extremely careful this CapEx and you have heard from Richard that our CapEx in the first year &#x2013; first half year was well below depreciation. I think, principally that's a bad advice to &#x2013; because you're eating into your future.</p>
          <p>We will therefore on a case-to-case basis carefully increase CapEx again. And I think next year, we might spend more CapEx again than this year depending on Christmas, on the crystal ball on the US dollar, on my Chairman's mood &#x2013; on a serious note, I mean, I personally believe that a company which is confident about the future should spend as much money in CapEx as in depreciation as a rule of thumb and we don't do that for the time being. So don't expect too much that the depreciation comes down, that's what I'm telling you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. Coming back on the cost line I assume you are not planning any more work time reduction in the second half than what was exactly in the first half, the impact in euro million from the work time reduction measures, do you have a way to quantify that this one-off gain you made in the first half and where do you carry on in the second half? My second question can you just remind us the amounts of the SIHH that you booked in the first half last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the answer is no. Okay. Richard may be you want to say something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Basically we understand that you would like to know what the future provides and how you can project the first half into the second. We will do the right thing as we walk along. It's very simple. The SIHH has been, of course, is a considerable cost to the Richemont Group, it's an event which is costly and which does not change very much if you close half a restaurant which we do &#x2013; I don't know we do all those kind of small things. But the SIHH is there and we will continue to stay because we think it's an important event not only because we show new products, but to meet our major customers, you know to meet them and look in their eyes which and have the customers also exchange views.</p>
          <p>Maybe when the Americans come again this year, which we hope they will more than last year. They get a little bit upbeat in their mood by talking to the clients from Asia and that is an event which has it's &#x2013; which is worthwhile but it's expensive. Well, we will continue if we have to we do that in one or two Maisons because again it's control of stock more as well as improvement of cash.</p>
          <p>I mean what we don't absolutely want is that we have producing product which put so much pressure on the sales organization and quite frankly the credit markets are already bad enough not only for us for the industry. It is one of the major risks with all industry how the dealers, our partners panic in today's world and try to create cash, no matter what is tomorrow.</p>
          <p>And that's why we encourage friends to do so much last year but then again you see, Mr. Rupert rightfully talked about it, big egos, they live in villages up in the mountains. You know who moves first is the, you have later when the wife goes to the bakery and buys the bread. I know your company is doing short work, I mean, next door they don't, why. So we encourage short work rather than building stock, but again, it's not the mantra, okay. We will continue in some parts fairly after Christmas and again depending on the sales in Christmas.</p>

          <p>I expect it to remain in place, I would say and remember that especially at the last closing in March '09 we have big hedging losses because the improvement of dollars and yen, again the euro and it was fortunate because we have gained more in transacting sales into euro than in losing for hedging. Now, it's reversed, so we'll have more and more profit hedges, which will &#x2013; I would say slightly and partially compensate what we lose in term of translation of sales.</p>
          <p>But globally it will impact and our sales and of course our margin and you know that we are producing in Swiss franc or euro. In terms of pricing has always been the strategy brand-per-brand to defend the pricing for us and even to other I would say consistent worldwide pricing policy that you may expect that they should have some time to compensate, decline of some currencies, it has happened this year with for example the Sterling and you see many, many brands especially for those living in UK have increased dramatically the prices in the UK and as I saw in Korea so that they're really key for protecting the mid-term and long-term business in our industry especially now while we're becoming more &#x2013; we are completely worldwide. Remember that many of our clients are traveling and are going abroad and it is important that they are not disappointed and I would say surprised by our pricing policy.</p>

          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Zurcher Kantonalbank again. I just have one question. Could you give us the sales split by nationalities? You were mentioning 6% with the Russian, 16 I guess with Japanese, could you give it to us for Americans, Europeans and Chinese please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, you know that people buy at home and abroad. And depending from the nationality and the relative ForEx and priority of their own currency they move, and that's obvious that Japanese will experience very significant slowdown in our business in Japan, which has been partially compensated by Japanese shopping abroad, because I would say that the purchase of the Japanese yen has increased dramatically when they travel. So you saw immediately huge sales of our business in Korea, which is one hour from Tokyo, in Hawaii and even in France.</p>
          <p>So the reason why we try to gave you for the biggest clientele some indication what we estimate and partly for sure because Chinese are coming but only Japanese are buying in Japan, but we know that and we have some indication to trace or match it by over growth, so we say 16%, Russia same two, six. Chinese, you know that Hong Kong we told you has become the first retail place in the world and by far both Tokyo and Paris and why because mainlanders are massively now buying in Hong Kong, in Macau, 90% mainlanders by the way I do believe that Chinese ethnic should really be I would say taken as a whole clientele, the same clientele. The same for the Americans, South Americans, Middle East.</p>
          <p>So what we know we said to you that well above 50% of our clientele are living and coming from so-called, now we call them the growth markets they used to be called underdeveloped markets and now the emerging markets and our Chairman told you perhaps you should change your operations, sounds stupid and now we call them growth market and what's going on spending and it's amazing to see for example, the Chinese just one indication Cartier store <mark type="inaudible" /> Paris 60% of sales are made with Chinese, 60.</p>

          <p>I think we've got time for two more questions, in the first row here.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alessandro Migliorini from Helvea, just two or three questions perhaps on brands, please, and one on Russia. The first one with respect to Piaget, if you can give us an idea whether sales at the moment are developing evenly between watches and jewellery, is that well balanced development basically at the moment, I know that the exposure is mainly in Asia?</p>
          <p>Secondly with respect to prices, can you give us an indication of how the average selling price for your collections have varied for brands such as IWC and Panerai for example, perhaps also Baume &amp; Mercier. And finally, can you just give us an indication on business in Russia at the moment. I have been told that clearly the watch retailers, they are in massive difficulties. What process are we in and at what stage are we in the clean up of this process? When can we start to see things improve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start with your last question because I'm old man and forgot your first one. Russia, yes the watch dealers are having difficulties because it's like in America, they have no cash. So we have a considerable difference between our own stores which we have quite a few in Moscow, Cartier is opening one in St. Petersburg. So we see basically a similar situation in United States, the dealers have always expanded in many ways because they thought the parties are going on forever, they've build stores in god know where outside of Moscow and now all of a sudden, they have cash issues. Okay. Do the Russians buy less original? Yes, it's coming back somewhat. But Russia of course is not in the same state like before the crisis and when the oil and the diamonds we got most of it at its very peak, okay.</p>
          <p>Now Piaget, Piaget is traditionally a strong watch brand, which is although in jewellery that's why you see already we group still Piaget as a watch brand not a jewellery brand. However, of course, some of their watches is pure jewellery because it's &#x2013; these are diamond watches. These are very expensive jewellery watches. Dress watches for men, Jewellery watches for women. And the brand is hot in China. The biggest store for Piaget today is in Macau.</p>
          <p>And when I first saw the sales to be a bit anecdotal of the Macau store of Piaget as had &#x2013; did I approve this, how big is that store. And then because we approved basically stores, Richard and myself, no brand can do that on its own. Did I want to see them? I mean, there must be a huge staff. When I went to Macau, it's a standard store 60, 70 square meters.</p>
          <p>So what I'm trying to say is they are extremely well-perceived in the Greater China. They were always strong in Taiwan and benefits from this. But that is of course mainly more watch brand than a jewellery brand prices. If you ask Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> he is selling today, he says, 'well, I am selling more steel watches.' How about this if you are watch brand positioned as IWC, you wonder why in first place they sold gold watches right it's a quart, it's Men's it's &#x2013; so yes, prices have &#x2013; we need to sell more watch to come to the same turnover. Prices have somehow &#x2013; customer has gone down to the next possible level maybe.</p>
          <p>But again that's different you have heard that our <mark type="inaudible" /> is more presiding than others. A brand which is like Baume, which is reduced certainly &#x2013; the brand which is more than any other brand in the Richemont Group a push brand is suffering today because the DLS have options, they sell as a stock &#x2013; off stock. Do you see slide in price? Not really because they are at low level of the watch universe to watch universe we are interested in and we are operating in anyway so.</p>
