        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Happy holidays and welcome to our conference call to discuss earnings for the second quarter of fiscal '11 and our outlook. Strong demand for FedEx transportation, outstanding customer service from our team of 300,000 plus around the world and a healthier global economy combined to drive revenue higher. As we reminded many of you at our Investors and Lenders Meeting in September, we are relentlessly focused on improving our yields. Our strategy is fast gaining traction. Yields and volumes increased significantly year-over-year in our transportation segments during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On Monday, FedEx recorded its busiest day in company history in terms of total shipments carried. More than half of this year's peak volume increase is expected to result from online retail and catalog shipments delivered to residential customers through our FedEx SmartPost network, which also delivered a 10% yield improvement for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We're now more bullish about the remainder of the year based on our record-setting peak volumes and greater anticipated customer demand for our services. We also are increasingly upbeat about longer term more positive macroeconomic trends. As a result, today we are increasing our earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year. We believe FedEx will continue to prosper as we execute our strategy of revenue and yield improvement and as customers increasingly appreciate our unparalleled service and portfolio of global business solutions.</p>
          <p>Overall, the global economic picture is increasingly more positive as recovery continues at a steady pace. We're encouraged also by the recent bipartisan cooperation in Washington on taxes. We believe the actions being considered, particularly the expensing provisions, will lead businesses to increase capital expenditures thereby creating jobs and increasing economic activity and GDP.</p>
          <p>Also, FedEx is very pleased with Tuesday's significant rulings from the Federal District Court in Indiana favoring FedEx Ground related to its independent contractor business model. We believe consumer and business sentiments are improving. Forward-looking indicators such as purchasing and credit manager surveys and other leading economic indexes collectively point to continued growth.</p>
          <p>While Asia is moderating toward more normal high growth rates, it is still the world's economic engine. Latin America as a whole is doing very well and European GDP growth is performing better than many expected. We expect manufacturing and industrial production will continue to lead the economy forward in the near term and drive transportation volumes higher.</p>
          <p>At FedEx, we are committed to investing in strategic long-term projects to position us for stronger worldwide growth in the future. In this regard, in October, FedEx Express officially inaugurated service through its new hub at Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany. As an aside, its rooftop solar panels cover 16,000 square meters, and the hub is the largest FedEx solar-powered system worldwide. The Cologne hub will play a pivotal role in our strategy of strengthening and expanding our market position in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>On the other side of the world, in November, FedEx launched a 777 freighter route in Shenzhen, China, with four flights weekly to meet the growing demand for non-stop service between the Pearl River Delta, Southern China and the United States. Customers greatly appreciate the non-stop 777 flights that we put in place that offer them the latest cut-off times in key manufacturing centers in China, an advantage unmatched by the competition. Our investments in Asia are driving market share gains and improved customer satisfaction. FedEx Express recently was named among the top 20 in the 200 most admired companies in Asia by the Wall Street Journal Asia and first among international express companies.</p>
          <p>Earlier today, we were very excited to announce that FedEx has reached an agreement to acquire MultiPack, a Mexican domestic express package delivery company. Last month, as you may recall, FedEx Express also announced plans to acquire a logistics distribution and express business in India, AFL, and we're very pleased to have both of these companies joining our team.</p>
          <p>Once completed, these acquisitions will give FedEx more robust domestic transportation and related capabilities in these important global markets. Also in this quarter, FedEx Trade Networks, our international forwarding and trade facilitation company, opened an additional five offices in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. As part of an aggressive global expansion plan, FedEx Trade Networks has opened 33 new offices since 2008 in addition to its more than 70 locations in the United States and Canada. All of these are recent examples of how we are expanding our international network. Already the strongest express network in the world, to sharpen our focus on global trade is our prime source of growth in the future.</p>
          <p>Emerging market GDP as a percentage of the world's GDP increased from 36% in 1980 to 46% in 2010. And emerging markets are forecast to contribute about 50% of world GDP by 2013. In the United States, we're very encouraged by the progress by Bill Logue, the CEO of FedEx Freight, and his team in combining FedEx Freight, our regional operation and FedEx National LTL. We strongly believe this action will substantially increase profits in FY '12 and let us offer the LTL marketplace a unique value proposition. Overall, we are soundly on track for increasing our earnings, as well as achieving our 10% plus operating margin goal. As always, we're very committed to improving cash flows and increasing shareowner value.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd like to thank all of our front line team members around the world who are working harder than ever to deliver the holidays to millions of customers. Our operations teams are the backbone of FedEx and we are especially appreciative of their dedication to our Purple Promise, simply stated as, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. And for all of you shopping and shipping procrastinators, you have until tomorrow to send your Christmas gifts by FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery, and you last minute shoppers have until December 23rd to utilize FedEx Express to get your gifts to their destination. For your added convenience, the more than 1,800 FedEx Office locations across the U.S. offer a full range of FedEx shipping options, including packaging, with most stores open as late as 11:00 p.m. and 300 that are open 24 hours a day.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn things over to our Chief Financial Officer, Alan Graf. Alan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. The most important point I want to make today is that we have raised our yearly guidance range of EPS to $5 to $5.30 per share from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.25 per share. Both these ranges exclude FedEx Freight combination costs and a second quarter legal reserve from the ATA matter and assume stable fuel prices and continued moderate growth in the global economy. Our yield management programs are delivering improvement across the entire portfolio, and we intend to maintain that focus. I also want to emphasize that we remain a people-first company and have already reinstated many of the compensation and benefits programs we had to curtail during the recent global downturn.</p>
          <p>As we move through the second half of the year, we will have already absorbed most of the year-over-year impact of these restorations. We also expect to see substantial productivity improvements and cost reductions at FedEx Freight in the fourth quarter. All of this, coupled with continued moderate improvements in the global economy, will set the stage for continued earnings improvements in FY '11 and into FY '12. We have a lot of earnings momentum.</p>
          <p>As for the second quarter, our adjusted EPS of $1.16 was at the low end of the range we had previously provided of $1.15 to $1.35 per share. Since we provided you that range, IP volume growth, while still very strong at over 10%, mitigated some from our expectations. Additionally, due to the lag effect of our program, fuel surcharges did not keep pace with the increasing price of fuel in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Lastly, because we are forecasting improved annual operating profit, our second quarter adjusted earnings were restrained by increased variable compensation accruals. For the corporation as a whole, solid demand for our transportation solutions, outstanding customer service from FedEx team members and a healthier global economy helped drive second quarter revenue higher. The quarter reflects many positive trends in yield improvement and volume growth. Revenue increased 12% to $9.6 billion versus $8.6 billion the previous year.</p>
          <p>Of note, IP Package revenue increased 14%, Ground Package revenue increased 12%, and Freight revenue increased 14%. Base yields increased across all service, transportation service cohorts. A couple of examples are base yields at Express Domestic were up 3.6%. Base yields at Freight Regional were up 5.2%, and base yields at Freight National were up 6%. Our yield improvement strategy is being implemented brilliantly by our terrific sales, marketing and pricing teams, and this will remain an ongoing focus for us.</p>
          <p>Operating income decreased 18% to $469 million versus $571 million the previous year. Significant impact to earnings resulted from $86 million in costs related to the FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL combination, the $66 million legal reserve and also last year's results included a $54 million benefit from a self-insurance program change. Operating margin declined to 4.9% versus 6.6% the previous year as a result of the restructuring costs, the legal reserves and the self-insurance I mentioned earlier. Those three items accounted for a 200 basis point decline in corporate earnings margins.</p>
          <p>Looking at our segments, at FedEx Express, revenue increased 13%, $6 billion versus $5.3 billion last year. In addition to improved yields, IP Package volume was at record levels and increased 11%, lead by exports from Asia. IP Freight pounds increased 29%, lead by exports from both Europe and Asia, and U.S. Overnight Box grew at 4%. Operating income did decrease 23% to $264 million versus $345 million last year, and included the legal reserve, last year's self-insurance program change, and reinstatement of compensation programs, increased aircraft maintenance charges and higher pension charges from the previous year.</p>
          <p>At FedEx Ground, results strongly benefited from higher package volumes and yields. Revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion versus $1.8 billion last year. FedEx Ground revenues increased 12% and FedEx SmartPost revenues increased 29%. FedEx Ground average daily volume was up 7% to 3.8 million packages per day, and yields at FedEx Ground were up 5% to $7.89. FedEx SmartPost average daily volume increased 17% to 1.5 million packages per day, due to the growth of E-commerce, market share gains and new service offerings in small shipper and returns area.</p>
          <p>FedEx SmartPost yield increased 10%. You might recall SmartPost yield is net of postage paid to the USPS and lower postage costs from increased deliveries to final U.S. Postal Service facilities resulted in higher yields. Overall, Ground segment operating income increased 24% to $296 million, and operating margins were a stellar 14.3% versus 13% last year.</p>
          <p>At FedEx Freight, strong revenue growth was offset by costs associated with the combination of FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations. Revenue increased 14% to $1.2 billion. LTL average daily shipments increased 8% to 89,400 and LTL yield per hundredweight increased 7% to $18.27. This strong performance was the result of more disciplined contract pricing, targeted improvement from lower-performing accounts, 6.9% general rate increase on November 1st, higher fuel surcharges. I should note that yields increased sequentially from Q1 by 5%. Freight operating loss was $91 million and resulted from the $86 million in costs related to the FedEx Freight and National LTL combination.</p>
          <p>As noted in the press release, we've lowered the expected costs in combining Regional and National to $140 to $170 million and expect the net cash costs after the sale of assets to be negligible. Substantial profit improvements at Freight will begin in the fourth quarter. In conclusion, we anticipate volume growth at Express and Ground and positive yield trends across our transportation segments during the second half of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing yield improvement activities, including general rate increases and changes to our dimensional weight pricing, will continue to be a major focus in the second half of FY '11 and into FY '12. We expect revenue growth to be partially offset by cost increases associated with higher aircraft maintenance, increased pension costs for the second half of FY '11, and continued investments in our employees as we complete the reinstatement of compensation and benefit programs curtailed during the recession. Effective January 1, 2011, we will reinstate the full 401(k) match. We do expect margins to improve in the second half of FY '11 and in FY '12 as we continue to benefit from solid global demand for our differentiated services and as abnormal cost headwinds subside next fiscal year.</p>
          <p>I also want to thank all the team members around the world for their outstanding performance during this extremely busy peak shipping season. What our team does every day is truly incredible.</p>
          <p>Now the Strategic Management Team will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go first to Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Wanted to see, Alan, if you could give us a little bit of further perspective on how much of a change in some of these costs, lines in Express that you would expect? You made some comments that indicated, I think, that you had seen the greater impact from incentive comp in this quarter, so that might be less of a headwind. I think also if I look at the maintenance costs sequentially, in Express $320 million versus $352 million in the first quarter. It seems that that's maybe easing up a little bit, but if you could give us some comments on how to think about Express costs in second half versus what you saw in the second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Dave. I think we'll &#x2013; as you can see from our year and third quarter forecasts, that they're going to start to mitigate in the third quarter, but by the fourth quarter, will be almost fully absorbed, and you will see some substantial improvements at Express, and you can do the math and figure that out. So I think we've got a lot of it behind us. The shock absorbers worked perfectly in the downturn and now we are slowly absorbing them back into the business and expect to have that completed as we get through the fourth quarter and into FY '12 and Dave can give you some more color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alan. This is Dave Bronczek. Yeah, that's exactly right. We &#x2013; obviously, we had talked about it for some time now: aircraft maintenance, the planes out of the desert, our increased volumes around the world. So we had incremental aircraft maintenance costs. The third quarter will be somewhat less than the second, and then of course, by the fourth quarter, it starts to gradually go back to normal rates. I did want to say one thing on the cost issues, and Alan framed it exactly right. We have great base business performance across the board in the U.S. and our global powerhouse around the world.</p>
          <p>With our revenues, et cetera, growing we can talk about that later. But on the expense side, we had a couple of one-time items that really were affecting our operating profits in the second quarter. And of course, the variable comp, the 401(k) and pension. So you add those three things together and I think you can realize and see the base performance business actually did very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you. And then the follow-up on the volume side, how would you look at year-over-year volume growth in second half of the year, third quarter, fourth quarter, versus what you realized in the second quarter? Would you expect it to decelerate significantly or do you think you're steady state type of level for IP, Domestic, International and if you want to comment on Ground?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mike Glenn. As Alan stated, I think what we've seen is a return to more normal high growth rates out of the International business, particularly out of Asia. I think we're pretty confident that we'll see continued positive trends in the second half regarding our U.S. Parcel business as well, and we're doing a very good job of managing the Freight business to balance the yield improvement that we're looking for with the right amount of growth rate to maximize the return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add that this is &#x2013; a year ago is when we started to see real upswing in IP and of course, the absolute numbers are getting larger, so I don't think you're going to see the same kind of growth rates as you saw in the first quarter in the second half. Having said that, we're quite encouraged by the inventory to sales ratio, which is now down to 1.2, and so any kind of restocking that starts to occur post the holidays I think will obviously be a benefit for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dave Bronczek again. Just one more piece of color on the International performance, we actually set an all-time record volume for the quarter for International Priority and actually Asia-Pacific set their all-time record volume as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Chase with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. If I could pick up a little bit on the Express cost questions that Tom was asking, I wondered -- you referenced some one-time items and clearly you disclosed and released the $66 million. I'm wondering if there were other things that you think were temporary in the quarter. As we look at say other expense, rental expense, there were a number of line items that surprised us sequentially on the upside. I'm wondering if you were referring to any one-time headwinds in there we should be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the headwinds are &#x2013; there's two kinds. There's the normal headwinds that you would get associated with merit increases, healthcare costs, normal volume increases and those kinds of things. Then there's the abnormal when you are doing things like pulling planes out of the desert and ramping up your operations for a much higher peak than originally had been expected, which we're, as Fred told you, are in the middle of right now and while those costs have to be front-end loaded and expended in the second quarter for benefits in the third at Express. Pension has been a big problem for us all year because of the mark-to-market in the May performance of the pension plan and how horrible the market was last May and the very low discount rate.</p>
          <p>We do not expect to see that again in FY '12. We may see some headwind from that but certainly not to the degree that we saw this year. And we have everything else in the base now. Our incentive comp programs have been built back up and they're in the base and they won't be a drag year-over-year to the extent they were this year. So there's many other things. I'll let Dave talk more about some of the direct operating lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's important to note and you wouldn't notice it, but in our purchased transportation we were up 37% and of course we had an accounting change there when we moved the FTN revenue from net to gross and that accounted for half of the change. And that was a simple accounting change. And then last year's second quarter, the fuel expense was $2.08 a gallon and it's $2.39 a gallon this quarter. That made a change as well, and then we had some volume-related expenses in there to go along with. And then Alan pointed out, the long-term disability issue from last year was over $50 million. So when you add them all up, you can see the &#x2013; you strip those back out away, the base performance is very solid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you have too many sections in the quarter and are you dialing down the level of capacity or is it just the cost associated with spooling up that activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We actually have added. As Fred pointed out, we added 777s out of Shenzhen. We added 777 that went from Hong Kong to CDG and we actually have extra sections, extra MD-11 sections. We didn't put as many extra sections on as we had anticipated we might, but we still went over the top of our normal scheduled routes connecting Asia to the rest of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the things that will help us going forward is that we should, as we have more, still high but more normalized growth, we'll be able to much more effectively manage those costs associated with our aviation network because we can plan for a much more steady sort of increase. You'll see that in the fourth quarter and you'll definitely see that in FY '12 at Express.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just want to understand on the International, your yields were up significantly and you mentioned that the volumes were going to a more normalized. Is this something you can &#x2013; you have the power to flex to keep pace with that incremental capacity that you continue to add on the lane? I just want to understand if this is &#x2013; you talk about the new normal being that low double-digit level. Just want to understand what we should expect on the go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Dave Bronczek, then I'll turn it over to Mike. The answer is yes, we can flex up and down, and of course we have scheduled 777s coming into our network that are replacing MD-11s, and of course that's a net positive straight across the board, not to mention on the operating expense side, not to mention the revenue upside.

        <plist>
          <p>Well, the point I would make about yields is with the broader portfolio of services that we have today, which we reviewed with you at the recent Investor and Analyst Meeting, our sales team is doing an excellent job matching the service the customers are seeking with the right network to make sure that we're getting very good returns and that we're getting the right amount of yield for the right amount of service that we're providing. So our sales team's doing a great job of that, and it's showing up in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Strategically, Ken, recall that where we really want to push yields hard are Domestic, Express and Freight, and in fact, willing to give up volume at both places as a result. The opposite is true at Ground and International Priority, where we're very happy with those yields and we're looking to push volumes. So that's the strategic play that you're seeing actually impact us positively right now and that we will continue to do.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And on the Freight side, you mentioned on the decreased Freight combination costs, lower than expected. What changed as you began this process? And I guess you're still ready to launch on, if I recall, it's February 1st on the combination. So what is this far in advance that you're seeing change, that you're lowering that combination cost?</p>

          <p>Hey, Ken, Bill Logue. Yeah, the -- actually the date is we'll be operating January 31st on the new format. Very excited about it, the planning is going very, very well for the team. The upfront charges obviously have come down, which is a good sign, heavily driven by severance packages. And again, we've made a couple of strategic moves. One, obviously, we've protected a lot of our CDL drivers by moving some of our drivers to a dock assignment for the first start-up until we get a good handle on the volume, as well as we've also had very good management. Since the announcement September 16th, done a very good job of &#x2013; we capitalized on every attrition opportunity, some relieves not replaced and really redistributing the work. We've done a nice job there.</p>
          <p>And, again, the front line employees have done an excellent job obviously since the announcement. Fabulous service, but at the same time, they've also been very good about realigning to their new opportunities and transferring and so forth and getting ready for the new organization. So that's basically the front end of it, that's where most of the drop came in up front severance costs.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on the LTL side. I was a little bit surprised that you were able to see LTL shipments per day stay up even with the move in &#x2013; the upward move in LTL revenue per hundredweight. One of your competitors going through a very similar restructuring actually has been seeing the opposite in improvement in yields but not the volume side. They are giving up some share. Can you just talk through what you think you did right in the quarter to keep the volume, while also pushing yields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I think it's a great reflection of the organization. The Freight team does a fabulous job in the eyes of the customer. So again, as we went through &#x2013; back in September, I think a lot of folks thought we'd see some volume drop off because the announcement. And the service since that day has not missed a beat. The team has done a fabulous job, so my hat's off to the teams out there in the field, done a great job. The sales team, as we've worked through this educating the customers on the new Priority economy offering in all lanes and all has gone over very well. So I think that's been the main focus. As we worked on specific targeted customers, working on yield, obviously we targeted those that we believe that there's other options for us and for the customer. And overall, the base business has maintained very strong for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Very good. And then lastly, just in looking at the aircraft, now that you've gotten &#x2013; you're starting to see some moderation in the International shipments, does it change your mind at all in terms of fleet size or at what pace you add additional aircraft into the International? Or do you believe this is just more of a we're up against a tough comp, but we're still going to see incremental International volumes being layered on and therefore we need more capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think certainly B is true. I mean, the comps are going to get tougher, but the absolute size of the amount of IP freight that we carry continues to grow more in pounds on an absolute basis. And that's what it takes to &#x2013; you have to have aircraft to fly those pounds. So we don't see anything in that regard. In fact, we may go the other way. If we get the expensing bill passed, we're likely to actually increase our acquisition of aircraft over the next 18 months and take advantage of that because we can. And we think we're going to need those planes. Dave?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alan. Yeah, our International pounds are up 29%. And every time we put a 777 in to replace an MD-11 in a route, we had obviously better costs, better revenue performance, later pick-ups, better customer service. The 777s are performing exceptionally well. So, no, we're right on track, and we're expecting it to be a tremendous opportunity going forward, these 777s.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Alan. Pension obviously is going to do what it's going to do, and aircraft maintenance you gave us some guidance around that. On the comp side, you've got the 401(k) coming back. But if I remember at the Investor Day correctly, you said that incentive comp, basically those buckets were filled by the end of September. So how should we think about those costs as we transition into the back half of '11 and into '12? What's the run rate? Is it going to be coming off or is the 401(k) going to keep things at the elevated levels we've seen for the last couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the 401(k) match, since it starts in January, a lot of that additional cost will be absorbed by the end of May 31, particularly for the highly-compensated employee, and they are in my range that I gave you. So a significantly less headwind in FY '12 from that as there was in '11. And as far as our annual incentive compensation, the pool will be significantly higher at the end of FY '11 than it was at the FY '10 so most of those headwinds will also be mitigated as we go into FY '12. We do expect to improve our earnings in FY '12, but we won't see the same negative impact to the bottom line from variable compensation accruals next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And I guess the other part of that question was in the back half of the year, relative to the front half of the year, is it still going to stay at a Q2 run rate? Or are we going to see that actually come down as we net the 401(k) against incentive comp funding?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll see it start to mitigate in Q3 from Q2, and you'll see the biggest impact in Q4. If you just take a look at the range I gave you for Q3 and the year, you have the fourth quarter range there and you'll be able to see that not only do we have volume and yield momentum, but then the cost mitigation and headwinds start to fade away, which is what's so exciting about the momentum we have going into '12.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. You had very nice pricing at your Express and also within your Freight divisions. If I look at Ground pricing and the yield there, healthy, but maybe not as healthy as I would have expected and I think sequentially, and I'm talking about the core Ground pricing, that yield there ticked down sequentially. I wanted to know what impacted pricing within Ground? Was there anything specific in the quarter? Has there been a change in terms of your strategy on that product? Maybe just provide a little bit more color on the Ground yield.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to let -- I'm going to give you the high part and then I'll let Mike and Dave Rebholz take you through the rest of it. But, yeah, sequentially, I can fool you because of our mix changes and the amount of traffic that we carry in the second quarter versus the first. But year-over-year, base Ground yields, base Ground yields were up over 3%. Mike?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have to tell you, Matt, we were quite pleased with the yield performance at Ground. If you just look at the second quarter year-over-year improvement, if you exclude fuel, virtually 100% of that change was due to improved rate and discount management. So that's exactly what we want to see, and I think our sales team and our pricing group that manages this is doing a heck of a job there. So we're pleased with the yield performance overall across all of our segments, but we're especially pleased not only at Ground, but Express as well, the strength of the base yields, which are coming from improvements in base rate and discount management, which is really what's driving these changes</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one comment, Matt. This is Dave Rebholz. You've heard all of us talk about it, if you provide a superior performance in service, the customers will eat the dog food. I mean, it's that simple. And every one of us have very specific goals to be the very best in the industry, and we can prove it statistically. So it all comes together in the end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, FedEx received favorable outcomes in I think it was roughly 20 of the 28 cases consolidated in the &#x2013; within the MDL litigation in Indiana. I think eight of those cases where there are either mixed or a decision that went against FedEx, those cases have been remanded and head back to court. Maybe you can provide us a little bit more color on the timing of when those cases go back to court if that is the case? And what are your expectations for the potential outcome with the remaining eight cases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, it's Chris Richards. The timing of the return of the cases, it'll probably be 60 to 90 days before the cases that are going to be remanded will actually get back to the receiving courts. And those individual courts will set the schedule for the proceedings in each of those respective cases. I do want to make it clear that in the 20 cases, we achieved a complete grant of summary judgment in our favor, which means that the court found as a matter of law in those cases, that the contractors are contractors and not employees.</p>
          <p>With the other eight cases, in each instance, many of the claims were found to be situations where we achieved the same outcome. The contractors were found to be contractors as a matter of law with respect to the claims, but in some instances the court determined that it was inappropriate with respect to at least one claim to make that determination and remanded those matters back for consideration. Of course, there were three states where a single claim was found to be a situation where the determination was in the plaintiff's favor and that's Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire. But we will be proceeding with those matters in accordance with the process. We've achieved significant victories under the court's decision in Kentucky and New Hampshire. Nevada, largely the court sent it back for remand. So we'll have a lot of work to do there.</p>
          <p>Time-wise, I expect we're going to be a couple years working our way through all of this. But we're very impressed with the outcomes so far. We are delighted to see the court reaffirm the ability of these independent work organizations to be contractors, to continue to operate their businesses and provide the outstanding service that Ground has promised to our customers.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, could you perhaps give me just a little bit of insight, you had very solid progress on the pricing front, as promised on the Freight side was what, almost 7% increase in revenue per hundredweight on a year-over-year basis and a solid 5.4% sequentially. I know that's partially driven by fuel. Bill, can you break it out and give us some insight into how much of that is driven by actual yield, core yield improvement and how much of that was driven by increases in fuel surcharge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Donald, this is Mike Glenn. We had several positive things going on in the quarter, but the fuel and the base rate changes were roughly the same. So we certainly saw some substantial improvement in base rate. The weight per shipment actually decreased a little bit during the period, which was an offset to that, but the underlying trends on the base rate changes at Freight, like the other Parcel businesses, are quite strong. So if you want to think about it, the base rate and the fuel were similar in terms of their impact in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a breakout of 50, half of that's fuel and half of that's base rate?  Is that what I just heard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were a lot of positive things going on in the quarter, but certainly those were the two biggest items, and we saw a little bit of class change that helped us a little bit. Shipment miles went down a little bit and in terms of &#x2013; had a little bit of a negative for us. So there was some other activity there, but the point I want to make is that the improvement in base rate and fuel were roughly equivalent to each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the class went up slightly and the weight per shipment goes down a little bit so those are also positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, shipment miles actually hurt us a little bit, class helped us a little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. Fred, you talked about the &#x2013; I guess the more positive outlook for macro trends that you're seeing and Alan said something about a lower inventory to sales ratio being one of them. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in the macro that makes you more positive going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in terms of the current holiday season, we took our estimate of the year-over-year up from about 3% to about 3.3% or so, much better than 2009 and 2008. I'm sitting right here across from Gene Huang, our very esteemed economist, so he'll jump in here if I get off base. We've taken our U.S. estimate for calendar '11 up from about 2.6% to 2.9%, calendar '12 to 3.2%. As Alan mentioned, the inventory to sales ratio has bled down. So when we come into Chinese New Year, I'll be surprised if you don't see a relatively strong restocking from the industrial base in Asia.</p>
          <p>And I think one of the things that we're very bullish on, as I mentioned in my remarks, is the continued growth in these emerging markets where we're very, very strong and our network is the biggest in the world, and as the emerging markets go from their current status of world GDP up over 50% by 2013, that's a huge growth opportunity for us. It's why the 777s are so important because it let's you eclectically connect these various regions of the world and all of our regions are growing very strongly. And as we've also reported, we made a couple of important acquisitions in the last quarter, one we just announced this morning in Mexico. As I said, we're very excited about that and one we announced in India a little while ago. So the momentum that's underway for all of those reasons lead us to be positive.</p>
          <p>From the internal standpoint, we've talked about a lot of individual line items and so forth, but as both Alan and I tried to say at the Investors and Lenders Meeting and put up some charts, these shock absorbers that we've designed worked perfectly in cushioning the downturn for the shareowners and they've been a retardant on the way back up. But as we go into the second half of this year, we're essentially normalized is what it amounts to. So as we roll into the second half of the year and into FY '12, we will have a lot of momentum, and that's why we've just said, as plainly as we can say, margins will go up. Cash flows will increase and our EPS should increase. And of course, we'll presumably continue to give you guidance on that as each quarter comes out, although we've got a couple of Directors wondering why we give guidance at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just add a little bit to that, the inventory to sales ratio, part of the reason it's down to 1.2 is because it can be because of networks like FedEx that allow you to skip intermediate distribution and go direct to the point of consumption. And the market is coming our way on a global basis on that and that is part of our momentum and part of what's so exciting around here.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everybody. If I could just talk a little bit about acquisition, I mean, clearly, you're starting to make more in the emerging markets, but they're all on a smaller nature. Is that the plan to make smaller acquisitions in the emerging market areas and build up over time or is there anything on the plate that might make you want to do something larger?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As a matter of policy, we don't comment on corporate development matters. And if you're interested in the criteria that we apply when considering acquisitions, you can listen to the comments we made at the Investors and Lenders Conference regarding culture and return on investment and strategic fit. And I think I'll just leave it at that. The acquisitions that we made are perfect. They fit those criteria. We're very excited about them expanding our network and reach. And they are small and bite sized. And it's one thing we do well is we know how to integrate these. For example, ANC in the UK is one of my favorite examples. So we'll keep you posted as we have something to say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions, Fred, Alan, if I interpret your comments, I guess this is probably for Dave. It sounds to me like when you were talking about Asia, you said the market for shipping was a little bit slower, and you were a little bit disappointed with the IP volumes, but it looked like the IP Freight was actually pretty strong. Was this more of a mix issue or was this that the whole market for shipping was a little lighter than you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me comment on this, and then have Dave Bronczek deal with greater specificity. As Alan mentioned, as we came out through the summer where you had this tremendous year-over-year increase as restocking continued, we anticipated that the growth going into the peak season would be slightly higher than it ended up being. But the growth is still very substantial. And remember, the incremental margins on that traffic, particularly in this quarter, as we reached that plateau that I mentioned of these normalization of costs as the shock absorbers are reabsorbed, it's very sensitive because you're right on the bubble there. But as I mentioned a moment ago, the, the holiday season is very strong, much stronger than 2009 and 2008.</p>
          <p>So that means by definition, with that inventory to sales ratio that Alan gave you and with a peak season, what we're seeing, as we go into Chinese New Year, it will be very surprising if the strength of the International traffic flows isn't pretty good. And part of that is why we have our optimism. So a little bit under what we thought it would be at peak season, but what's happened at peak season leads us to more optimism on a go-forward basis. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Yeah, Fred is right on all counts. Our International volumes, as I mentioned, start off around the world, achieved record level volumes. And Asia-Pacific had record volumes. We had anticipated possibly a little bit higher growth rates based on the trends of the last couple of quarters. With that being said, we have tremendous quarters to compare ourselves against from Q2 last year, as an example. But you have to look underneath all of these covers, and we had 29% growth on International pounds. So we're very bullish, very optimistic and I think Fred and Alan and I have talked about this issue. Our International business is performing very, very well.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. A couple of quick questions on fuel and one on the charges, on the fuel, can you tell us what the difference was or how much of an added cost headwind versus your initial guidance came from fuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd just say it's part of the three that I gave you. And we're not going to break it down. I mean, there was very little net impact from fuel, negligible impact to the quarter from fuel. And I expected it actually to have a more positive impact. But, as I said, with the cost rising here, we have that lag effect. So it, it should, provided it stays where it is, provide us a little bit of benefit in the second half more than I thought. That would be the case when we gave you the original guidance. So they all three were the same. It was the fuel, the slightly less than expected IP and the variable compensation with the higher profit in the second half, all about equal.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, just one quick question here for Fred. Fred, in your travels in China, do you ever hear from the Chinese an expression of interest in having for themselves an Express operation or are they satisfied having FedEx and their partners like that provide the Express in and out of the country? How do they think about that? What do you hear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will make a couple of comments and then ask Dave, which &#x2013; who's probably even more tuned into it than I am. First of all, the Chinese have some good Express companies inside China, which Dave can talk about. So it's not as if they don't have domestic competitors. And they are very active in the International Air Cargo business with all of their major carriers. So they are active in that regard. On the other side of the coin, I think the Chinese government has understood for a long time that FedEx and our competitors, but particularly FedEx, has provided an enormously useful service for a Chinese industry to access the rest of the world with their products. And that's just not my speculation. I've actually heard Jiang Zemin say it to our Board of Directors when he had us over several years ago.</p>
          <p>So our commitment to China is very large. We built this enormous hub in Guangzhou, which is growing mightily and is the centerpiece of our AsiaOne network. The 777 in large measure was bought because it gives us unique capabilities out of China, but I don't doubt that China, whose economy is now I guess the second largest in the world, they'll have participants in probably almost every sector and certainly inside China and within Asia. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In fact, we were at a dinner last night with the Chinese Ambassador in Washington, D.C. and he actually, unsolicited by us, said thanks to FedEx and people like FedEx, it's making China more successful, more prosperous, and we were a very good corporate citizen. And of course, as Fred pointed out, our Guangzhou hub in China has been fabulous. And so I think that on all accounts, that -- I think that that's correct, that FedEx does provide those services. There are Chinese operators out there, Shrung Fung is the local domestic one, and of course China Southern, China Eastern that all provide services. But of course, like I mentioned before, our core international growth has come from Asia-Pacific, led by China.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, just two questions. A quick follow-up on International Priority, would you guys release any of the actual numbers on Asia or Europe, volume growth in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't release that &#x2013; the sector, specific things for competitive reasons, but I can say that we're growing in all regions and our U.S. export is strong, our Trans-Pacific is strong, our Trans-Atlantic is strong, Latin America is strong, Intra-Europe is strong, Trans-border is strong. So all of our International sectors are growing, some more than others. And obviously Asia, in general, and China in particular, has become the manufacturing center of the world. Mike's going to give you some more color on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got strong double-digit growth rates out of APAC on a volume basis. We've got near double-digit growth rates out of EMEA and Latin America, and we're very happy with our growth rates on a U.S. export basis, which are above our domestic growth rate. So that'll just give you a flavor for where we are. I mean, we're very pleased with our performance and of course, the revenue numbers are very strong as well, because of the good job we're doing on managing yields, so very good trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.S. export's very important for us, as you can imagine, given the size of the imports that the U.S. have and U.S. exports are growing. That's a great opportunity for us going forward, because we have some space as we exit the U.S., particularly to Asia, on our planes. Things like chemicals and drilling equipment and steel-making materials and material handling, and all that stuff that's made in the U.S. that goes to Asia is very important. And as that continues to grow, we get really good margins on that because we already have the fixed cost network up and we have space available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to put it in perspective on a U.S. basis, I mean FedEx U.S. export is substantially larger than our next two competitors combined. So I mean, we've got a very strong position and very solid growth rates.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just two quick questions, one on dimensional weight and then one a little follow-up on the guidance. First on the dimensional weight charges, Alan, you mentioned that you think they're going to &#x2013; you're going to start pushing those forward in the second half. Can you talk a little bit about the percentage of revenue that's impacted by dimensional weight changes and how you think over time that could impact yield?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Mike. That's pretty hard to predict because one of the things that we talked about at the Investor and Lenders Meeting is we actually want to work with customers to minimize the amount of packages that get the dimensional weight charge, because it's greater handling costs for us. Many of these packages have to be handled in a more manual fashion, so one of our objectives here is to actually minimize the percentage of packages that receive the dimensional weight charge. I don't see a significant change in trends in the near term, but in the long-term, hopefully customers will be more efficient in their packaging going forward, so they don't have to receive the higher dim charges. But they're being well received. Our sales team is doing a great job positioning the changes in the dimensional weight, just as they did last year with International. So we don't see any significant pushback regarding the dim changes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. On one of the comments I believe in your prepared remarks, you were talking about your yield strategy and that you were more comfortable with your yields in terms of where they were on an absolute level on the Ground side versus maybe the Express side. Can you talk about what that means relative to how you approach the customer on pricing? Do you have a differentiated thought in terms of we need more rates on the Express side versus Ground? And how do you balance that mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Mike Glenn. I mean, you have to understand, our sales team does a fabulous job in a consultative selling role. They go in and work, especially with our larger customers, to deliver value to those customers. In doing so, it is our objective to put the right traffic in the right network and to make sure we're compensated accordingly. So there's no one single strategy, especially as it relates to larger customers. We go in. We look at a customer. We look at the modes that they use and most of our larger customers use all of our modes of transportation. We see where the opportunities are. We make assessments about where we need rate increases for those individual customers, and then we negotiate those accordingly. So that's the biggest driver right now, in addition to the annual rate increases, to the yield improvement that we have seen, and that's especially true at Freight.</p>
          <p>We have a tremendous amount of pricing science and analytical horsepower that we apply to this. So &#x2013; and we make these judgments collectively as a management team about the amount of increase that we need to take to maximize the return to FedEx. So there's no one set formula here. I mean, this is a pricing science exercise is the best way I could describe it. But we have a process that is working very well and delivering significant improvements in yields and we're going to continue that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of that process, and this is the steely-eyed financial guy talking now, is we have fabulous margins and fabulous return on invested capital at Ground. We are pushing hard to get Express to double-digit margins. And so yield improvements at Express, particularly domestic, are vital for us get to those numbers. So yes, it is more important for us to improve Express domestic yields, and that's part of what Mike was mentioning. I mean, we're willing to walk away from some business there, or put it into the Ground or SmartPost network, as appropriate. But we must get higher yields at domestic Express, and we are in the process of doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The one thing I would add is the value of the Ground service that we are delivering, the faster network, the higher levels of reliability, the choices available in our Home Delivery network allow us to go in and command a higher price. So that's why when I say that you're seeing strong improvements in base rate and discounts, we're able to deliver on those because we have a  fabulous Ground service and our sales team is doing a great job of presenting that value to our customers. So it's a great combination and it's working very well for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I appreciate that. My question on the guidance was, it seems like you have greater conviction and visibility into guidance six months from now for fiscal fourth quarter than you did for this quarter or for next quarter, and you talked about on a quarter a lot of costs that are going to start coming out which you talked about at the Investor Conference for maintenance and other things. But I'm guessing you knew that when you gave the guidance a quarter ago. So what's changed in the last quarter or so that's given you more guidance out six months from now? Is it just the general, the economy picking up and confidence from the customer? Is it the timing of fuel? Is it you're seeing things happen faster on the LTL side, just want to get a sense for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, I'd say yes to all that. The reason that we gave you such a wide range for the second quarter, and we did come in inside that range, was because we knew the volatility on the margins and profitability of IP and we were worried about fuel price spikes because we were starting to see our traffic pick up. Both those things came to fruition. The third quarter, weather is always a huge factor and we've been hammered, hammered with weather already as people are still suffering in the Northeast and Northern Midwest. And those expenses are very, very difficult to predict. So always the third quarter is probably our most volatile and also post holiday season shipping.</p>
          <p>You get back into the spring, our seasonally strongest quarter, we start to see with more confidence what we think our traffic is going to be. We're hoping that fuel price doesn't spike from here. That's part of our guidance, as well as last year we started to have significant accruals for bonuses in the third and fourth quarter that -- for the whole year that we didn't have in the first half, and so the year-over-year AIC accruals won't be as high. And so that gives us more confidence as well, but it's really simply the volatility on the margin right now in a very high growth environment, and as the percentage starts to mitigate, we have a lot more confidence. That's really the long-winded answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, this is Fred Smith again. I said this again at the Investors and Lenders Meeting, and I don't think we're getting this across. These shock absorbers in the second quarter they reached normalization and it's right on the bubble there. So as traffic goes up, a lot of money goes to the bottom line, a lot of money goes into AIC and it goes right back and forth there when it's on that bubble. But as you get into the third and particularly into the fourth quarter, as Alan just said, those costs are now normalized year-over-year. So you don't have that volatility right on the expense line. So I hope I'm making that clear, but that's what the issue is.</p>
