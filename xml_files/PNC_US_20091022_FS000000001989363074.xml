Participating on our call this morning will be PNC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rohr; and Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>The following statements contain forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ possibly, materially from those that we anticipate in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of factors. Those factors include items described in today's conference call, press release and related materials and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings and other various SEC filings available on our corporate website. These statements speak only as of October 22, 2009, and PNC undertakes no obligation to you update them. We also provide details of reconciliations to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures we may discuss.</p>
          <p>These details may be found in today's conference call, press release, and our financial supplement, in our presentation slides and appendix and in various SEC reports and other documents. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com in the Investor Relations section. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. In these challenging times I'm very pleased with the performance of our business model. In the third quarter we had strong revenue performance, reduced cost, and we continued most importantly to grow clients. We also began to see signs that the rate of credit deterioration has eased.</p>
          <p>Thinking about the economy, certainly appears that the economy has stabilized. Now, while we expect unemployment to continue to increase through year end, we are seeing some signs of tangible recovery.</p>
          <p>When we look at our balance sheet, we believe that it's well-positioned. In the third quarter we further increased our capital, and we strengthened our loan loss reserves. And we're very pleased with our deposit franchise. We remain core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 87% as of September 30. Our bank liquidity is excellent, and we've been able to access the markets in order to fund our holding company obligations.</p>
          <p>Our revenue and expense performance for the quarter resulted in pre-tax, pre-provision earnings of $1.7 billion, well in excess of our credit costs of approximately 900 million.</p>
          <p>Now these are encouraging signs but also encouraging is that the pace of our credit quality deterioration may have eased. As a result, PNC reported third-quarter earnings of 559 million or $1 per common diluted share. In the quarter, the impact of the TARP preferred dividends was $95 million or $0.21 per share. Year-to-date earnings were 1.3 billion or $2.17 per common diluted share.</p>
          <p>Now this is a very solid performance we believe, and I am very pleased with our results. It's important to note we've been profitable in every quarter since the economic downturn began in the middle of 2007 other than the fourth quarter of 2008 and only then because of the conforming provision we took for National City that quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our customers, we continue to see strong product sales activity in the third quarter. Our client retention trends are strong in all markets as reflected in our solid revenue performance. We see meaningful product sales opportunities in legacy National City markets and results should continue to improve after we complete the customer conversions.</p>
          <p>In Retail Banking our focus is to win in the payment space and in the third quarter checking account relationships grew by 4% on an annualized basis. Active online banking increased by 12% annualized, and online bill payment customers rose by 16% annualized. This growth was driven in part by investments in our brand and innovative products such as virtual wallet.</p>
          <p>Those gains excluded the impact of the required divesture of 61 branches with $4 billion in deposits that we completed by early September. Corporate and Institutional Banking had a strong third quarter as lower credit costs benefited the results. We saw good results as we are increasing cross-selling of our products and services to legacy National City customers. And we continue to be a leader in serving our business clients. Through the first nine months PNC again ranked first nationally in the number of traditional middle market loan syndications arranged.</p>
          <p>Our Asset Management Group which includes wealth management, saw its assets under management increase to $104 billion at September 30 as a result of higher equity market values and improved net flows. Client retention and satisfaction rates continue to be strong and the business pipeline for the fourth quarter is accelerating.</p>
          <p>Residential mortgage banking performed well in the third quarter primarily driven by lower expenses. In November we will rebrand our mortgage business as PNC Mortgage. And this is more than a name change, instead it reflects the strategy of a new leadership we put in place at the beginning of the year. PNC Mortgage will be a top ten retail mortgage lender offering mortgage products as a means to deepen customer relationships consistent with our moderate risk profile. This line of business also provides high quality assets for investment.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Investment Services, asset based fees increased in line with the improvements in the equity markets and client growth. We are seeing the benefits from expense reduction efforts that were initiated in previous quarters, and Global Investment Services continues to have a strong sales pipeline, and I am pleased with the relative performance of this business.</p>
          <p>BlackRock you saw reported a quarterly profit of more than $300 million in the third quarter, rallies of equity and fixed income markets along with improved investor sentiments drove the improved results. BlackRock also announced that its pending acquisition of Barclays Global Investors is on target to close on December 1. This will provide PNC with additional capital upon closing assuming BlackRock's current stock price.</p>
          <p>Our distressed asset portfolio is focused on maximizing the value of our distressed loans. We made good progress in disclosing &#x2013; in disposing of foreclosed assets through the sale of more than 1,200 properties in the third quarter, bringing the total number of properties disposed to almost 4,200 for the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to credit availability, PNC remains committed to meeting the credit needs of qualified customers. Through the end of the third quarter, refinances under the Home Affordable refinance program totaled $242 million. Our servicing unit sent out more than 60,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program.</p>
          <p>On the commercial side we continue to reach out to small businesses and corporations. Despite slow demand, we originated more than $900 million in small business loans in just the third quarter and we continue to be a leader in loan syndications arranging more than $9 billion in business loans for the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the integration of National City. I am very pleased with our efforts here, particularly the teamwork we are seeing from our legacy National City and PNC colleagues. Together our employees are working very hard on this integration, and I appreciate their ongoing efforts and their enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>We're just a few weeks away from our first wave of customer conversions which will involve National City business and consumer customers in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and Florida. Customers in those areas have been contacted, and provided with the details on how their accounts will be converted to PNC products and services, and we conducted successful mock conversions in September and October. The remaining customer conversion waves will run through June 2010, six months faster than our original estimate, and our goal is a seamless transition for customers. And I believe we will reach that mark given the investments we are making and our solid preparation.</p>
          <p>The tremendous leverage we expected from this transaction is having a positive effect on our results. One of the reasons is that we're well on our way to achieving our cost saving goal. On an annualized basis we have already captured more than $800 million in cost savings against our two year goal of $1.2 billion and we're confident that we will exceed that 1.2 billion at this point.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of National City was accretive to our year-to-date earnings, and we expect it to be accretive for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the balance sheet. Critical to our success is transitioning to a higher quality balance sheet, and we made significant progress towards that in the first nine months of the year. We believe our balance sheet as shown on slide four is well-positioned and continues to differentiate us. The size of our balance sheet has declined since the end of the second quarter. We reduced high cost deposits, completed required brands divestitures and have seen loans decline due to reduced originations as well as lower utilization levels, pay downs and charge-offs.</p>
          <p>However, our balance sheet reflects improved funding which Rick will discuss in a couple of minutes. On the deposit side, total deposits are down $9 billion since year end. However, the mix is important. We continued to grow our core deposit relationships. In the first three quarters of the year our transaction deposits increased by $11 billion. Now those gains were more than offset by the reduction of our higher rate brokered and retail CDs.</p>
          <p>Now the greatest challenge we see is on the asset side. Loan demand continues to be soft across the country although the opportunities we do see are providing much better returns for the risks we are taking. As a result, loans decreased by almost $15 billion since year end despite originating more than $83 billion of loans and commitments through the first nine months of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now with the combination of PNC and National City, we have a large client base and more than $16 billion in annualized revenues. In the third quarter our ability to grow revenue and effectively manage expenses continued to generate pre-tax pre-provision earnings that more than covered our credit costs. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was nearly $12 billion. Our pre-tax pre-provision earnings of 4.5 billion were more than $1.6 billion above our credit costs providing a solid contribution to the increase in our capital ratios.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter we delivered $4 billion in revenue, and we continued to focus on expense control. For the quarter our non interest expenses of nearly 2.4 billion were down 10% on a linked quarter basis. By continuing to manage the revenue &#x2013; expense relationship effectively our pre-tax pre-provision earnings for the quarter were 1.7 billion or $750 million more than the cost of credit.</p>
          <p>Now, Rick will provide you with more detail around our third quarter results beginning with our revenue performance. Rick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I am going to focus on the key drivers of revenue and expense, our loan book and reserve levels, the repositioning of our securities portfolio and our capital growth. I will also provide you with some additional guidance around the sustainability of our strong third quarter performance. Let me begin with net interest income which was 55% of total revenue.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet produced net interest income of more than $2.2 billion which was up slightly from the second quarter. The ongoing transitioning of the balance sheet resulted in a net interest margin of 3.76%, 16 basis points higher than last quarter.</p>
          <p>The largest benefit to our net interest income was on the funding side where the deposit rate declined from 1.25% in the second quarter to 1.04% in the third quarter as we continue to reprice our deposit funding base. And the rate on borrowed funds declined 40 basis points due to debt maturities. We expect the funding rate to continue to improve in the fourth quarter given that we have about 7 billion of higher rate CDs maturing that we believe we can reprice at much lower rates while retaining a large part of the core relationship based accounts.</p>
          <p>In addition, the balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter was highly asset sensitive with a duration of equity of negative two years, giving us substantial opportunities to invest in the future.</p>
          <p>Noninterest income of 1.8 billion represented 45% of total revenue and was also up slightly from the second quarter. These sources of revenue are primarily customer related and remain high quality and diversified. As expected, Residential Mortgage fees were down linked quarter driven by less refinancing activity as mortgage rates increased.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect our net interest income to be relatively flat and our net interest margin to improve as we capture the remaining benefit from repricing our high cost deposits and redeploying some of the balance sheet liquidity into securities portfolio. We would also expect client related noninterest income to continue to improve as equity markets have improved, and we integrate our product offerings.</p>
          <p>Now let me take a moment to talk about our focus on expense management. As Jim said, our third quarter noninterest expenses of nearly 2.4 billion were down 10% linked quarter. Excluding the FDIC special assessment in the second quarter, the reversal of a portion of the charge for the Visa indemnification and ongoing integration costs, expenses were down $44 million on a linked quarter basis reflecting additional integration savings of 60 million, bringing the total savings for the quarter to 200 million, and year-to-date savings related to the acquisition to more than $460 million.</p>
          <p>The right side of the chart highlights some of the actions we have taken to achieve our integration cost savings and reflects our focus on continuous improvement that is an integral part of our corporate culture.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect savings to exceed 660 million, well in excess of our 2009 goal of 600 million. We remain confident that we will exceed our 1.2 billion annualized cost savings target by mid-2011. We're in the process of finalizing the 2010 budget now, and given our progress to date I expect to raise our cost savings target in January of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the current economy clearly the focus is on credit quality, so let's take a look at our loan portfolio on slide eight. Our loan portfolio represents only 59% of our total assets which is at the lower end of the peer group. Now let me begin with our core portfolio which excludes our distressed assets. Overall the core portfolio of 141 billion is diverse, relatively balanced with 41% from consumer lending, and 59% from commercial lending. It is primarily in our geographic markets and the majority is collateralized.</p>
          <p>Our core commercial portfolio of more than 62 billion is primarily comprised of diversified middle market relationships in our region. It is well balanced with no concentrations in any one sector. The two largest sectors are manufacturing and retail with a combined total of 20 billion. Both are holding up relatively well in the current economy. The greatest pressure we saw in the third quarter was in the financial services sector where NPLs increased by 140 million driven by two large non-bank credits.</p>
          <p>We have already sold 50% of one of these exposures at $0.90 on the dollar. Our exposure to commercial real estate sector of 9% of total assets is among the lowest concentration in our peer group. When you exclude the 3.2 billion of residential construction loans and our distressed portfolio, our core real estate outstandings of 21 billion is only 13% of our total loan portfolio. This core portfolio includes 8 billion of commercial mortgages which are performing well. The remaining core commercial real estate book of 13 billion is primarily real estate projects with average outstandings of less than 10 million per loan that are well diversified in terms of asset classes and geography.</p>
          <p>While the environment remains challenging, and we expect further losses in this book, we believe they will be manageable for the following reasons; first, we don't see the overbuilding as we did in previous cycles. Second, we believe the underwriting for legacy PNC was more rigorous than many of our peers, and third, our acquired loans have been marked and are well reserved.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the consumer side. Core home equity loans and residential real estate make up more than 71% of our consumer &#x2013; core consumer lending portfolio. The remainder of 16.5 billion is primarily comprised of education loans, credit card and auto loans and all are performing as expected in this environment. Both our core home equity and core residential mortgage portfolios are relatively high quality and overall are performing well especially in comparison to many of our peers. Net charge-offs for core home equity loans were 52 basis points in the quarter and in the same period they were 50 basis points for core residential mortgage loans.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our Distressed Assets, this portfolio had 19.7 billion of loans at the end of the third quarter. And page 19 of our financial supplement describes the makeup of this portfolio. The Distressed portfolio includes 7.8 billion of impaired loans that were marked down by 37% at September 30.</p>
          <p>In other words, when the allowance for loan losses of more than 900 million associated with these loans &#x2013; this segment is included, the entire distressed portfolio is being carried at about 75% of the outstanding balance. The goal of our distressed loans is straightforward. We to want optimize the economic value of these assets and I am confident with the tools and the talent to meet this objective and so far the loans assigned to this segment are performing as we expected.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize our total credit book and its performance. First, overall past due loans appear to be stabilizing, and while non-performing loans were up in the third quarter, the growth rate is lower than previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Second, as expected, we continued to see stress in commercial real estate, and the mortgage sectors, but the pace of the deterioration has been manageable.</p>
          <p>Third, net charge-offs in the third quarter are down 18% to 650 million compared to the linked quarter charge-offs of 795 million. Our allowance for loan losses is $4.8 billion or nearly 3% of total loans versus a current annualized charge-off rate of 1.59%. Even still, we expect to continue to add to reserves in the fourth quarter as we project our fourth quarter provision to look similar to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And fourth, the fair value marks our impaired loans stand at 6.6 billion at the end of the quarter. This is 37% of impaired loans outstanding. This means we have a total of 11.4 billion or nearly 7% of our loans outstandings in reserves and fair value marks. We believe this loss coverage is substantial and appropriate.</p>
          <p>Slide nine looks at our investment securities portfolio. This 54 billion portfolio represented 20% of our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. Our goal is to have a securities portfolio that consists of high quality well diversified assets. Since the end of 2008 we have made considerable progress in reducing the risk of this portfolio. We have enhanced our investments in lower risk asset classes by increasing our purchases of treasuries and government agency securities. Where opportunities existed to sell non-agency securities at a gain to cover the cost of our OTTI charges, we did. We also saw improvements in credit related OTTI charges from 55 million in the second quarter to 129 million in the third quarter and we expect this trend of improvement to continue.</p>
          <p>We have stated before that the underlying assets in the portfolio are high quality. The unrealized pre-tax losses on this portfolio improved by 1.6 billion in the third quarter, and has improved by 3.2 billion from year end primarily due to better market conditions in both agency and non-agency securities. As you can see, we are recapturing a substantial portion of the market valuations and this has a positive impact on tangible common equity.</p>
          <p>And we continue to see capital as a key differentiator and effective capital management is an integral part of our business model. Since year end 2008 we have increased common equity by $3.5 billion to 21 billion due to retained earnings and the reduction of the marks on our securities portfolio.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 10, we have strengthened our capital ratios throughout the year. As of September 30, Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 5.5% and our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 10.8% estimated. These increases have been driven primarily by growing retained earnings and reductions in risk-weighted assets. Now, keep in mind that these ratios already reflect the impaired loan marks of approximately 6.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter. The losses related to these marks are behind us.</p>
          <p>We see further enhancements to these ratios on the horizon. First, we expect fourth quarter results will again be accretive to capital. Second, unless loan demand strengthens, I think we will have modest balance sheet contraction reducing risk-weighted assets. And third, in addition to executing our business model, if the BlackRock BGI transition closes this year, we would expect a significant after-tax gain of over 700 million based on the current BlackRock share price, which would add an additional 30 basis points to our Tier 1 ratios.</p>
          <p>Our position on TARP repayment has not changed. Our plan is to repay TARP as soon as appropriate and in a shareholder friendly manner subject to approval by our banking regulators. As you can see, we are building capital that should allow us to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p>As I've said before, our goal is simply to execute on our business model. As you can see, we're making strong progress on each step in our plan.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. Slide 11 is a scorecard we use to measure our progress as we integrate National City and apply PNC's business model to our new franchise. You saw this at the Barclays presentation. These goals are not new. Instead, these goals represent where we were prior to the recession and prior to our acquisition of National City. And they reflect our efforts as we work to transition our balance sheet and position the company for future growth, which we were prior to either one of those items.</p>
          <p>As evidenced by our third quarter performance, I believe we are making good progress against these targets. We now have a large client base and more than $16 billion in annualized revenues, and we believe there are three reasons why we can build on these opportunities.</p>
          <p>First, as Rick disclosed and discussed, with the marks we have taken on the impaired loans, we believe our credit cost will decline faster than others as the economy begins to recover. Our third quarter results indicate the rate of credit deterioration has eased.</p>
          <p>Second, we expect to exceed the $1.2 billion in annualized integration expense savings. We made significant progress in the third quarter, and we're confident that we can achieve that objective.</p>
          <p>And finally, the acquisition of National City provides us with a larger distribution platform for cross-selling our products and services. And we have just begun to see increased revenue across the franchise in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, improving markets should further enhance income from our fee-based businesses and our asset sensitive balance sheet provides us with a great deal of flexibility. Our return on assets in the third quarter was 0.81%, making our year-to-date ROA 0.62. We obviously have higher aspirations than that, and as the economy recovers and once we are able to repay TARP, I believe we should be able to deliver returns consistent with our historical performance in excess of 1.3% on assets.</p>
          <p>Now, as I reflect on the first nine months of this year, I am very pleased with how we performed during this difficult economy. Our proven business model continues to demonstrate its effectiveness. Clearly, we have an established framework for success. The economy is beginning to show signs of stabilization, and we're seeing signs that the pace of credit quality deterioration may be easing.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of National City continues to exceed our expectations, and we're ready to begin the first wave of the client conversions early next month. We've got a very strong team, and we're focused on execution. Clearly we believe our enterprise will create tremendous opportunities for shareholder value as we continue to build a great company.</p>
          <p>With that, we're pleased to take your questions. Operator, could you give our participants the instructions, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Can you go into a little bit more detail about your NIM, I mean, it was a very strong NIM, very strong growth and I believe you guided to relatively flat NIM growth. But what exactly are the benefits coming through on the Nat City purchase accounting marks? I think the Street has been very confused about what exactly the accretion is and does &#x2013; do we have to back anything out going into next year? I know you said it should be strong going into next quarter, but what about 2010? Can we expect this same type of performance on the NIM or will some around it be backed out because the accretion impact will be lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're actually getting more benefit than the purchase accounting attributes to us. Because when we did the marks on the deposits, it was about a 2% mark. We're actually repricing all of those at below 1.8%. So we're actually doing better than those marks, but we're also repricing a lot of PNC retail CDs as well, probably coming down in the fourth quarter from an average of 3% down to again less than 1.8%.</p>
          <p>So we're not giving guidance going forward, but I will say that we do have a substantial number of deposits which will also reprice in 2010. So, yeah, I do expect the benefit to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can you real quick address the marks? What is your average marks, I don't know if you disclosed it or not in your nonperforming asset portfolio. When you move that stuff in what is the overall portfolio of the marks and then what was the new stuff you brought in? What type of marks did you put on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we've got approximately 6.6 billion of marks on the impaired loans that we have. That brings that overall balance down to about $11 billion in total. So it would be about 17 billion pre the marks and on the rest of the portfolio we've got 4.8 billion worth of allowance. If you add the two together, you get close to 7% of loss coverage on our total credit exposure.</p>

          <p>I meant more in the sense of your nonperforming assets like when it goes from delinquent into your NPA, that's where the bulk of the charge-offs are coming from, am I correct? And most companies are telling us they're marking them somewhere between 0.65 and $0.75. And I was just wondering what is the overall marks inside the nonperforming asset portfolio and then what were the new stuff that came in this quarter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>When a loan goes to nonperforming, you don't take a mark on it. You would set aside a reserve for it, but you wouldn't take a mark on it. So there is a whole range of different types of nonperforming assets whether they're collateralized or uncollateralized, so it's a &#x2013; when it goes into OREO or the impaired portfolio that we took on when we bought National City, those are the marks that Rick is talking about in the impaired portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Okay. I'm just saying most banks have told us like our NPAs are marked down like to $0.65 on the dollar even be it &#x2013; like that's the reserve set aside for it or not. And I'm just wondering if, I guess if you have those similar type of numbers. If not, I can just take it offline.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just first as far as TARP, you're still a TARP bank. What are you thinking about there and what would be the financial impact if you were to pay back TARP? How do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not in a rush to pay back TARP simply because I don't &#x2013; although the recession is technically over, it doesn't feel like the recession is over and we expect housing prices and unemployment to continue &#x2013; unemployment to continue to increase and housing prices to continue to decline somewhat. So we're still relatively conservative in terms of the economy, although we have seen some stabilization for sure.</p>
          <p>I think the issue for us is to pay it back over a reasonable period of time. I would expect we will be beginning conversations with the regulators to pay it back perhaps over the next 15 months, and I think we'll do it in a shareholder-friendly manner. We've built these capital ratios up and we will continue to do so as Rick mentioned.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Tier 1 ratio that many peers were able to reduce their capital ratio to when they paid it back, that was around 9%. We're at 10.8 right now. When we get the BlackRock gain that will be worth 30 basis points, taking us over 11 on &#x2013; presuming it closes on December 1 as scheduled. We expect to be continuing to build our capital ratios in the quarter. The balance sheet continues to reduce. We've got a $20 billion distressed book that we have approximately $2 billion worth of capital supporting that. We wouldn't expect that to be around forever.</p>
          <p>So, I think we'll be able to pay it back in a shareholder-friendly manner without having to do some huge capital raise like other people have had to do. So I think we'll be really conservative in that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just on that question regarding HAMP, I think the concern that some folks in the industry have is that the recidivism is not very good and that shadow inventory in housing is building, and this is going to hit banks and your institution as you move into 2010. And I'm just wondering if you could give us some color as to the modifications that you've done so far to date, how those have been going? I'm sure you're watching them very closely. Could you give us some color as to how you expect to deal with borrowers who might not be able to make the payments long-term and give us some sense as to what you could potentially do to manage through that process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Betsy. We've done about 9,000 modifications so far and about 4,000 of those have been under HAMP and the others non-HAMP type programs. It's had an impact on about 1.7 billion overall of loans that we have.</p>
          <p>But you're right. I think there is a question around how successful are those going to be over time. Our rate is &#x2013; in terms of success is pretty consistent with the industry. I think the industry is about 54% or right around that same level. So you're absolutely right. I think over time as we work through here, there will be more assets, certainly moving into the OREO portfolio, and that's why we've been very active in terms of selling them out and have sold out over 4,200 properties year-to-date. So we have been building up resources there to be prepared for exactly what you're anticipating.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Ed Najarian with ISI group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. I have two questions. First, Rick, in prior quarters you were laying out the dollar amount of the accretable yield from the purchase accounting marks back through net interest income. Could you give us that number for the third quarter and remind us again what it was in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the second quarter I gave you a number related to deposits in particular of about 253 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That number is down about 60 million, Ed. But again, all of that value is coming to us through the repricing of the deposits and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that accretable yield number is down about 60 million from 253 million in 2Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The deposit piece, that's correct, yeah. And again all of that comes back to us because we've repriced those CDs at rates below the 2% mark that created that purchase accounting accretion. So the loan numbers haven't changed dramatically at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Weren't you previously giving us a bigger number that I guess included the asset side and the deposit side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were, Ed, but we got too much confusion I think in our discussions about how people should treat those. And the bottom line is we're able to grow the margin because we're able to actually achieve those values, and the detail wasn't adding any help to the story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Rick...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I think &#x2013; I guess the message you're giving is to sort of forget about that old line of thinking and just sort of go with your new view in terms of a sort of a stable or up margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that you saw the margin go up 16 basis points from the second to the third quarter. I think you can expect a similar improvement going from the third to the fourth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you would turn, Ed, if you get &#x2013; I know it's a busy morning, but on page five of the supplement it describes really how the funding costs have come down on the deposit side, and that's very consistent with Rick's comments. We took the purchase accounting mark to 2%, and now we rewriting them at 1.80 and 1.70, so we're actually getting more than the accretive &#x2013; of the accretion. We're realizing more than the accretion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, and then my second question just has to do with the $314 million that you have classified as other noninterest income. I think there was a line in there, I can't find it right now, but talked something about net asset valuation improvements included in that number. I guess, if you could maybe give us some context on that number and if there were anything that you would regard as nonrecurring gains within that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very well diversified. I think you see some modest private equity gains; I'm talking less than $20 million. Some modest trading gains, number like 30. So you'd just asset values BOLI income, which we have every quarter improving in value. Modest amounts of gains on sale distributed across five or six books. So nothing there substantial, Ed.</p>
          <p>I think what you're seeing, we also had &#x2013; we did have one item which was the BlackRock gain and the fact they did raise capital in anticipation of the BGI deal, so we had 29 million on that. But these are relatively small, very diversified. I think what you saw in the second and third quarters is a pretty stable performance that you can continue to expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not unrealistic, Rick, in your mind to think about that line item being in the $300 million range in future quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're buying primarily agencies and treasuries, and we're buying very short dated. I think we feel at the moment it's important to keep liquidity and stay asset sensitive at the time. We think as we get into the new year, I think as unemployment maybe peaks, the economy starts to come back a little bit, the government stops buying assets off the market in terms of both residential mortgage as well as the treasuries and they finish up their programs, then they think maybe rates will go a bit higher and we'll have an opportunity to invest a little longer term.</p>
          <p>And also just keeping a lot of liquidity I think was just important at this moment, we think the economy has started to improve. But we want to be cautious not to be overly confident about where the economy goes at this stage. So we're investing in very short dated assets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on Ed's question. Can you explain to us why we &#x2013; some of us may have been sort of thinking about the purchase accounting accretion wrong? Are those &#x2013; I think you had told us as of the second quarter that you had accrued 1.1 billion? Should we think about that as sort of staying in your lending revenues going forward or are we thinking about it wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, we accrued 1.1 billion over the first two quarters, but the second quarter was much lower than the first. It was actually down by 130, and again I would say that the third quarter will be down again. But it's all driven by deposit accretion and all that deposit accretion is being captured through the repricing of the CD portfolios at National City.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if I could, one of the things that's important is that when we talk about accretion, people perceive that it's accounting. I think what we're saying is that the cash being received and paid out is now in a &#x2013; the benefit of it because of the declining rates and the way we've been able to manage our funding costs is in excess of the accounting assumption that we made at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>So the realization is very real in terms of cash, lower cash expense for our deposits, so that's why I think Rick has pointed out that it's just in the system now because we are recognizing it in a very real way in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Can you give us some color on the National City business that used to be called the rest of Nat City, meaning it wasn't the first Franklin or the real estate lending but it was a core basic business in the Midwestern part of the United States. How is that doing in view of the recession and are you seeing any early signs of it starting to stabilize and improve assuming that it got hit by the recession?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there is a number of ways to look at National City. I mean, we've &#x2013; as you know, we tried to acquire National City a number of times because of the core business that they had. The deposit business of National City has done extraordinarily well this year. They have raised the transaction accounts dramatically over the course of the first nine months. I think they increased demand deposits by 3.5 billion the first four or five months, so deposit business is very good.</p>
          <p>I would say that generally speaking if you look at their home equity book it's been very good. Their commercial loans have worked out well given the economic environment. But when you look at what National City did in its various silos that caused significant problems, you had one part of the company which, for example, in the core business was cutting back its exposure to the big three. So that on a combined basis today we're less than $50 million to the big three, but on the other hand they originated and bought $9 billion of brokered home equity from around the country. That obviously has done poorly, and that's a big part of our impaired book. And then they acquired two banks in Florida and clearly the assets, the timing on that was very, very difficult. That became a big part of our impaired book.</p>
          <p>So I think when you look at the core business of National City, it's doing very well. And the issue for us is to eliminate the sub prime. As you brought up, the sub prime, the brokered home equity and some of the ancillary activities they got into, and I think that's what we're doing. We were able to take charges and reserves, 12.5 billion, I believe it was at the close of the transaction, and move those issues or the losses on those issues up front, and I think that's coming home now.</p>
          <p>The other thing is, is that because they were so siloed, they really didn't cross-sell products at all. For example, at PNC we cross-sell eight times as many dollars per customer of capital markets customers &#x2013; capital markets revenue as they did, three times in the treasury management space. The treasury management has already taken off, and the capital markets will come along. It's &#x2013; we're starting to see signs of it. So working as a team is something that National City didn't do as well as they might have, and they are now. So it's a &#x2013; there is a lot of opportunity there.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you guys put incentive plans in place to encourage the Nat City folks to cross-sell these pockets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The &#x2013; you're exactly right. I mean that was the big issue. The lenders were paid to be lenders and were paid only on a lending basis and not paid or rewarded in any way to cross-sell other products, and so whether it's workplace banking, whether it's &#x2013; they didn't really refer anybody to the private bank. We've basically changed that, and they have really come on board operating as a team extraordinarily well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of lending, your loan portfolio obviously similar to the industry is shrinking because of the economic conditions of the country. Historically it takes a while though we know Washington is complaining that the banks aren't lending, they don't I guess realize that banks are in the business to lend and you guys would like to lend more if the demand was there. When do you see loan demand coming back? Is it something that you could &#x2013; assuming the U.S. economy is expanding in 2010 and we're back into a growth mode?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You won't see a lot of expansion in the economy unless you do see expansion in the credit space. So I think there is a few things that has to happen &#x2013; have to happen. I think the consumer has got to be more confident in their position. I think a stable environment, whether it be governmental or economic, I think is very important before the consumer starts buying again. You've seen the savings rates go from 1% where they were for 20 years to last time I saw was 6.7% in a month. And so they're paying down their credit cards, they are paying down their home equity loans and they're saving money, so we've got to get back to a stable position there, and I think you've just started to see corporations start to spend money on capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Now, whether that's a blip or whether that's sustained, and then of course the stimulus money hopefully will come in next year, which causes people to spend money, capital money, so those kinds of things would incent borrowing as well. So we'd love to see borrowing come back. I don't see it turning around in the immediate future, but hopefully if the economy turns around next year, you'll see loan demand next year. Utilization rates are from what I can tell an all time low for utilization of credit facilities, so if the economy starts to come back, I think that could change in a hurry.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that on the credit deterioration some of the credits in the finance space were the drivers of credit deterioration this quarter. You also I think said that you sold one of those credits at $0.90 on the dollar. On page 10, was the credit that was sold, was it the number one or number two credit that was listed there as your largest non-performing asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's the number one credit. We knocked that exposure in half. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, just trying to take a stab at the accretion from the purchase accounting, is it safe to look at it that because you guys were assuming the 2% cost of funds and now cost of funds is less, that the initial estimate was too low and you're getting additional benefit now from the purchase accounting because the cost of funds are lower than the 2%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the initial estimate was done as of 12/31/08, so it was as of the end of last year and rates have come down obviously since then, so we've been able to do better. Deposit rates come down, a lot less competition today than there was at the end of the year, so deposit rates are down. But the real &#x2013; the thing I think people also might not be picking up on, we're repricing all the PNC CDs, and we didn't have marks on those, and we're dropping those from 3% down to under 2%, so there is that additional value coming in there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. So if you would have &#x2013; again, I know rates were a lot different and the market was different when you guys made these assumptions. If you would have assumed 1.8% on the deposit side, for example, then the initial assumption on accretion would have been greater back in '08. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If that were the market environment then, that's correct, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we still would not have estimated the total benefit from the lower rates because we wouldn't have marked the PNC book.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>

          <p>Morning, Keith.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for another National's revenue question. But if you look at just on the cash, so if you look at 3Q over 3Q and you kind of do a pro forma margin, pro forma National's revenue, your Nat's revenues growth is up 10% year-over-year, your balance sheet is down 7% year-over-year in terms of earning assets. It implies your margin is up like 55 basis points from like a 3.22 to 3.76, so maybe if you forget about talking it from the perspective of accretion and just talk about why would the combined margin of two companies be up about 50 basis points year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you got to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's clearly something that I was missing, in terms of trying to model the earnings power. We would have thought National revenue would have been running a lot lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you take a look at page five, it's easy. Look at the cost of funds. It has come down dramatically, even since the beginning of the year. The cost of funds has come down. The borrowed funds and the deposit rates, deposits overall down to 1%.</p>
          <p>We haven't done a lot of comparisons actually to the prior year because we're kind of a much bigger and a very different company. But you can see, even if you did that comparison, you can see the overall cost of funds coming down from 2.29% down 90 basis points. It's about as simple as that, that decrease. And while the cost of assets is coming down, it's not as great. That's -- how else to explain the margin increase other than the fact that we're getting funds a lot cheaper than we were a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a lot cheaper than we had assumed at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you think this kind of level of margin of 3.75 is consistent with how your balance sheet is constructed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is. And as I think we gave in guidance before, we do expect this to continue to go up because we do expect another $7 billion of retail CDs and brokered CDs to roll off in the fourth quarter, and we'll be able to reprice those at below the rates at which we have them marked, getting better cash on that side, as well as a portion of that is PNC CDs which today are accruing at 3% and we'll reprice them below the 1.8 level.</p>

          <p>In the quarter we basically used about a billion dollars of that mark. I think last quarter, this quarter it's at 6.6 billion, last quarter was about 7.5, something like that, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I think following up a little bit with Heather's last question, can you talk a little bit about the relationship between net loan charge-offs and nonperforming assets? I was little surprised that when the nonperforming assets did go up this quarter, but the charge-offs came down and why would that be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The charge-offs are very asset specific and they can be very volatile. They'll bounce around a bit. I think the trend you really want to stare at there is the nonperforming, and watch to see that come down. Keep in mind also that, at National City we took about, what, $2.8 billion worth of reserves at the end of the year related to their portfolio. At some point we're going to charge those off. So the charge off number can be very misleading as to where our overall credit quality is headed.</p>
