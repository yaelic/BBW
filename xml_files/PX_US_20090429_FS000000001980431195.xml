          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q1 2009 Praxair Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Antoine and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session toward the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you and good morning. And thank you all for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. Matt White, Vice President and Controller and Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations are with me this morning. Liz will review our first quarter results, afterward I will discuss the current business environment or outlook for the balance of 2009 and our earnings guidance. And we'll then be available to answer questions. Liz?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page three for a summary of our first quarter results. Note that year-over-year comparison exclude the pension settlement charge taken in the first quarter of 2008. The reconciliations to GAAP reported numbers are in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Praxair had very good results in the first quarter given a very difficult macro environment. Overall, demand was weaker than we had anticipated and this continued right through the quarter with overall volumes lower sequentially from the fourth quarter. The decline now appears to have stabilized in most sectors, but we hadn't seen a meaningful and sustainable overall pickup yet. However, you can see in our results that the early and swift cost reduction actions we initiated in November offset a significant portion of the impact of the lower volumes on our earnings.</p>
          <p>So our sales declined 20%, our operating profit only declined 11% and our operating margin improved to 20.8%. Sales in the quarter were 2.1 billion, 20% below the prior year. There were three primary factors contributing to the lower sales. First, we had negative 9% year-over-year impact from foreign currency translation. Second, lower cost pass-through reduced sales by 2%. This number primarily reflects the lower price of natural gas passed through automatically to hydrogen customers in hydrogen prices.</p>
          <p>Beginning this quarter, we are also including in this number the cost of electric power passed through automatically to onsite atmospheric customers. These costs were previously included in the price component of our sales variance, but we think that combining all cost pass-through will give better transparency on organic sales growth and margins.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, our overall volumes were 12% below the prior year quarter, and 8% below the fourth quarter. This is an average of volumes across all our end markets with the largest decline in chemicals, metals, and electronics, followed by general manufacturing. Sales to energy markets were higher year-on-year.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we realized higher overall pricing as compared to the prior year. Operating profit was 442 million in the quarter, 11% below the prior year. The sharp drop in sales volumes reduced operating profit by about $180 million. We realized about 95 million of productivity and cost savings which offset a significant amount of this impact.</p>
          <p>Cost of sales was 25% below prior year and SG&amp;A expenses were 21% lower. These savings resulted from ongoing productivity programs, plus the cost reduction program we announced in the fourth quarter. In addition, we realized additional savings from procurement and the curtailment of other discretionary expenses. The significant cost reduction plus higher pricing resulted in a higher year-over-year operating margin despite the sales decline.</p>
          <p>Net income of 290 million was 9% below prior year, but as a percentage of sales it increased from 11.9% to 13.7%, nearly a 200 basis point improvement in margins. In addition to lower costs, net income benefited from lower interest expense on commercial paper and other short-term debt despite the tightening in global capital markets.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $0.93 were 6% below the $0.99 we earned last year. Earnings per share included the benefit of a 3% lower share count due to stock repurchases we made during 2008.</p>
          <p>We generated 349 million of operating cash flow this quarter from net income and depreciation. This cash flow funded 293 million of capital expenditures related primarily to the on-site projects in our backlog which are under contract with customers globally.</p>
          <p>Overall debt levels and our debt to capital ratio of 53.6% were relatively unchanged. In March, we issued $300 million of five year bonds at 4.738, the proceeds of which reduced outstanding commercial paper. This is part of our ongoing financing strategy, whereby we will continue to issue medium and long-term debt in the public markets to refinance short-term debt when rates are attractive.</p>
          <p>Please refer to pages four and five for our North American results. Sales in North America were 1.16 billion, 15% below the prior year, excluding a negative currency translation effect of a weaker Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Sales were reduced 4% by lower cost pass-through. This was due to the impact of natural gas prices which were 40% lower than in the prior year quarter, and thus reduced the dollar value of our hydrogen sales with negligible impact on operating profit.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales were 11% below the prior year due to lower volumes in all major end markets expect energy, partially offset by higher pricing levels.</p>
          <p>In the energy sector, we had higher sales for enhanced oil recovery. Enhanced oil recovery is strong and growing in Mexico. The gas well fracing business in the US and Canada was weaker this quarter due to low gas prices. Underlying hydrogen demand continues to be strong. This quarter we have slightly lower volumes due to a number of refinery customers who took scheduled maintenance turnarounds. Sales to metals, chemicals and electronics were down in line with the November and December run rates. Sales to general manufacturing markets were off 16% ex-currency in line with the overall decline in industrial production.</p>
          <p>On-site sales declined 23% ex-currency. 13% of this decline was due to lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas. On-site volumes were 10% below last year. As I just mentioned, hydrogen volumes were slightly lower due to customer turnarounds. Oxygen and nitrogen volumes were significantly lower attributable primarily to chemical and steel customers. Volumes to some of these customers at individual facilities were off 20% to 40% due to extended production cut backs in order to de-stock inventory levels in the face of falling prices for their products and weak demand.</p>
          <p>For the most part we're seeing similar run rates in April. In some locations individual customers have increased their demand but many others have not and so we are being cautious about calling a meaningful change in business trends yet.</p>
          <p>This quarter we signed a new enhanced oil recovery contract in the US. Oil prices have come down a lot from their peak, but these are long-term contracts and oil companies take a long-term view of their production economics. We also announced a new hydrogen supply contract whereby we will be supplying hydrogen to Shell's Deer Park, Texas refinery from our Gulf Coast pipeline system. These new contracts demonstrate the sustainability of growth and demand for industrial gases for the production of energy supplies.</p>
          <p>Merchant liquid sales were 4% below the prior year excluding currency impacts. Volumes were down 12%, partially offset by higher pricing and facility fees. Volumes declined from the fourth quarter for all product lines as overall customer demand continued to weaken. Pricing is higher year-over-year and stable sequentially across all products and geographies. We continue to sign new business for energy, food and environmental applications.</p>
          <p>Overall sales of packaged gases in North America were 14% below 2008 ex-currency due to lower volumes in the US, Canada and Mexico. Pricing is higher year-over-year. In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business same-store sales declined 13% due primarily to a 28% drop in hard goods. Gases declined 3%. The drop in hard goods volumes is not surprising and reflects the sharp contraction in capital spending in construction, auto, metals and mining due to weak demand and the uncertain economic outlook. While capital equipment showed the largest decrease, volumes are off in other product lines as well. Gases are more resilient as they are consumables, which customers need to operate.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in North America of $256 million was only 2% below the prior period quarter. The negative impact of lower volumes was offset by cost savings from productivity initiatives and our cost reduction program. Excluding the currency effect of lower exchange rates in Mexico and Canada, our operating profit was higher. The operating margin increased from 18% to 22%. The realized cost savings and higher pricing accounted for 300 basis points of this improvement with the remaining 1% attributable to the effect of lower natural gas prices, which reduced sales without similarly impacting operating profit.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for the second quarter in North America is for volumes to remain at a low level. We are seeing a sequential improvement in Gulf Coast chemicals and plastics production, primarily driven by the low price of natural gas. We are also seeing some improvement in electronics due to re-stocking. However, we do not expect a significant pickup in other markets.</p>
          <p>Please look at page six for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were 303 million, 22% below the first quarter of 2008. The currency translation effect of the weaker euro reduced sales by 9%. Underlying sales fell 11% resulting from 14% lower volumes. As we anticipated, volume declines were largest in chemicals, metals and electronics. During the quarter merchant and packaged gas volumes weakened particularly related to construction and metal fabrication customers. Volumes were down 10 to 15% in most end markets except food and beverage, healthcare and environmental applications where we signed a number of new contracts this quarter. Overall pricing is above prior year and we expect it to remain so.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $63 million compared to 87 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to lower volumes and currency depreciation, only partially offset by cost reductions. The operating margin was reduced this quarter due to the significant operating leverage of the lower volumes. Our cost reduction programs are proceeding more slowly in Europe due to the more rigid labor market and our unwillingness to pay high severance costs. We are stepping up our productivity program and expect the margin to improve over the balance of the year. Remember that our operating margin last quarter was high because it included a $4 million currency hedge gain.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page seven for our results in South America. Sales in South America this quarter were 353 million, 24% below the prior year, almost entirely due to negative currency translation. Ex-currency, sales were slightly below the prior year. Overall volumes were 8% lower, largely offset by higher pricing. Similar to other regions, sales to on-site customers in commodity export industries were most impacted due to inventory destocking. Merchant liquid and packaged gas volumes were down much more moderately, in the six to 8% range. Sales were up to food and healthcare markets.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $75 million, 16% below 2008. Excluding the impact of currency, underlying operating profit grew, as substantial cost savings and productivity and higher pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes. Operating margin increased both year-over-year and sequentially, excluding the hedge gain in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the Brazilian government has been cutting interest rates and taxes to spur growth and inventory de-stocking should abate, so we expect some improvement in the underlying level of macroeconomic activity we saw this quarter. In addition, we have several new projects starting up in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Page eight summarizes our results in Asia. Sales in Asia of $180 million were 5% below 2008 excluding currency effects. This sales decline was primarily due to electronics, where sales ex-currency, were down 22% year-on-year. Excluding electronics, underlying sales were higher from new project start-ups in China, India, and Korea, partially offset by lower demand from existing customers. Overall volumes declined 8%.</p>
          <p>In China on-site volumes were lower, primarily due to reduced demand from steel customers. In India and Korea on-site volumes were higher due to new projects start-ups. Excluding electronics, merchant volumes remained relatively stable across the region. Operating profit was $26 million compared to 37 million last year. The operating margin was primarily impacted by the downturn in on-site volumes and the sharp drop in electronics volumes, particularly rare and specialty gases to plasma display customers. We partially offset the impact with cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we expect growth to resume in Asia albeit at a slower pace than in 2008. Our customers in China are slowly increasing production. India has remained more isolated from the global recession. We have a large number of projects in our backlog which we are continuing to build for customers including two large oxygen plants for gasification. We continue to believe that China's shortage of domestic oil and gas and abundance of coal and soon petcoke will drive the development of more gasification projects.</p>
          <p>We also expect that the Chinese government will spend what it needs to on infrastructure to create jobs and stimulate growth. The electronics market appears to have bottomed, so while we don't have a lot of specific visibility right now, we do expect that our growth will pick up in the second half of the year in our base business and from new project start-ups.</p>
          <p>Page nine shows Surface Technologies results this quarter. PST had sales of $123 million, down 7% from 2008 ex-currency effects. Underlying growth in the energy market was 35% offset by a decline in sales to the aerospace market of 16% and to manufacturing and other markets of 21%. The lower volumes of aerospace coating work we have had for the last several quarters is the result of the Boeing strike and the delays in the Boeing and Airbus next generation plane programs.</p>
          <p>Our forecast is for these volumes to steadily increase from current levels throughout this year. We are seeing steady growth from the energy market which includes coatings for industrial gas turbines and also coatings for oil well service parts. The IGT market is strong as natural gas turbines are an economic source of clean energy for emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Demand in Europe for general industry markets such as printing is soft. Operating profit of 22 million was below prior year but PST produced excellent results in cost reduction and productivity, which more than offset the impact of the lower volume. Operating margin increased both year-over-year and sequentially to 17.9%.</p>
          <p>Now Jim will discuss our results in the quarter by end-market, our business outlook and our guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Liz. The global manufacturing environment turned out to be weaker during the first quarter than we had earlier anticipated. When we implemented our cost reduction program back in October, we had anticipated that fourth quarter 2008 and full-year 2009 industrial production would be off by about 5%. In the first quarter US industrial production was actually off by more than 10% and GDP now reported off by 6%. The decline is a lot larger in some parts of Europe, in the 20% range in Spain, in Germany and other places.</p>
          <p>Additionally Brazil and Korea, both large exporters to the US and Europe have also suffered double digit declines. Going forward, we share the view with others that the economic free fall has stabilized, and that overall manufacturing will hold but at about a 10% lower level than a year ago. The pie chart on page 10 shows our first quarter sales by end-market and our year-over-year sales growth this quarter for our principal end-markets excluding currency effects and cost pass-through.</p>
          <p>The markets in red, metals, chemicals, and electronics, are the end-markets we sell to where our customers produce commodities. These markets represent about a third of our sales. We saw the sharpest volume declines in these markets. Many of these customers dramatically reduced production to de-stock inventory as prices for their products fell and demand weakened around the world. Their production level stayed at very low levels right through the quarter and continue into April. As Liz mentioned earlier, certain chemical plants in the Gulf Coast have restarted due to the low price in natural gas.</p>
          <p>Electronics, February appears to have been the low point with a slight improvement in backlog, and sporadic pickup orders in March and April. But we believe it will be a very slow recovery because consumer demand remains so depressed. We're seeing growth in the solar market and so this is a bright spot in the current environment, but it is not a large part of our business today.</p>
          <p>Global steel production remains at very low levels, particularly in the US where industry production is off about 50%. Our US volumes are not off to that degree, but are running significantly below prior year, and we've not seen much of an upturn yet. More than half of our exposure to this market is outside the US. In South America and China some of our customers are starting to increase production levels. In India our volumes are higher than last year due to new projects start-ups.</p>
          <p>Our global sales to the chemicals markets were down 16%. The decrease was largely due to the curtailment of production by customers in North America resulting from a collapse in demand due to weak housing and auto demand. A number of our customers have started up again so we're seeing a little sequential improvement. Our sales in Asia were comparable to last year.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing is 24% of our sales and sales to this sector were 12% below last year. This sector encompasses a variety of markets and applications including a lot of metal fabrication for construction and machinery. So you can see that our sales are generally tracking a decline in industrial production.</p>
          <p>The energy sector continues to be a positive with sales up 8% this quarter. Hydrogen for refining will continue to grow. This quarter we announced a new contract to supply hydrogen to Shell's Deer Park refinery. They need the hydrogen to refine low-sulphur diesel. We'll be supplying them off our existing Gulf Coast line system.</p>
          <p>Our enhanced oil recovery sales are growing and we signed a new contract in North America this quarter. As Liz said before, our fracing sales in the US and Canada are slow because of low natural gas prices, but oil well services remains strong in Mexico. Mexico needs to continue to increase its oil and gas production, as that is a major source of the government's revenue.</p>
          <p>Finally the blue sectors which represent about a third of our sales are relatively non-cyclical. We expect food and beverage and healthcare to continue to grow at steady mid-single digit rates. Growth in overall healthcare segment is weighed down a little by our US home care business, which struggles with reduced reimbursement rates set by Medicare. But this is less than one quarter of our global $1billion business. The hospital business is a steady grower and our home care businesses in Europe and South America continue to do well.</p>
          <p>Food and beverage is down slightly this quarter, but we expect this market to be a steady grower. We are signing a lot of new merchant contracts around the world for frozen food applications, which are growing with the increasing demand for convenience pre-packaged foods. Aerospace is down this quarter because of the lower PST aerospace coatings which we mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page 11 for our earnings guidance. In second quarter 2009 we expect diluted EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.00. Guidance assumes a negative currency impact of about 11% versus the second quarter of 2008 and a negative natural gas and electricity pass-through effect on sales of about 5%. The second and third quarters of this year will have the largest negative year-over-year currency comparisons, because the dollar was at its lowest relative exchange rate to most major currencies in those quarters last year. We expect the second quarter to be sequentially stronger than the first quarter, due to a couple of typical seasonal factors, fewer refinery turnarounds and holidays combined with sequentially stronger volumes of hydrogen. We expect a little volume pick up in Asia and South America from on-site customers and we will realize more benefit from cost reduction.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2009 we now expect sales to be about $9 billion. This is below the range of 9.5 to 10 billion we gave you last quarter for a couple of reasons. We are now expecting a 9% negative currency impact and we are also expecting about a 3% headwind overall from lower cost pass-through primarily due to the low price of natural gas. In addition to these factors we're expecting a slower recovery in volumes from current levels.</p>
          <p>We're forecasting diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 3.85 to 4.15. We expect that productivity, cost reduction and pricing will offset our more cautious volume assumptions allowing us to main our expectations &#x2013; maintain our expectations for earnings.</p>
          <p>We expect that our CapEx will be about 1.4 billion for the year. Our project backlog still stands at 42. New project activity has slowed from the torrid pace of last year, but we signed six new projects during the first quarter. Projects in our backlog are solid and will come on stream giving us about 5% growth in earnings in 2010 and 2011.  We have two major <mark type="inaudible" /> hydrogen complexes starting up next year in the US plus two major coal gasification oxygen supply systems starting up in China.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to make a few comments about operating leverage. The 12% decline in volumes we saw in the first quarter reduced our operating profit by $180 million or about $ 0.42 of EPS. The Praxair team achieved a new level of productivity, generating about $95 million of cost reduction during the quarter which offset about half of the operating leverage impact on earnings. You can see the effect in the improvement in both our gross margin and operating margin, when all other things being equal, a significant loss of volume would normally hurt margin percentages.</p>
          <p>When volumes do come back, we will have significant operating leverage on the upside, as we expect to be able to hold on to and improve our new level of operating efficiency. And now we are happy to take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well about 11% of it is currency, which is affecting the sales line as well, but the remainder is true sustainable lower cost. And we have really risen to a new level of efficiency all around the world but particularly in North America.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can't really speak for competition, but what we are seeing is that there is still a lot of new projects out there. Four of the six that we signed were energy related, so that shows that that's still going very strongly even though oil prices and gas prices are down. But there is still quite a few new projects out there, What we don't have this year that we had last year was a lot of those speculative oil sands projects and gasification projects. But the kind of normal mainstay industrial gas projects are still out here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My first question is use of cash flow. If I take everything you said in terms of earnings and CapEx and all that, I'm coming up with something on the order of $0.5 billion of free cash flow this year. Between acquisitions, share repurchases, debt reduction, any &#x2013; can you give us an idea Jim how you expect to deploy that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well basically our main, our highest return on investment are our bricks and mortar projects and so of course that will be in the capital spending line. Additionally we are taking a hard look at a couple of smaller acquisitions where we may be able to pick up some businesses that are core businesses but at good prices. And then lastly we'll probably hold debt relatively flat and have some money left over to buy back some stock. We still haven't stopped our stock buyback program even though we didn't buy much back in the first quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Jim I was wondering if you could talk about variation in pricing power across different geographies and then also comment if you believe there is or isn't any cyclicality to pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I think you all know that we have a lot of control over pricing in this business. Number one, because we do sign long-term contracts and the pricing that we put into those contracts sort of gives us a guaranteed return on our capital, and the on-site contracts go for 15 years. And so I haven't seen &#x2013; we haven't seen anything changing there. In the merchant business they're typically five-year contracts and we haven't seen any change there as well. So and basically if I try to look at it around the world, there is no part of the world that's really different than any other part of the world.</p>
          <p>And then I guess you asked if pricing was cyclical. I don't think it will be cyclical because of the long-term contracts. It's not like the commodities industries where people just produce and have to sell their product and lower the price to sell the product.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have got a &#x2013; I'm a little puzzled by one of your slides, in that in terms of pricing what you show is that there is no sequential change. That is, that from Q4 to Q1 you are up three but, in your Q4 presentation you are up six. So one would think that you would be down three on a sequential basis. And the basis for that is that North America looks like it got restated downward by about three percentage points and Asia by about eight percentage points. But you also changed the classification. You now talk about price mix and other where you used to talk about price. So can you clarify all that?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well let me start with your comparison of the fourth quarter and the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fourth quarter was up 6% from the prior year fourth quarter, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This quarter was up 3% from the prior year first quarter. You can't say it was sequentially down because the fourth quarter was versus the prior year fourth quarter, okay. So there is no disconnect in the fact that we are showing price sequentially unchanged. There's not a disconnect with the 6% in the fourth quarter. We did change the cost pass-through to include changes in electricity cost which had been showing up in price before. So that's a little bit bigger category now. And then the other thing is in price mix other, what happens is that almost all of our sales have a combination of variable sales, but also a fixed fee payment at the bottom. And the fixed fee payment is the take or pay part of the on-site contract or the rental for the cylinders and tanks and so forth. And so as volume comes down, it has a mix effect on the overall average price there. I don't know if that makes sense to you, but usually there is not very much mix effect because volume's not changing very much, but with a 12% change in volume, there is a fair amount of mix effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the meaning of it is that the &#x2013; so in the &#x2013; and I'll just try this once, and then I'll pass on to somebody else. So, the meaning of it is that, so for example in Asia, the prices were up in the fourth quarter, they were up 8% year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in this quarter they were up 0% year-over-year, but what you're saying is that there was no change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically, in overall price, it's 0% sequentially. Now I will tell you though that electronics sales are a significant part of our Asian business. And there was a decline in electronics pricing overall, which was offset by increases in merchant packaged gases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at our, if you take electronics out of that portfolio, we did have higher pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's why this year, the year-over-year, this quarter the year-over-year effect is not what it was in the fourth quarter, because we had this problem in electronics this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so last year in the first quarter of 2008, your prices were up 4% and so if your prices were up -- so last year in the first quarter you were up four in Asia and the fourth quarter you were up eight. So there was a 4% sequential benefit. So then when you get to 2009 in the first quarter where you are up zero, it certainly would seem that there would be some sequential diminution.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You made three small acquisitions in packaged gases. So is the strategy there to make acquisitions while the market is down, and can we see more roll-ups like this in packaged gases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will be doing roll-ups, the strategy is to do roll-ups where we can extract a lot of synergy because what we are buying has an overlay on our existing business and I think one of the things I always look at in business is, is you want to have synergy between the new business and the old business, and that's where the packaged gas acquisitions come into play. But they all have to do with the willingness of the seller to sell the property and most of them are privately owned or family owned. And just because the economy comes down, it doesn't necessarily cause them to want to sell the business, nor does it cause them to be willing to sell at a lower price. So that's, a lot of people ask that question, but people who own private businesses, they tend to think of them sort of like people who own their house, that the value of the market went down but they aren't going to sell it --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, because they are more our normal, the ones we signed this quarter were kind of normal, 50 million average kind of size projects. But in the backlog, we got those two big gasification complexes that are multi-hundred million, and the two coal gasification projects are quite large also. So the backlog number of projects has stayed the same. In terms of dollars it's gone down some, but we didn't start up any of those big projects in the first quarter anyway. So generally if you want to put some dollars on it, it's about $2 billion, unchanged from the prior quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Jim, with regard to the 95 million in cost reductions that you achieved in the first quarter, how would you expect that number to trend moving into the June quarter? Would it remain stable or escalate at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get a little bit more cost savings going forward, because we've always got productivity programs going on. And when you look at the cost savings there, three quarters of it was due to ongoing productivity initiatives and another 25% of it was due to just tightening down spending in SG&amp;A and so forth. So the productivity initiatives keep going forward and those create advantages, for cost advantages through procurement, through production and distribution, through lower energy cost consumption, more efficient truck routing and that type of thing. And I think some people are kind of amazed at how much cost reduction we can actually get in this business. But it is basically a distribution business, and in distribution business is all about efficiency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Speaking of distribution with regard to PDI. I was wondering if you could comment on the price and volume composition of the minus 13 on same-store sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can't go specifically into price and volume on that because it's just not something that is appropriate to do here. But I could tell you, we're continuing to get positive price and that volume actually was off more than the 13% negative same store sales number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally if I may on the interest line Jim, would you comment on where you stand with regard to fixed versus floating, and what a reasonable forecast might be for the June quarter given the bond deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, we'll see interest expense up some for the rest of the year, because of moving into more fixed rate money. It's &#x2013; we're basically financing commercial paper at less than 0.5%. And so that's helping on the interest line, but during this low interest rate environment we do want to lock in more long-term money at below 5% rates, that's kind of our goal. And so you want to take advantage of the low commercial paper rate, but at the same time you want to take advantage of the future of locking in interest rates for a longer period.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, hi Jim. Jim a longer term question. Recently you sort of took down your estimate of post-2010 organic sales growth from eight to 12, to six to 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm just wondering if you can go into a little more detail about that. Why wouldn't &#x2013; I mean granted we've had some above trend demand from commodity projects for the last few years. But why wouldn't you think we could get back to the same level of organic sales growth that you've had in the past? And then any comments on the recent decision by the EPA to classify CO2 as a greenhouse gas? Does that sort of speed up the potential for gasification of utilities in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well we scaled back the long term forecast, because of what I'll call a commodity capacity overhang in metals and chemicals, plastics and electronics. So given the excess capacity in those three end markets, we're just forecasting that there are going to be fewer projects to do going forward, and that took about 2% out of the total. We also brought down our expectation for industrial production in that chart that we had on the long-term growth.</p>
          <p>So, top line probably six to 10% over the period, but it will be combined with lower capital spending and therefore more free cash flow generation, which actually will be extremely strong in the out post years. But there's still a lot of good projects there, and so we think once we get out of the comparables from prior years, six to 10% organic growth is doable and that will leverage into low-single digit, I mean low-double digit earnings growth. And so once we get through the comparables of this year, the outlook doesn't change that much from what it was a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now, on the CO2 legislation, that, there are several ways that we benefit from that. In the short-term we've got a lot of ways of helping our customers improve their combustion efficiencies. We have a whole technologies in combustion. And if you can improve your combustion efficiency, you can reduce on &#x2013; incrementally reduce your CO2 emission. So, if there is a tax to our customers or a cap in trade, that's going to increase demand for our combustion technologies and the oxygen that goes along with that. Longer term we have the oxy-coal combustion technology, which if the government wants to build power plants that, and sequester the CO2 from power plants is the ideal &#x2013; this is the ideal way to do that. But and we've got two projects that were pilot projects we're working on right now to do that on a turnkey basis. But that will be a ways out I think.</p>

          <p>Morning. Two quick questions. The fact that hard goods was down so much more than gases and inventory's de-stocking, should we expect gases to still decelerate down in the packaged North American gas segment? Would hard goods be a leading indicator maybe here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hard goods both on the upside and the downside are a leading indicator or I would say they are the most, not necessarily so much a leading indicator I would say as the more cyclical part of it. Because a lot of the hard goods are like welding equipment and laser cutting equipment and so forth and people stop spending money on those, what to the user would be a piece of capital equipment, okay. So that's why the hard goods are down so much, roughly 35% on the equipment there, just because they don't see the need to increase their capacity.  But I don't think...</p>

          <p>Good morning. Jim, on your slides page 10, it might be a reflection of the current situation of the US Senate. The blue sectors are stable and red are shrinking one senator at a time, right? My question is about the green sector though which is energy and so I don't know which party it corresponds to. But it was up 8% this quarter. I presume that what helped this 8% increase was some new contracts? If you take them out, if you compare the same store sales from existing customers, would energy sector would be up year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually I expect energy to be up double-digit this year. The reason, it wasn't up as much in the first quarter is because we had a lot of refinery turnarounds and hydrogen sales were actually off 6%. But, other places around the world and hydrogen volumes being back up again, I'm looking at energy being double-digit growth this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so on slide 11, previously I recall you talking about new projects contributing about 4% of sales in '09 and 5% in '010. And this morning, if I heard it correctly, I think you mentioned 5% in each of '10 and '11. Do you hear this right?</p>

          <p>Good morning. First question on merchant pricing in North America, just want to circle back to your comment about price and mix. What do you see as the underlying pricing trend in the merchant business, if you back out the mix effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is &#x2013; it won't going up the way it had been going up over the last five years, because part of the increase in the last five years was part of the cost of building plants and the cost of equipment and so forth was inflating rapidly. I think we're moving into generally a deflationary environment, and we're still looking at some decent positive pricing in merchant gases.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning Jim. The lower CapEx guidance, is that volume related or cost and supplier concessions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really more volume related. I mean we are getting through procurement lower costs on almost everything that we buy. But I would say the more of the impact is from volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last quarter you mentioned that a few customers were below minimum revenue requirements, this quarter volumes are softer. So are these customers farther behind and is it still your expectation that they will make up the difference in volume by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well they won't necessarily make up the difference in volume, but they will continue to pay the take or pay part of the contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no issue. There is no issue there. It's not like they have to take a minimum volume. Now a lot of them are actually, especially in Asia, are operating at the volume level of the minimum take or pay, because below that they have to pay for it even if they don't take it, so they are taking it anyway. And actually that's an inefficient level for us to be operating at, with some of the plant turndowns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's hurting us some.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you mentioned the margins in Europe were down. The margins in North America were actually up although there has been more pressure in volumes in North America versus Europe. So was that all just a labor issue. Is there anything else going on or there any other steps you could take other than basically improving margins to help the margins out in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually volumes in Europe were off by more than volumes in the US. And so there was a big decline there, but the labor market flexibility just takes a lot more time in Europe than it does in the US because in most parts of Europe you have to pay like three year severance. And when we look at the numbers on that, there's not really a good pay back on that, okay. And we are not going to take a charge just so we can pay three year severance. So we will continue to get the cost down in Europe, but it will be more out of attrition and so forth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And thanks for providing the current quarter breakout between pass-throughs and price. In Asia last year in the 2Q and 3Q prices and cost pass-throughs spiked about 11, 12%, how much of that was again the breakout between pass-throughs and price or electronics and how much of that do you expect to give back this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, the Asia pass-through was primarily in electronics last year in some of the rare gases and so forth. And also a lot of electricity cost increases. And so basically what we are expecting to see going forward that we haven't really seen yet, we haven't really seen a decline in electricity prices yet. It's starting to decline in some places but not &#x2013; but it was actually, electricity was up 15% in Europe. So we are hoping to see a decline in electricity prices going forward. Now we will have to give that back to the customers in terms of pass-through. So I would expect that it will be relatively indifferent to it on the operating profit line, but the sales line it would be a function of electricity prices going up substantially the last couple of years and I think probably falling 10 to 15% going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. When you take a look at your guidance for 2009 for sales, assuming the currency impact and the natural gas pass-throughs, it would sort of imply that your volume growth for the full year of '09 would be down let's say mid-single digits to high single digits. Given the tougher start to the year and it doesn't sound like second quarter is going to be that much better, are you assuming sort of an improvement in industrial demand in the second half of the year? Or are more of the sort of big projects coming on in the second half that sort of give you that improvement in sales in the back half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well basically it's, we are expecting some end to the destocking in the second half in the projections there, because steel production is off 50% in the United States but consumption is not off that much for example. And the same thing, and we're actually starting to see in chemicals and plastics the destocking come to an end. So in the second half, we're expecting there would be some destocking, some bounce-back from destocking, but that the overall demand, overall consumption will probably stay down about 10%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I got you. Then in terms of electronics, the improvement you are looking for sequentially, are you seeing order patterns for your customers already giving you that sort of outlook, that things can improve heading into the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, basically much of what we sell in electronics is on on-site contract, and so that's not really affected. In the materials science business, we do accommodation of long-term contracts and additional sales on top of that, we call pickup sales, and we are seeing more pickup sales. But we are not seeing a commitment by the semiconductor fabs to enter into long-term higher levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, in terms of merchant, could you just, and I apologize if I missed this, what your operating rates are for your plants globally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What our operating rates are, they're generally in the low 70s globally, but remember that the product can't move. You can't take product from one plant and move it to where some other customer would be, so that does no impact on price.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. In the last decade you had a fairly substantial increase in volume, pricing, et cetera, and really two trends out there. One being the consolidation of the industry and two being hydrogen. Could you guys, could you talk about sort of the next ten years and what you see out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well I think that the past ten years was really a combination of pretty much what you said, a combination of consolidation plus the overall economy was growing pretty nicely. And then on top of that you had the whole energy situation which is broader than just hydrogen. I don't expect the economy to be growing that fast going forward. There may be a bounce back from this depression. But long term I expect consumer savings rates to go up and so forth. But the other big driver is going to be emerging markets, mainly India and China and South America. And we are going to just continue to sign new projects in all three of those countries. And in fact they've all been impacted by this financial crisis, but they are rapidly bouncing out of it and bouncing back up right now. But if you look ten years forward, we'll have a substantial amount of our business in emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the sort of CO2 global warming, et cetera, a lot of your products may help in that area, but we're obviously going to see a huge tax on energy and other products. Call it a tax, call it whatever you will, and that's going to lead to lower demand. So offsetting that, you're going to see lower demand across a lot of your products. How do you think that balances out in the end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well that would be lower demand for hydrocarbons. Okay, but we don't really sell, we don't sell any hydrocarbons other than hydrogen and that won't impact the demand for hydrogen going down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well of course I mean if we're selling less oil you are going to see lower EOR, you're going to see lower refinery hydrogen et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the hydrogen is going to keep going and enhanced oil recovery is going to keep going. And there, hopefully, I guess what the administration is looking for or what you're talking about with attacks on energy, reducing energy demand. I guess you would see that mostly in electric power production, in coal burning plants which we don't really have as customers right now. So I don't see any negative effect on growth from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you certainly would say that maybe the next 10 years is not going to look like the last 10 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I am saying, would you say that the next 10 years for the industrial gas business may not look as rosy as the last 10 years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
