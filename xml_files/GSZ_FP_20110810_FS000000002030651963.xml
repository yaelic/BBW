        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet speaking. I'm delighted to welcome you to this call with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli and G&#xE9;rard Lamarche. Together, we will present our first half results but also the strategic partnership we have announced this morning with the Chinese sovereign fund, China Investment Corporation or CIC.</p>
          <p>I will start with our key figures and the highlights of the first semester, including our CIC partnership. Then G&#xE9;rard Lamarche will speak in more details about the first half accounts and about our portfolio optimization program, which is well on track and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will come back to some key issues for the group such as the gas tariff in France, a long-term contract and the nuclear environment in Belgium.</p>
          <p>Let's start with our key figures. The group is growing with an EBITDA at &#x20AC;8.9 billion, increasing by 8.2% for the first semester. Net income group share amounts to &#x20AC;2.7 billion. With the transactions announced this morning, we are well on track with our &#x20AC;10 billion portfolio optimization program planned over 2011, '12 and '13, with over 60% closed or already announced. Efficio saved &#x20AC;500 million over the semester, in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Based on these results, we are able to confirm our targets for 2011, 2011 EBITDA between &#x20AC;17 billion and &#x20AC;17.5 billion with average weather conditions and with no significant regulatory changes. As of June 30th, the impact of the exceptional warm winter and dry spring we have had in France and Belgium is estimated at &#x20AC;465 million. Regarding gas tariff in France, we are working with the French authorities to set up a new formula in September.</p>
          <p>Besides, we confirm an earnings per share above or equal to 2010, taking into account capital gains from our portfolio optimization program and EPS above or equal to 2010. May I remind you that an interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.83 per share will be paid on November 15th the total amount will be decided at the Shareholders General Meeting on April 23rd in 2012. We also maintain our A category rating objective, which is a strategic objective.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you a brief update on our &#x20AC;10 billion portfolio optimization program that we announced last March when we met for our 2010 annual results. This program is based on two pillars. First, on one hand, the disposal of the non-core assets or minority stakes notably G6 Rete Gas, our distribution network in Italy; the Belgium intermunicipalities, Noverco in Canada, but also Elgin-Franklin and Atlantic LNG. The second pillar is the strategic partnerships. Two strategic partnerships which allow GDF SUEZ to access new resources in order to accelerate the development of businesses that are key to the group.</p>
          <p>We had announced two very important strategic partnerships, the long-term partnership in natural gas transmission with CNP/CDC consortium closed in July. And today, the investments are for CIC in our E&amp;P division.</p>
          <p>We can say that we are well advanced on our portfolio optimization program with over 60% already closed or announced. The program will further strengthen our financial structure, reducing our net debt by more than &#x20AC;6 billion with an adjusted net debt of &#x20AC;35 billion instead of &#x20AC;41 billion and an adjusted gearing below 44%.</p>
          <p>In six months, finally, we have been able to offset the impact of the acquisition of International Power on our debt ratios. I would like also to highlight the fact that we have been able to generate significant value from these disposals and capital gains expected on this transaction of &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to what we announced today, a unique and very promising partnership with CIC, the Chinese sovereign fund. As you know, the group has been developing its presence in the Asia-Pacific region over the past years where we're already present strongly and we have an established presence in almost all our activities in all countries.</p>
          <p>In power generation, we have a strong foothold in Thailand, in Singapore. And International Power had added a strong presence in Indonesia and Australia. In LNG, we have a large prospect in Australia such as the Bonaparte project. In exploration production, we have had the recent important discovery announced in Indonesia. In Energy Services, with the recent partnership we signed with the city of Tianjin in China and a historical presence in India, essentially in engineering; and in environment, with the water and waste management services provided to over 14 million people in China and also a strong presence in Australia, in desalination, for example. We have already today around 11,000 employees working in this region and 13,000 megawatt of installed capacity as of June 2011.</p>
          <p>Therefore we have already a platform for future growth in the Asia-Pacific region and therefore the partnership with CIC will help us to accelerate our development in the region. The agreements that we have signed with CIC will be deployed across the group businesses and sets up the framework for cooperation in three key areas.</p>
          <p>Joint investment opportunities in existing and new energy-related projects in Asia-Pacific, financing cooperation on new projects in Asia-Pacific, and also, commercial sponsorship and support given by CIC or through CIC affiliates to GDF SUEZ in Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>The cooperation will be closely managed and monitored with the steering committee co-chaired by myself and Chairman Lou Jiwei, Chairman and CEO of CIC, and we will notably review existing corporations and new opportunities.</p>
          <p>I already consider that this is a unique partnership between two leaders with highly complementary competencies. CIC, which is a major investment force worldwide, will provide its financial resources and expertise to our company, the development of GDF SUEZ in its largest Asian projects across all businesses and countries. And GDF SUEZ which offers CIC numerous high-quality investment opportunities in all our businesses and across the region in energy or environment.</p>
          <p>As the first milestone of this cooperation, we are proud to announce advanced exclusive talks on the 30% minority stake by CIC in our exploration and production division to accelerate its development. CIC will also acquire our 10% stake in Atlantic LNG and LNG liquefaction train located in Trinidad and Tobago. The minority investments of CIC in our E&amp;P division will be a highly attractive first milestone for our group, strategically and financially and will support the E&amp;P development.</p>
          <p>Initiated in the '90s via acquisitions followed by a strong organic development, the E&amp;P division of GDF SUEZ has 2P reserves of 815 Mboe at the end of 2010, an annual production of 51 Mboe in 2010 and a significant portfolio of contingent resources and exploration prospects.</p>
          <p>CIC has agreed to take a 30% stake in our E&amp;P division for &#x20AC;2.3 billion by a capital increase. GDF SUEZ will retain operational control of the assets and the Board member allocation will be proportional to each partner's equity, 70%, 30% interest in the division. The partnership with the CIC will reinforce this capital-intensive co-activity and will permit expansion opportunities and development in new regions. It will offer E&amp;P further expansion opportunities in Asia already representing two-thirds of the worldwide LNG demand.</p>
          <p>On top of this minority investment in our E&amp;P division, we have already identified numerous other significant opportunities for cooperation in our businesses, and I would rapidly mention some of them. In natural gas, there are significant investment opportunities in gas distribution and storage activities across Asia, and in also infrastructure solutions. And infrastructure is linked with the development of a floating gasification and re-gasification solutions. And I hope we'll be able to announce concrete achievements in this area of re-gasification in the coming months. This cooperation will also help GDF SUEZ to further develop our sales of LNG in Asia.</p>
          <p>In power generation, there is an attractive pipeline of quality power production projects in Asia, therefore, there is a wide room for cooperation with partners. In Energy Services, there are potential opportunities around the development of what is called sustainable cities, eco-cities in China as well as attractive existing projects in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. In environment services, we will be better placed to respond to the increasing demand for global water cycle management for both municipalities and corporate.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to G&#xE9;rard Lamarche, who will cover our first half financial results in detail. G&#xE9;rard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased to be here today and to present our solid performance. There are three key points on which I would like to focus on today.</p>
          <p>First of all, our result in the first half of this year, which have been very robust. Secondly, we have strengthened our balance sheet further. And finally, we have made a very good progress on our portfolio optimization program.</p>
          <p>Let's start with a few comments on the key figures of the P&amp;L. Operating performance has been very solid during the first half of this year. Revenue increased by 7.9% compared to same period of last year to reach &#x20AC;45.7 billion. And EBITDA grew by more than 8% to &#x20AC;8.9 billion. This robust operational performance demonstrated the capacity of the group to deliver strong growth despite the unfavorable weather condition in our domestic market, on which I will comment later.</p>
          <p>Net income share &#x2013; group share was &#x20AC;2.7 billion. And please note that including the &#x20AC;1.5 billion of capital gain expected from the announced transaction of our portfolio optimization program. The net income group share would have been &#x20AC;3.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a closer look at the contribution of each business line to the strong operational performance. So, excluding the exceptional and favorable weather condition of the first semester, all the business line delivered operational growth as you can see on the chart. As you can see on this chart, that the weather impact during the reporting period represents &#x20AC;465 million for both gas activities in France and in Belgium and hydropower generation in France due to the drought.</p>
          <p>Please keep also in mind that last year, in H1, the exceptionally cold temperature generated a positive impact of &#x20AC;210 million compared to a normalized year. So, all in all, close to &#x20AC;700 million of negative impact when we compare to last year. So, excluding the weather condition, the EBITDA of Energy France grew by more than &#x20AC;300 million, mainly thanks to the margin of the retail gas provided by the public service contracts set up in April 2010, higher margin in power generation, and the new power capacity commissioned last year namely Combigolfe and Montoir-de Bretagne.</p>
          <p>The Energy Europe International, displayed in light blue on the screen, delivered growth of both 20% benefiting in particular from the integration of International Power as of February the 3rd, which contributed to &#x20AC;565 million and strong organic growth coming from Latin America and United States.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look on the performance of the main countries. In Brazil, the performance was driven by higher margin on the renewed contracts, inflation and increase of hydro generation, thanks to the commissioning of the unit of Estreito.</p>
          <p>In Chile, Mejillones LNG terminal contributed to the full semester. In Panama, the Dos Mares hydro plants started its production progressively during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>And in North America, growth was mainly driven by higher contribution of the LNG activities and stronger margin in the retail business.</p>
          <p>Benelux, Germany and the rest of Europe showed good resistance taking into account the non-recurring positive impact totaling &#x20AC;180 million last year as you remember. Moreover, new capacity contributed to this semester's results like Flevo in the Netherlands and Sidmar in Belgium.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of Global Gas LNG, the contribution grew by 3%. The marketing and supply activity evolved as anticipated <mark type="ph" /> which was (19:15) an increase in the LNG sales with 21 cargoes sold versus 14 for the same period of last year; then lower volume sold to the key accounts to preserve our margin level and finally, an oil-gas spread impact consistent with our full-year expectation.</p>
          <p>The contribution of exploration and production grew significantly as a result of the 16% rise in the volume with the production totaling 30 million barrel of oil equivalent and hike of course in the oil and gas prices. Excluding weather impact in France, the infrastructure business now contributed &#x20AC;26 million to the EBITDA growth. The full capacity of Fos Cavaou LNG terminal being offset by the storage capacity sold.</p>
          <p>The Energy Services, displayed in red on the screen continued to grow both organically with a good performance of the installation activities in France and through the full benefit of the acquisition close in 2010, mainly in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:37) in France. And finally, SUEZ Environment posted strong numbers with an EBITDA increase of 18.2% for the period and please refer to the detailed presentation given last week by Jean-Louis Chaussade. All in all, despite this exceptional and favorable weather condition, the group posted an EBITDA growth of more than 8% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look on the full-year outlook. We expect this robust performance of H1 to continue during the second half of this year. First of all, Energy France. If we assume a total gas tariff freeze for Q4, which is by the way not the base case for the group, the 2011 EBITDA would represent roughly 50% of the level reached last year. This takes, of course into account the unfavorable weather condition of H1 and the assumption of an average climate for H2. So, for Energy France, more or less &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>Energy Europe and International. In 2011, International Power integration will contribute over 11 months. We take the opportunity to confirm today that the previously announced synergies are well on track. International Power will also benefit from the trend I've just mentioned in Latin America and in the US and from the commissioning of new electricity capacity in Brazil, in Chile, in Panama and in Thailand. This overall strong performance will be partly compensated by the continued margin contraction being the Benelux countries and the disappearance of the non-recurring effect mentioned previously.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn our attention to Global Gas LNG outlook. In 2011, EBITDA for the exploration production division should go up with a production increase to 60 million barrels, many thanks to Europe. And the gas market remains tough and the impact of the gas-oil spread is in line with our expectation estimate of around &#x20AC;500 million. Overall, the EBITDA of B3G should hedge up on 2010.</p>
          <p>For infrastructure now, <mark type="ph" /> our force line (23:38) based on average weather condition, the EBITDA should remain stable. Fos Cavaou will provide full-year contribution while the storage activities in France will see a drop in the sold volume. You will note, however that the acquisition of the gas storage facilities in Germany that we announced last January should be closed in the first half of this &#x2013; in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>As for Energy Services, the EBITDA for the full year should reach &#x20AC;1 billion in line with the achievement I've just mentioned for each one. And concerning environment, the EBITDA is set to grow by more than 10% in 2011 at constant exchange rate following the guidance confirmed by SUEZ Environment last week.</p>
          <p>So, to sum up, as G&#xE9;rard has already indicated, we confirm 2011 guidance &#x2013; the 2011 guidance assuming average weather condition on the whole year and with no significant regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a look on the other line of the results of the P&amp;L. Our net recurring income for the bottom line, recurring bottom line has slightly decreased compared to the same period of last year. Depreciation, amortization and provision amount to &#x20AC;3.4 billion at &#x20AC;600 million versus H1. And this includes the former IPR assets contribution and the purchase price allocation impact. As a result, on a full-year basis, D&amp;A should increase by around &#x20AC;1.1 billion including the PPA impact. This PPA impact should amount to roughly &#x20AC;200 million, including a one-off of &#x20AC;150 million negative.</p>
          <p>The asset disposal result, &#x20AC;650 million are mainly related to the first transaction on the Belgian municipalities in Flanders and Wallonia totaling more than &#x20AC;500 million of capital gain. With the transaction announced so far for the portfolio optimization program, we expect &#x20AC;1.5 billion of capital gain for the full year, namely with the disposal of our minority stake in Atlantic LNG and Elgin-Franklin fields.</p>
          <p>The financial result. Now, the financial result is stable at &#x20AC;1.1 billion, thanks to positive variation in FX hedging offsetting higher volume of debt after the integration of International Power. The average cost of net debt remains stable at 4.6%. The financial result should amount roughly &#x20AC;2.4 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>The adjusted income tax increased to 34% versus 30% by taking into account higher contribution of our exploration and production activities in the northern countries of Europe, more results so more tax. The adjusted income tax rate should remain at around 34% on a full-year basis.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to make a few comments on the balance sheet. As you can see on the screen, our balance sheet has remained very strong, thanks to the combined effect of a strong cash flow generation and the successful implementation of the portfolio optimization and the reduction of the capital intensity. Our free cash flow remains at the same level with &#x20AC;4.5 billion for the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CapEx over the reporting period, we invested &#x20AC;4.2 billion, out of which two-thirds on development. CapEx for the full year remain in line with our program of &#x20AC;11 billion. &#x20AC;1.3 billion of disposal were booked on the first half of this year including &#x20AC;700 million for the Belgian municipalities and &#x20AC;200 million from the sales of our minority stake in Noverco Canada.</p>
          <p>Turning to net debt. We started the year with &#x20AC;43 billion, including International Power. Thanks to the combined effect of the reduced capital intensity and the sustained cash flow, the net debt has decreased by more than &#x20AC;2 billion to reach &#x20AC;40.7 billion. Adjusted for the announced transaction as of today, which are not yet booked in the half year, in the first six months, the net debt should reduce further to &#x20AC;35 billion, very close to the level of &#x20AC;34 billion before the integration of International Power.</p>
          <p>To conclude, our balance sheet remain therefore strong and flexible with a net debt representing 2.5 time last 12 months EBITDA and a good control of CapEx. This is spot on the target with our objective of A rating.</p>
          <p>Let us now focus on the portfolio optimization program. As, G&#xE9;rard indicated, we are well advanced on our &#x20AC;10 billion program over three years with over 60% announced today &#x2013; as of today. Let me insist on the fact that this portfolio optimization program has been set up in order to strengthen our credit rating after the integration of International Power while extracting the maximum value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>As this slide demonstrate each transaction has achieved level on the high-end of the valuation in terms of valuation references, even in the case of disposal of minority stakes. As far as regulated asset are concerned, this transaction delivered premium over the regulated asset base and high multiple of EBITDA as you can see.</p>
          <p>I would like to focus on the largest transaction. The offer of CIC for 30% minority stake in our E&amp;P division value this business over &#x20AC;8 billion. This amount exclude, of course, Elgin-Franklin. This valuation for a minority stake fully reflects the 2P and the 2C reserves and also our project in Australia and in Asia which are not yet under construction.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I would like to take &#x2013; you to takeaway three key messages. Firstly, our group delivered a robust set of results despite exceptional weather conditions.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have further strengthened our financial structure as a result of high cash-flow generation and disposal and reduction of the capital intensity. And finally, we continue to work on value creation in all our businesses and through the portfolio disposal products. Thank you very much. And I pass it to Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Good morning. Today I will focus on three items, first, the latest developments of the gas tariff framework in France and our efforts to stabilize it. I will give you a brief overview of the ongoing negotiations we have with our main gas suppliers on our long-term contracts. Second, a focus on the nuclear situation in Belgium and third an update on our pipeline of projects. Several projects have successfully started operation and are already delivering revenues this very year. And lastly, I would rapidly mention the reorganization of our European activities in view of increasing the integration of our activities in Europe and strengthening our efficiency.</p>
          <p>First, as we go our gas retail activities in France, the <mark type="ph" /> news throws (32:53) over the last quarter has been quite dense. On April 1st and on July 1st two tariff changes were approved. On April 1st, we got an increase of 4.9% that was totally in line with the tariff formula. On July 1st, a 7% tariff increase was needed according to the formula, but we were only granted plus 3.2% for around the quarter of our sales under what we call the public distribution tariffs, i.e. only an increase for non-residential customers such as small companies. The consequences in term of revenues of this shortfall are for the time being limited to &#x20AC;35 million if it is contained within the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So, what is at stake today? The government indicated its willingness to find a new formula better adapted to the valuations on the gas market. We're akin at GDF SUEZ the tariff formula provided that all our supply costs are fully included in this formula. And we're currently working with the French regulator on this new formula within the current regulatory framework with a view to conclude these discussions in our work in September.</p>
          <p>We consider that a solution has to be found by October 1st to fully take into account the supply costs. As you remember, Q4 represents roughly 30% of the total sales of the year. As G&#xE9;rard told you, should there be a total tariff freeze over Q4 this year, then the shortfall for H2 as a whole would amount to about &#x20AC;340 million of which, as I told you, only &#x20AC;35 million is coming from Q3. And that is on the assumption of the recent <mark type="ph" /> forwards (35:07) and based on the current tariff formula. This is by definition not our best case, and we will do our best to improve visibility on this issue.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to our midstream gas businesses, and first an update of the global situation, I will say only three things. First, the global gas markets are better oriented in term of prices due in particular to a progressive tightening of the market driven by the Fukushima aftermath. Second, the LNG demand has expanded rapidly, thus, reducing the LNG over supply. And this movement will even be greater next year. And third, gas demand in Europe as we turn to pre-crisis level, but the gas to oil spread has not substantially been reduced despite the gas market price increases.</p>
          <p>All in all, we'll continue to think that the full rebalancing of the market will occur between '13 and '14. And meanwhile, the situation calls for the continued adaptation of our long-term contracts prices with our main suppliers. And the situation is as follows.</p>
          <p>First, during H1 this year, we managed our gas balance to reduce the spread impact and we have used the volume flexibility of our long-term contracts and have reduced our exposure to the spread for next year, '12, to 70 terawatt hour from the 100 terawatt hour that were mentioned in March. For the months to come, we will continue to adapt the reduction of this exposure to market conditions and evolutions.</p>
          <p>Second, we are currently discussing with all our suppliers with a view to conclude our negotiations as soon as possible such as to alleviate the spread burden as soon as this very year, if possible, but mainly for '12. Third, we are willing to introduce shorter review cycle one or two years' duration to take into account the current volatile situation. And fourth, we have not decided at this point in time to go to arbitration, but we are keen to consider it if unsatisfactory proposals are made. We cannot be more specific at this moment of the year, but I am carefully optimistic for the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to our nuclear power generation in Belgium. As you know, in '09, we signed a broad agreement with the Belgium government including the life extension to 2025 for three reactors. First, the political situation in Belgium, as you know, has not permitted the implementation of this agreement. A fully functioning government is needed to go ahead on this issue. Once it will be the case, a rapid confirmation will be needed to make the necessary investments before the 2015 current termination date. Timing is now short.</p>
          <p>Second, with nuclear safety as a top priority, GDF SUEZ has rapidly confirmed its commitment to participate to the stress test process. A project structure has been set up since April to cover the full scope of the required tests. A first progress report will be finalized by August the 15th. The final report will be sent to the Belgium safety authorities by the end of October.</p>
          <p>And third, as you know, for the level of tax included in the '11 budget, this level is fully in line with all nine agreements. As you know there's been a lot of debates in Belgium on this topic. Finally, at this point of time, no additional contribution has been decided. But for us, clearly, the level of the contribution is key to favor or not the life extension.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding the third item, our pipeline of projects, at the end of June this year, we have close to &#x20AC;11 billion of assets under construction, i.e. non-predictive CapEx for the time being that will fuel growth for the years to come. On the last part of the screen, you will find an update of the main projects under construction with expected COD and on the right part of the screen, the EBITDA contribution.</p>
          <p>Over this first semester of '11, the EBITDA contribution of new projects has been &#x20AC;600 million in line with the &#x20AC;900 million that we're expecting for their full year. Gj&#xF8;a, the gas and oil field in Norway, has contributed to half of this amount. We expect an additional total production of 8 Mboe for the full year '11 for Gj&#xF8;a with the higher share of oil than previously expected.</p>
          <p>Our other main projects for this year, Estreito in Brazil, about 300 megawatt of the 1.1 gigawatt dam were commissioned in April and July. The remaining 800 megawatt will be commissioned in H2 '11 and in '12. Two 150-megawatt coal plants in Chile have also been commissioned in July and August. Two projects, however, have encountered some difficulties during this first semester.</p>
          <p>First, due to welding issues with the so-called T24 steel alloy used as membrane wall material for our coal-fired power plants project in Germany at Wilhelmshaven, we forecast delaying the commercial operating date to October '13. This is a generic problem affecting several coal plants under construction in Europe. And we are currently discussing the issue with Hitachi Power Europe to find a technically satisfactory and reliable solution and to minimize delays. For our coal-fired power plant under construction in Rotterdam in Maasvlakte, no delay is considered yet and we maintain our COD in Q2 '13.</p>
          <p>The second point I want to mention is regarding Jirau, our main hydro project in Brazil is a great opportunity for the group for the years to come. The construction is now back to normal after some delays at the beginning of this year with construction back to normal level with more than 15,000 workers on site.</p>
          <p>The river deviation which is a key milestone for the project is still planned for H2 this year as scheduled and <mark type="ph" /> the phase start (43:06) of operation is expected in H2 '12, with the project expected to reach its maximum assured energy level in H2 '13.</p>
          <p>These consequences of this delay in EBITDA contribution is expected to impact by &#x20AC;100 million in '12, the EBITDA because of the delay. And any impact in '13 is not expected to be significant.</p>
          <p>Now, a last word on the reorganization of our European activities. The current market context in Europe and the high level of competition drives us to better integrate our activities in Continental Europe to reinforce our operational efficiency. The plan is to bring together the group's Continental European activities with a simple business line that will include what is today the Benelux &amp; Germany in the Europe business areas and the Europe business areas of the current Energy Europe International business line. The Energy France business line, the gas supply and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:21) business unit of the Global Gas and LNG business lines and the Central Portfolio Management Europe and GDF SUEZ Trading.</p>
          <p>The exploration and production and LNG businesses will make up the new Global Gas and LNG business line. At the very heart of the project, our objective is both to, first, strengthen the steering role of our business activities what we call the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:50) downstream, energy management and generation in order to deliver increased revenue and second to keep a strong country-based approach to guarantee an efficient coordination between the business activities.</p>
          <p>The implementation is expected early next year. And we will naturally come back in the near future to this reorganization to give you more detailed information. Thank you for your attention, and I will now let G&#xE9;rard conclude.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Before concluding, I would like to come back briefly to one of the main events which marked this first semester, the Fukushima tragedy. Beyond the emotion, we have to recognize that this tragedy has deeply changed our environment and the energy industry. The stress test will result in more CapEx, security of energy supply will be further questioned, increasing in competition among the continents. The risk cost not meeting Q2 target as planned is rising. And all these factors will probably lead to a recovery in power prices.</p>
          <p>And I am convinced that GDF SUEZ is well positioned to respond to these new challenges, thanks to our balanced model, our generation mix, our flexible gas portfolio and our leadership positions in LNG. We will also capitalize on our proven expertise across the whole new nuclear value chain. And finally, we will benefit from our strong presence in fast-growing countries.</p>
          <p>Before answering your questions with Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and G&#xE9;rard, I would like to remind you of our action plan for the second semester. First, we'll work actively on our regulatory environment and on long-term contracts to improve profitability and visibility. We will pursue integration and restructuring of the group including the announced reorganization of the Energy Europe business line</p>
          <p>that Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will take in charge. To focus on efficiency and value creation, we will implement the unique and promising partnerships announced today with the CIC. We will continue to strictly monitor our CapEx to deliver profitable growth, and we will preserve our sound financial structure delivering on our portfolio optimization program.</p>
          <p>I'm also very happy to announce our upcoming Investor Days, first with IPR on September the 14th, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:56) GDF SUEZ a unique know-how on large projects by the end of the year. Thank you very much for your attention, and we are ready to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>And before that, let me take this opportunity to express on behalf on myself and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois and the group, my warm thanks and all my gratitude to G&#xE9;rard Lamarche for the work he has done during these 23rd years in the group since today was his last results presentation for GDF SUEZ. As you may know, perhaps, Isabelle Kocher will replace G&#xE9;rard as CFO of GDF SUEZ on October the 1st.</p>
          <p>So, now, let's take your questions. Who wants to ask the first question? Please, if you have a question, you present yourself and ask your question.</p>

          <p>We will now take our first question from Emmanuel Turpin in Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Two questions, please. First of all, could you please update us on your guidance for 2013? I haven't heard anything that makes me anticipate a change except maybe for some slight delays to some capacity commissioning. So, that was my first question.</p>
          <p>Number two, could you help us calculate through the string of disposals you've announced. We now have estimates of the proceeds for this year. Could you help us through the contribution to your earnings from these assets, mainly Atlantic LNG and Noverco, maybe the others as well if you've got an estimate of the dilution to earnings from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:29) stake in the E&amp;P business, as well? That would be helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Mr. Turpin. I will answer to the first question and suggest that G&#xE9;rard answer to the second one. We have not given any new guidance for the 2013, no change to date. We'll make an update if necessary with the full-year results next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the second question is what is the impact of the disposal program on 2011 and on the full-year basis. So, for 2011, the cash proceed of the disposal program will be &#x20AC;1.2 billion booked in the first half and &#x20AC;5 billion in the second half, so a total proceed of above &#x20AC;6 billion.</p>
          <p>We are going to book <mark type="ph" /> 31.5 billion (51:34) of capital gain this year. And the transaction will be neutral on the EBITDA and the bottom line in 2011. On the full-year basis, of course, there will be a negative impact on the EBITDA of roughly &#x20AC;700 million, which was taken into account in the guidance, in the medium-term guidance. And the impact on the bottom line will be dilutive 3% only because we have reached very high level of valuation for all these transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard. Second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Per Lekander in UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to all of you. I have three questions, but before I do that, I would also follow up on G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet's comment and congratulate G&#xE9;rard Lamarche on excellent achievement during your seven years as CFO. I'm convinced that all us long-term analysts in the stock would agree with me that you have done an exceptional job to strengthen the company's financial reporting and communication and making GDF SUEZ arguably the global leading utility. Best of luck in your forthcoming new job. So my three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on gas 2012, you talked about the March results of 100 terawatt hours and &#x20AC;6 megawatt-hour spread. So, it could be like &#x20AC;600 million downside into 2012. What would be your estimate right now? Is it still feasible to get a renegotiation? And if not, what would be a year-on-year mark-to-market impact on the gas business? And <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:39), sales in Europe.</p>
          <p>Second, you are still talking about &#x20AC;11 billion of annual CapEx, and you have previously said that you are going to invest less in Europe and more outside of Europe, and what you are doing today is kind of highlighting that. That's probably going to be the case. Can you break down a bit on this CapEx by region and by company? And more specifically, do you have a budget for IPR in terms of CapEx?</p>
          <p>And third, &#x20AC;17 billion to &#x20AC;17.5 billion EBITDA guidance at normal weather and you're saying &#x20AC;465 million of negative year-on-year weather impact, but last year was not normal and so, I wonder, how much should we really think taking into account on this year relative &#x2013; a normal year not relative to last year when it was very cold? That was my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Certainly the first &#x2013; so, for the first question, for '12 now, because '11 is clearly done, and we have announced what we expected in term of revenues and EBITDA for this year. For '12, which remains open in term of terawatt hour, 70 terawatt hour for the remaining &#x2013; for all '12 at that particular juncture. So, this 70 terawatt hour has to be closed according to the market developments. If you take &#x2013; and before &#x2013; so the negotiation, if you take the amount which will be at stake in term of revenues, and you take a spread around &#x20AC;5 to &#x20AC;6, &#x20AC;6 multiplied by 70-terawatt hour means around roughly &#x20AC;400 million which are at stake and this is the bulk, and that figures would be reduced by the renegotiations that we are currently doing with our suppliers. So, the end result is not today very precise because it depends on the results of the negotiation. But you have the big figures, which is at stake, around &#x20AC;400 million on the &#x20AC;5 to &#x20AC;6 spread, which is currently the market spread. And naturally, this figure has to be for us reduced after the negotiations with our suppliers.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. G&#xE9;rard, for the second question of Mr. Lekander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the second question is the weather impact, the negative weather impact for the first half is &#x20AC;465 million. So, compared to the guidance which was &#x20AC;17 billion to &#x20AC;17.5 billion including &#x2013; assuming a normal weather condition, you have to deduct &#x20AC;465 million. And there was a question about the capital allocation strategy and how much we are going to invest in our international business out of the &#x20AC;11 billion of guidance. So, this year it will be between &#x20AC;3 billion and &#x20AC;4 billion of CapEx for International Power and in the coming years are slightly more depending on the project that we will have. And of course, you know that we decide to make investment on project for their own merits.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Two questions if I may. Firstly, on the production target for the exploration and production business so you already achieved the 60 million barrels or you're going to achieve them this year or as if I remember correctly, previously, you were achieving about 50 million barrels going to 60 in 2013. So, does this mean that we can expect an additional 10 million barrels up to 70 million by 2013?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the reorganization of your European business, could this yield additional cost savings since you haven't necessarily expanded your cost-saving targets beyond 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I should just pass it to G&#xE9;rard for answer to the first one and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois to the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the exploration and production business, you're right. We are going to produce 60 million barrel of oil equivalent this year, and you can expect an additional 10 million before 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, the reorganization of Europe, clearly, there will be synergies that are naturally in line with our reorganization both in term of revenues and in term of costs. It's too soon to tell you now what is at stake, the level which is at stake, but we'll come back later on to give you some update about what we are expecting from this reorganization in term of synergies, more in the beginning of next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Any question, perhaps Leyre from Exane if he is back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question will come from Martin Young in Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to everybody. Three quick questions hopefully. Could you expand a little bit more on the EBITDA impact that you mentioned from disposals on a full-year basis, 700 million, what the key items within that are, because the way I've been looking at it, a number of the disposals that you're making are for minority stakes? Secondly, could you just give us an indication on what the net income of the E&amp;P business is, so we can work out the minority stake that will result in your financials going forward?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, in relation to the negotiations that you currently have with the French authorities regarding the gas tariffs, what about the risk that there is no solution before 2012 given the impending election in France? Clearly, gas tariffs are likely to be something of a political hot potato in the run up to that election. So interested in your thoughts around potential delays in the negotiation process. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps just an indication of your last question and perhaps G&#xE9;rard could answer to the first two questions. Of course, we do not imagine that there would be no solutions before the elections. As you have seen in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:01), in July there has been an increase of the tariff for the non-individual, non-retail market, no increase for the retail markets, and that is the reason for which we are negotiating with the government and the regulator.</p>
          <p>And the regulator itself has clearly expressed a clear point of view asking for gas increase, tariff increase for the retail market for the 1st of October. So, we are working on a solution, and we do not imagine that &#x2013; with no solution. G&#xE9;rard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there are two questions. The first one is about the write-down of the &#x20AC;700 million negative impact on the EBITDA as a consequence of the disposal program. I have not been very accurate. The &#x20AC;700 million is the total impact on the EBITDA of the &#x20AC;10 billion disposal program and not only the &#x20AC;6 billion that we have announced today.</p>
          <p>So, &#x20AC;700 million negative impact on the EBITDA is for the &#x20AC;10 billion disposal program. That's point number one. And I've mentioned the dilution of 3%, it's also for the &#x20AC;10 billion disposal program and not only for the &#x20AC;6 billion that we announced today.</p>
          <p>The second question is the net result of the E&amp;P business, the net result of the E&amp;P business including EFOG, Elgin-Franklin, as of December 2010 was &#x20AC;276 million. And I need to give you the contribution of EFOG and I will give it to you in a minute.</p>

          <p>Hello. Bertrand Lecourt from Deutsche Bank. I had a couple of financial questions for you. Regarding this &#x20AC;17 billion to &#x20AC;17.5 billion in EBITDA, is this considering average weather <mark type="ph" /> and tariffs (1:04:54), but does this include the disposals announced in the first half? There's no value creative aspects on the second half. What's the tax expected &#x2013; the tax rate expected for the full year, and in terms of financial expenses, it's less than I expected &#x2013; can we expect the net financial &#x2013; interest expense to be below &#x20AC;2 billion or &#x20AC;2.5 billion in all? And then could you tell us whether we've reached the lowest level regarding the Benelux in 2011 and the gas in terms of EBITDA growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Answering your first question, &#x20AC;17 billion, &#x20AC;17.5 billion guidance for 2011 is obviously to be considered not counting the impact of the bad weather in H1, so that's before bad weather and not including a retail gas tariff risk in H2. The impact of divestments however has been factored in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tax rate, I told you that it was 34% for the first half. And it will be in the coming months and the coming years stable at 34%, okay. Then I come back on the net earnings of the E&amp;P business. I mentioned &#x20AC;276 million, including EFOG. And excluding EFOG it is in the region of &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I believe we can say that it is the lowest level if we take our assumptions which are that &#x2013; progressive recovery of all our emerging markets over time. And for the gas business, we expect that '12 will be an improved market compared to '10 and '11. And for the electricity prices which are naturally key for the revenues of the Benelux, it is under the assumption that you &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> they are including in one slide (1:07:36) i.e. power prices for &#x2013; the electricity around &#x20AC;50 per megawatt.</p>
          <p>So, under these assumptions, clearly we will see an improved growth of revenues over '12 and beyond, naturally, again, under the current circumstances. Recently there has been a lot of voices around the economic development and growth in Europe and in the US, so, that's naturally depending on that situation. But globally, under our assumptions which are, for the time being, quite normal and conservative assumption, there will be an improved revenues next year compared to this year, yes.</p>

          <p>The following question from Eric Lopez of Merrill Lynch. Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions about retail gas, France. Could you give us your expectations of effect on Q4 if there is no increase in tariffs in October because of the volatile oil prices. What are your assumptions in terms of the cost of oil in euros for the last few months ending in August? If the oil price remains at $104 per barrel, no effect of tariffs in October, what would be the effect on the gas retail branch in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ballpark figure, the assumptions we're hearing today on the revenue shortfall in Q4 predicated on dollar prices of roughly $100 a barrel. That gives us the &#x20AC;340 million for Q4. The brunt of the effort comes in Q4 naturally because that is where most of our revenue is coming from, and that is where the shortfall would potentially be greatest if we are to remain on a basis of $100 barrel.</p>
          <p>Then there should be no major price hike in 2012, but obviously this is going to depend on what happens to the price of the barrel. If the barrel goes up in 2012, then obviously there are going to be additional requirements. There's going to be, should we say, a further pass-on effect reflected in tariffs.</p>
          <p>But if we have a barrel costing &#x2013; still costing around about $100 as of January, then there should be no major upheavals to be expected in our case. But once again, it depends on what happens to the barrel in 2011. If you take a $120 barrel in 2011 then obviously we're going to have a spillover into 2012, not if it stays around $100.</p>
