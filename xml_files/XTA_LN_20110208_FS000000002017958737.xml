        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the presentation of our results for 2010. I'd like to welcome those who are attending the presentation via webcast or by telephone.</p>
          <p>As usual, I'm joined by our group's CFO, Trevor Reid. Next to him, Chief Executives of each of the business units; Santiago Zaldumbide, the Executive Director of Xstrata and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc; Ian Pearce, Chief Executive of Xstrata Nickel; Charlie Sartain, Chief Executive of Xstrata Cooper; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive, Xstrata Coal; and Peet Nienaber, Chief Executive of our Alloys business. Thras Moraitis is also in the audience, and I see that our Senior Non-Executive Director, David Rough, is sitting at the back as well.</p>
          <p>So, I'm sure after the presentation any of you would like to make a few points to him, he'd be available to take them.</p>
          <p>I have to apologize for my voice. I'm sort of recovering from a cold, but that doesn't affect the warmth that I feel about these results. And so, while you won't have the use &#x2013; the usual dolce of modulator tones, and you'll have to live with the sort of monolog of throat infection. Just bear in mind, the results themselves overcompensate for that in equal measure. So a strong financial and operational performance in 2010 obviously contributed to a very exciting year for Xstrata.</p>
          <p>The opportunities seized during the difficult market conditions of 2009 to restructure the higher cost businesses, improve productivity, strengthen the balance sheet, and together with the ongoing initiative to improve the quality and value of our underlying business positioned Xstrata to benefit from the much more favorable operating environment in 2010. Average commodity prices rose substantially over the prior year, reflecting improved market sentiment, particularly in the second half as macroeconomic concerns over the European sovereign debt issues eased and strong fiscal demand emanated from the developing economies.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, operating EBITDA rose to $10.4 billion and attributable profit increased 86% to $5.2 billion or $1.70 on a per share basis. And strong cash generation from our operations of just under $10 billion in addition to the cash flow from Glencore's exercise of its options to acquire or re-acquire the Prodeco coal operations in the first half contributed to significantly improved balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So consequently, net debt was reduced by 38% compared to 2009 to $7.6 billion, gearing fell to 15% on a net debt to equity basis &#x2013; the net debt to net debt plus equity basis compared to 26% at the end of 2009. And this is despite the total CapEx of $6.1 billion including $4.3 billion of expansion in CapEx to advance this organic growth pipeline, which we've been speaking about for some time.</p>
          <p>Production records, we achieved for hard and semi-soft coking coal and also for nickel. Our volumes of mined copper, chrome and lead in concentrate rose in comparison to 2009, with very strong momentum in volumes in the second half of the year, despite some weather-related impacts at the end of 2010, which unfortunately continued into 2011, and I'm sure you will have questions on that to Peter Freyberg later.</p>
          <p>Year-on-year cost savings have become, as you know, a hallmark of Xstrata's operational performance since the IPO. And in 2010, our teams realized a record cost saving of $541 million in real terms, representing 3.4% of the operating cost base. And in the past two years, we have reduced our operating cost base by over $1 billion in real terms. And all Xstrata's commodity businesses are now in the lower half of the cost curve.</p>
          <p>I sense that the growth trend currently underway is progressively bringing about another step change in cost competiveness over the next three years, which I think is going to be very exciting development.</p>
          <p>Our businesses once again successfully expanded our resource base to preserve or enhance the longevity and value of these operations. And I note in this regard a substantial increase in copper mineral resources at the joint venture, Collahuasi operation in Chile, underpinning the potential to expand that operation to 1 million ton producer and we've had significant copper resource upgrades also at El Pach&#xF3;n in Northern Argentina and recently at Frieda River in Papua New Guinea, and we just announced further upgrades to resources at Frieda River today.</p>
          <p>The safety and environmental performance are equally important indicators at Xstrata of management and operational performance. And in 2010, we were recognized as the sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. And for the first time, all managed operations achieved our target of operating without any moderate or more serious environmental incidents.</p>
          <p>And our businesses continue to make, I think, very significant progress in reducing the frequencies of all injuries sustained at our operations. And our total recordable injuries in fact reduced by 20% year-on-year, including contractors, which is a 79% improvement over the last eight years.</p>
          <p>Now, during the year, we made substantial progress in bringing a number of our organic growth projects into production and advanced the development of both late and early-stage opportunities in the pipeline. And we are now in the midst of a fundamental transformation of our portfolio through the development of our organic growth pipelines.</p>
          <p> Still a number of projects being developed by our teams today represent a step change in our growth strategy, equivalent and in fact even more transformational to many of the acquisitions &#x2013; the transformational acquisitions we did in the last few years. And it will, as I've said, have a big impact on transforming indeed Xstrata's volumes and unit costs profoundly.</p>
          <p>Momentum gathered pace in 2010 in three major new mines we successfully commissioned, adding low cost coal and nickel production from Goedgevonden, Blakefield South and Nickel Rim South and obviously in the nickel division. A further ten projects were approved and are now in implementation, including Antapaccay and the Las Bambas copper projects in Southern Peru, two co-expansions at Ulan West and Ravensworth North, and expansion also of the George Fisher zinc lead mine at Mount Isa and the second phase expansion to the Lion chrome smelting operation complex in South Africa.</p>
          <p>So, while this organic expansion will underpin Xstrata's growth and transformation over the next several years, we've also been clear that we remain alive to M&amp;A opportunities. And I get asked this question often, about is there a change in strategy? No, there's not a change in the strategy. We focus on where the value can be found. So, we remain alive to these opportunities.</p>
          <p>And we announced an agreed offer to acquire Sphere Minerals, an Australian listed junior mining company with three iron ore projects in Mauritania. These projects include potential near-term production from the Askaf project and longer-term growth from the large-scale El Aouj project, which will provide exposure to the attractive iron ore market, further diversifying our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Xstrata currently owns in excess of 75% of the company, and the integration of that company operations &#x2013; Sphere into the operations &#x2013; into Xstrata is well advanced. The iron ore projects are being managed through our coal business, sharing the substantial expertise available in bulk mining and project development and logistics.</p>
          <p>Now, the acquisition of Sphere was in fact our second foray into the iron ore sector, having less than a year after we obtained an option to acquire a stake in the early stage Zanaga iron ore project in the Republic of Congo. As we have announced today, Xstrata has agreed to exercise its option to acquire 50% plus one share interest in Jumelles, the owner of the Zanaga project, in exchange for funding a feasibility study.</p>
          <p>Each of our major projects have made good progress this year and since approval in January, and in total our teams are now building 20 growth projects, including &#x2013; totaling $18 billion of capital expenditure, of which $14 billion is still to be spent. Five of the projects in construction are due to commence operations this year, including Mangoola, ATCOM East and &#x2013; Mangoola ATCOM East coal projects, and the Antamina projects as well as the Newlands underground extension and the Black Star Deeps zinc project at Mount Isa.</p>
          <p>Now, capital projects representing an additional capital spend of something like $7.5 billion are due to reach approval stage during the course of this year, and a range of early-stage opportunities are continuing to progress through feasibility &#x2013; into feasibility as well.</p>
          <p>The Koniambo nickel project in New Caledonia remains on track to commence production, and the pictures you see in front of you, I think, are an exciting example of how a big project comes into fruition. And so, we are on track really to commence production next year before ramping up to full production in 2014.</p>
          <p>During 2010, the project achieved a number of key milestones, including the completion of the dredging for the port, construction of the power station stack and the successful construction and delivery of the modules required to construct the metallurgical complex from the engineering yard in China, and I'm pleased to say that Ian didn't have to go down with any ships. They all arrived safely and you can see many of the modules inside.</p>
          <p>And all the modules, in fact, have been restored by the end of last month. On-site construction for the metallurgic facility and the power station is currently underway and will be complete in the early part of next year to allow testing, commissioning to commence. The project is clearly entering its peak construction phase with some 3,500 employees and contractors currently onsite.</p>
          <p>With respect to the almost $1.5 billion Antapaccay expansion to the Tintaya copper mine in Southern Peru, which as you know was approved in July as part of the integrated regional strategy to progressively increase copper production from sell through to 500,000 tons by the end of 2014. And in the six months since that project was approved, facilities for the construction camp have been completed to accommodate the current 1,600 workers on site and this will increase to 4,500 people by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>The on-site construction for the foundations of the crusher and the three large grinding mills is progressing on schedule and all the major components for the mills are ready in Peru, ready to be installed. Commissioning is clearly on track for the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, the successful completion or the successful execution of Antapaccay lays the foundation for the Greenfield $4.2 billion Las Bambas project also approved during the second half of last year. Las Bambas will share key infrastructure of Antapaccay, achieving operational and capital synergies and enabling skills to be transferred on the completion of Antapaccay project to the construction of Las Bambas.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to hand over to Trevor, who's going to take you through the financial review and overview of 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Mick, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. As usual, our financial and operating performance during the year is set out in great detail in our preliminary full-year results statement and in the pack that you have with you. And so this morning, I'm going to limit my presentation to summarize the key points.</p>
          <p>Robust demand growth in the developing economies and the tentative recovery in OECD supported the strong rebound in commodity prices during the course of 2010, and this underpinned a 34% increase in group revenue to over $30 billion. While uncertainty surrounding the US economic recovery and European sovereign debt concerns weighed on commodity prices in the second quarter, base metal spot prices rose steadily in the second half of the year, as fears of a double dip recession abated and the US economy has continued to recover.</p>
          <p>Copper prices have been particularly firm during the period and closed the year at a high of $9,650 per ton, some 30% higher than at the end of 2009. Nickel and zinc prices followed the similar trend. Realized ferrochrome and thermal coal prices rose over the first half and while contract prices were slightly lower in the second half, spot prices showed strength into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Strong operational cash flows enabled debt to be repaid, down rapidly, reducing cash finance cost by 31% to less than $300 million in 2010. And the effective tax rate remained at 25%, as per the guidance provided at our interim results. Now, given the current high prices for our commodities and our positive outlook for the rest of the year, I do expect that the tax rate will increase slightly in 2011 to some 27%.</p>
          <p>Attributable profit before exceptionals increased by 86% to $5.2 billion of which $2.9 billion was generated in the second half. To put this in context, the second half results exceeded our full-year results of $2.8 billion in 2009. Earnings per share before exceptional items for the year are $1.07, which represents a 69% increase over 2010 &#x2013; 2009.</p>
          <p>Exceptional items largely relate to the non-cash impairment charge which we signaled in December in respect of the deferred Araguaia nickel project in Brazil. This impairment is primarily due to the high priority which we have assigned to other projects in Xstrata nickel pipeline, including Koniambo and its subsequent potential expansion, Kabanga in Tanzania, and the Falcondo operation in the Dominican Republic.</p>
          <p>The momentum in earnings growth that began in the second half of 2009, continued throughout 2010 with operating EBITDA rising by 53% to $10.4 billion. And as we pointed out that in December EBITDA ran at a level of $1.4 billion for that month. Second half EBITDA in 2010 was just below $6 billion and was 31% higher than in the first half.</p>
          <p>Stronger market conditions led to improved prices and sales volumes in most of Xstrata's businesses and the result was also positively impacted by the ongoing benefits of the restructurings of our nickel and zinc businesses, which we undertook in 2009, and by the commissioning of new lower cost production from organic growth projects in 2010.</p>
          <p>Recovering demand and ongoing constraints to supply have supported significantly higher average base metal prices than in the previous year. Average LME copper, nickel and zinc prices increased by 46%, 48% and 30% respectively, while strong demand in the stainless steel sector also lead to a 46% increase in ferrochrome prices.</p>
          <p>The overhang of lower thermal and semi-soft coal contract prices settled in 2009 for the Japanese full year to April impacted received thermal and semi-soft prices during 2010. However, this was offset by higher received coking coal prices, which rose by 41% in line with improved global steel production. The fact that almost $6 billion of this EBITDA was delivered in the second half and that prices and market fundamentals remain robust, all goes well for our progression into 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to a brief overview of the operational performance of each of our commodity businesses, starting with Xstrata alloys. Recovering market conditions and restocking provided the stronger pricing environment in both chrome and platinum, allowing the alloys business to jump start idle chrome capacity using the skilled workers we had retained during the downturn, and once again demonstrating the flexibility of our ferrochrome smelting operations. Chrome production increased by just under 50% for the year.</p>
          <p>Despite significant inflation in South Africa, Peet and his team achieved real cost savings of $77 million, due to economies of scale from increased production, improvements in electrical energy efficiencies and a reduction in the use of higher priced coking coal, which helped to counter the ongoing pressures of the strong rand and higher electricity prices. We continue to progress the expansion at the Eland platinum complex, where production is now set to double by 2015 and first production is expected from the western decline shaft during the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>At the Lion ferrochrome facility, a second-phase expansion for the smelting complex is underway, once again using Xstrata's proprietary energy-efficient technology, and following the success of the Bokamoso mega-palletizing plant, which we commissioned in 2008, the Tswelopele palletizing plant was approved during the year, which will deliver additional energy efficiency savings and will optimize all consumption at our smelters.</p>
          <p>Xstrata coal navigated a challenging 2010, with adverse weather conditions in the early part of the year in South Africa and Australia, above-average rainfall in Columbia and in December unprecedented flooding in Queensland. Now, excluding the impact of the difficult weather conditions and the prolonged strike, which we endured at the Togara coking coal mine Xstrata coal responded well to deliver $181 million in real cost savings over the period.</p>
          <p>These savings were primarily due to a 44% increase in production at the Oaky Creek complex, improved strip ratios and cost efficiencies at the Cerrej&#xF3;n joint venture in Columbia and the successful commissioning of the new low-cost Tweefontein open-cut mine in South Africa.</p>
          <p>The full impact of adverse weather on production in 2011 is still being assessed and depends largely on the speed of recovery in the logistics chain and on the extent of future rainfall. Current spot prices have responded to the inevitable supply constraints, and at this stage, it does not appear that despite the fact that we will lose some tons, the flooding will have a material impact on the profitability of the coal business as a whole.</p>
          <p>During the period, we successfully commissioned the Blakefield South and Tweefontein mines, and Peet and his team are now in the midst of their ambitious expansion program that includes the Mangoola greenfield project, the Newlands Underground extension, Ulan West and Ravensworth North thermal coal projects, all of these being in Australia, and the ATCOM East project in South Africa. All of the projects are progressing well and Mangoola, which is the most advanced project, is on budget and ahead of schedule to commission its coal handing and prep plant in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Mined copper production was broadly flat after a significantly stronger second half performance. Real cost savings of $52 million were achieved, despite the significant negative impact of lower grades at a number of older operations, which added $47 million to unit costs in the period. This highly-creditable cost performance offset the impact of stronger local currencies at existing operations and managed to reduce C1 cash cost to below $0.90 per pound. It's a truly staggering performance by the copper division.</p>
          <p>Our copper business benefits from an industry leading portfolio of growth options, the approval of Antamina, Antapaccay and the Las Bambas projects during the year were major milestones and Charlie's team is now constructing five major projects in Peru, Chile and Australia which will add 50% to volumes by the end of 2014 while &#x2013; and this is extremely important, also significantly reducing operating costs. A range of additional growth opportunities are currently in the feasibility phase, and as, Mick mentioned, we continue to add to our copper resource base as work continues to define these earlier stage opportunities.</p>
          <p>In 2010 the transformation of Xstrata nickel into a large-scale, low-cost producer was evident. Record production of mined and refined nickel was achieved in 2010, thanks to Nickel Rim South reaching nameplate capacity some six months ahead of schedule and expansions at a number of other key assets, including Raglan and our Australian mines, together with a strong overall operating performance.</p>
          <p>Xstrata nickel's C1 cash cost profile has undergone a remarkable transformation since 2008 when at that stage it was a third-quartile producer at over $5 a pound. C1 cash costs are now dramatically lower in 2010 and ahead of expectations at some $2.16 per pound, positioning the business low in the second quartile on a sustainable basis. The development of Koniambo in New Caledonia will consolidate this cost position while adding significant volume when it commences production in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the near term, nickel volumes are set to benefit from the restart of the Falcondo operation in the Dominican Republic, which we're starting at 50% capacity and while Falcondo is a high-cost operation at current nickel prices, it delivers attractive margins and the cost to restart production are modest. We are continuing to review options to convert the plant's energy source permanently and so transform Falcondo into a more sustainable producer throughout the cycle.</p>
          <p>Once more, Xstrata's introduced unit cost at a remarkable rate as the benefits of operational excellence and capital-efficient expansions at Mount Isa and McArthur River continue to bear fruits throughout 2010. In total, Xstrata zinc achieved real cost savings of $163 million, continuing their unbroken record of annual cost reductions.</p>
          <p>C1 cash costs on an integrated mine and smelter basis have been reduced by 40% over the last two years from $0.51 per pound in 2008 to less than $0.31 per pound at the end of 2010, a feat all the more remarkable in the context of such strong producer currencies.</p>
          <p>Approval was obtained in 2010 for the Bracemac-McLeod development in Canada and at Mount Isa, the expansion of the George Fisher zinc-lead mine and the Black Star Deeps project. Xstrata zinc also recently agreed to acquire the remaining 25% stake in the high-grade Lady Loretta deposit where a feasibility study is currently underway.</p>
          <p>Combined with the potential expansion of the Handlebar Hill mine and the George Fisher and Black Star expansions, these projects will exploit Xstrata's extensive zinc resource space in the Mount Isa area which remains the largest zinc resource in the world.</p>
          <p>Turning back to our financial performance, this chart demonstrates the significant benefit to operating profit of improved sales prices, which contributed $4.5 billion to operating profit compared to the previous period. Just under half of this increase is coming from stronger copper prices. Increased volumes across most of our businesses contributed a further $244 million.</p>
          <p>Our teams, once again delivered a strong cost performance, trimming $541 million from operating cost base in real terms, with particularly strong performances from our coal and zinc businesses. The cost savings more than offset the negative impact of CPI inflation and higher prices in mining specific inputs, which together reduced our operating profits by some $470 million.</p>
          <p>While the impact of inflation, specific to the mining industry was significantly less than that seen in the period prior to the global financial crisis, we are seeing now that inflationary pressures have started to build. As an increase in capital projects, primarily by the major mining companies has once again increased demands for skills, equipment and key inputs.</p>
          <p>Adverse foreign exchange movements reduced earnings by $1.3 billion, compared to the previous period, as the majority of Xstrata's operating currency strengthened against the US dollar. The Australian dollar was 16% stronger, while the South African rand depreciated 13% and the Canadian dollar 10%. Depreciation and amortization increased, mainly due to higher mining volumes across our businesses. And other income and expenses include higher demurrage charges, industrial action and the impact of the severe wet weather conditions largely in our coal business.</p>
          <p>Xstrata's operations generated almost $10 billion of cash in 2010, 88% higher than in 2009 and this enabled a rapid deleveraging of our balance sheet. Despite a significant increase in expansionary capital spending, up some 77%, cash flow after capital expenditure was a healthy $2.4 billion. At the year end, net debt was $7.6 billion with gearing at 15%, down from 26% at the previous year end. Lower gearing led to significantly reduced interest payments, while cash tax payments increased by 93%, due to increased earnings.</p>
          <p>During the year, the group entered into a new syndicated loan totaling $4 billion further extending Xstrata's debt maturity profile and providing the group with a total of $8.7 billion of undrawn committed facilities. The new syndicated loan is without financial covenants and the covenants under our existing revolving loan have also been removed. I can see there are a number of representatives of our syndicate banks here today, and I just want to take this opportunity once again to thank you for your ongoing support.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure during 2010 was targeted at the completion of a number of near-term, high-return expansions while commencing or advancing a number of significant longer-term growth projects, particularly in coal, copper and nickel. And these are the projects that provide the pillars for our future growth. Expansion capital spending was $4.3 billion in the year, which is just under my previous guidance, which I gave you in August.</p>
          <p>Single largest item of growth CapEx was at Koniambo, where $1.2 billion was spent to bring the project to just under 70% completion. Other major items included the Mangoola and ATCOM East coal projects, due to start production this year and early-stage construction in Antapaccay project in Southern Peru, which was approved in the second half of the year. Sustaining capital expenditure of $1.8 billion reflects an element of catch up after 2009 cash conservation measures and was in line with my previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Guidance for 2011 is for capital expenditure of approximately $6.8 billion of expansion capital and around $2 billion of sustaining CapEx. For expansionary capital in 2011, $3 billion will be targeted largely to progress the five major copper projects under construction, $1.9 billion on coal projects and $1 billion on our nickel portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, the Board's confidence in the medium term outlook for Xstrata is reflected in our decision to increase the final dividend while continuing to fund a significant expansionary capital program. The proposed final dividend of $0.20 per share amounts to $586 million which will be paid on the 13th of May, 2011 to shareholders who are registered at the 26 of April.</p>
          <p>A total dividend of $0.25 per share for the year is more than double the implied full-year level for 2009, and on a comparable basis, the final dividend of $0.20 represents a return to pre-crisis level and provides a platform from which we can restore our progressive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>On that positive note, I'll hand you back to Mick for his concluding remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Trevor. I think it's worth briefly recapping the evolution of Xstrata's strategy to deliver industry-leading value for our shareholders by growing and diversifying our business and continuously improving the quality of our assets. That strategy has remained in place since Xstrata's IPO some nine years ago. But as we have grown the business, so the range of options open to us to create value has grown exponentially.</p>
          <p>Today, Xstrata enjoys an unprecedented plethora of options, including opportunities to improve the value of our operations, prolific organic growth and opportunistic transformation and bolt-on M&amp;A. The initial stages, as you well know, of Xstrata's growth rely predominantly on a series of acquisitions to rapidly add scale and diversity to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>A second stage saw the judicious application of capital and operational excellence to turn around underperforming assets, together with an unrelenting focus on improving the quality and value of our operations and that continues today.</p>
          <p>A third phase of Xstrata's evolution is now coming into its own, as we transform our portfolio over the next few years and beyond that, through development of a number of near-term organic growth options. Now, as I noted to you in my opening remarks, this transformation is no less fundamental than a major acquisition, but its execution is within our control to a far greater extent than any on-market transaction today.</p>
          <p>As many of you are aware, organic growth is not new for Xstrata and our teams have already successfully delivered 14 new or expanded mines since IPO, including three projects which were completed last year. Xstrata's project pipeline is a product of many years of planning and preparation, as projects are nurtured through numerous approval stages, feasibility, environmental and social studies. A new component of the extensive feasibility and planning process is to eliminate or mitigate the risks involved individually in each project and cumulatively across the portfolio.</p>
          <p>So the entrepreneurial spirit which we fostered throughout the group is also clearly evident in our approach to how our management teams have taken to de-risking our growth pipeline. At Xstrata nickel for instance, a modular approach was adopted on the Koniambo project to use best value engineering expertise and minimize the risks of additional on-site activity in constructing a power plant and a complex metallurgical plant complex.</p>
          <p>Xstrata alloys and Xstrata zinc are using proprietary technology at their development projects to optimize the cost performance and the efficiency of their metallurgical operations. Xstrata copper, as was described by Charlie, perhaps 18 months ago, signed a strategic alliance with Bechtel to secure the skills and personnel required to deliver its major growth projects currently in development. And together with engineering partners, developed a standard concentrator design to fasttrack the construction and delivery of the concentrating infrastructure required.</p>
          <p>At each of our projects, we've also assiduously engaged communities early in the process to address any areas of concern and to work together with community members to deliver sustainable benefits from our presence in the region, with the ultimate aim of maintaining that sort of social license to operate.</p>
          <p>Now, it's the de-centralized management structure that is the core differentiator of Xstrata, and in my view, this underpins our entrepreneurial approach to project execution, just as it has done in our day-to-day operations and approach to M&amp;A. Our businesses are able to adopt innovative solutions to specific project challenges, respond more nimbly to local issues unencumbered by the constraints imposed by a single rigid approach to project development and limited resources and capacity which often befall centralized project teams.</p>
          <p>Once proven, innovative ways of responding to particular risks or technical issues are then widely disseminated and shared across the group to ensure that all our businesses enjoy the benefits of successful innovation. Our approach encourages projects to be developed by the same commodity management teams that will eventually be responsible for running the operations, ensuring maximum accountability throughout the process, enabling operational management to devote longer term, more strategic relationships with key stakeholders.</p>
          <p>The impact of our business of developing our internal growth options is profound. By the end of 2014, volumes will increase by 50% over 2009 production on a cost equivalent basis. Now, this is a consistent metric we've been giving you, and it's a metric which we stand by and will be delivered. The introduction of lower cost capacity is anticipated together with this, to deliver a reduction over 20% in average operating costs, again a consistent metric, which will be delivered, securing first and second quartile cost positions across our commodity businesses.</p>
          <p>I expect our proved and near-term projects deliver an average of turnaround 22%, predicated on what I think are conservative long-run commodity prices, and the average lives of our mines will extend to more than 50 years.</p>
          <p>So, work on earlier stage growth opportunities, of course, is equally significant. Capital will be spent over the next five years to complete conceptual pre-feasibility and feasibility studies into the next generation of projects, including the large scale Tampakan copper gold project in the Philippines, the awesome Wandoan coal project in Australia, and El Pach&#xF3;n copper project in Argentina, as well as the African iron ore projects, which we spoke about earlier.</p>
          <p>Amongst the various conceptual studies underway across the business, a study into sustainable expansion, the world class Collahuasi copper operation to produce 1 million of tons of copper per annum, is due to be completed in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Now, these projects are clearly at an earlier, less certain stage, but they offer the potential for very substantial further growth to sustain volume growth over the medium term. The potential inherent in these projects is underlined by the 60% increase in Xstrata's resource base over the last few years, with further additions to mineral resources expected this year, as we continue to work through our feasibility studies.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, Xstrata's growth strategy has been based on a conviction, now widely held, that the supply side of our industry is fundamentally constrained and will struggle over the short and medium term to meet burgeoning demand from populous industrializing nations. And following a short period of interruption during the downturn, this secular trend was once again reaffirmed in 11 as in 2010 as the impact of falling rates on the one hand, longer haulage distances, labor disputes and technical problems at existing aging operations, on the second hand, led to mine underperformance across the industry, while the timing of the onset of new sources of supply fell short of market expectations in most key commodities.</p>
          <p>Now, these issues are particularly acute in the copper industry. The growing deficit is apparent and the development of new copper projects remains challenging due to the skilled labor engineering shortages, more onerous environmental and planning and regulatory requirements, community dissent, and increased political risks. Challenging conditions in the geographies in which a large proportion of new copper projects are allocated are likely to exacerbate this trend.</p>
          <p>Additionally, capital costs continue to rise as the reemergence of mining sector inflation, as major mining companies ramp up their expansion plans and the cost of key inputs rises.</p>
          <p>In thermal coal, transport infrastructure constraints continue to impact new supply from Australia and South Africa. The supply growth remains highly dependent on government and private sector investment in rail and port infrastructure. And meanwhile, Indonesian supply &#x2013; historically, the primary source of supply growth &#x2013; faces dwindling quality and shorter mine lives than in Australia, South Africa or indeed, Colombia.</p>
          <p>China is now firmly established also as a net importer of coal, with domestic production constrained by increasingly stringent environmental regulations, logistic constraints, and the restructuring of a fragmented industry to close smaller, inefficient and unsafe operations.</p>
          <p>On the demand side, the story may, by now, be a familiar one to those who follow our sector, but is nevertheless a profound one for the future growth in Xstrata's &#x2013; or growth in demand for Xstrata's projects &#x2013; products. China, India, Brazil and other developing Asian economies will continue to fuel the lion's share of global growth in demand for commodities in the medium term.</p>
          <p>Over 300 million people will move to cities in China alone over the next 15 years. Over 300 million people were moved to cities in China alone over the next 15 years. A rising GDP per capita in China, India, other developing nations is giving rise to the inevitable increases in the intensity of metal and energy demand as those countries move up from their positions at the bottom of the global intensity curve.</p>
          <p>In 2011, developing economies and China in particular appear set to continue to achieve highly respectable growth in the high single digits, albeit below 2010 levels, due to the impacts of inflation and the sort of proactive actions by governments to contain economic growth to within manageable levels. Further actions to curb inflation are likely this year, following the monetary and fiscal measures imposed by China and India in 2010 that are, in my view, a positive sign that the authorities are proactively managing inflation to avoid the negative impacts of overheating.</p>
          <p>Chinese demand for commodities is increasingly supported by growing domestic consumption from the urbanization of Western China, both elements of a concerted effort by the government to reduce reliance on exports to the West. These factors are further supported by resurgence of foreign direct investment in China.</p>
          <p>The 12th five-year plan includes a target of 20% annual growth in the western province infrastructure investment, and 23 major new infrastructure projects worth $100 billion were approved in 2010. Now, all of this augers well for ongoing growth in demand, for early and mid-stage commodities.</p>
          <p>Global economic growth exceeded most expectations in 2010. In the OECD growth was bolstered by the inventory re-stocking and ongoing government measures, including stimulus spending, extended tax cuts, quantitative easing, but these short-term measures were succeeded by a stronger than expected manufacturing recovery in the Unites States and Germany. And looking ahead, leading indicators suggest that the US economy continues to find a reasonably solid track for recovery with management activity at a seven-year high, rising retail sales and unemployment, which is finally starting to fall. And this is despite continued weakness in the housing and construction sectors of that economy.</p>
          <p>In the Eurozone, January data for the manufacturing and services industries reveal the fastest pace of expansion in nine months. In particular, the German economy continues to strengthen, driven by its large manufacturing sector and robust export showing the fastest growth since 2001, second only to the post unification years. Nevertheless, market confidence in the rate of growth in the medium term has to be impacted by high unemployment persistence in European sovereign &#x2013; the high unemployment and persistent European sovereign debt concerns and the potential impact on growth of austerity measures.</p>
          <p>And in the nine short years since our IPO, Xstrata finds itself with a broader and deeper range of options to deliver growth at its disposal than ever before. Our internal portfolio of growth projects is extensive and industry leading and the next generation of projects is already being advanced to sustain the momentum we have created well beyond the next few years. We have built a recognized capability for identifying and executing disciplined acquisitions and integrating acquired assets rapidly and successfully, and we remain alive to the potential to opportunistically grow our business through value-adding acquisitions at business unit and group levels.</p>
          <p>Against the backdrop of a world-class risk management and governance framework, our devolved management culture supports an entrepreneurial approach at every level of the organization. Importantly, our balance sheet provides the financial capability to finance our organic growth program while allowing us the flexibility to assess a range of other external opportunities to create value.</p>
          <p>Xstrata today is one of the world's leading and largest diversified mining companies, with a robust portfolio of long-life operations in the lower half of the industry cost curves, diversified across numerous geographies and exposed to commodities that will continue to develop on the ongoing urbanization of China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies.</p>
          <p>The next stage of our transformation is now well underway. To exploit the various options embedded in our portfolio to create value through organic growth. So I remain very confident in Xstrata's prospects now and well into the future.</p>
          <p>So with those remarks now coming to an end, we, as usual, will open up the floor to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Just a couple of quick questions, firstly on cash management, 15% gearing is an unusual situation for Xstrata to be in. How do you think about your balance sheet management and the sort of gearing levels you'd like to run into the future?</p>
          <p>And on cash flow spending, and given the increases we're seeing in capital spending, is the Bechtel strategic alliance giving you the sort of control on cost increases that you'd like? And the final question is just the obvious one on the coal market, what are you seeing a) in coking coal obviously, but in the differences between the thermal markets in the Atlantic versus the Pacific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Actually we have Trevor, Charlie and Peet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, 15% is an unusually low level of gearing, but equally a company facing a capital spend like we've got is also relatively unusual for Xstrata. I think it was very important that we entered this phase not only with the structure of our debt, correct, and I think we've accomplished that but also the quantum, so that we are able to weather any buffers that we get from temporary declining commodity prices without compromising their capital program.</p>
          <p>As, Mick also alluded to, we have a number of major projects which we will be assessing and bringing forward hopefully for approval in 2011, and I have to see where that goes. But yes, I think your assessment on an ongoing basis, 15% being a low level, too low level of gearing is correct. I just don't think now is the time for us to be considering interesting things like share buybacks. I think that's a job for six months to 18 months time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charlie, do you want to comment on these de facto ranches, how they're working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think they're working well <mark type="inaudible" /> we're able to go in the agreement with them to establish labor rights that were in the index and that's a great formula and that's something I think that's put us in good stead, particularly as we're seeing some acceleration in construction and consulting costs outside of our framework agreement. And there's also been a fixed, an agreed margin for them on the overall project.</p>
          <p>And I think one of the flexibilities that we do have under that arrangement is that we can elect to take on the management of certain aspects of the project, for example some of the earthworks contract where we undertake that directly, if we feel that we've got the resources to do that and we can do that more cost effectively. So there's some real flexibility that's enabling us to have that competitive advantage, whilst ensuring that we continue to have access to their A teams in successive projects, which was another commitment under their contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then on the markets and differential?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Rob, you asked about the coking coal, I think we all know that the market was imbalanced later last year, but without any doubt these very serious flood events that we've seen in Queensland December through into this year, have had a very, very marked effect on the market. We are in a situation now where negotiations for the traditional quarterly or another traditional quarterly pricing are about to commence probably in the next month or so.</p>
          <p>And I think people are standing out of the market waiting to see what happens there, not withstanding that there has been some spot demand. And we certainly have sold a number of shipments into the market, a number of which are well over the $300 mark, which gives an indication of where the market might be going, certainly for the next quarter pricing. In terms of the thermal markets we saw last year, in fact the Atlantic market was in decline with low gas prices and so forth.</p>
          <p>And in fact a reduction of something like 20 million tons in their market in terms of demand. However all of that and more was taken up in the Pacific with growth and demand in China, where we saw something like an increase of net 65 to somewhere around 110 million tons thermal imports. We saw very strong import growth into India, Malaysia and so forth. So there was a very strong demand growth within the Pacific that balanced off that decline.</p>
          <p>We are expecting this year, though, that the Atlantic market will start to recover, and in fact there is some risks, given some of these supply folks that we've seen in Columbia with heavy rains and so forth. So that market might actually get quite tight. I think that's probably why you're seeing the forward curve sitting where it is at the moment at fairly high levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peet. Next question? Behind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Bogusz from Macquarie. Just a few questions, firstly for Charlie on copper, coal elasticity can you just us an update there on the port loader? Secondly, on the droughts in Chile and the impact to the hydropower and whether Xstrata's operations are affected at all, given that I think from memory most of the operations rely on the Northern grid, which is unaffected? And thirdly, just on ferroalloys, just an update on winter tariffs going forward post 2012, what the chat is there and whether there is potential for chrome or bands? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, in relation to the logistical aspects of coalesce since the ship loader failure, we're looking to distribute concentrate and ship concentrate through a number of other port facilities in <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And it's a significant trucking logistical exercise, as you could imagine, but the management is actually working towards progressively building up the number of trucks to deliver against that port. I believe yesterday we received authority from the Teekay port to be able to export from there.</p>
          <p>And so we'll have some lag effect on the shipments in the first half of the year, but it's unaffecting production. It's a question of managing down the stockpiles over the coming months. The shipload on current indications should be re-established within the next two to three months under most recent indications.</p>
          <p>I think you answered the question that you put in relation to the drought, where it's all about mines being on the northern grid there, unaffected by lower-than-average rainfalls in the south of the country. In fact, the biggest issue that we have at the moment is in Altiplano &#x2013; winter in Collahuasi, which is having higher-than-average precipitation in that area. But energy supplies and pricing hasn't been affected by the drought conditions in the south.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly on ferrochrome, the winter tariff is dramatically higher than the rest of the year's tariffs, and therefore, the ferrochrome production in South Africa really turned into the nine months production. So the winter months are used for maintenance, et cetera.</p>
          <p>If we achieve either the ferrochrome prices now after the Chinese New Year &#x2013; pick up the way we think it should &#x2013; then if the prices are high enough, we will continue to reduce. Otherwise, we'll do the normal maintenance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess going forward, is there any guidance from the government or Eskom in particular on where there's going to be sustained winter tariffs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We're sure. The winter tariff is going to stay for sure. Maybe after four or five years from now, then they'll consider to take it away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. It's Olivia Ker from UBS. Maybe it's a question for Charlie.</p>
          <p>China's about to enter its major restocking phase now. Do you think, at the current prices in copper and also in zinc, if there's any kind of potential for demand destruction going forward?</p>
          <p>And then just a question on coal. So the stepping forward from the CME price impacts now, in terms of infrastructure build and mine capacity ramp-up that we're looking for over the next one, two years or so, what sort of impacts are we going to see there? Is it going to be sort of funding diverted away, if it's government-based projects? Or just simply that the labor construction market gets very, very tight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Olivia, in relation to copper supplies at the high prices that we are currently seeing, you're referring to possible substitution away from copper? Repeating the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> traditional levels where they do turn to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we will see volume coming in. I think there's a necessity to now read into the market. I think there's a necessity to actually re-start some of that, even at the current prices.</p>
          <p>I think the challenge in the medium term now will be to protect those markets that copper has and make sure that we can ensure, we can have copper continuing to be delivered into those areas where it may be under threat from substitution. But we don't see that as a very substantial threat in the mid term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just answer your question on the infrastructure. It's a key issue. And we see thermal and coking coal markets being tight into the next few years, if not in deficit, in terms of supply.</p>
          <p>As far as New South Wales is concerned, I believe that there's a reasonable build plan in place for PWCS and NCIG ports. We are seeing investment into rail infrastructure. And certainly with the advent of Xstrata rail this year, we are extremely well positioned in terms of meeting our requirements for our growth plans in that state.</p>
          <p>But the pinch-point is likely to happen in Queensland, particularly around the Wiggins Island Coal Terminal, where decisions need to be made in the near future. And you're correct. Labor prices and the advent of LNG in that state could have an impact on the rollout of that port.</p>
          <p>I'm optimistic in as much as the network is well advanced, and we should be expecting a decision on the build fairly soon, early in this year in terms of phase one wicket.</p>
          <p>Rail is another issue in Queensland, and certainly if the needs of the industry are to be met, Queensland Rail are going to have to up their act quite some bit.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Nick Hatch from RBS. Two questions, Mick. First of all, Sphere iron ore. You've obviously been looking closely at the assets there for a couple of months now. Can you outline for us, please, your development plans for those iron ore assets?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I was wondering whether you care to offer up any thoughts on the attraction of the Drummonds Columbian coal assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's quite good that you asked that question, because one man can answer both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mick. Good passing.</p>
          <p>Sphere, certainly we took the business over late last year. we're sitting with over 75% of it now. And we have recently put an iron-ore team in place to start managing that plus scenario.</p>
          <p>The three main projects in Sphere are Askaf El Aouj, as was mentioned earlier on in <mark type="inaudible" />. Askaf is probably a project that can come &#x2013; be brought on fairly quickly. It's fairly straight forward cross-grain magna-type project. Whereas El Aouj is potentially something larger.</p>
          <p>Both of these projects are being worked on simultaneously. However, as far as El Aouj is concerned, there's a real need for us to examine our options and see whether or not, rather than the 7 million ton scale operation that was originally envisaged, where there could not be something larger, in fact significantly larger. And that may &#x2013; or will require us looking at options of actually building the plant down at the port.</p>
          <p>So these options are being studied. They're being accelerated. As I said, we have a team on board. And as we get these things into the feasibility phase, we will be able to talk a bit more accurately about delivery time tables.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the thing on Drummond is everybody understands and knows that the Drummond assets are very best assets in Columbia. That it really is up to Garry Drummond to talk about what his plans are, and that we would never comment on that sort of thing. And so I don't think we're going to change that precedent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Liam Fitzpatrick from Credit Suisse. Two questions.</p>
          <p>Firstly just on M&amp;A. Clearly you've got more of an organic focus at the moment, but do you still see any transformational deals out there for Xstrata? And if so, how would that affect your positioning as a high-growth company?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on Tampakan, can you just give an outline of the key milestones you see for that over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the issue of M&amp;A, I sort of guess the best position for us to be in is so we announce when we announce. And that you got to assume that our total energies are on producing this organic growth pipeline. It is the most transformational thing that we can see as line of sight of Xstrata. As transformational as any M&amp;A opportunity.</p>
          <p>You know, as well as I do, what the scope is for companies to consolidate in this industry. You also know how complex it is to do our market transactions. And so there is nothing that we are working on at the moment which is in any way going to compete with the organic growth pipeline that we're working on right now.</p>
          <p>But if the opportunity presents itself, it's in the universe of possible &#x2013; we would act as we always have acted. And I'm not one to in anyway sort of temper your enthusiasm for asking questions. It's a line of questioning which is actually &#x2013; I'm not going to be able ever satisfy you on, because this is just pure speculation on terms which I'm just not going to enter into.</p>
          <p>On the issue of Tampaken, Charlie, maybe I'll hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. Tampaken reached a couple of milestones during 2010. The first of those was the completion of the feasibility study, which by law, needed to be submitted to government. So that was undertaken in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>And we're continuing with value engineering work, based on the outcomes of that feasibility study. And we plan to continue that work for the balance of this year.</p>
          <p>Utilizing the timeframe and the critical path that the project is under at the moment, which is the Environmental Social Impact Assessment. That work was completed at the end of 2010, the first half of this year where we're now moving into the statutory public consultation phase for that prior to the submission of the ESIA to government, which will be mid this year. And then the timeframe is expected to be in the order of 12 months to go through that review process with government there.</p>
          <p>So by the end of the first half of next year, we should be in position there to be taking some key decisions on Tampaken.</p>

          <p>If we look at equity valuations in the mining sector, it seems that the market is not willing to discount a long-term high-price environment. So stocks and prices of &#x2013; commodity prices are peaking now and will be much lower in the not very distant future.</p>
          <p>And I guess if we look at the history of the sector, what we have here is very high commodity prices with an outlook of even bigger deficits going forward and possibly higher prices. That has historically inevitably led to a slowdown in global growth and much weaker commodity markets and lower mining share prices.</p>
          <p>So I guess the question is, what might be different this time that would lead us to believe that commodity prices at current, very high levels are more sustainable, and the impact to global growth of current very high prices won't be as significant as it has been in the past?</p>

          <p>Well, Chris, you're quite right in what you're saying. I mean the sector has de-rated, and that's true. Point is why it's de-rated, and you may well be right in your analysis &#x2013; that there is this view that the short term is one thing and the medium to longer term is an entirely different story.</p>
          <p>Why is it going to be different? Because this is different. I mean, the supply side of the industry is just going to deliver the supply. So you have to take your view therefore that has to be entirely on the demand side.</p>
          <p>This is not a question of rising supply to meet anticipated demand. If the demand falls away, you suddenly &#x2013; you have this glut of supplier <mark type="inaudible" /> capacity being built, has to be delivered. And industry being &#x2013; facing indigestion. Yes, you've got supply, which is battling to actually make up these expectations in demand.</p>
          <p>So you have to have a particularly negative view, a really low road view of future demand, for you to have the view that the industry rating should be at current levels.</p>
          <p>And I think this is actually reflected in what happened post-2008, post the financial crisis. I mean, there was a sharp reduction in commodity prices as the world sort of stopped working for a few months, and the pipeline sort of came to a shuddering halt.</p>
          <p>Like within the early stages of 2009, while the OECD was in a really bad phase &#x2013; I mean they're really struggling to come out of recession &#x2013; through to 2010, commodity prices soared. And so you have commodity prices now at levels well in excess of what they were &#x2013; copper is in excess of $10,000. Well, at its height in 2008, it wasn't $10,000. It was a couple of thousand dollars below that.</p>
          <p>The coal price is showing levels &#x2013; consistent levels now &#x2013; way ahead of what they were in 2007, when we thought the world was going to go &#x2013; and there never would be a correction. So even in the face of the most significant financial crisis the world has faced since the Great Depression of the Stock Exchange collapse in 1929, we've seen commodity prices at very significant &#x2013; at historically high levels.</p>
          <p>The point is that the supply side just cannot deliver a response. In a world where grades are declining every single month. And so existing grade operations, significant operations, are working harder and harder to stand still. And you see that in our results, you see that in the results of all our competitors. And you will continue to see that.</p>
          <p>And you've seen a situation where bringing new opportunities into the market, bringing those projects to even a decision level, let alone a construction level, is very, very difficult. People announce with great hoorah and blaring of trumpets when we're going to go into this project, but the actual construction decision never seems to take place.</p>
          <p>Why? Well, because they are in geographies, which have never booked grade projects before. So they have to be in countries, which don't have the manpower, which don't have the experience, which don't have the skills to actually build these things.</p>
          <p>If I look at the stuff that we're looking at in the medium to far term, and I see the challenges that we have to overcome, that's multiplied in many of the other projects which have far less potential than the stuff that we can bring on board.</p>
          <p>So the world actually is different and those people who are looking at the valuations of cash flows and how to risk cash flows, the mining industry can't replicate the 1980s and the 1990s and say that is the measure of how you're going to understand 2010 going onwards. It's a different world, a different set of dynamics, and that's the onset.</p>
          <p>I'll tell you something, if I owned 100% of Xstrata, I'd be jumping up and down every day when I got out of bed, because I would see dramatic cash flows coming through the door. Acknowledging that we are making investments, acknowledging that I'm re-investing a lot of that cash flow, but nevertheless I would see the potential for cash flow coming through the door, coming into my pockets.</p>
          <p>And now we've got a company, which is owned by the general market, and they're looking, and they're saying, it looks fantastic, but you know what? We're going to be a bit cynical about it &#x2013; crazy stuff. This is a different world, and a world where in fact there is opportunity for grabbing and writing on the sector, which the markets in fact are missing out, was a time to in fact understand the future of this industry through the prism of the past doesn't apply.</p>
          <p>Go back to when the time of the industrialization of the United States took place. Go back to the time of the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, the rebuilding of Japan after the Second World War. Those will give you clues as to what is the potential for the cash flows of this industry, not in 1980s and 1990s, there you are.</p>
          <p>I think it's a great time to pause. It's not going to get any better than that.</p>
