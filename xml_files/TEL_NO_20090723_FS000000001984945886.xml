          <p>Ladies and gentleman good morning and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's Results for the Second Quarter 2009.  My name is P&#xE5;l Kvalheim and I have the pleasure of guiding you through this morning's presentations.  We hope that everyone has the material made available, that is the press release, the quarterly report and the presentations to be used here shortly.  They can be found at the back of the room or on telenor.com.  You can watch this presentations live or in recording on the Internet or on a mobile phone and might also send in the written question during the transmission and information on these alternatives may be found on our website.</p>
          <p>As usual, there will be a Q&amp;A session after the presentations first here from the audience present, then from the ones participating on the phone, and finally the opportunity to conduct individual interviews.  To present our figures here today, we have our CEO, Mr. Jon Fredrik Baksaas; and our CFO, Trond &#xD8;. Westlie.  And without further due, I leave the floor to Mr. Baksaas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Paul.  And good morning to you and welcome to all of you here to Fornebu to this second quarter 2009 reporting.  There is a new business environment out there and there are certain effects in this also to the Telenor figures.  But on the other hand we're also seeing some of growth signs in some of our markets.  So, the picture is a bit balanced.  The macro trends that we saw earlier this year in the first quarter is more or less also coming through in this quarter's reporting package.  There is a continued pressure on the top line, but there are also some positive signs in some of our markets.  We communicated this at the beginning of this year and the priorities that we'll focus on this year was to secure cost efficiency and make sure that there is sound CapEx control around in our operating companies.  And I think I can say that on this second quarter reporting package I think we can say that we have shown performance in that direction.  We continued to execute on these priorities and we've seen the results both in terms of fairly solid EBITDA margin as well as the strong cash flow in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Coming to cash flow I will start in the Nordics.  Here we have a very strong performance in Norway this quarter.  There is a solid EBITDA margin in Mobile Norway, driven by revenue growth and lower sales and marketing spends.  And on the growth side both mobile and internet contributes as well as the ongoing migration of fixed voice minutes pouring into the mobile handsets.  There is a strong momentum on mobile internet from the broadband in all of the three Nordic markets in this quarter.  And all in all we've reached more than 500,000 connections.  The rebranding in Denmark, that was done in June, will focus strongly &#x2013; more strongly on the Telenor profile, and it will give a holistic market approach from our services in the Danish competitive marketplace.</p>
          <p>The 10 billion operating cash flow target, we've been moving in that direction in this quarter.  This is within reach towards the end of the year.  We're not there quite yet, but there is a steady improvement.  And the operating cash flow in this quarter was NOK 2.4 billion.  And Trond will comeback to this more in detail in his part of the presentation.</p>
          <p>In the Nordics, it's Sweden that is still our most challenging marketplace.  Here we have initiated a downsizing exercise for our &#x2013; for the organization which was announced in May, and it is expected to take place towards the end of this year.  And the full effects of this will come into the 2010 figures.  There is also a necessity to adjust CapEx and market-spend according to market development in general.  And also to be more precise on how we use our market activities and how we make ourselves visible in the competitive marketplace in Sweden.  The infrastructure sharing deal with Tele2, which has a more long-term profile, will secure an efficient CapEx situation for our Swedish operation many years into the future.</p>
          <p>Before I move to another region of our operations, namely that of Central and Eastern Europe, we've here seen an overall stabilization of the markets and macro situation in more or less all the countries, though the characteristics of this being a bit different from market-to-market.  This is for sure the case for Kyivstar, where we did see a small pickup in usage from Q1 with reasonably stable price level in the marketplace.  And due to a very strong OpEx control, we have been able to maintain the EBITDA margin in the 50s &#x2013; in the high 50s, despite the fairly high inflation rate in Ukraine.  And we are of course year-over-year harmed by the weakening of the Ukrainian hryvnia.  However, this currency has been fairly stable in this quarter compared to other currencies.  So, the drop seems to come towards the end of last year and into 2009.</p>
          <p>In Serbia, we've seen a lower year-over-year revenue growth than we have been used to in the last quarters.  But still we have been able to deliver a 30% cash flow margin.  There is an effect of the financial crisis in Serbia, and this has become more visible in this second quarter of 2009 than we've seen before and the government has also increased taxation, which may lead to usage drop to a certain extent coming forward.  But we also see that under circumstances like this, like in Hungary for example, that the market generally seen fairly quickly adjusts to these kind of parameters.  But there is a short-term effect we expect.</p>
          <p>Moving to Hungary, Pannon is able to keep EBITDA margin at the 40% level.  There is a revenue decline there mostly explained by the full in mobile termination rates.  And also here there is a tax hike on the excise size &#x2013; side of the tax system, where they have raised the VAT from 20 to 25% and may also, as a consequent, affect consumer spending in the shorter time span.</p>
          <p>In Russia, VimpelCom is doing fine.  During the last few months there has been an increased media focus on the conflict side of the relationship with our partner.  Our VIP shares have been arrested since 11th of March and for a practical purpose <mark type="inaudible" /> and then forward sales could have taken place.  This has not taken place, and as you know the activity level around this with our appeals, etcetera, is part of the final development in this case.  There is not very much new to report, other than the new hearing expected to take place, 30th of September, which is a delay from 10th of June.</p>
          <p>Coming to Asia, we see other positive trends similar to those in Norway, in particular in Grameenphone.  Grameenphone has maintained a very solid EBITDA margin in this quarter, leaves it in the high 50s.  There is a 10% organic revenue growth, despite &#x2013; I have to say &#x2013; also the fact that mobile termination rates were cut in half earlier this year.  But the price situation is fairly positive during this period of the year and that has also led to a fairly nominal growth in subscriber growth.  The IPO in Grameenphone is expected to take place towards the end of this year, but that has been a fairly long route to go, but now it looks like it's on-stream.</p>
          <p>Both Malaysia and Thailand has &#x2013; have reported their figures previously this week.  There is a pressure in both countries on revenues primarily coming from international calling patterns and however, the local activity seems to be fairly much in place.  In Pakistan, there we had a very good quarter experiencing significant customer growth close to 900,000, which is a very strong figure under present circumstances we feel and we are securing our number two position by this kind of customer growth.  And this is also their very best margin quarter reported from Telenor Pakistan so far.  The cash flow in Asia has then improved considerably throughout this year and as a consequence &#x2013; and this comes as a consequence primarily from the improvements in Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p>
          <p>In India, we are preparing for launch. In the year Q1 reporting package we indicated a slight delay from the initial launch point of time.  However, we are looking very strongly at a launch some time in Q4.  We have been able to be a bit more precise on the outlook for the figures of 2009 regarding India and Trond might come back to that. And there will also be occasions later this autumn after the Capital Markets Day in September to dive more deeply into the details of the Indian project.  Closing then in, we're maintaining our priorities for 2009, namely that of cost efficiencies and CapEx control, leading to improve the cash-flow margins.  And this comes as a consequence of the new tends in the marketplace that we are operating.  The results in the first half of 2009 confirms this direction we've managed to execute on exactly CapEx control and OpEx efficiencies and there is more to be done.  This awareness is growing in the Group.  There will be efficiency programs executed in all our operations in a bit of the manner as Thoralfsson described for DTAC  yesterday and we do expect for the rest of the year a continued pressure on revenues for the second half.  However, we're also very happy that the &#x2013; the growth elements in some of our markets seems to be something that we also can be looking forward to in the second half of this year.  And then of course the startup in India is our main focus for the second half of 2009.  And with these words I handover to Trond.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Fredrik and good morning ladies and gentlemen.  I'll go through the numbers for the second quarter.  Second quarter that is very much in line with the first quarter trends.  We see an organic revenue decline of approximately 3% and a stable EBITDA margin of 35.  We see that going from second quarter '08 we're coming from the 27 billion revenue base to approximately the same 27 billion.  So, nominal reported figures is approximately flat.  Then, you also see that the trend line in the margin actually develops roundabout the 35% level roundabout in the same quarters.  So, as a result going from also from the first quarter of this year we see a very stable trend going forward.</p>
          <p>Changes in revenues and EBITDA, in general we see a reported figure on flattish on 0.5%, an organic decline of 3.5, but we see an adjusted decline of 0.7%.  But as usual when you look at the dilemma or the portfolio of companies included, you'll see that it is a big variety of changes. Specifically on the revenue side you see that the Kyivstar is actually having a reported decline of almost 30% due to the currency changes.  The underlying changes in Ukraine though is that it is an organic decline on revenue &#x2013; on top line basis for approximately 8%, which is still the &#x2013; one of the highest levels that is not on the sort of influence by a one-time or one &#x2013; one instance &#x2013; incidents like in DTAC here which has a run-off from last year going in.</p>
          <p>Going to the EBITDA number, we see a very positive trend here in Mobile Norway and some of our Asian markets, but in general a slight decline in most markets leaving us as 0.7%.  In general, we have a currency &#x2013; a positive currency effect of Denmark and from the Asian region, all the others are basically slightly negative.  One element on this is of course that as a result of having a decline of 3% on the revenue side and maintaining the EBITDA margin you also see that we're actually able to keep the nominal level of cost.  So, in regards to looking at the inflation level in some of our countries we are actually have been able to maintain the cost level at certain basis in this first half year of 2009 compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Looking at the CapEx, we see that we have this quarter numbers on 3.3 billion and the &#x2013; it's a decline from last year of almost NOK 5 billion.  Going to the bridge you can see that most of that decline is coming is Asia but we see a decline in all our regions relative to the CapEx spending during the quarter.  And then looking at the results coming into the operational cash flow, we see that the level of the &#x2013; from the last few quarters coming into the NOK 6 billion operational cash flow level, from the second quarter of 4.5 going up to last year to 6 this year and you also see the trend-line the fourth quarter rolling basis you see that the trend-line is actually developing very positively as we've been expecting for the period.</p>
          <p>Having said that even though we come up to more than 21 million in the fourth quarter rolling operational cash flow as a result of getting closer to launch in India, we do not expect that to continue as a result of CapEx and OpEx being spend in India.  So, we do expect this trend to go downwards for the coming period when we're launching or ramping up in India as such.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the details for the different regions, relative to our cash flow target of 10 billion in the Nordic section, we see that we have increased over the year.  We've actually increased the operational fourth quarter rolling operational cash flow from almost 8 to 8.8.  So, basically it's a 900 million plus in the Nordic region, we see a 0.4%, 0.4 billion growth in the Central and Eastern Europe, and even though we see a trend down declined here.  The growth in cash flow from the Asian region is actually offsetting all of the decline in the Central and Eastern Europe.  So in total, we see the positive trend continuing and this is also Asian is also going to be affected by the Indian launch going forward.</p>
          <p>The third slide on cash flow is just showing you country-by-country on the fourth quarter rolling average, compared to last year, and we see that it's a slight positive trend in the Nordic region.  It's a good positive trend in the Central and Eastern Europe.  We see a positive trend, everybody is above the 30% mark.  We see a good growth in cash flow in Serbia, also in Promonte and a slight growth both in Kyivstar and in Pannon.  The major growth is of course coming from Asia and that's the turnover in Grameenphone coming from a negative to a positive, to a 33% cash flow margin on the positive side in the last four quarters and also as a much less negative impact from Pakistan. And that the basic sentiment of the changes the last few quarters has come from change in sort of the tide in Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p>
          <p>Then going to the reported figures and we see a slight growth in top line numbers from 23.7 to NOK 24.5 billion and EBITDA of almost 7.9 billion and an EBITDA of NOK 7.8 billion.  And then we have an impairment loss, meaning a write down of goodwill in the Serbia. And the reason for that is that the &#x2013; the changes of Serbian economy as a result of the changes both influenced Serbia economy as such but also increased the country-risk premiums that has included for us on the discount price looking forward.  So, it's the most &#x2013; the most important part of the write down is the &#x2013; the change in the discount rates, but it's also of course the impact of economy that is our view of low EBITDA margin as well as growth expectations going forward.</p>
          <p>So, that has been taking down by 1.9 billion or 1 &#x2013; a bit lower than NOK 2 billion leaves earnings before interest and tax to slightly below 2 billion.  Associated companies of 1.569, is basically comprised out of Kyivstar with short of 500 million and VimpelCom with a bit more than 1 billion.  There are some adjustments from prior quarters as well as fourth quarter in that number, taking the number from VimpelCom down with approximately 300 million, down to the short of NOK 1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Net financials is basically inline with last year, so profit before tax is then NOK 3.114 billion.  As a result of the write-down in impairments, which has no tax consequence, we have then for this quarter fairly high tax percentage coming up to the 42%.  The change in the tax percentage for the year has not changed.  The tax effect for or the tax percentage for year is approximately calculated to about 33% including the effects of India.  That leaves a net income of 1. &#x2013; or short of NOK 1.8 billion and an earnings per share of 86 &#xD8;re. (sic) [NOK 0.86] .</p>
          <p>Development in net interest-bearing debt this quarter has been positive, the main reasons going from NOK 40 billion to about NOK 35 billion has been very little currency effect &#x2013; net currency effect on the debt side during the quarter.  So, most of the effects comes out of the earnings of almost NOK 8 billion, less the taxes, interest and CapEx paid, dividend received from Kyivstar, a bit more than 2 billion and then of course adjustments of dividends leaving us for the net change of almost 5 billion, down to the 35 billion net debt level.</p>
          <p>And then summing up with the outlook for 2009, we included here two columns, one including India and one excluding India as a result of reference to our last guidance.  So, with that reference the organic revenue is going to be in line with 2008 but as we say, however, slightly on the negative side, we do see still a pressure on the top sides always &#x2013; its not going to be zero but its going to be sort of in line but slightly lower.  We still see margin around the 34% level and then we lowered the CapEx expectations with two percentage points from last time to now says that we are going to see a CapEx to sales 13 to 15%. That is also including the launch of our satellites in broadcast later this year.</p>
          <p>For including India, the organic revenue is in the &#x2013; still the same.  With India we see our margin between 32 and 33% and the CapEx to sales of 16 to 19%.  At the bottom of the page we also included the numbers as we've done earlier when guiding on India for 2009, we lowered the EBITDA loss to and expect that to be between 1.5 and NOK 2 billion and CapEx to be between 3.5 to 4.5 billion as such.  So, in general lowered expectations on CapEx in operations as well as lowered the cost spending in India as well as lowering the CapEx in India leading us with a guidance of the year of improved cash flow of plus NOK 5 billion.  And that was it from me.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Trond.  We are now ready to take your questions, so I invite Mr. Baksaas back on the podium.  Before you ask your questions please wait for microphone and please be so kind as to introduce yourselves.  Mr. Hoff do you have a microphone?  This one question here on the front.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations very much with very strong underlying operating results and particularly the operating cash flow.  And with that in mind I have two questions, one of them is the reduced India CapEx guidance is a kind of run-rate of NOK 2 billion per quarter, is that what we all should be expecting for 2010?  And then my second question again somewhat now that you said operating cash flow for 2009 will be improving by about NOK 5 billion.  Could you just comment again on dividends for 2009, is it still &#x2013; so too early to start dividend payment plan again?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the &#x2013; the guidance on India, the business plan as such has not been altered relative to the fundamental elemental evolve like cash spending both on operations and sort of sum of operation and CapEx.  So this is more sort of a sliding as a result of not launching until the fourth quarter and thereby sliding it over in 2010.  How that's actually going to be effect-full in 2010 relative to when we see that detailed schedules of 2010, I'm not fully able to say that, might &#x2013; something might slide over to 2011, I'm not &#x2013;  I'm not able to do that right now.  But the total CapEx or the cash spending as we have said earlier still remains of India such the times &#x2013; just the timing difference.  Coming to dividend, our opinion still stands on dividends, we see that the progress of developing going forward on the cash flow wise is improving, but we are not ready to adjust that statement at of this time.  We just have to wait and see how the things goes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question is from Mr. Nickel Alfas, comes from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much.  Just a quick question there have been in press reports about disposals of one of your operations in local press.  And in general what is your attitude to reassessing operations where maybe the long-term return on capital is going to meet your &#x2013; your targets, is that something that you would consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; our comment to that is as it would have been the previous conditions as well and I think you are specifically referring to some writings around potential activities in Pakistan and let me be very clear in this, Telenor is always long-term and we are moving into every market, the way we've done.  Pakistan though is a market where we can expect some consolidation to happen so there is no wonder of that speculation in someway or another comes forward.  So, generally speaking as we said before, in country consolidation when meaningful to the market balance the number of players, etcetera, that is part of what we are following in every market.  Generally speaking, this kind of consolidation might both be in country, as well as on a regional level.  And since Telenor now are in both Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, we are part of that agenda in this industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I could just follow-up, is that in general that you'd want to remain invested in the markets even priced to consolidation is that &#x2013; is that what I'm &#x2013; when you say your long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The longer term in this profile of Telenor should be very clear.  How these consolidations then will play out on the specific circumstances that remains to be seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Next from Mr. Peter Kurt Nielsen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.  Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux London.  Couple of questions related to the domestic operations please.  You've now shown a second quarter in a row with an EBITDA margin in the domestic fixed business of 36%.  Your previous target further it has been 35%, has anything here would made you a bit more optimistic on that front given the good performance you've shown in the last six months?  And my second question relates to mobile, you talked about lower marketing and sales expenses in the quarter.  Could you elaborate a little bit, is that a sort of a market driven, have you seen easing of competition in the market or would you expect that to marketing and sales to come up again in the second half of the year?  And if I may just return to the first question here on Pakistan or you commented open market consolidation, would you &#x2013; I assume, have an ambition of remaining in control of any of your operations that were to enter such a market consolidation in such a hypothetical case please.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we take a comment to the domestic question first, it is in 2009 we have an intensity of challengers in the Norwegian market that might be sort of a bit softer in 2009 than what has been before. But from the established players, the intensity in the market activity is as before.  And but also the fact that the number of new hand held entities in first half of 2009 is lower than what has been before despite the fact that we lost the iPhone in this period.  Then to your fixed part, yes, we are very, very satisfied that we are able to maintain the levels of margin in the fixed activities in Norway.  But remember, here this is a very long time earned exercise, some people engaged in this on a continuously operating manner, are working at cost efficiencies all the time.  So, it's become a habit of theirs and if you take the longer route from say 2002, 2003 onwards to today, it's done a phenomenal job to keep cost structures in line with revenue development.  We haven't revised our long-term target around fixed, but this quarter seems to be a good one also driven by some higher wholesale revenues.  As to your comment on consolidation, the general comment for Telenor in that respect is that we want to be in majority in our operations in the longer-term picture and that we haven't revised that position.  We want to be in industry a strategic partner around the table and that is our go-to-market business model, and so it will be also for the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello.  I would like to talk a little bit about Ukraine and Bangladesh.  We'll start with Ukraine, there again you report very solid EBITDA margin and the &#x2013; it's also stabilization of the ARPU [average revenue per unit], but you're losing market share where the other operators are offering zero overnight tariffs.  Can you give an update on the market situation in Ukraine?  And for Bangladesh, it's &#x2013; there you reported very solid subscription revenues and you said also in the report that the average prices are up.  Is the pricing situation an effect of less campaigns with free minutes or is the pricing situation improving generally in Bangladesh?</p>

          <p>Yeah, okay, let's start a bit on the Ukraine. Yes, the operation in Ukraine is very solid in this quarter, and the fundamentals around the domestic economy in Ukraine, you all know, is a challenging one.  But Kyivstar has been doing extremely well balancing this in their operation in this quarter, with the minus that you described namely that of reduced number of subscribers in the range of 500,000.  We have now revised our service offering in particular in the youth segment using the djuice brand with a zero on that profile in the pricing structure to meet this development.  And we for sure hope that that initiative will lead to that Kyivstar also will be perceived competitive in this segment.  On the other hand, it's important to note that the revenue market share is anticipated to be 50% plus as &#x2013; and stable compared to previous quarters.  In Bangladesh, Trond?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the development in Bangladesh is not necessarily the campaigns as such. I do think that we revised our prices upwards some quarters back, and we saw that the competitors were following that action there &#x2013; at least the main competitors were following that action. And we have seen that until lately and now lately we've seen some price developments for some of them but not for a long period of the time, and it's only campaigns.  So, fundamentally we do think that the price stabilization in Bangladesh have started to happen and people are &#x2013; our competitors also acknowledging that they come down to price per minute now.  That is basically the low ones US $0.01 a minute that is so low that the only company making money down in Bangladesh is Telenor, so &#x2013; or Grameenphone.  So basically we do expect to see trending slightly trending upward bounce on the ARPU side going forward.  So, in that sense I do think yes for we expect to see in the bottom of the pricing in Bangladesh, but for the ones that are following the market in Bangladesh it is a jungle of campaigns out there every quarter, and we see that's still is going to continue.  So, we don't see sort of the competitive landscape as such is not.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you <mark type="inaudible" />.  Two questions.  One sort of ties to an earlier question that was raised in particular with regards to the Ukraine.  And I would like to get this more in the big picture.  With your CapEx cuts that you've now executed at your the general guiding for 2009, do you feel that the CapEx levels that you're spending, in particular in Asia, are in line with your growth prospects there that obviously have decreased a bit? Or are you currently really stepping on the CapEx brakes very much now to free up capital for the India project and maybe you'll sort of even under-spending a bit for the still significant usage growth that you're seeing &#x2013; if only not much from subscribers, if only from the minute of use increase, that was &#x2013; would be my first question on the CapEx, in the big picture.  Second one is very specific to Norway Mobile where I see the usage declining.  Is this simply a mix effect due to higher mobile internet subscription or is there an underlying usage decrease? And if yes, why would that be?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start on the overall picture &#x2013; if you take an operation like Ukraine for example, when we have a reduction in the first of all the growth profile that we've had as well as also the overall total number of minutes in the network, there is capacities in a mobile network that can handle this without sort of continuing the CapEx profile.  So, it's quite obvious that you are able to run your assets in a smarter way under those kind of circumstances.  The overall picture when we look on how we spend our CapEx is also related to how competitors are moving in the competitive field.  Is it so that competitors are building coverage, extra coverage, new coverage and new capacities? Then it pours into the equation on how much CapEx, we as an operator under those circumstances will be.  And I think we are in a timeframe now where all operators basically are having a break face for how to spend on their CapEx side.  So, it's a more diverse picture than a little look at it from your prospective.  You have to expand that prospective a bit also to that on competitors.  As for the time being, we feel no difficulties in having the CapEx profile that we have as today.  But of course this may change depending on the trends in the economy and how also other players will both be financed and how they will run their activities.  And mobile broadband, by the way, is still the number one growth driver in many markets and also has to be handled in the same way.  As for Norway, Trond you might be able to...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to see how you can analyze the short decline in usage in Mobile Norway.  My numbers shows that we have about approximately 249 minutes in Norway this quarter, same quarter last year we had 251, so it's a two-minute change.  If you take quarter-on-quarter, last quarter had 243 than increasing now to this year &#x2013; this minutes of use of 249.  So to see that this is a general trend of decline on minutes of use coming to mobile, no, we kind of see that and we do see some seasonality effects during the year.  So, if you go to the sort of our enclosures in page 44 our total presentation you basically see the minutes we use.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Two questions, one especially on Swedish Mobile.  The cost cutting is going to come through a clear positive here, but how did you think your competitive position is in this market today and do you think it's improving over the next 12 to 24 months?  And secondly is for you a broader question on CapEx across the Group as a whole.  Your CapEx cuts were clear positive for near-term cash flow, but do you think you're sacrificing long-term competitiveness in any markets as a result? And if not, why not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember here that in Sweden there are three business lines: it's that of fixed voice, it's that of broadband and it's that of mobile.  In the mobile area, there is an underlying growth on the retail level.  So, it's a bit of a mixed picture compared to sort of saying that the Swedish market is only characterized by mobile as such.  There is I &#x2013; there has been in all the Nordic countries a strong sentiment into mobile internet high speed access in this period and this is not strange because when you're leading up to the summer holiday people take a look on what's &#x2013; what's out there for internet access and in general there is a boost ahead of the summer holidays for that kind of service. And I think we are still competitors &#x2013; are as competitive as we shall in Sweden in that respect.  The overall picture though is that the cost structures are too high in the operation in relation to the overall income revenue development for all three business lines and this is what we approach when we do the downsizing in the ambition of making things more efficient and more simple in the Swedish operation.  In many ways a bit of the same that we have been executing here in Norway over the quite some number of years.  As to the second part of your question I think that is exactly the same type of question that we got from the previous person that asked the question about the long-term profile on the CapEx that I don't feel that its necessary to repeat that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's why &#x2013; the question on CapEx is more about how you see that affecting your competitiveness on a two year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said during my &#x2013; the previous question under the present circumstances we are putting into the equation when you evaluate this the way &#x2013; the behavior of our competitors in every market as to what kind of capacities and coverage they are putting into their market place on ongoing or rolling basis, that will of course also have something to do on how we spend our, an example for that is the build-up in Pakistan for example, when both Mobilink and Telenor built in parallel in Pakistan extending their coverage, we both opened new market areas and we've benefited from building a new market around us under those circumstances, I think that is the best example I can bring forward right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning and two questions, please.  First of all just in terms of driving this cost efficiency culture through the Group, can you give any specific examples of cost efficiency measures which you will be pushing down from the new business unit as the Group centre?  And secondly with respect to your network joint venture administrated in Sweden, are there any other markets where you might be interested in this sort of arrangement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Examples, I mean the most visible examples on how you develop group synergies is that of purchasing.  There is no doubt that the size of the Group has enabled us to have an ambition of working on betting the best terms possibly from various vendors in the telecoms sphere as well as in the IT sphere.  And the other element is of course that of competence-sharing, both in the market and distribution activities and that in &#x2013; on how you deploy technology in general.  So there are a number of initiatives across the Group that is originating more or less in the center of the Group and being developed in the companies and vise versa for that matter.  When it comes to infrastructure sharing, actually the one of the best examples of infrastructure sharing is how the wholesale market has been developed in Norway over the years in the fixed line area.  Where we have had an extensive infrastructure sharing principle at the bottom and where there are layers of the service functionality that other players can utilize from the number one network holder namely that of Telenor.  Infrastructure sharing the way it's &#x2013; it's displayed at a display in India, will be a new way of thinking also into other markets in for Telenor.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning.  I was hoping, first of all, you might be able to provide a general update on the pricing trends in India over the last quarter or so. And with that in mind I wonder if you could comment at all on the launch of Loop Telecom, one of your competitors; I think I'm right in saying they have launched in a number of the circles that you are planning on launching in Q4.  Can you sort of talk through maybe what you've seen from them is that some sort of risk about that they've stolen your thunder somewhat?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the launch in India, the growth in India is significant in this period and we saw that last year when we look for that specific market. We were absolutely sure that the Indian market would grow in penetration from below 30 and through saying that the market would double until 2012.  I think we're see exactly that happening in these days. So from our own ambition, we need to be at street level as soon as possible and that's why a launch in fourth quarter is so important.  As to comments on one specific operators launch, I think we have to be competitive whether or not there is a newcomer or an existing player.  So it's not that easy to sort of, say that one is coming here using the vacuum cleaner before us.  I don't think &#x2013; I think we ourselves will be as efficient when we come to the marketplace as others might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I can quickly follow up on pricing, I think you said that the Q1 numbers there was signs of stability in pricing generally in India, is that something you're still fairly comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're fairly comfortable on that but it will always be so that any newcomer will always have to use the pricing mechanism to create attraction in the first place. And then remember, the newcomer will also be the one that has the most capacity available when he starts that will go for us as well.  Whereas the longer-term picture is so that it seems market leaders already do run fairly full networks.  They show that such operators do not have the same ability to pour in, for example, free minutes as the ones with more capacity in the early launch period.  And the stabilization development has &#x2013; the market has exactly showed that both when also Reliance came with their offerings, say beginning of this year.</p>

And then secondly just returning to the subject of consolidation that you talked about earlier, can you provide any insight into other markets, aside from Pakistan and India which you've talked about in the past, where you potentially see consolidation happening?

          <p>Well, to your last point, I don't have any specific viewpoints on that.  Your speculations in that is as good as mine.  So, to comment on this specifically is not that relevant if...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't have, well we're not commenting on specific cost numbers, but we do see that licenses are rumored at least or stated by some public officials that it might come up with the 3G license in Thailand.  We see that something might come up in Bangladesh and in Pakistan.  It is a potential that something is coming up in Ukraine and that's basically the sort of the four elements and of course there are some saying about some 4G in Denmark, but the timing and the specific time events on that so whether it's within the 12 months or might be a longer and what our position are in those regards, that is too early to come within the statement and to give you any cost indications on that would be almost impossible.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have just one question on broadband, it seems that some, your sort of the number of GSL lines are sort of constantly slipping at the moment.  And I guess cables taking share.  Can you just give us your sort of your overall thoughts on the broadband market in Norway and how you think about losing share to your own cable business and leakage outside that and what do you think your sort of overall retail picture looks like in terms of market share and how that impacts going forward and what you do to try and reduce the drag from cable outside the Group over the next few quarters?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The broadband market is exactly characterized by the elements that you referred.  I think you can split the broadband markets originated from the fixed line system in two groups, if not three.  DSL will become sort of a or is a technology that reached out to the whole of the marketplace in Norway.  Where as cable reaches out to roughly set a little bit below half of the whole number of households in the Norwegian marketplace.  And due to the distribution of how households are located in this country, the number of households will not increase outside the cities, it's only in the cities that also has a small potential for increase. And where cable &#x2013; where  cable is, then cable is a superior capacity product in the broadband seen from a customer perspective compared to DSL because of speed.  But there is also the value chain to fix from that technology into the house of the customers and the cable operators have struggled a bit, us included, to get that value chain in good operation.  So, then the third element is that of fiber.  And fiber rollout is something that we also are initially &#x2013; in the initial stages of in this period.  And here the electrical companies do have ambitions primarily out of Digitel in Stavanger region as well as in the Oslo region.  And they will naturally concentrate only on the city areas or not only that's may be a strong to say that primarily for the city areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask something, I mean just a follow-up there, I mean I guess in a time when capital is relatively scarce where you have cable footprint, are you more inclined to invest and being a relatively modest upgrade to DOCSIS 3, as opposed to pushing forward the Primus or forward the curve and how do you think about that as you I guess placed more scrutiny on the allocation of capital across the Group?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that is yes, we are on the opinion that the cable functionality is at customer level, very good functional internet access product with all necessary speed available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look at the decline of DSL number base.  You're also going to see this basically the same number or a bit more pickup of the &#x2013; of the customers in on the broadband side.  So, you basically have a balancing view from a Group perspective relative to cash flow base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it worth going forward sort of giving us more granularity on the overall broadband numbers including cable and sort of how your market share plays like?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me tell that, we see the leakage from DSL's cable where that's not necessarily harmful for the Group but all we see at the DSL numbers are in a &#x2013; which makes it a bit more harm I guess?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>It's more an effect of the increased pricing as due to the fact that we actually increased prices, but it's also of course as a result of slowing down some of the effects of the campaigns in Bangladesh.  It is also of course a slight a bit of free minutes, but the major effect is because of the increased pricing.</p>
