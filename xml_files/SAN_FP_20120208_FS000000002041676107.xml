          <p>Okay, I think we're ready to roll. So good afternoon, and welcome to Sanofi 2011 Annual Results. Thanks to those who managed to come to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:13) despite the snow we had this morning for a change. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:17). We're also doing a webcast. This year we're actually allowing participants to answer questions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:23). And so we'll add these questions in the Q&amp;A session later. As always, I have to go to the <mark type="ph" /> elemental (00:31) statements. So you know that our presentation today will contain forward-looking &#x2013; and both known and unknown uncertainties and risks. Those are detailed in our Form 20-S, as well in as our document of reference.</p>
          <p>Today with us, we've got Chris Viehbacher, our CEO, who will share with you the highlights for 2011 and provide you with an update on the execution of our strategy. Then J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, our CFO, will share with you the financial performance for 2011. We'll deep dive into the performance of growth platforms with Hanspeter Spek, President of Global Operations. And then we decided to keep enough time to actually cover a number of late-stage projects in the pipeline today, and this will be done by Dr. Elias Zerhouni, President of Global Research and Development. Chris will then wrap up the session and then open up for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>With that, I will actually leave the floor to Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, good afternoon, everybody. Let me add my words of welcome. Now it was three years ago almost to the day when I had the first opportunity to present results of Sanofi. They were the 2008 results, to which I had contributed all of one month. But it was an opportunity really to lay out our strategy.</p>
          <p>In 2008 we pointed out that actually &#x2013; and I think has been kind of the hallmark of what we've been doing &#x2013; we did point out that, while results were great in 2008, we could already envisage a time three years, four years hence, when things would not be so great, and that we as management had decided to be (a) both transparent, but (b) also to lay out a strategy that would prepare us for the patent cliff and would actually build a strong and growing company coming out of the patent cliff. And we'll go through some of that in a minute.</p>
          <p>But I would say three years later, I think we've stuck to this strategy. I think if you look at 2011 results, they should be really unremarkable to you, even though they're remarkable to us because they should really just be in line with what we've intended to do and where we intend to go.</p>
          <p>Now it was a busy year for us. Clearly, 2011 was particularly marked by the Genzyme acquisition. That was a big move for us in a lot of different ways. Any time you spend $20 billion is a big deal. But doing a hostile acquisition of a biotech company, especially one that had manufacturing difficulties, was clearly an element of risk. But equally, it gave us an opportunity to create significant value. And I think as we look at 2011, we can already see that we're well down the track of creating the value that we thought we would.</p>
          <p>2012, I've said on numerous occasions, is a year that I've had circled in red in my diary for three years. The fact that we lose Plavix and Avapro this year, plus let's not forget Eloxatin, a full year of Taxotere, a second generic for Lovenox, not to mention a few price reductions in Europe and Turkey and the like, is not a secret to anybody.</p>
          <p>I think we've always been open that that was going to occur. And I think really if I look at our investor base, most people have begun to say, okay, but what happens afterwards? And you remember back in September we had an opportunity to really present where we thought the company was going in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So 2012 is a transition year in some ways because we lose those blockbuster products. But in some ways it's not because two or three years ago we said our future's not those blockbusters. We stopped promotion from those; we've been essentially milking those. And we've been re-investing in other parts of the business. And so for us, 2012 has certainly got plenty of challenges, but we're going to continue to focus on those things that we have focused on for the last three years, which is building a strong, sustainably growing business based on our growth platforms and on Genzyme.</p>
          <p>Now the strategy is what it has been. There's always been three aspects to this. One is increased innovation in research and development. And in that, we initially tackled development in the first two years, and we obviously dramatically reduced our portfolio of assets.</p>
          <p>I think with the benefit of time, what we have seen is that a lot of those assets are still with us. I mean, it's one thing to chuck things out; it's another thing to decide what are you going to keep, and do you have the right criteria to make those decisions? I think the fact that most of what we decided to keep is still with us is an indication that we had the right criteria. And so that's how we've been able to file five dossiers this year and why we've got 18 potential launches coming up between now and 2015.</p>
          <p>Last year we tackled the R, and we've embarked upon an ambitious program, not only of restructuring, but when you look at things like the Warp Drive deal that we did in January, although a small deal in itself, is very much emblematic of where we see research and development going. And I won't say more on that because Elias will come back and talk about that.</p>
          <p>Second part was to simply take the cash flow that we knew was going to go away one day and reinvest in those areas where there were growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>And the third was really to make sure we were adapting our structure. And essentially that meant we were going to dis-invest where there was no more growth, and we were going to invest where there is growth.</p>
          <p>And strategy is all about making those choices. And it's often very easy to say, I want to go here. But in making a strategy choice, you have to stop doing things. And that's what's sometimes is very difficult with large organizations. And I think J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me will show you that we've had some extremely impressive shifts in resources from those areas which no longer provide growth to those that do.</p>
          <p>So let's take these a little bit, one at a time. Elias is going to go through each of these products in a little bit more detail because I think there is an awful lot of value here that is not being recognized. What I'm particularly happy about is not only Aubagio, but also Lemtrada, which we plan to file in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>By the way, there's no real big dip between &#x2013; there's nothing going on. It was first quarter; it just slipped into second quarter. It was at the end of the year, and there's just &#x2013; with the work load, it's going to slip a bit, but we're still very confident in that.</p>
          <p>Lemtrada, I think, is yet misunderstood. I read an article yesterday in the paper. I mean, I think people clearly don't really understand that Lemtrada is in a complete class by itself in multiple sclerosis &#x2013; the only product that has ever demonstrated significant superiority over the gold standard, which is Rebif.</p>
          <p>One of the things that I didn't know &#x2013; really realized until even yesterday, which I don't think most people realize, the market is not dominated by Gilenya or Tysabri. Eighty percent of the market is in something called ABCR, which is Avonex, Betaseron, Copaxon, and Rebif. So the market is still to be had by those who come along with innovative products, and I think Aubagio and Lemtrada will do that.</p>
          <p>Now the GLP-1 with Lyxumia will reinforce our Diabetes franchise. Kynamro puts us down a path that will ultimately &#x2013; the PCSK9 and Zaltrap will add to our &#x2013; as well as Visamerin &#x2013; both of those products will add to our Oncology franchise.</p>
          <p>I will just say on those five, I can tell you that actually getting five regulatory dossiers together in nine months is an incredible task. And I searched back; I couldn't find another company that had ever submitted so many regulatory files in such a concentrated period of time. So for a company that most people don't think has a pipeline, I think it's a pretty strong achievement.</p>
          <p>Genzyme was clearly the focus of 2011. This time last year we were just in finalizing really the acquisition. We announced it on the 15th of February. On the 16th of February, we already began the pre-integration. And there were a number of aspects to this. Obviously bringing a successful biotech company with a big pharma is not an easy thing to do, especially because this was not just any biotech. It was a very iconic biotech company &#x2013; and a big one, with 10,000 employees.</p>
          <p>So as I stand here today, I'm actually amazed at the progress that we have made on a number of fronts. Clearly, the value proposition of Genzyme was being able to bring production back on Cerezyme and Fabrazyme to those patients who need it.</p>
          <p>Central to this was being able to get Framingham, the new facility, approved. And so we achieved a major milestone this year when we had, within three or four days of each other, approval by both the European, as well as the U.S. regulatory authorities &#x2013; and on the basis of really the first validation batch. Now I think that's a very strong sign of the confidence that the agencies have in the work program that we have put in place since Sanofi and Genzyme have started working together on this.</p>
          <p>Just this week, we've also received formal approval from the FDA of the work plan to get ourselves out of the consent decree. If you think about a year ago, in Allston, which was the site affected by the consent decree, we were still producing bulk for four products, we were still doing purification, and we were still doing fill and finish.</p>
          <p>By April, we had moved the fill and finish out. By the end of the year we were only producing two products. And by the end of this year, we will only be producing one product in Allston. And so we have dramatically simplified operations, taken the pressure off Allston. And I think that is what's really given me the confidence that we're getting back well into production.</p>
          <p>Now if you start up a biological facility, you don't go from zero to 100 in five days. That's why it's going to take a little bit of time, till the middle of the year, to really fully get supplied. But on Fabrazyme, for example, we will be able to get all patients in the U.S. back to full dose by the beginning of March. We'll then start working on the waiting list. We'll be able to also already immediately begin to treat a number of patients in Europe who are on Replagal, but who are obviously not getting a full dose of the enzyme that they need. And so we'll be able to start bringing Fabrazyme back. Cerezyme will obviously benefit from the fact that Allston is simplified.</p>
          <p>I think this morning you've seen that Phase II data we're extremely positive on for eliglustat. And as Elias will tell you, this is an extremely important innovation in the treatment of Gaucher disease. So production was central to this. I think production I'm confident on.</p>
          <p>Next in the metric is creating synergies. We proposed $700 million worth of synergies by 2013. By the end of 2011, we had already received $230 million of synergies. And obviously we feel we're on very good track with that, too. And in fact, most of the integration will actually be completed in 2012. The only reason we give 2013 as the date &#x2013; because that's the year where you get a full year impact of all the savings because, if you complete a task in July of 2012, you're only going to get six months of those synergies.</p>
          <p>Third element is research and development. In this case, we decided to get our synergies not out of Genzyme, but out of Sanofi. So we completely reorganized our research and development operations in the U.S. Genzyme has clearly been selected as our principal source of research in the U.S.</p>
          <p>I think Cambridge is one of the most promising areas in the world today to do research and development. And with the acquisition of Genzyme, but also past acquisition of Acambis, the creation of our oncology research and development, we are now the number one life sciences employer in this very promising area.</p>
          <p>Equally, we closed a major research and development facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey, and instead selected to use New Jersey as our base for clinical development, regulatory affairs, and pharmacovigilance.</p>
          <p>Third element is really the new products, and we've talked about Lemtrada and Aubagio.</p>
          <p>Fourth element is really people. And I spent a lot of time personally in Boston this year. And if you do the walking-around test, if you talk about the meetings, I think what I'm really seeing is that we not only are past the we-versus-you process, but we've actually got teams working together with trust and confidence. And I think the success we've had in production is very much a signal of that.</p>
          <p>Another signal that I look at is what happened to the businesses that we took out of Genzyme and put into Sanofi? That's where you had maximum turbulence. All of those businesses performed at double-digits. So that says that we're able to do this without disruption to the business.</p>
          <p>Cost savings is critical. We obviously lose a major piece of margin leverage by losing the blockbusters. And to compensate for that, we've embarked upon a program of cost reduction. Now I would point out all of these cost reductions (a) have come earlier than planned, but (b) are net.</p>
          <p>I mean, we have not decided to build our company on cost reduction. Within that, there have been more massive cost reductions, with a re-investment in places like Diabetes and in Emerging Markets. So there's been a massive shift of resources within the company &#x2013; roughly 10,000 people out of North America and Europe, with an equivalent number into Emerging Markets, just as an example.</p>
          <p>So with all of that, when we look at our sales in 2008 of &#x20AC;27.5 billion, 25% of that was under threat for generic. We've obviously grown that business and announced &#x20AC;33 billion. Now, yes, we have increased that through acquisition. But I'll show you later that actually the gross growth was &#x20AC;10 billion from our growth platforms. &#x20AC;4 billion of it came from acquisitions, but &#x20AC;6 billion of it came from organic growth. And the &#x20AC;6 billion is more than the &#x20AC;4 billion that we lost because of generics. Obviously, Genzyme has certainly helped in all of this. But I think you can't have a robust company going forward unless you're continuing to build your sales line.</p>
          <p>So there you see the result. The &#x20AC;10 billion on the left are the growth platforms. And on the left &#x2013; on the right, you see what we've lost &#x2013; &#x20AC;7.5 billion down to &#x20AC;3 billion. And obviously a major chunk of that is going to go this year.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we suffered another &#x20AC;2.2 billion of lost sales due to generics. But you can see that the growth platforms have now moved from 43% when we first talked together in 2009, and they've now grown to 65%. So two-thirds of the company is Genzyme and the growth platforms. By 2015, 80% of the company is this business. Equally on the right, we've gone from 27% of sales being at risk down to 9%, and that will drop to less than 6% at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>So when you look at all of these, obviously Emerging Markets is really, I think, an unbelievable story for Sanofi. We're the only company to do more than &#x20AC;10 billion in emerging markets. We are by far the leader in this, and this is simply because we have historically been strong there. We have been for decades in India, in Latin America. We were the first foreign company into China. We have local manufacturing, we have local product lines that are adapted to those markets, and most importantly we've got depth of management in all those countries. And you can see that between 2008 and 2011, we've had 16%. And Hanspeter will show you the acceleration that we've seen in the last three years.</p>
          <p>Diabetes, we've gone from a company that sells Lantus to being a diabetes solutions company. And we've seen very strong growth &#x2013; particularly pleased by the fourth quarter growth in Lantus of 17% and 15% for the year.</p>
          <p>On Human Vaccines, very good growth, on average of about 6.8%. I think Vaccines is going to be a really strong contributor to growth, as the dengue vaccine comes along, as Shantha comes back online, and with products like C. difficile coming along. But I will say that I think Sanofi Pasteur has done an extraordinary job on line extension strategies in our flu franchise.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health is the one I'm happiest about. When we started with &#x20AC;1.2 billion, quite honestly this was a little bit of a hope and a prayer because we had a product here and a product there &#x2013; nothing in the U.S., nothing in China. And yet we've been able to acquire companies like Chattem really on the basis of our desire to launch Allegra ourselves. That was a risk. We could have launched this with a more established partner. I can tell you that not only were the sales of Allegra such that we could attain, almost within three weeks of launch, the second spot in this highly contested allergy market, but we actually exceed some of the sales projections from the more established players who were pitching to be our partner on this.</p>
          <p>Obviously with the acquisition of BMP Sunstone, we're into traditional Chinese medicines. We've opened up new channels of distribution, and we're doing the same thing in India. And so we are now starting to have a global presence in Consumer, and we're one of the top five companies in this.</p>
          <p>Animal Health, you've heard me talk about for a long, long time. The growth of 4% is pretty much the way we see this business growing to 2015. But I think you'll also see that we'll be very active in business development in this area. I still want us to be stronger in Production Animals, and I still want us to be stronger in Emerging Markets.</p>
          <p>And finally, Innovative Products, you will see that that contribution grow. But the objective of this has been that we don't depend too much on R&amp;D and patented medicines in our growth. We want that to be accretive to a sustainably growing sales line and not be the only story to the company.</p>
          <p>And so you see the well balanced portfolio. One of the things that I keep close attention to is, particularly in these times of economic austerity, we have roughly 50% of our sales are reimbursed by government, but 50% which is not. And right now the 50% that is not is looking a lot better than the part that is.</p>
          <p>So we haven't been able to completely mitigate the loss on this, but if you look at that &#x20AC;5.59, which was our earnings per share in 2008, if you take the &#x20AC;4 billion of generic expirees that we've had, plus the &#x20AC;2 billion of after-tax profit related to Plavix and Avapro, you can see that essentially in 2008 &#x2013; and I didn't say this when I announced it because there's only so much transparency that everybody can tolerate &#x2013; but essentially 50% of the profits of the company were at risk at that point. So to me, when I look at &#x20AC;6.65 &#x2013; and even for 2012, we are well above what the profits would have been had we not chosen to implement the strategy.</p>
          <p>We have talked about our payout going up to 50%. And one of the things that we have done is wanted to make sure that investors were confident in our future. And we believe that we could do that by regularly improving our dividend. This year we're increasing our payout to 40%, with a 6% increase in the dividend to &#x20AC;2.65.</p>
          <p>We also purchased &#x20AC;1 billion of shares. And I would remind you that that's largely to start to mop up the dilution that was created when we issued the stock dividend. Why do we call them opportunistic? Well, if you can issue shares for &#x20AC;49.60 as part of a dividend and buy them back at the same price or less, then that's probably a good deal.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it over to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everybody. As Chris has already commented on dividends, I'm just wondering what I should say now. But however I will go through the P&amp;L for 2011, give some details on the final <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:18) for this year.</p>
          <p>So you are used to this draft, which we present quarter after quarter. And I still feel that it is quite impressive. So that's about the year 2011. We have lost &#x20AC;2.2 billion of sales from the key products we're selling genericized year-on-year. And as we all know, I mean, these products are not only safe, but also high profit. On top of that, we still booked &#x20AC;450 million of sales of H1N1 vaccines in 2010. So we started the year with a sort of handicap as compared to where we expected to be for 2011.</p>
          <p>I mean, and as impressive is the contribution of the growth platforms. I mean, Hanspeter will go through that later on. &#x20AC;1.9 billion of new sales created organically from the growth platform, 10.8% growth. I think that's really signaling that these are really the drivers of Sanofi for tomorrow &#x2013; today and for tomorrow. And on top of that of course, we've booked Genzyme. Genzyme <mark type="ph" /> has proceeds over the pre-core sales (23:27) on which we have booked the sales &#x2013; a 7.6% increase of sales, including double-digit for both Renagel, Synvisc, as well as Myozyme.</p>
          <p>The FX impact, there's always a lot of volatility, as we know, in the exchange rate. Actually the FX impact negative is mainly driven by the U.S. dollar. We tend to look at the U.S. dollar being a strong currency against the euro today. Just six months ago it was exactly the reverse. So impact out of the &#x20AC;700 million, &#x20AC;600 million is coming &#x2013; or precisely &#x20AC;593 million is coming from the U.S. dollar against the euro.</p>
          <p>Which precisely brings me to the next slide, yes. I think that's important to &#x2013; at a time where we are looking at very precise guidance for 2012 &#x2013; to remind you where are the main drivers in terms of currency exposure. So still the dollar is the main currency, as you can see. In 2011, it represents 28% of our sales. Just after the euro and just before &#x2013; or significantly before the other currencies, which in the same mark of order is the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real. You see interestingly that &#x2013; and also it's a bit demonstrating how the shift of the company is taking place. And for instance, the British pound is just coming at the end of the list. So we are really now more exposed to Emerging Markets really than exposed to European markets, and particularly <mark type="ph" /> through Europe <mark type="indiscernible" /> [25:02] in euros.</p>
          <p>So the sensitivity, which I think also has to be kept into mind, is 0.3% of the net income because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:16) $0.01 of the exchange rate. In other terms, if you take the 2011 exchange rate, which was on average &#x20AC;1.39 and you add two points in that, in 2012 you will be &#x20AC;1.30. It means that it is $0.09, and $0.09 is 2.7% of our net income for 2012. It's a 2.7% variation. So 2.7% of &#x20AC;6.65 is roughly $0.20. So this gives you an important point on really actually what is the sensitivity of actual results both in 2011, but also for the forecast 2012.</p>
          <p>A few words on the last quarter &#x2013; of course as usual when you speak about annual accounts, you tend not to look so much about the quarter. However, in this quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:14) to show strong performance. The sales have been up 9.2%. Not only the sales, but also the profit we had 9.2% on the business EPS basis.</p>
          <p>So the increase of sales is basically driven by Genzyme. So you can say that in the fourth quarter we lost around &#x20AC;387 million from key genericized-type products, the same as the ones which were contributed &#x20AC;2.2 billion we have seen the previous slide. At the same time the growth platform has basically compensated for that &#x2013; slightly less than that. On the right is really the contribution of Genzyme.</p>
          <p>So yes, Genzyme has contributed to the growth of the sales in the fourth quarter. But at the same time you can say that the growth platform has compensated for the loss of the genericized competition.</p>
          <p>The second noticeable element in this P&amp;L is that we have been able to show a strong increase in profit, showing that by the way of saving cost and in fact having a minor impact of the change of mix in our gross margin. And the net profit has increased in line with sales &#x2013; slightly higher than sales. We are taking more share outstanding, which brings us to the 9.2% increase of business EPS, which is exactly equivalent to the one we are posting for sales.</p>
          <p>Now &#x2013; yeah, now if I look at the full year, so the full year is a 5.3% increase on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:51) of the sales. It's gross profit, which is basically stable, slightly increasing. This is clearly the results of the change of mix, and we come back on that on the next slide. R&amp;D has increased by 7.4% and SG&amp;A by 6.7%. But of course you need to also keep in mind that this includes the consideration of Genzyme of three-quarters. So clearly, it's not a like-for-like basis, but just on the current basis.</p>
          <p>So this brings us to the slight decrease of the BOI, business operating income, by 3.9%, as you can read. I don't think there is many comments to be make of the Other line. Basically they are driven by the contribution of Plavix &#x2013; on the joint venture with BMS on Plavix and Aprovel.</p>
          <p>And then I will make some more comments on the various margins and ratio. So to start with the cost of sales, so the cost of sales to sale ratio for the fourth quarter has been 32%, just 0.4% above the level equivalent for last year. And we should even remember that not only we have lost about this period significant sales for highly profitable product, but also we have the shift of sales for the Vaccine business between Q3 in 2011 and Q4 in 2010 in terms of flu vaccines, which is de-favorable &#x2013; unfavorable to the cost of sales to sales ratio.</p>
          <p>So we can say basically that we have been able to stabilize the cost of sales to sales ratio despite of the shift of the business mix, which is a positive element, showing that there is underlying cost savings on this line.</p>
          <p>Now as I look at 2012, I can give you as a guidance that the cost of sales to sales ratio should be around 31.5%, maybe slightly higher than that, but below 32%. So very much in line with what we have achieved in 2011 in terms of ratio and probably slightly better than Q4.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, we have continued to benefit from the transformations that we took and initiated now three years ago and now are existing on the business. As we can see, the R&amp;D expense, excluding Genzyme, has decreased by 2.4%. For next year, we we're going to see in the year, of course we will change that from impact of the restructuring of our research organization around four hubs of the restructuring we have embarked on, which will be a positive &#x2013; or let's say which will reduce our fixed cost base and help to monitor how we cost, and of course also help to improve innovation, the way we handle it. At the same time, as you see, you have also contribution of Genzyme. And for the three quarters Genzyme has been consolidated, the contribution on R&amp;D cost has been &#x20AC;419 million.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A will be the same story. So here again we have the contribution of Genzyme. So excluding Genzyme, the SG&amp;A has been down in 2011 by 2.6%. This is clearly the result of our cost savings. This is a result of the reorganization we have implemented in our mature countries, both in the U.S., but also to a large extent in Europe. But at the same time, we have re-invested significantly in new businesses behind our growth platform, in particular in Emerging Markets. So on one hand is the &#x20AC;300 million to &#x20AC;400 million of cost reduction, of sales reduction of the mature markets, and on the other all this re-investment in other markets.</p>
          <p>The second thing that you can draw as a conclusion from this graft is that we really start to see an increasing impact of our control <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:59) in Q4 and also the result of the synergies being generated between Genzyme and Sanofi. And as you can see, a good way telling of our costs, we have been able to limit the SG&amp;A percent ratio in Q4 to 26.1% as compared to 28.1% in Q4 2010.</p>
          <p>Well, here again if you go down from the net to &#x2013; from the operating income to the net income &#x2013; I mean, here I will also give a few comments. The first thing which is striking is that there is only a slight increase of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:40) expenses. I mean, you could be astonished by that, but we have just raised $20 billion to finance the Genzyme acquisition.</p>
          <p>Currently we have been able to reduce our average cost of debt, obviously also regardless of the fact that we managed to finance Genzyme on an average cost of 1.4% and also because of a better allocation or reduction of the unbalanced between cash available on that, the net impact of the carry, as we know it, negative in 2011 as compared to 2010. So all in all, I think it's impressive to say that we've been able to basically not increase our financial R&amp;D expenses despite a significant increase of our debt.</p>
          <p>On the income tax, as you can see, we end the year with slightly lower than the guidance I gave at the beginning of the year. This is a result of the positive outcome of the final agreement in terms of a constant price between France and the U.S., which finally appear to be more beneficial to some of the &#x2013; as compared to what we anticipated and has contributed 1% improvement as compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we will still benefit from this environment. But on the other hand, we'll have less revenues coming from royalties linked to patents. And these revenues are taxed, in particular in France, at the lower tax rate. So by now I expect an increase of average tax rate in the range of 1%, around 1% &#x2013; 1% plus. So basically we should have most probably something like 28% tax rate for 2012.</p>
          <p>The number of shares, outstanding shares, has increased slightly from the 1.305 billion to 1.321 billion. This is really of course the result of the dividend we pay in shares. We have taken as a result of that 38 million new shares. But at the same time, as you noticed, we have bought back <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:50) 21 million of these shares. So at an average price, which has been very similar to the price we have issued, this seems fair. So you can say that the average, as a result in dilution of the payments of the dividends in shares, has been very limited in 2011 and will be limited either in 2012.</p>
          <p>Okay. I take you to the full P&amp;L down to the <mark type="ph" /> net highest income (35:22). I mean, I do that once a year &#x2013; some elements. I will not go through all the lines which are all very technical. We have amortization on intangible assets. This is resulting from the intangibles which were allocated to products at the time of the Aventis acquisition, but also to the allocation of &#x2013; of course there's accounting price, or PPA, through the recent acquisitions we did, in particular for Genzyme and Merial.</p>
          <p>The second thing is that, because of that, we have also re-evaluated our inventories in the opening balance sheet, which then create some charges which are non-cash charges which will disappear time passing in 2012. So this is the expense <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:15) on the work down of acquired inventories. So research and costs have been basically very similar to the previous year, but then that's driven by the restructuring in Europe, but also the recently announced restructuring of our research organization.</p>
          <p>And we have some positive and some negative elements on the gains and losses on disposals and litigations. Of the negative side in fact, we had to resume the amortization of intangibles when we decided not to finally strike the deal with Merck in the venture between Merial and Intervet, which then we had to redo five quarters of amortization of intangibles, meaning that we have a negative impact, which was &#x20AC;517 million if I recall properly.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we had some positive elements, one of which has been announced today &#x2013; that we got a final outcome of the trial between us and Apotex in connection with announcement for Plavix by Apotex, which created the positive one-off gain of &#x20AC;210 million in our P&amp;L in 2011 and actually we received yesterday the check for this payment, which in dollars represents $270 million.</p>
          <p>On the tax aspect beyond the systematic impact of taxes on all the elements which are described on these slides, we have in particular what I mentioned before, which is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:53) one-off contribution of the finalization of the toss-up price agreement between the U.S. and France. For the final outcome, there's a slight increase of the ISI consolidated net income, as you can see, by 4.1%.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate strong cash flow despite the shift of business. As you can see, the free cash flow after CapEx expense expenditures and the variation of working capital has been close to &#x20AC;38.4 billion. We finance that part of our acquisitions &#x2013; I mean, the main acquisition of course being Genzyme. On top of that, we had the acquisition of BMP Sunstone, and more recently the small acquisition of Universal in CHC in India.</p>
          <p>The payment to shareholder in cash has been the part of the dividends which are spent in cash plus the recent change of shares for a total amount of &#x20AC;2.4 billion. And as you can see, the cash-out linked to restructuring has been a bit more than &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>So finally we end the year with &#x20AC;10.9 billion of net debt when we started at &#x20AC;1.6 billion, which means that, while we have invested in acquisitions &#x20AC;14 billion, the net debt has just increased by &#x20AC;9 billion, which shows the ability of the group to generate free cash flow.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before, the average cost of gross debt has decreased down to 2.6%. And we have now a debt-to-EBITDA ratio which significantly below one, which makes us comfortable to sustain, as mentioned before in particular at the time of our September Investor Meeting, that we can sustain around &#x20AC;10 billion of debt net going forward.</p>
          <p>So finally, a word on the new plan. You remember that we announced in September that we had declined some loans. We aim to save another &#x20AC;2 billion. But each and every details of that plan were not already identified in September.</p>
          <p>Now we can say that we have gone through a comprehensive exercise to identify new ways of working and new ways of saving costs all across the company: generating more synergies between businesses, using lean approaches more systematically in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:29) operations; continuing to restructure R&amp;D, and particularly R, on variabilizing our cost base in R&amp;D; continuing to shift between forces between the mature and the newly growing markets, and being more accurate in the way we spend our marketing expenses.</p>
          <p>And generalizing an approach towards generalized shared services approach to all of our support functions &#x2013; we have implemented that in the U.S. around mid-year, serving all our businesses. We are positing in the same direction in Europe, but also in Asia and Latin America. And of course this &#x20AC;2 billion includes the savings &#x2013; or the synergies we expect to generate from the Genzyme integration which, as mentioned before, should contribute to a $700 million, &#x20AC;500 million, by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>So we sense also that out of this &#x20AC;2 billion, part of it should be not just split over the four years. Part of it will be front-loaded, in particular of the results of the Genzyme integration or the Genzyme synergies and now also our efforts to implement a sustainable restructure of the organization over the year 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll pass over to Hanspeter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good afternoon. I would like to lead you through the performance, in essence, of our growth platforms in 2007. And I'll start with the total picture.</p>
          <p>As you see here, we have achieved &#x20AC;33.4 billion sales, growing by 5.3%. On the left, the positives &#x2013; in essence, the growth platforms achieving an additional growth of approximately &#x20AC;2 billion sales, compensating there nearly the total losses on the right side of the picture caused by newly generalized products, most of them being Taxotere and Lovenox, but also a series of smaller products mainly in the United States.</p>
          <p>For the first time, counting incremental sales for Genzyme, &#x20AC;2.5 billion, nearly &#x20AC;2.6 billion, giving a total of &#x20AC;4.7 billion new sales against &#x20AC;2.2 billion sales coming from generification.</p>
          <p>Now the focus on the growth platforms &#x2013; achieving &#x20AC;19 billion, spending such for approximately 60% of our total sales. Over the total year of 2011, growth platforms have been growing by 10.8%. And you see then rather remarkable growth for each of them &#x2013; most importantly, as mentioned by Chris earlier, of course Consumer Health Care with nearly 23%; Animal Health with a relatively modest growth profile, 3%. You will see later that we have a nice acceleration of course for Animal Health in the fourth quarter, getting around 7% of growth.</p>
          <p>Important to see the way we really get through the cliff, the patent cliff, you see here for the last five quarters the impact of generification, which has been in the fourth quarter 2010 nearly &#x20AC;1.1 billion for the quarter alone. And you see then that this is coming down &#x2013; has been coming down to less than &#x20AC;700 million in the fourth quarter. As we were losing 14% of sales by the end of 2010, it's been down in total a remarkable 8%, but nevertheless just a little bit more than half of what we have been losing about one year ago.</p>
          <p>Now more focus again on the growth platforms &#x2013; here you see our performance on the Emerging Markets. You see very nicely that this is not something which is recent. You'll see that evidently this is something which is accelerating as of 2008/2009. We have an average growth rate of 16%. And you see also the strategy is sustainable. It has all started in 2005 already. So this gives us of course some confidence concerning the future sustainability of this business.</p>
          <p>More in detail, we achieved more than &#x20AC;10 billion of annual sales in the Emerging Markets &#x2013; 10% growth as an average growth rate, excluding Genzyme. It's a little bit more if you include Genzyme and the H1N1 sales. And if you focus just on the famous BRIC countries, sales are approximately &#x20AC;3.5 billion, and growth rate goes further up to 15% growth activity, even 20% if you exclude Genzyme, which is less a presence in those markets. But of course we see this as a very important upside for future growth of Genzyme.</p>
          <p>Now we were a little bit suspicious. In the third quarter, there were some question marks also coming from you &#x2013; is this already the beginning of the end of accelerated growth? And I'm happy to report that this is not the case. In fact, we had a very strong fourth quarter. You see 13.8% respectively, 18.7% at constant exchange rate. And you see that, yes, they are very insistent. I have a repetitively said that I believe it's the variance which makes clearly the strength of the Emerging Markets because the Emerging Markets are not as uniform in their structure, in their opportunity, and potentially also in their sustainability of growth.</p>
          <p>You see that we have had the fourth quarter the strongest growth &#x2013; 21% coming from Latin America. Their sales were well above &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>Relatively moderate 4.9% growth coming out of Eastern Europe and Turkey. I think it's fair to say that in Eastern Europe, of course we have economies which are relatively close or even being part of the European community. And we have the issues you are very well aware of. We also have on top of it Turkey. Turkey has been seeing an extremely difficult this year with two consecutive price cuts <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:41) nearly 40%.</p>
          <p>Asia continues very strong in the fourth quarter, nearly 16%. And Africa and Middle East, very, very close to 10%. Remarkable growth, I believe, if you keep in mind that we have very strong positions in those countries where we have seen the Arabic Spring in 2011, being it Nigeria, being it Tunisia, or being it also Egypt.</p>
          <p>So once again a little focus on the free countries, and you see that also in the free countries a strong acceleration of growth of plus 20%. So no bad surprises at all. I believe even more a very good surprise because we have further accelerated our growth and therefore our market-leading presence in Emerging Markets.</p>
          <p>Second good news of the fourth quarter and 2011 overall without any doubt &#x2013; the performance of Diabetes. And we've seen Diabetes &#x2013; we are extremely proud on the performance of Lantus. You see that we have succeeded to accelerate Lantus performance on evidently a growing base compared to last year from quarter-to-quarter. We finished the year with nearly 18% growth.</p>
          <p>In a short time, Lantus has achieved more than &#x20AC;1 billion of sales in a single quarter. And, yes, we have been also extremely pleased to read and to hear from the so-called Nordic Studies that there is continuously not at all any evidence concerning the safely of Lantus. And so we are looking with a lot of confidence. <mark type="ph" /> This is outstanding studies and service (49:33) are still in 2012 and 2013.</p>
          <p>So all over, a very, very strong performance of Lantus. And so far overall for Sanofi in Diabetes is &#x20AC;4.7 billion growth and 12% over last year.</p>
          <p>CHC, Chris has alluded to it. There was hardly anything, let's say, three years ago in CHC. We have put emphasis on our organization. And, yes, I believe we have made very good choice in acquiring Chattem and trusting into Chattem to launch successfully Allegra. Allegra has been process marketed in the OTC segment of the United States in February of 2011. The product has taken immediately the number two position in an extremely competitive market. And we have achieved sales of approximately &#x20AC;230 million in the first year. And of course this has nicely and strongly even contributed to the overall sales growth &#x2013; up to close to &#x20AC;2.7 billion and a growth of nearly 23%.</p>
          <p>So we can state that we have today a rather solid, strong position in CHC all over the world, ranking approximately number four or number five in this market segment.</p>
          <p>We continue to do also generics. We don't call them generics. We prefer to the term perhaps of affordable medication because generics are not necessarily the same. If you go to the Emerging Markets, most of the business you see on the chart in Emerging Markets is in a branded generic business. And you see that we do extremely well out of this kind of product &#x2013; growing by 16% to above &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>You see sales in the United States on the bottom of the toolbar for 2010 and 2011. Those are the sales of our authorized generics in the United States, being it Taxotere, being it Ambien, being it once again Lovenox.</p>
          <p>Due to the recent decision of giving <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:54) access to the market, we have reintroduced our generic of Lovenox into United States. And you see that those products altogether have significant sales. Besides we have no ambition to become really active in this market segment in the United States beyond authorized generics of our own product.</p>
          <p>We have continued to roll out Medley. And Medley part of our success story inside the acquisitions overall, but evidently also inside affordable medications. And we have rolled out more or less all over Latin America, and we will see in 2012 if we can really successfully export this concept from Brazil to the surrounding markets.</p>
          <p>One word on Merial, I said already that overall the growth rate, 4.3%, looks relatively modest, but is in line with the overall Animal Health market. We are happy to report that we had a very good fourth quarter, which was so to say the first quarter of Merial being integrated inside Sanofi. This has been an integration which went extremely smooth. And so we had very nice growth of 10% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In fact when you look to the chart, you'll see that we are under-represented in this chart &#x2013; 25% of sales coming out of Emerging Markets. And, yes, of course this is part of our overall strategy to expand Merial stronger into the so-called Production Animal segment, but also stronger inside the Emerging Markets where in this 25% we see a very significant room for growth.</p>
          <p>The next one's a little bit difficult to read. You see a negative growth rate, which is due to a one-time event potentially, which was &#x2013; those sales are for H1N1 of more than &#x20AC;400 million in 2010, which could not be repeated of course.</p>
          <p>But if you correct it, you'll see that vaccines had a good growth with 7.2% on a very, very high base. Vaccines succeeded to make a nice record year, these flu vaccines, but beyond. Also the other products did extremely well <mark type="indiscernible" /> (054:29) Pentaxim in the Emerging Markets, as Emerging Markets overall continued to contribute to the growth of Vaccines nicely, with close to 11% growth. But also Menactra re-accelerated its growth due to new booster recommendations in the United States and extended global launches due to increased production capacity.</p>
          <p>Finally on Genzyme, you see that Genzyme had a good quarter this month and &#x20AC;800 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. You see then that those products which will be taken care of inside the Sanofi portfolio, which are in essence Synvisc and Renagel, play an important part. We are very, very confident that this larger footprint of Sanofi will of course accelerate growth in 2012.</p>
          <p>And I think it is clear and it has been already mentioned that the most important news around Genzyme of course is the approval of Framingham, which should help to lead the Genzyme in an even further accelerated growth into 2012 and to years to come.</p>
          <p>And mentioning the years to come is probably is the perfect bridge to pass onto Elias Zerhouni. Thank you so much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. What we wanted to do at this presentation is focus a little bit more on R&amp;D. And the reason we wanted to is because 2011 has been an extraordinary transition year for the R&amp;D organization. But first I'd like to share with you the principles that have &#x2013; the underpinning of the strategy that we followed.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, our global R&amp;D goals are really based on the fact that we, for the first time, created a global R&amp;D organization. And the fundamental reason we did this &#x2013; because (1) there is an enormous convergence in science in terms of vaccines and understanding immunology or in terms of multiple sclerosis, animal health. And the convergence of biology gives us some ideas about how to synergize between the different components of what has become today one of the largest biopharma companies in the world because we can produce insulin, biologics. We can do vaccines, monoclonal antibodies. And now with Genzyme, one of the best biotechs in the U.S., we have a spectrum of capabilities where we think we can get synergies that would not have been available to any other organization. It allows us to exploit economies of scale. And more importantly, as I will describe to you, we've had a deep exercise in terms of restructuring our R and our D, and improving our cost structure, which was inherited from the integration of multiple processing entities.</p>
          <p>The second strategy has been to focus on high-value projects. And what does that mean? It means fundamentally that there are only three things that will make an R&amp;D organization successful: (1) create products with high added medical value. And that is a very profound statement because we don't know at this point what the market is going to look like in five to ten years. But it's clear that payers are changing their behavior. And it is clear also that healthcare costs are going to grow at a fast rate.</p>
          <p>Ten years from now the total healthcare expenditure, despite all of the controls that are out there, are predicted to double. But 75% of these costs are related to chronic diseases. And so payers, patients, providers are really expecting us to provide integrated solutions to the needs of their patients over long periods of time.</p>
          <p>And this is where I think what we did was to focus our portfolio. And we stress-tested the portfolio in 2009 to really cull out of the portfolio, prune out of the portfolio things that really didn't have legs in the context of the new world. But we did focus &#x2013; and you'll see the results of that &#x2013; on the execution of late-stage projects. We accelerated that execution.</p>
          <p>We felt it was very important to change how we operated in R&amp;D based on the medical value, but more importantly based on the quality of the science. And quality of the science in this context means taking advantage of all the emerging capabilities that allow us to understand human disease in humans, and not just in mice and with low predictability of translation.</p>
          <p>We also established new models of external innovation. It's clear that, if you look at our strategy, it has two components. There is a D component, which is the development of what we do has to be outstanding, excellent, executed on time across a very complex chain of events that you need to control when you're doing clinical development. So we focused on the excellence of our development.</p>
          <p>On the R side, however, it is a more profound change that we needed to accomplish. Fundamentally if you look at the internal productivity of the industry, it has been quite low in terms of new products, innovative products on the research side.</p>
          <p>And the reason is, in my view, not just an organizational reason. I mean, everybody thought it's because the organizations are too big and unwieldy. But I can tell you it's not just a question of small size versus big size. It's also a question of smart. And smart means that you have to change fundamentally how you do innovation because there is no way with the emerging complexity of biology that any one company, any one country, can have all of the resources needed to master the fundamental biology of a disease process like cancer or diabetes.</p>
          <p>So it's clear that, as the explosion of innovation outside of the company occurred, we were not taking advantage of that. So over the past year, two years, we have exploded this, and we have promoted the concept of external opportunities and partnerships. But also we are really changing the model by creating an open model of interaction with both biotech and academia.</p>
          <p>And the Warp Drive Bio example, which we created in the past month actually, is a good example of &#x2013; what we are trying to do is not invest in others. We do not want to be passive investors. What we want to do is, using the principles that we talked about, is to have a clear idea of where we can build on our strength.</p>
          <p>And so when you look at R&amp;D &#x2013; and you'll see this in the presentation &#x2013; we are not going to be everywhere. I mean, diversification does not mean dispersion. And to us, what is very important is to stay focused on the greatest opportunities we have. So diabetes is one of them. Rare diseases is another one &#x2013; immuno-inflammation because of the strength we have with vaccines and with other components of the group.</p>
          <p>And so we're going to focus on areas where we can internally provide value to an external innovation pathway, but also access patients as early as possible in the process to understand the mode of action and know how to measure it to diagnostics or biomarkers.</p>
          <p>This is why, for example, Warp Drive is a unique example &#x2013; because the scientist who developed the method to read out the genomes of natural products or organisms have a technique, but he had no way of really using that until we realized that we had internally expertise that was accumulated for 50 years that was essentially not being used because we didn't have a way to read out what our libraries were doing. So we created one plus one equals three by putting our internal team with the external team and co-funding with an external partner something that we have hope will provide breakthrough products.</p>
          <p>Having said that, let me go back to the short term and medium term because, at the end of the day &#x2013; we can all talk about concepts of R&amp;D, but at the end of the day, what needs to happen is executing on what we have in front of us. And that has been the focus of 2011.</p>
          <p>So we focused on delivering what I consider a promising development portfolio. So in the short term, we focused on achieving regulatory milestones. And if you look at the data that you have, we had five products in the submission stage. And we submitted eight submissions &#x2013; five in the Europe Union and three in the U.S. &#x2013; in the past 12 months. And for those of you who know what it involves, very few organizations I know &#x2013; organizations I know can do this. Each application is hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. But on top of that, we have Lemtrada, which is coming in 2012. We have another four submissions in 2012 to complete &#x2013; the six products that we think have potential for approval in the near future.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, we decided not to just have a sort of generic development approach to the rest of the portfolio. And so we decided to have some high-value, high-priority projects that we would fast track, that we would work on in a way that will guarantee, if you will, excellent execution. Operational excellence is also a factor. And these are the next wave or late-stage projects, which I will talk to you about in greater detail, for most of them.</p>
          <p>So let's just look at the two concepts &#x2013; focusing on an emerging portfolio that is actually promising and combining this with our strategic intent, which is to build in focused areas across where we have value to add and in opening up to external partners.</p>
          <p>So the first franchise, if you will, that is emerging is multiple sclerosis. And this is truly an emerging franchise for us because we can, in fact, envision the ability for us at Sanofi because we have the capabilities across the spectrum of tools to really address the full spectrum of patient needs in multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>And you have to understand that multiple sclerosis is not one disease; it's a multiplicity of phases and types of disease that has multiple phenotypes, if you will. And at one end, you can have the patient with early MS and very limited disease where really you don't want to take a lot of risk, and you want to find treatments that are convenient and safe at the same time. And then you have the relapsing form with remission in the middle. That's an intermediate category where you still want convenience, but efficacy as well. And then you have the most severe cases where what's important here is to stop the disease at the most efficacious treatment at a reasonable safety level. And basically that spectrum is covered from Aubagio to Lemtrada.</p>
          <p>And we have other follow-on ideas about how to fill in the blanks, if you will, in the entire multiple sclerosis franchise, if you will. But remember that, for us, multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. It is in the world of what we call immunomodulation. And we want to build a very strong franchise in immunomodulation as the top number one or two company in that field.</p>
          <p>So Lemtrada &#x2013; what is Lemtrada? Lemtrada is truly a unique, unique product in the entire spectrum of products in multiple sclerosis. First, it has superior efficacy, demonstrated in two Phase III trials. But more importantly, it's an annual dosing mechanism. So in fact, you treat the patient at the beginning of one year, and then you don't treat the patient anymore.</p>
          <p>Now as Chris said, 80% of patients today require regular injections. This would be a yearly treatment &#x2013; essentially first year, second year. And I always like to point out that this kind of dosing is quite unusual for an autoimmune disease, but it's quite common in vaccines. That's what we do. We vaccinate and then we boost the vaccination.</p>
          <p>And I think the efficacy demonstrated in Phase III against a comparative Rebif, it's clear you can have the results from CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II, with a 55% and 49% reduction in the relapse rate, but also a statistically significant sustained accumulation of disability reduction. And that is becoming a standard in the care of patients with MS.</p>
          <p>I think the safety is understood. It's well characterized and consistent across studies. It's effectively managed. So from my standpoint, at one end of the spectrum, high efficacy, manageable safety, very convenient once-a-year dosing.</p>
          <p>Then Aubagio, at the other end, is an oral molecule, once daily therapy with comparable efficacy to an injectable interferon. That's the value proposition. I mean, we can't complicate things too much. It's important to realize that we are going for efficacy and safety at the different components of the spectrum of multiple sclerosis. And we've demonstrated that efficacy. We see, for example, that patients have a lower rate of discontinuation with Aubagio at equal efficacy to others. And I think there the safely is manageable. We've had patients on it for up to 10 years. We understand exactly what we have to do. So that's one area of focus &#x2013; autoimmune disease, autoimmunity, immunomodulation.</p>
          <p>The second is one of our best growth platforms, Diabetes. We completely have to make sure R&amp;D serves the needs of that platform. And so the first product that is coming out of the pipeline has been filed in the E.U. this year, will be filed in the U.S. towards November 2012, is Lyxumia, lixisenatide. Why is Lyxumia something that we believe in? Because it's a GLP-1 agonist with a very unique postprandial effect, and a one-step titration. It's simple, and it's very effective in the postprandial period, which is &#x2013; when you ask physicians who treat patients with diabetes, that's one of the variabilities that is the most important to treat.</p>
          <p>So how do you treat it? Well, short-acting insulin. But GLP-1s, especially this one, have the ability to dispense from the use of that short-acting insulin on top of basal insulin. That's why we think there's a very good effect here &#x2013; because it also has a weight-loss component to it, which balances the effects of insulin. So it's a consistent GLP-1 effect. We've demonstrated through a series of trials, including one that is going to be published today, that in fact we are reducing A1c and having a weight-loss effect and a favorable safety profile with much lower risk of hypoglycemic events. And it's simple peptide to use.</p>
          <p>Now why is that important in the strategy? People think, is that just a copycat or &#x2013; in fact, it turns out that, from our standpoint, what's really important here is that it has an optimal complementarity &#x2013; complementarity to basal insulins. And that's where we see an additional benefit here. And we have pre-trials which really tested lixisenatide on top of basal insulin because if you really look at the patients again treated &#x2013; type 2 diabetes patients &#x2013; and this is what I've been trying to do in the R&amp;D organization this year &#x2013; bring it back to the patient. Science is great; we understand that. But at the end of the day, what does it mean?</p>
          <p>Well, if you look at the people treated today with basal insulin, there are about 8 million people treated &#x2013; half of them on Lantus, half of them on other basal insulins. But when you look at the results, how many are really treated well and are getting to target? You realize that only half of them will reach target; half of them do not. They still have A1c hemoglobin over 7%. So we need to find a solution to that. We can't have 50% of our population not using our treatments effectively.</p>
          <p>And so what we found is that, by combining Lyxumia on top of basal insulin in pre-trials, we find that in fact we can bring these patients within &#x2013; closer to goal. And therefore, we &#x2013; this is why we're developing an injection device for combining Lantus with Lyxumia &#x2013; a fixed-dosed Lyxumia which is on track for Phase III initiation early in 2003 with a device that will do that.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at the Diabetes franchise, you realize that you have to look at patient needs. And if you really look at the patients who use insulin, a large number of them really do not get to target. Why is that? Because when you look at the pharmacokinetics of an insulin, what you have to be careful about is the peaks because the doctor is going to actually titrate the patient according to the peak, not the base. And because of that, what tends to happen is that, if you have a treatment, you want to be safe. And therefore the great majority of patients on basal insulins are under-treated.</p>
          <p>And so what we've been always looking for is an insulin that has a flatter PK/PD profile. And this one, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:14) has a PK/PD profile. But more importantly, 20% of patients with advanced diabetes use very high dose insulin, so they have to stick themselves more times than once. And the lower injection volume allow us to envision a way of helping these patients.</p>
          <p>But you're going to say, is this just the formulation? It's not just the formulation. It's a different biophysical principle. The crystal of insulin inside of a &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> the pillow of (1:13:50) insulin is really different in a normal formulation where there's fewer molecules of insulin per unit of space, whereas in the new formulation, we've been able to pack more insulin in a much smaller volume.</p>
          <p>So (1) we can address the clinical need, but (2) because of that, it dilutes at a different rate. And that's what gives us the unique, flat PK/PD profile. And that's why we're our first Phase III trials on high dose insulin users to see how we can, in fact, improve the treatment of these patients.</p>
          <p>Now diabetes is a major franchise area for us. Cancer is also such a franchise. You know about all the currently marketed products. And this year we have strengthened our portfolio with Zaltrap. Now why is Zaltrap, aflibercept, something we think has potential? Because unlike the other in the market that hits one receptor, this one is a trap. It really traps the ligand, which means that it's really affecting every endergonic target in the process. That's why we wanted to really push this one with the positive results in metastatic colorectal cancer. And we have ideas about how to extend the utilization of Zaltrap for patients with different conditions.</p>
          <p>And next to that is Visamerin or Mulsevo, which is the &#x2013; I mean, fundamentally what we have to understand is that treating the cancer patient is not just giving an anti-cancer drug. It's also managing the complications inherent to the cancer state. One of them is that a large number of patients, when started on chemotherapy, will develop venous thrombo-embolism. And these can be quite lethal conditions.</p>
          <p>And this product is the only ultra low weight, molecular weight heparin that is effective in reducing the particular state of patients with cancer and coagulability issues, and reducing the risk in chemo-treated cancer patients. It doesn't have an impact on major bleeding incidents. And the treatment effect has been consistent across tumor types. So that's again a reinforcement of what we consider one of our platforms, if you will, in R&amp;D &#x2013; oncology.</p>
          <p>Clearly, when you look at the history of our company and you look at our ability to play in cardiovascular areas, we had a historical success in thrombosis and arrhythmias and other conditions. So there's quite a bit of inherent knowledge. And when we looked at what Genzyme was bringing in the rare disease space and then what we had in the portfolio with PCSK9, we realized that in fact we may have a very favored franchise there. Why? Because if you look at the 40,000 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia that comes from genetic causes, about 5,000 of them are homozygous. In other words, they inherited the gene from both their mother and their father that increased cholesterol to levels that are unbelievably high &#x2013; and about 35,000 that have a severe but heterozygous condition.</p>
          <p>Well, this is what Kynamro is focusing on. This is a novel type of therapy because it suppresses. It's what we're calling an anti-sense RNA. It goes directly to the liver and blocks the production of cholesterol. And that significantly reduces LDLC, and liver fat is stabilized at 12 months. And we really see a significant reduction in apolipoprotein B production and Lp(a), which are really important characteristics with these patients to have a good outcome.</p>
          <p>So this is one component &#x2013; again rare diseases at one end, with the Genzyme approach to rare diseases.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have in our portfolio something that we are putting a lot of attention to, and that is the PCSK9 monoclonal antibody. This is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody addressing unmet needs in hypercholesterolemia. And this is a common pattern of development today. When you look at your R&amp;D, you have to define a significant unmet need. Now we know that 30% to 40% of patients are not at goal with statins. And there are many reasons for them &#x2013; some familial, some compliance, some tolerability. But what is clear is that we have reached a plateau in reducing mortality and morbidity in atherosclerosis.</p>
          <p>And I think the landmark study that I'm referring to on the slide is the study that showed in Texas 9,000 patients followed over years that the PCSK9 gene was disabled. The patients had a very low rate of coronary disease and lower rate of LDLC cholesterol.</p>
          <p>That observation, a human observation, led to a race in developing this. In 2009, Chris and the team decided to focus on PCSK9 because it has a strong translational rationale and it has a strong medical value attached to it, in our opinion. And so what we did is, realizing that the mode of action is different in statins &#x2013; that in fact you had an opportunity here with smart development to reach a goal quite fast in terms of reaching proof of concept and eventually Phase III.</p>
          <p>And sure enough Phase II results have been described for the reduction in the LDLC in 65% systematically, even on top of statins, which shows the complementarity of the pathways and at the same time that we have opportunities to treat patients who can't tolerate statins. And we're starting Phase III in the second quarter of 2012. We've already started the Phase III long-term study in December of 2011. So again addressing unmet needs.</p>
          <p>Because we are quite expert in cardiovascular thrombosis, for example, and other like Plavix or other treatment like low molecular weight heparins and other approaches, we really focused on this one, Otamixaban. Why is that? Because when you talk to physicians who treat acute coronary events, what they will tell you is that one of their biggest fear is that they will treat the event and they will harm the patient because they have to use heparin or anti-coagulants, the action of which is slow in coming, which means that, when they do the intervention, the blood can clot and they fail, or slow in going. In other words, the anti-coagulant action lasts so long that they've treated the patient, then the next day they have a significant hemorrhagic complication, including hemorrhagic stroke.</p>
          <p>So doctors have been looking for something that would be short in terms of reaching efficacy and short in terms of quitting the anti-coagulating effect. So I'm trying to explain it to you &#x2013; why is it that we are interested in this product? It's because it provides a superior outcome while simplifying treatment.</p>
          <p>Treatment today is very complex. With this one, what we hope is that interventional surgeons, interventional radiologists who do a lot of &#x2013; cardiologists, who do a lot of these procedures, will realize that with this they can have a one-step titration and a one-step deactivation of the thrombotic event.</p>
          <p>So those are, in my view, the advantages of Otamixaban. And we'll see. We have a Phase III that we'll finish that the end of the year, and we'll see if that's true.</p>
          <p>Again building on the rare disease franchise, continuing to say, we don't want to be dispersed; we want to be focused on things we are good at and build on strength. This Eliglustat is, in my view, not only a novel therapy for Gaucher disease, but it's probably a revolutionary therapy because it addresses the disease in a different way. With Cerezyme, what we try to do is replace the defective enzyme. With this medication, what we try to do &#x2013; it's a small molecule. It goes to the brain and goes to different parts of the body, bones for example. But what we're trying to do it different than Cerezyme. What we're trying to do is actually inhibit the enzyme that produces the harmful ceramide, which is the one that accumulates and makes these patients have an enlarged liver and the dysfunction that is associated with Gaucher disease.</p>
          <p>That's why our colleagues in Genzyme really jumped on this opportunity. And frankly it's a potent and novel substrate inhibitor that has the convenience of oral therapy and can eliminate the challenges of infusing patients. But it's complementary in many ways because it will help us in truly managing this disease more comprehensively. And the clinical profile is expected to be similar to Cerezyme because it's really in the pathway. But we believe that over time with the Phase II data that we have &#x2013; and we have completely recruited Phase III &#x2013; that what we hope is that this will be a game changer for these patients.</p>
          <p>You can have a patient here, for example, 18 years of age. You can see the size of the patient. Three years on Eliglustat, and you can see the impact physiologically on this young patient. It is, in my view, probably the most significant change in the management of this disease that will occur.</p>
          <p>So to finish &#x2013; I don't want to miss my colleague Olivier Charmeil's accomplishments here, as again we're working as a global organization, and we're sharing our resources to make sure that the high-value projects are supported and executed with operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Well, dengue vaccine, in my view, is actually &#x2013; in truth over the past 10 years, there's not been a novel vaccine in the field. Everything has been sort of modification of what we know. This is the first true novel vaccine design for dengue. And dengue is, in my view, a growing global threat because the mosquito that carries dengue lives in cities. Urbanization is fast occurring. Global warming is affecting a larger swath of the world. It's truly at this point a public health priority in Asia and Latin America &#x2013; 220 million infections.</p>
          <p>So we think that this, in my view, provides a solution to a rising problem at the right time. There's a global Phase III program currently ongoing with 43,000 individuals. And this is something that I think has to be understood about global R&amp;D. Global R&amp;D at Sanofi is capable of launching a global clinical development program in all of the areas of interest in the company. And this is a good example of that.</p>
          <p>Now clearly dengue is a major threat. The vaccine itself is scientifically extremely innovative because it uses a chimera where we use a yellow fever virus and we build all of the antigens of the dengue viruses, which are four of them, so that we can produce the tetravalent vaccine that this dengue vaccine is. And I really have great confidence that this will be a successful launch.</p>
          <p>So 18 potential new launches &#x2013; you have the list. I am only giving you what is in the current late-stage portfolio. I understand that &#x2013; and I'm told &#x2013; that there is a lot of discounting whatever R&amp;D chiefs say in terms of their early portfolio. And I agree. We should, given the track record of the past 20 years. But I think we have here tangible, measurable outcomes of R&amp;D you can check us on.</p>
          <p>And frankly when you look at the catalysts in 2012 &#x2013; you have the list &#x2013; we are committed to these. But importantly I think you should not ignore &#x2013; and you have that in the appendix &#x2013; our earlier-stage portfolio and our preclinical portfolio, which also I think promises to be quite significant.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you, Elias. So let's have a look at now where we're going in 2012. So as we thought about guidance, we said, all right, what do we want to signal that's new? What do we want to tell you in the guidance that's a change from what we've already told you? The answer is nothing. Sixth of September, a lot of us up here, we gave you a vision of where we saw the company going to 2015. What's happened in the meantime? Well, we had a very solid fourth quarter &#x2013; all the growth platforms performing exactly in line. In fact, for any Doubting Thomases on Emerging Markets, I think we put those to rest. If anything, if there's any new news, it's the fact that we've de-risked the Genzyme recovery through the approval of the Framingham facility.</p>
          <p>So let's have a look specifically at 2012. This is just the things that are going to happen. Again I wouldn't expect for anybody who's been following us to have any surprises in any of this. Clearly, what are the headwinds? Well, March, Avapro is going to go. May, Plavix is going to go. August, Eloxatin is going to go. On the full year effect, Taxotere. We've seen that Momenta has lost the injunction on a second generic, and we would expect that in the market. We've already put our own generic out there. The Copaxone agreement terminates in Q1 of 2012.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we've clearly gotten very strongly performing growth platforms. They've been performing for three years, and I think they're going to continue to perform. We will get an additional quarter of Genzyme. So we will consolidate four quarters instead of three quarters in 2011. And I think we've developed a good reputation on being disciplined on costs.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean? Well, you know, I think we're also trying to be very transparent. What is the actual impact on Plavix? Well, on September the 6, it was &#x20AC;1.4 billion. What's it today? It's still &#x20AC;1.4 billion. So if we take into account very robust performances in the growth platform, cost control, and the impact of Plavix, Avapro, and other generic competition, we would expect EPS for 2012 to be in line with consensus, which is around 12% to 15% lower than 2011.</p>
          <p>Now exchange rates always play a role in all the consensus, and we tried to decode all of that. But our belief is that this is in line with consensus. And again this is exactly in line with our vision of the business that we had on September 6. Nothing has changed as far as we're concerned. We still are extremely confident that, as we come out of 2012, we've got a growing business.</p>
          <p>And why is that? Well, it's because nothing happens to the business. The only thing that happens is the stuff that's dragging us down goes away, but the growth platforms just continue to march along. And when you remove the part that's negative, then you just have a higher and higher percentage of what is growth platform.</p>
          <p>So as we stand here today, we believe that we can do 5% annual compound growth rate on sales between 2012 and 2015. If you go back 30 years, you will find that diversified companies pretty much consistently have a higher PE than those who aren't. And we believe that we've got a nicely balanced business. We've got scale in some pretty important franchises &#x2013; leaders in Vaccines, leaders in Diabetes, leaders in rare diseases, leaders in Animal Health. We're now one of the top five companies in Consumer Health.</p>
          <p>What happens when patent expires afterwards? Sanofi goes through one of the most concentrated patent cliffs, but it comes through the patent cliff. By the time we get through the patent cliff, 6% of our sales are related to small molecules in generic-endemic countries &#x2013; i.e., U.S., Europe and Japan &#x2013; probably the lowest of any company in our industry.</p>
          <p>Large Emerging Markets presence &#x2013; are those countries here and there going to have hiccups? Yes. Are we going to be able to do double-digit every single quarter? I don't know. We can't manage those businesses as tightly as we've been able to do in the U.S. and Europe. But I do fundamentally believe in the emergence of middle classes, the growth of those economies. And I think that it is the biggest lever of growth for the entire pharmaceutical, and I don't think anybody's better positioned to seize that than Sanofi.</p>
          <p>Research and development, you've heard that, having cleaned out the portfolio three years ago, actually that stuff is still here. And it's now being filed, and it is coming to market. And I think Elias has given a good indication of some of the interesting things we have in the pipeline. There's still work to do, that's why we're doing a massive shift in research. But I actually think that in research and development, we were behind three years ago. We're at least as good as anybody I think in the industry today. And I think on research, we're prepared to be more radical than most.</p>
          <p>Operating margin will be affected, and we gave guidance on that. Nothing's changed on that either by the way. We're still at the 31% to 32%. But the &#x20AC;2 billion that we will pull out of the business on top of a growing business mathematically leads you to higher margins as we go forward.</p>
          <p>We'll have leveraged P&amp;L, so that means we would expect earnings per share, compound annual growth rate to be in excess of sales. And as we've said all along, we believe in shareholder returns, and so we'll increase our dividend payout ratio to 50%.</p>
          <p>Well, thanks very much for listening. And let's turn this over to some Q&amp;A, and love to hear from you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Luisa Hector at Credit Suisse. I've got three questions for you. Firstly, on the guidance, Chris, you showed the slide with the tailwinds and the headwinds, but you've got the guidance range. Is there anything specific driving that range? I guess Lovenox and Genzyme are probably the two bigger swing factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, obviously you've got the &#x20AC;1.4 billion that's Plavix and Avapro. We only had Taxotere for three quarters last year. You'll have a fourth quarter in this year. We've got Eloxatin. We were very thrilled to get Eloxatin back last year, but Eloxatin will go away again in August. We don't expect anything new on European pricing. Last year European pricing cost us about &#x20AC;300 million. I don't see things getting better in Europe. We have no particular evidence that anything's getting worse either. So we would kind of expect difficult times in Europe to continue.</p>
          <p>I think we're making extremely strong progress with Genzyme. I'm more confident than ever than in the recovery of Genzyme. And I think that the ability for us to really work with Genzyme &#x2013; it's not just a recovery. I think there's excitement in Genzyme when you look at the new products coming along. And we're clearly seeing the ability with Hanspeter's organization of what we can do behind biosurgery and behind the renal and oncology business.</p>
          <p>So there's nothing in particular. It's just this is 2012, and we've always known this is the cliff year. And so that's where we are. And as I say, I think our view of the world is pretty much in sync with where our investors are.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, just coming back to the cost savings, you've got about &#x20AC;1.7 billion left to deliver. And I think you were saying basically for 2012 it would really be the residual Genzyme cost savings coming through. So can you put any more color on the timing of the rest of the savings and why they are more delayed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is no delay, huh? We have this &#x20AC;2 billion objective for 2015. So if split it over four years, it's &#x20AC;500 million per year. The way you need to look at it is the following. I mean (a) you have Genzyme. So we have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:35:40) in 2011. We have a $700 million full-year impact 2013. And clearly, the savings in 2012 will be somewhere in between because all these change in organization which we are implementing, such as for example, running out the new ARP, we say country-by-country for the 80 countries was as I indicated. And then you get the savings over time over the years. And I can take examples like that. So clearly, there is another contribution from Genzyme this year.</p>
          <p>I mean &#x2013; and last year. I mean, you saw the slide I presented. We are implementing all of our industrial lean approach, having a total cost of ownership approach to see how we can generate maximum value of the production &#x2013; I mean, also having the commercial people speaking more with industrial people to reduce the number of SKUs, to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:35) which we are positioning all over the world <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:42). But actually, all these take a bit of time to be implemented.</p>
          <p>But on the other arm, we are going to benefit this year from the savings which result from the decisions we took 2009 and 2010 &#x2013; for instance the restructure of our clinical network in France and Europe. So there's always a delay between the time you harvest the savings and the time you start recycling payment in.</p>
          <p>Of course if you decide to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:37:11) in the U.S., it is probably much quicker R&amp;D. I mean, on the R, we have big scale reorganization taking place. By mid-year and even maybe before, all people working in Bridgewater will have either moved to Cambridge or left the company. And that &#x2013; I mean, still you have to move all the infrastructure, the IS, I mean, the information system as well.</p>
          <p>So these are how things work. So at the end of the day, from what I tried to describe to you, out of the average &#x20AC;500 million, we should see more of these taking place this year. In other term, there will be some front-loading of the &#x20AC;2 billion, which will be already in 2012 and 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, you take &#x20AC;2 billion between now and 2015, you could say it's &#x20AC;500 million a year. That ain't going to happen. I mean, the only thing that takes longer is industrial affairs. The rest of it all is going to come much closer in the period. So most of the savings actually are up-front. And I think if you look at our last &#x20AC;2 billion, originally in 2009, we said we'd take &#x20AC;2 billion out before 2013. In actual fact, we took the &#x20AC;2 billion out in 2011. So I think we've got a pretty good track record of, when we sit down to do it, of taking costs out.</p>
          <p>We're always cautious in how we express that because we've got a big cost base in Europe, and there are always negotiations and computations that have to be done. And we never want to get out ahead of those. But I think if you look at what we've done on costs, that's what we're going to do in the front. So the most of those cost savings will come in in the next couple of years &#x2013; not in 2015.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And could I also just ask on the Lantus new formulation, does that &#x2013; the studies that you've started with once-daily dosing &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> the sort of pitching, (1:38:55) is this a true &#x2013; true once daily? And then could you comment on the timing of the data and whether this would be filed as a novel drug or as a supplemental to Lantus please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the current Phase III trial, we're really focusing on high dosage with a goal of glycemic control in hypoglycemia. So that's exactly the point. And then there was can we do it in that mode and reduce the number of injections that you have to do?</p>
          <p>But also more importantly is really understand whether we can get better glycemic control over &#x2013; and with less hypoglycemia. The formulation is really a patented formulation. So it has actually some specific composition <mark type="ph" /> of matter issues (1:39:51) to it in terms of the physics and the biophysics of it. So it is patented, per se.</p>

          <p>The first one is, could we have a little bit more color on the impact of austerity measures, slashed healthcare reform which impacted 2011, and what could it be for 2012?</p>
          <p>And my second question is about Iniparib. You found a new mechanism of action, so could we have a little bit more color on this new mechanism of action? And what could be now the new &#x2013; the indications for this product and the timing of Phase III timing and launching? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hanspeter, you want to take the austerity measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll take the austerities. I think it was mentioned before. We estimated at approximately &#x20AC;300 million in Europe, and I think we have said another &#x20AC;100 million in the United States coming out of previous measures in 2010, possibly even in 2009, out of the so-called Obama Plan. So roundabout &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>And in anticipation, we anticipate nothing more dramatic. This has to be handled with care if the overall macroeconomic situation became a little bit unpredictable. And there's more pressures on the macro system, as more will be on the microsystem of healthcare. But in our estimates, we have anticipated approximately the same impact 2012 as in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as Iniparib is concerned, as you can see from the data that &#x2013; the information that you have, we're definitely continuing the trials that were ongoing. So we're going to have a redial of that. In the meantime though, we did elucidate the mode of action. And Iniparib is acting in a way that we understand better, which will lead us to redesign some of our approaches to it. Fundamentally, it's acting like a prodrug and really is metabolized within cancer cells, which really has unique advantages in our view and explains also some of the results that we've had. And so we're trying to really exploit this knowledge right now.</p>
          <p>So two phases &#x2013; (1) we continue as we had in the trials because now we have some confidence that we understand what's happening; second, redesigning some of the &#x2013; or designing de novo a new approach to it dose-wise, as well as delivery-wise.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Vincent Meunier from Exane BNP Paribas. Two questions, if I may. The first one is a follow-up question on the new glargine formulation. Is it required to perform cardiovascular studies with that new compound? And will you test the usual glargine molecule as the comparator? Also what's your commercial strategy against Novo Nordisk's degludec, which is potentially launched, or at least approved by the end of July this year? And last question on Lemtrada, what could be the pricing for this drug, assuming it's a yearly infusion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're going to have to take one question at a time. I don't have that &#x2013; so go back to the first one on the glargine, if you don't mind. And I'll take that. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:42) Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the glargine, the question is, do you have to perform cardiovascular studies? And will you compare it to the usual glargine molecule?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we don't expect to do that. I mean, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:44:02) in its own, as a molecule of matter. It's different in its PK/PD. So we have to document that. We have to find out what happens in terms of the typical endpoint, glycemic control, and hypoglycemic events. Second question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was on degludec.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you see, first, we will not define our commercial strategy because they aren't through Phase III and have a labeling. And even if we would, we would not communicate today about it.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are not too excited about the context of the compound. To be frank with you, I think I have said before, that we went to similar place with detemir. You know that means that detemir has not been such successful. We have seen across the recent clinical data where we see, according to what Novo Nordisk said, no difference at all between Lantus and this product in the &#x2013; I have a memory loss &#x2013; in the group of diabetes 1 patients. What we see in the diabetes 2 population is very marginal already from a clinical point of view. I think we have 0.05 <mark type="ph" /> high points (1:45:30) per patient here. So whatever you show those statistically may be interesting, but it has not a lot of clinical relevance. And as I also said earlier, we have to see how this product comes to the market at this price and so on and so forth. And then we have a number of options to react or just to let it go by, as we did with detemir.</p>
          <p>The last one was on the potential pricing of Lemtrada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just maybe I'll add &#x2013; I mean, the only thing I would say on degludec from what we're hearing is that basically if detemir was too short, degludec is too long. And so we can deal with that commercially.</p>
          <p>Lemtrada pricing, I think we're not going to comment on at this stage. But given the results, we would certainly &#x2013; I'm just not going to comment, actually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I'll jump in with a couple of questions from our webcast. We've got one for J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:46:39). He's asking what are the expectations in terms of payout increase for the dividend in 2012 already? And he wonders whether we will actually increase the dividend in 2012 despite an EPS decline this year.</p>
          <p>And we've got another one maybe I guess for our Head of Vaccines here, Olivier Charmeil. There's a question on whether the strong Q4 performance of vaccines in Emerging Markets is related to any specific tender process or other growth drivers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the dividend, firstly, a dividend is <mark type="ph" /> a ERE (1:47:21) decision come from the board of directors to compose a general meeting to approve a dividend. So it's not time to ask any board member to announce themselves on what could be the dividend to paid 2013 on 2012 results precisely.</p>
          <p>Now if you look at the graph, I mean, clearly we are &#x2013; I don't know we have really clear signal. But the fact that we have this idea to increase the dividend up to &#x20AC;2.65, which is a 6% increase, when our profit is decreasing &#x2013; a signal that we are aiming clearly to have a regular increase of our dividend over year in order to reach the 50% payout in 2013, pay it on the result in 2013. And clearly, the results in 2013 should be higher than the results in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now how are we going to exactly present these two figures? And this will have to be decided next year. The only thing I can say is that &#x2013; I think that we said that already &#x2013; that by all means we are not considering, or we will not consider reducing the dividend even if our profit will decline in 2012. So this is also clearly excluded. So between flat to slight increase going to the 50% payout in 2014, I mean, this is where we'll be next year.</p>

Our growth is very much driven by our contacts in sales, our pediatric combination, with strong sales in Mexico and in other parts of Latin America.</p>
          <p>We have also got the IPV in Brazil. Brazil has made a decision to put on its immunization schedule IPV, and this is a major achievement. And we had our first shipment at the end of December, so it is of course sustainable sales. And the last element is the OPV sale to UNICEF, and it could play from one quarter to the other. There's nothing very significant here. We continue to see a strong momentum for OPV. And since the beginning of the year 2012, we see the level of requirements coming from UNICEF &#x2013; that the OPV sales continue to show some strong momentum.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Philippe Lanone from Natixis. Just one quick question on Lyxumia because in your the slide, you only presented an add-on on top of Lantus basically, while there's been a lot of change in the GLP-1 environment with the negative results of the once-a-weeks. So what do you see as a future for monotherapy Lyxumia apart from the fixed combination?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope I didn't convey that. There is &#x2013; definitely because of the postprandial effect and the ease of use, it has a single freestanding use, per se. And I hope I didn't mis-convey the fact that it can only be used on top of Lantus. But because of that, it has a unique profile to be, in fact, combined with basal insulins, not just Lantus &#x2013; because of this postprandial control profile which is quite unique in class GLP-1s and the fact that you can titrate it in one step. You don't have to wait four to six weeks to get there.</p>
          <p>I hope I'm answering &#x2013; it has both uses &#x2013; GLP-1 alone and GLP-1 on top of insulin. And remember, all GLP-1s have the advantage of weight loss versus weight gain so that you stabilize the patient at a better rate. And through the studies we've done, I mean, you can see there is a better achievement of A1c levels with the combination. But it is not just a combo product; it has a freestanding merit.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Mark Beards from Goldman Sachs. A couple of questions on the pipeline, if I may. Firstly, we didn't see PCSK9 on your new launches 2015 slide. Is that because it's a long-term opportunity and still will face a couple years of development, or is it just missing from that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, Lantus, lixisenatide, and new Lantus, obviously you've got a combination in development for Lantus and lixisenatide. You're also developing a new Lantus. How should we think about those two programs, and will they converge at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on PCSK9, go to page 55. It's right there on the bottom of the 2015 column.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the Lantus U-100, U300, you said PCSK9? I didn't quite hear the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the question was, you're developing new Lantus. You also are developing a Lantus, lixisenatide combination. Will those two programs converge? Do you have any update on them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point, I can't comment on the new Lantus converging with lixi. What we're doing right now is lixi plus Lantus because we do define that as a special categorization.</p>
          <p>The beginning development for U300 are the patients who are not a target, especially the high insulin use patients. So at this point I can't comment on whether or not our development is going to go there. Our first Phase III is on the 20% of patients who really are at high doses with any basal insulin, by the way, and are not our goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have an update on the combination development plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the combination, as I said, we are launching the Phase III in 2013. The device is &#x2013; the FDA requires that you do your Phase IIIs with your final commercial device. So that's what's getting to a start in end of 2012, beginning of 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take a question from Eric le Berrigaud.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Eric le Berrigaud, Bryan, Garnier. Three questions &#x2013; first would be on Emerging Markets. For the six products to be filed, you're still very much focused on the U.S. and Europe. How far behind are other filings in territories like China or Japan, for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So actually we look at global development now. So if you look at our PCSK9, we're already in files in Japan, for example. Zaltrap, same thing; we're trying to submit to other health authorities. But you're right. I think the key is in many countries, if you don't have an E.U. or an FDA approval, it's hard to go to Phase II. Like China, for example, will not allow you to do a Phase II trial unless you have &#x2013; or else you have to do the Phase I with compound produced in China. So when you strategize all that, you have to understand that it's almost obligatory that you start U.S., E.U., no matter what.</p>
          <p>So in Japan &#x2013; but on the other hand, in Japan we have Lyxumia there; we have PCSK9 there. I can't remember the others, but I know that we are putting Japan now much earlier in the process because, if you recall, Japan used to have the tradition of waiting for all approvals elsewhere before starting. That has changed. They do want to reduce the time of access to new molecules by their patients. So it's not reported here, but I can convey that information to you if you wish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, it's quite a mix because there are some countries also in Emerging Markets that, once you have approval either in the U.S. or in Europe, you will automatically get approval in those countries. So there's actually quite a wide range of variability. But at least, as Elias said, for particularly China and Japan, there is going to be some delay, but probably less than it has been in the past.</p>

          <p>Unless it's a disease that is specific to the region, we are still going to do global development with U.S. and Europe being key to the approval for our pathway.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So precisely, the second question relates to PCSK9. The target, per se, looks very much interesting. But what could you say already about safety and, in terms of injection site reaction, whether you see anything, and whether your overall formulation is already into early stage development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, the overall formulation is pretty &#x2013; we clearly understand that. We wouldn't be going Phase III in three months if we didn't have that. The device is something &#x2013; the dosing, we're pretty clear on what needs to be done. In terms of safety, I don't know if you went to <mark type="ph" /> the H.A. (1:56:59) but we did report at <mark type="ph" /> the H.A. that immunologistically (1:57:00) we don't see that in the Phase II trials. We had one reaction, a skin reaction &#x2013; unclear whether it was the product or something else.</p>
          <p>So it looks extremely safe from the current data that we have. No increase in other parameters that would say, oh, there's a counterbalancing effect or lowering, for example, in HDL or something like this that typically you'd worry about. So right now we're quite comfortable with the safety profile. We'll find out in Phase III.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last one in terms of dividend &#x2013; do you plan, as last year, to pay &#x2013; to offer the possibility for the dividend to be paid in shares?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a quick one. Maybe we'll take questions here from Alexandra Hauber [J.P. Morgan], second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Several questions &#x2013; question for Hanspeter first. I think it was said in the press release that the SoloSTAR conversion's now up to 50%, up from 40%. Is that going fairly smooth, and are you confident you can sort of increase that penetration every year by 10 percentage points so that by 2014, 2015 we should be at this sort of 80%, 90%? And what are you actually doing to make sure that that's happening?</p>
          <p>And then second question is just around the topic of pens. Have you finally defined which device you're going to take into Phase III for the lixi, Lantus combination? Are you still pursuing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:58:38) components can be titrated?</p>
          <p>And then also on &#x2013; I'll ask that later since you want to take the questions one by one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take conversion to SoloSTAR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say conversion &#x2013; yes, I think 40% is not a bad result. You will remember it was a market totally dominated by coverage. So that's already the answer to the second part of the question &#x2013; what do we do? We favor everything commercially from a promotional point of view which goes into conversion. And we de-favor anything which would keep the market on coverages.</p>
          <p>Can we bring to market to 100%? I don't think so. But I think as we grow, you are right, huh? Would we like to grow faster? Yes. Yes, perhaps on the other side we have to see that there is still a market of non-pens where we also have to continue to make offers with Lantus not in pens. But I think 40% today...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>50%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...50% today where we have been, I think in 2005 or 2006 at 10% or 15%, it's a good way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that we have really increased our efforts in this in the last two years. And that includes pricing and other commercial terms in addition to promotion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, we're continuing with the development of devices that could give you fixed/flex so that you can titrate the insulin. We think it's important for patients. I don't think you have the ability &#x2013; I mean, the fixed/flex for us works well because lixisenatide is a fixed dose. It's either 10 or 20, so there's not a lot of complexity to that. But we have &#x2013; this is what we pursue. I mean, we have a device with some backup, and aiming for some increased fee with a commercial device in 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's still not finalized since it's only in a year where you're initiating. Or have you nailed it now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much. I mean, all &#x2013; you have to do all the PK/PD trials obviously for that before you start your Phase III. So we're ongoing through that, and we have in primary device a backup, like every development plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, to be clear, the device is fixed. There is a backup device. So we're not tinkering with the device at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're just making sure that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're doing PK/PD studies...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...for the device to make sure it's valid and we're to be able to get into authorization into Phase III with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I just would like to ask you for a little bit more color on the Genzyme situation. You said that you're going to initiate to dose the patients on the waiting list &#x2013; I can't remember whether you said March or second quarter. How long's that waiting list and how long's it's going to get to everyone for full dosing?</p>
          <p>And on Cerezyme, I know it's going to take you some time to get as much out of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:01:37) as you would like, but can you just update us what the Cerezyme situation is in terms of patient dosing and wait lists?</p>
          <p>And just in general, how long do you think, since you have to balance the supply, patient dosing, and inventory, how long will it be until we have completely normal inventory levels again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we start with inventory levels, one of the aspects of this type of production is that yields can vary fairly significantly. Historically, Genzyme had five, six months of inventory. So if you had some of the fluctuations in batch-to-batch yields, we picked that up. We were running at less than one month of inventory. Now we came out of 2011 with actually higher inventory levels than we expected, and so I think it will be a gradual build.</p>
          <p>But clearly there's a constant patient demand. And so until we really get every patient on a full dose that needs the drug, we're not about to start putting product in the warehouse. So we will continue to operate at least through most of 2012 with minimum levels of inventory.</p>
          <p>Now batch-to-batch variability is interesting. We are just coming through the first time that the Allston facility has been shut down for maintenance in 10 years. And our belief is that potentially this could have a beneficial impact on yields as well. We have no evidence of it yet, but those are the sorts of things that could have a result.</p>
          <p>We won't be able to immediately be able to use the Fabrazyme reactors because, after Fabrazyme is completed, we actually have to go through a validation process to be able to use the other reactors. The real benefit is expected to come from eliminating some of the other downstream bottlenecks because we've taken Fabrazyme out and really significantly simplified the operations of the Allston facility.</p>
          <p>The Allston facility was built 20 years ago, and it was built really for one product. And so when four products came in, we'd almost overloaded that facility. So we're now getting that facility back to really what it was originally intended to do. And we've also been able to replace a lot of the aging equipment because this facility has been running flat-out for 10 years.</p>
          <p>So I think, as I say, on Cerezyme, we're going to see a gradual increase in sales over the year principally because in the fourth quarter we weren't able to fully provide dosing for patients.</p>
          <p>I think the real change in Gaucher is going to come through Eliglustat. And Eliglustat is clearly a game changer in this, offering an oral drug. Remember, patients have been on some of these twice-monthly infusions all their life. I mean, Genzyme has followed patients very often from childhood through to adulthood. Now to offer them an oral with the same level of &#x2013; at least the same level of efficacy is quite an opportunity.</p>
          <p>On Fabrazyme, I think the interesting thing about Fabrazyme is you've got five times the enzyme that the Shire product has. And we've clearly seen that at least some patients don't do as well when they're not getting the full dose of the product. We've certainly got enough patients who are anxiously awaiting Fabrazyme to come into the marketplace, especially since we're offering five times the dose for the same price as Shire.</p>
          <p>So I think on that one, we're more than competitive. And we get up to &#x2013; we first have an obligation to patients who are on the drug. And, as I say, that we believe we get to in the beginning of March. And I can't remember exactly how many patients are on there. But we take that on a first-come, first-served basis to be fair to all patients. And I believe by mid-2012, we get back to full supply, even on the waiting list. And we will have started to supply those patients in Europe who are desperately awaiting Fabrazyme.</p>

          <p>We'll take a question from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:06:02) on the left-hand side, third row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:06:05). I had a question on your vaccine, your joint venture in Europe. You've done extremely well after the acquisition of the full control of Merial. So what is your strategy with your JV vaccine in Europe? Are you satisfied with the <mark type="indiscernible" />? How would you liberate (1) performance of the subsidiary, (2:06:27) and (b) the asset value.</p>
          <p>I have also a question on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:06:41). What is the value proposition for that one compared to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:06:48), for example? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if I have understood correctly. I think the question goes, what we would do with the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:07:01), after having substantially integrated Meriala and it should go to a...</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...and liberate of the asset value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it should be answered by Olivier Charmeil on the first row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are clearly not happy with the performance of the joint venture. We have changed management. We have a new management on board since September. We are busy working in two directions. The first one is identifying goals of opportunities. And we have clearly &#x2013; we are starting to identify clear goals of opportunity.</p>
          <p>I think just an example, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:07:40) have been declining significantly since the end of the catch-up period. But we see now that the utilization rates when compared to the U.S. are really on the low side. We have faced some issues in terms of supply in the last two or three years. And month-by-month we get back on track, and at some point we'll be in the position to launch Zostavax in the U.K.</p>
          <p>The third &#x2013; second dimension is really on making sure that we operate in a more efficient way in the various countries. And we are going to look to various opportunities to combine our force to make sure that we get really the full benefit of the Merck support and of the Sanofi support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the JAK2, I mean, fundamentally it's an equivalent pathway to the JAK2 inhibition that Insight had and targets on myelofibrosis, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:08:41), we're looking at other indications, but basically a JAK2 inhibitor. Then the differentiation is going to be on relative efficacy and safety.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in other words, we'll need to do the &#x2013; I think the interesting thing for us is having an oncology portfolio that covers all the principal mechanisms of action. I think when you look at whether it's MEK inhibitors or PI3Ks or JAK2s, Sanofi's now been able to build a portfolio and development of all those. And I think what is also interesting is that we're exploring ways of combining those, which few companies will be able to do because we essentially have the full portfolio of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, we had a number of questions from the Web, which were fairly similar to what we heard here in the room. Maybe I'll just pick one last question from Mark Dainty. He basically says that market EPS estimates for 2013 seems to be a bit pessimistic. So he wonders what are the main differences between how you view 2013 and where the market currently is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we're focused on delivering 2012. I mean, in 2009 we gave guidance for 2013. Fundamentally, I don't see any major difference in what's happened with the business. In fact if anything, we've had to overcome some things that weren't anticipated. We've probably lost &#x2013; since we gave 2013 guidance, we've probably lost at least &#x20AC;1 billion before tax because of European price reductions, healthcare reform in the U.S. And essentially we've been able to offset that largely because our &#x20AC;2 billion cost reduction program has come in two years earlier than expected.</p>
          <p>So overall, I don't see any difference in the trend of the business. I think we've been able to deliver over the three years since we gave the guidance in a manner that was really in line with expectations.</p>
          <p>Now the one thing we're going to be cautious about is it's one thing to give guidance in 2013 when you're sitting there in 2009 because everybody looks back with error bars around it that are a little different than when you're in 2012. I mean, we're all pretty experienced in this. And so we don't want to get into the game of already here in the beginning of 2012 giving pinpoint guidance for 2013.</p>
          <p>But fundamentally, I think compared to what we set out to do in 2009, we've been delivering on that. I think the growth platforms have come in. I have to say I'm particular &#x2013; I think the Consumer Health has been even better than I would have hoped for. The Emerging Markets, I think we've really been able to seize upon, and we've directed an awful lot of our investment there. And that's created a true competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>I think we've found &#x2013; a lot of people wondered whether we could take costs out of the business with so much of our costs based in Europe. I think we've demonstrated that we've been able to do that. And I can tell you there's still plenty of cost to be taken out of the business.</p>
          <p>We've just introduced a program last September in looking fundamentally at productivity across the company, and there's plenty of opportunity. I've always said that nobody ever got promoted in the pharmaceutical industry because they're a cost killer. And so these aren't businesses that have ever been operated like the car industry, for example. So I don't think we're going to have much trouble getting the next $2 billion out of that. And that's really helping us to offset some of the loss of the leverage factor from our blockbusters.</p>
          <p>So again I think the business continues to perform at a regular pace. We're marching along towards our longer-term objectives. But we're not also ignoring any of the shorter-term and interim milestones along the way.</p>
