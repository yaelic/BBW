        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. 2009 was an excellent year for Teva, a year in which our company grew significantly, increased profits, and quarter after quarter delivered value for all our stakeholders. It was a year of record-breaking sales across all our geographies and in all our major businesses leading to record breaking financial results across the board.</p>
          <p>This was also a year of major strategic achievements for Teva including the successful integration of Barr, a process which was completed less than a year after closing and from which we expect to continue to derive significant synergies for many years to come.</p>
          <p>I believe that especially against the backdrop of the troubled world economy, volatile market conditions, and unfavorable foreign exchange effects, our results this year provides an especially strong demonstration of how Teva's agility and the strength of our balanced business model enable us to deliver continuous profitable growth even as market conditions change.</p>
          <p>I would also like to mention that in mid-January, Moody's upgraded Teva to a credit rating of A3, reflecting Teva's commitment to executing its growth strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Before I describe the year in greater detail, let me briefly review our results for the fourth quarter. In a fitting end to the year, we had record breaking results across every possible parameter in Q4. Net sales reached $3.8 billion, with gross margins of 58.6%. Our operating profit for the first time reached the $1 billion mark with net profit of $847 million and a very strong cash flow from operations of $957 million. And all of this ultimately brought us to EPS of $0.94, another record high for Teva.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting that these results were not driven by many one major launch in the U.S. during the quarter, but rather from contributions from across our company. We benefited from especially strong performance in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, as well as record global sales of ProAir, Qvar and Azilect. In future quarters the greatest contributions may come from a different mix of business, products and geographies. Whatever the mix, the important thing to keep in mind is, once again, the value we derive from our balanced business model.</p>
          <p>Let us turn now to the full year 2009, a year in which, as I said earlier, we had record breaking results across the board including sales of $13.9 billion, which reflects 25% growth year-over-year, operating profit of $3.9 billion, up 35% over 2008, net income of $3 billion, up 22% over 2008 and record EPS of $3.37, up 11% over 2008. We also had record cash flow from operations of $3.4 billion and strong free cash flow of $2.18 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me share with you some of the highlights of the year for each of our major businesses beginning with our North American business which had an exceptional year including record sales of $8.6 billion, up 34% over 2008. $4.9 billion of these sales represent U.S. generic sales, which grew 16% over 2008. During the year, we introduced 19 new generic products which collectively represent branded sales of $14 billion.</p>
          <p>These launches included one significant new generic product, Adderall XR and the rare introduction of another; Pulmicort. We were highly focused during the year on extracting the maximum value from all of our product launches as well as on creating additional opportunities for the strength of our base business. Our pipeline in the U.S. grew to 260 product applications awaiting final FDA approval, including 89 first-to-files. Collectively, the brand product covered by the entire pipeline had annual sales of over $113 billion. We expect these products to materialize over the next three to five years.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we expanded our leading market share in the U.S. among all pharmaceutical companies, both generic and brand, to 16.3% of total prescriptions and 17% of new prescriptions. Among generic companies, Teva leads with 22% of total prescriptions. That number is greater than the next two competitors combined by any measure.</p>
          <p>2009 was a very good year for our European business, where we had record sales of $3.3 billion, representing 22% growth year-over-year in local currencies and 10% growth in U.S. dollars. As you know, the effects of the financial crisis were especially apparent in Europe during this year with the market growing more slowly than expected. Despite this, Teva maintained or improved our market position in every one of our major European markets. Teva is a top three player in every major European market except Germany. We are the number one player in Italy as well as in the fiercely competitive markets of the U.K. and Netherlands where we expanded our lead during the year. And we have by far the broadest pipeline in Europe with 3,100 marketing authorization applications in 30 European countries.</p>
          <p>A key element of our integration of Barr during the year was the work to integrate PLIVA. By leveraging Teva's global and European platform and know how, we have turned PLIVA's European business into a profitable entity which will make significant contributions to our business in the years to come.</p>
          <p>2009 was an especially strong year for our international business. For the first time, sales reached over $2 billion, up 32% over 2008 in local currencies and 20% in U.S. dollars. These results were driven by especially strong sales in Latin America, Russia, and other Central and Eastern European countries and Israel.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn now to the Teva's branded business beginning with Copaxone which had a truly outstanding year. During 2009, Copaxone further solidified its position as the global leader among MS therapies. Sales of Copaxone grew 25% over 2008 to reach a record breaking $2.8 billion. Throughout the year, Copaxone continue to demonstrate its unmatched safety and efficacy. The FDA approved an extended indication for Copaxone to include the treatment of patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS. In Europe, the U.K. issued a similar approval which was adopted by 24 other European countries.</p>
          <p>Teva remains strongly committed to the MS community, and we are continuing to invest in a range of product enhancements including new dosages, formulations and devices for Copaxone. We are very pleased with the exciting results of our SONG Study which evaluated whether a new formulation would show improvement in the patient injection experience. Based on the study's positive results, we plan to submit a file with the FDA by the end of this March.</p>
          <p>In addition, last month we announced that we will be kicking off a new study called GALA which will evaluate the benefits of less frequent higher dosing of Copaxone. The study will begin this April.</p>
          <p>This was also an excellent year for Azilect which had record in-market sales in 2009 of $243 million, up 39% over 2008. The result of the ADAGIO study which was designed to test Azilect's efficacy in slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
          <p>In January we had a productive meeting with the FDA, and we filed a supplemental New Drug Application based on the ADAGIO study results by the end of the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, based on the results of our tyramine study, the FDA in December approved newly revised prescribing information for Azilect which reduced medication and food restrictions, thus removing a significant barrier for some patients and physicians.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Respiratory business, 2009 was a record breaking year in which global sales of our inhalers grew 15% over 2008 to reach $898 million. In the U.S., sales grew 30% to reach $568 million. U.S. revenues were driven by higher sales of ProAir, which maintained its market leadership in the HFA market and of Qvar, which captured the number two position in the ICS market.</p>
          <p>2009 was also a year of major strategic achievements for Teva and we took many steps during the year to ensure that we solidified even further our strong leading positions both in generics and in the pharma industry overall. Let me share with you just a few of the highlights.</p>
          <p>First and foremost, of course, was the successful completion of the Barr integration. We now expect to realize over $500 million in synergies by this acquisition by 2012.</p>
          <p>As you have already heard today, we had a very productive year when it comes to developing our innovative business, and in addition to growth through our own R&amp;D we recently announced that Teva is licensing a Phase III product from OncoGenex for multiple oncology indications.</p>
          <p>We regard biosimilars as one of our key growth drivers in the future and during 2009 we have made very good progress on our goal of becoming the leading player in this emerging field.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month the FDA accepted for filing Teva's first ever biologic license application for NEUTROVAL, a G-CSF product. This product has already been launched in several EU markets under the trade name TevaGrastim and will be launched in additional EU markets over time.</p>
          <p>Our long-acting G-CSF product Neugranin has successfully completed Phase II trials and will begin Phase III trials during the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition to adding diversity and balance through our product mix, we are expanding our geographic footprint, especially in markets with high potential for growth and profitability such as Japan, the world's second largest pharmaceutical market.</p>
          <p>In late December we announced that Teva-KOWA, our Japanese JV, was acquiring a majority interest in Taisho, an important step in realizing our strategic objective of becoming a leading player in the very important Japanese market.</p>
          <p>Finally, as you know, during the year we undertook a major review of our business and the industry based on which we updated our long-term strategy. At the heart of our strategy is value creation based on four factors: continuous growth, high profitability, financial strength and hedging risk through our diverse mix of businesses, products and geographies. I'm looking forward continuing to share with you our progress towards realizing these strategic objectives in the quarters and years to come.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to provide our current expectation for 2010. For the full year we expect net sales of around $16 billion. It is important to bear in mind that in this uncertain economic and foreign exchange environment, exchange rates may have an impact on our revenues. As for earnings per share, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.40 to $4.60.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Eyal, I would like to take a moment on behalf of the entire Teva family to wish Eli Hurvitz, the Chairman of Teva's Board of Directors, a very swift recovery. As we announced yesterday, Eli is taking three weeks leave of absence in order to focus his full attention and energy on recuperating from treatment for a recently diagnosed illness. I am happy to say that the treatment has been successful and we are all looking forward to Eli returning to work and most important to excellent health very soon.</p>
          <p>And now let's turn the call over to Eyal for a more detailed financial update. Eyal?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo, and good day to everyone. I hope you have had an opportunity to review the press release we issued earlier today.</p>
          <p>As you can see, the fourth quarter completed an excellent year for Teva and we are reporting today a record quarter and year. It is a long list of records here, so please bear with me. Q4 was a record quarter in terms of sales, gross margin and operating income, net income, and of course, earnings per share, all on a non-GAAP basis. 2009 was our best year ever as we delivered records in sales, GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and GAAP and non-GAAP net income, as well as non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>We also had record sales across all key geographies and across all our branded franchises, Copaxone, Azilect, respiratory products and women health products. Cash flow and free cash flow remained strong as well. These results were driven by a good product mix, tight expense control and successful integration of Barr. In other words, all parts of the Teva machine worked together in perfect harmony. Before we delve into the numbers I would like to touch on two issues.</p>
          <p>First, I would like to remind everyone that we are presenting GAAP and non-GAAP results. In our non-GAAP presentation we have excluded the following items this quarter: Legal settlement of $379 million with $315 million relating both to settlement agreements and reserves in connection with drug pricing litigation, including a settlement we announced a couple of weeks ago; and the majority of the balance relating to settlement agreement with Novartis regarding famciclovir; amortization of purchased intangible assets and inventory step-ups totaling $139 million of which $129 million are included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $10 million in sales and marketing; impairment of assets of $71 million and restructuring expenses of $25 million, mainly in connection with Barr-related integration and rationalization activities; purchased in process R&amp;D of $23 million in connection with our investment in OncoGenex announced in December; other net financial income of $8 million; and in addition, the related tax benefits of $161 million.</p>
          <p>You should note that the items excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2008 are not identical to those in the current quarter. Also, the items excluded from our full-year non-GAAP results are also not identical to those of the fourth quarter. Please review our press release and related tables for the complete information.</p>
          <p>As indicated in the past, we present non-GAAP figures to show how we, the management team and our board, look at our financial results.</p>
          <p>Foreign currencies continued to play a significant role in our results. In the fourth quarter, foreign exchange trends were reversed as the dollar weakened against most currencies, so in Q4 foreign currency differences contributed approximately $98 million or 3% of total sales as compared to Q4 2008.</p>
          <p>The impact on sales resulted primarily from the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain other currencies, primarily the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Hungarian forint, partially offset by strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Russian ruble and Argentinean peso. For the full year 2009, exchange rates still had an adverse effect on sales of approximately $572 million where the full-year sales were impacted mostly by strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, the Hungarian forint, the euro, the Russian ruble, the Polish zloty and the Israeli shekel. However, it is important to note that on operating income, foreign exchange had a negligible effect, close to zero in Q4 and approximately $37 million adverse effect for the full year. Teva's diverse geographical presence continues to provide us with a good natural hedge that mitigates such of the risk involved in currency fluctuation and minimizes the impact on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>Looking at consolidated results for Q4, sales totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of 33% compared to Q4 last year. The Barr acquisition contributed to growth in sales in all Teva's geographies, particularly in the U.S., Russia, Poland, Germany and Croatia. For the full year, sales reached $13.9, an increase of 25% compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating income reached a record high, topping $1 billion and up 41% compared to Q4 2008 and benefiting from strong gross margin and tight expense control. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, representing 35% growth compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP net income was strong at $847 million, up 28% compared to Q4 2008, despite the higher tax rate that resulted from the integration of the Barr business. Non-GAAP net income for the full year was over $3 billion, up 22%.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share were $0.94, up 18% compared to Q4 2008. Similar to the previous quarter we had approximately 78 million more shares this quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2008 in our earnings per share calculation due primarily to shares issued in connection with the Barr acquisition. Two housekeeping points related to EPS calculation. You will find share count details in the press release we issued today and the add-back for the non-GAAP EPS calculation is $10 million for the quarter. For the full year, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.37 per share, 11% up from 2008.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to discuss profit margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit margins, which excludes amortization of intangible assets and the inventory step-up, was 58.6% in the reported quarter, a record high compared to 57.4% in the comparable quarter of 2008. The improvement in gross profit margin is attributable to higher contribution to sales from our branded and innovative franchises, higher contribution in the quarter from new products launched in the U.S., as well as improved gross margin of our U.S. generic-based business. For the full year, non-GAAP gross profit margin was 58.4%. A side note on the U.S. base business, the improvement in the gross margin of the U.S. base business is the result of internal action to improve our cost structure and product mix, as well as leveraging market conditions that have led to supply opportunities.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP operating margin reached 27.6%, up from 26.2% in the comparable quarter last year, driven primarily from strong gross margin, lower G&amp;A and net R&amp;D as a percentage of sales, primarily offset by higher royalty payments, which are reflected in sales and marketing expenses. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin reached 27.7%, similar to the quarter.</p>
          <p>Net R&amp;D expenses reached $219 million or 5.8% of sales this quarter. However, gross R&amp;D before reimbursement from third parties for certain R&amp;D expenses, primarily Teva's joint venture with Lonza and purchased in-process R&amp;D, was $276 million, or 7.3% of sales. For the full year, net R&amp;D expenses totaled $802 million, or 5.8% of sales. R&amp;D expenses in 2009 were lower than originally expected primarily because Barr's pipeline also enabled us to keep R&amp;D expenses lower than we had originally anticipated as planned.</p>
          <p>I would like to provide some more details on total R&amp;D spending done by the Teva group. When we add up all the R&amp;D done by Teva that doesn't show up directly in our R&amp;D income statement line item such as the Lonza JV, the Teva-KOWA JV, third party participation, and innovative investments, total gross R&amp;D for the year was $923 million or 6.6% of sales. In addition, we invested approximately $35 million in equity investments in 2009, primarily through Teva's innovative ventures as part of our effort to expand our innovative pipeline.</p>
          <p>As we discussed in our strategy update in early January, we view the breadth of our generic product portfolio as a core competitive advantage, and we intend to continue investing in R&amp;D in order to be first to market in every major opportunity and leverage our broad portfolio in the United States and elsewhere. We also intend to expand our innovative and biologic R&amp;D activity either in house or through a partnership, joint venture, as in the Lonza case, or licensing agreements, as in the OncoGenex example.</p>
          <p>Sales and marketing expenses excluding amortization of intangible assets totaled $742 million in the quarter or 19.5% of sales compared to 17.2% of sales in Q4 2008. These higher sales and marketing expenses are the result of two main factors: the contribution of Barr's business which is characterized by higher sales and marketing expenses and higher royalty payments in connection with Copaxone and other products, primarily the re-launch of budesonide. For the full year sales and marketing expenses totaled $2.6 billion or 19% of sales.</p>
          <p>Total G&amp;A expenses this quarter were $218 million or 5.7% of sales compared with 6.4% of sales in Q4 last year. For the full year, G&amp;A expenses totaled $823 million or 5.9% of sales.</p>
          <p>We recorded $34 million of financial expenses on a non-GAAP basis in Q4. This is $26 million on a GAAP basis compared with $30 million of non-GAAP financial expenses in the comparable quarter in 2008. Higher levels of debt during the quarter compared to Q4 last year before the Barr acquisition were offset by lower interest rates. Financial expenses were down $18 million from the third quarter of this year as the result of a decrease in our debt over the first three quarters of 2009 and a reduction in currency hedging costs.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate for the full year of 2009 was 16% compared with the rate of 10% for 2008. The increase in tax rate from 2008 to 2009 resulted primarily from the fact that Barr's effective tax rate is higher than Teva's. The tax rate for 2009 GAAP results was 8%. Now let's have a look at our cash flow.</p>
          <p>Cash generated from operations totaled $957 million. Our free cash flow excluding net capital expenditure of $179 million and cash dividend of $141 million amounted to $637 million. This strong cash flow was driven primarily by strong collection during the quarter. For the full year, cash flow from operations reached a record of $3.3 billion, strong collection throughout the year more than offset significant Barr related integration and restructuring spending. Free cash flow for the year totaled $2.2 billion.</p>
          <p>On December 31, our cash and marketable securities was $2.5 billion, up half a billion dollars from September 30. Our total outstanding loans, bonds and convertible debentures stood at $5.6 billion, down from 5.8 billion at the end of September. From December 2008, our debt has gone down by $2.8 billion, resulting primarily from paying back the bridge financing incurred in connection with the Barr acquisition and the conversion of convertible debt of almost $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our financial leverage as of December 31, 2009, was 23%, similar to September 30 and down from 34% in December 2008 following the Barr acquisition. Our strong balance sheet and business results has led Moody's raise Teva's rating to A3, the first ever A rating for a generic pharmaceutical company.</p>
          <p>DSO, day sales outstanding, amounted to 48 days this quarter compared to 50 days in Q3 2009 and 51 days in Q4 last year. We calculate the DSOs as we always do after netting out from the receivables the sales reserve and allowances. Inventory days were 182 days, down from 195 days in Q3 and down from 206 days in Q4 2008. Net capital expenditures reached $179 million this quarter, similar to the CapEx levels in Q4 2008 and $195 million in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Dividends. Yesterday, Teva's Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend from 0.6 shekels per share to 0.7 shekels per share. As you know our dividend is paid in shekels. This is a 17% increase in our cash dividend and completed more than 50% increase in dividend payment over the past two years. Based on the rate of exchange on February 15 of the shekel to the U.S. dollar, this translated into approximately $0.19 per share or a quarterly dividend amounting to approximately $165 million.</p>
          <p>Before opening the call to questions, let me repeat our guidance for 2010 and provide a few more data points regarding 2010. We expect sales of approximately $16 billion. As Shlomo indicated, this number is sensitive to foreign exchange volatility and could be impacted by future exchange rates. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $4.40 and $4.60 for the year with significant variance between the first quarter and the rest of the year, resulting from the timing of our key business drivers during the year: new launches of Paragraph IV products in the U.S. market, the elimination of Copaxone royalty payments to Sanofi-Aventis, as well as our regular seasonality. Now let me provide some specific guidance as to expenses and margin.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to average between 59 to 60% with lower rates in Q1. This number does not include amortization of approximately $470 million for the year. Net R&amp;D expenses without joint venture and other investments will be between six and 6.5% of net sales. Sales and marketing expenses will be in the range of 16 to 18% for the year. This number does not include amortization of approximately $40 million.</p>
          <p>In Q1, sales and marketing will be considerably higher as a percentage of sales since the take back of royalties from Sanofi-Aventis does not begin before April 1. G&amp;A as a percentage of sales for the year is expected to be between 5 and 5.5%. Finance expenses are expected to be between 150 to $170 million. Tax rate on our non-GAAP numbers is expected to be between 13 and 15%.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we expect to record share in losses of associate companies of approximately $40 million, primarily in our JV with Lonza. We believe that the fully diluted number of shares in 2010 should be approximately 925 million shares and the add-back for earnings per share calculation will be $45 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your time and attention today and now we will be glad to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for the questions. Just one for Eyal and one for Bill. Eyal, can you give us a sense of how much cost savings you realized from Barr last year? And then how do we think about that for 2010 on your path to 500 million in savings?</p>
          <p>And then secondly for Bill, can you just give us a sense of what's going on in Women's Health? How do we think about One Step and the trajectory of that segment from here? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Randall. Thanks for the question. First on 2009, we estimate the savings synergies measurement is not nuclear science, so we estimate the savings to be anywhere between 350 to $400 million, and it will get to 500 million as Shlomo says. It's factored into our numbers for 2010, so it's already in there.</p>

          <p>Hey. Good morning, Randall. Thanks for the question. With respect to Women's Health, I think your biggest question is about Plan B One-Step and that, we would have to say, was not the smoothest hand-off that we would like. It wasn't as smooth as we would like. But what's important is we're committed to the franchise, and our expectations are still very good for growth moving forward. We're going to be putting a lot of emphasis behind Plan B One Step and that will be very, very helpful. But our thoughts about Women's Health is it continues to be a really good growth area for us, and we're going to emphasize it a lot, especially in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there other products in that segment that we can think about adding growth in 2010? And then I guess from this quarter, does it grow sequentially? Should we expect a ramp in One Step? How do we think about the level of growth going forward quarterly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the level of growth on Plan B One Step is really more back end loaded for sure when you think about the efforts, the DTC and some of the other efforts that we've put on that. That's for sure. The other &#x2013; we're also excited when you look at all the promoted brands, they are all performing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Could Gerard maybe give us a flavor for what's happening in Europe? What's been changing? What the prospects are for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, with pleasure, Marc. I think, as Shlomo said, Europe has been a bit of a tough year in Europe in some places. We have been hit by many aspects of the crisis. We have seen sales picking up in the Southern European part in particular. We see some stabilization in the Central European places. We have done very well through the year despite all of the difficulties in the economy in markets like in the Northern part of Europe, the U.K., Netherlands, and what have you.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all I think it seems as if the market is recovering from what was a very difficult year in '09 in which we did very well, as Shlomo explained. We did very well in every market relative to our competitors. And we expect also to be able to thrive on that in this year to come. In particular markets like Spain and France are doing very well. We've launched a lot of products in the last 12 months which will bear a lot of fruit in the coming 12 months. We have launched more than 200 products spread out &#x2013; varying from let's say almost 10 in Poland up to 30, 40 in markets like France. So we have a very good ability to grow our business on the back of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So will those markets &#x2013; will France be a growth market or the whole market in general, or is it just you're growing because of all the new launches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at France, France has been going through a bad year in '09 in terms of growth in the low single digits. We see Q4 picking up again and going up to the low single digits, so that's a good sign, for instance.</p>
          <p>So the market itself will grow. And within that, we are doing better than the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just give us the same sense for the U.K. as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the U.K. is low single-digit growth, and we are growing a bit faster than the market.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Richard Silver with Barclays Capital. Please state your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just on the pharmaceutical sales by geography, excluding API, can you provide those numbers as you have in previous quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have combined this quarter all our sales together, but you could assume that the breakout of the API is similar to what we have provided in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you want to plug it in your model, that's the information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the gross margin, Eyal, you said that 59 to 60 is the range for 2010, lower in the first quarter. Would that be lower than 59, or the low end of 59 to 60?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be lower than 59. 59 to 60 is the average for the year. And as I said, particularly in the first quarter, given the fact that there is no major Para IV launch and the seasonality impact that we always see in a neutral Q, our first quarter &#x2013; the gross margin, end of first quarter is expected to be lower than the yearly average. And the later quarters, especially Q3 with the expected venlafaxine launch, will see higher gross margin.</p>
          <p>So it's not going to be even throughout the year. The range that I've provided is an average for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one more on the gross margin. You mentioned some reasons for an improvement in the U.S. base business margin, and you mentioned benefiting from supply disruptions. Is that something that we've seen the full benefit from in the fourth quarter? Or would you expect some additional benefit to be seen?</p>
          <p>And then the second is in that 2010 plan, would you assume that that benefit is something that lasts throughout the year, or would you expect, as I assume the supply disruptions on the competitor side to change, that perhaps the benefit diminishes later in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, good morning, Rich.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bill</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The supply disruptions have &#x2013; there's a lot of lumpiness in them. They haven't come in a smooth linear fashion. So what we have noted is that people are giving awards to us that are occurring over time. So we've got some benefit in Q4. We're going to get a little benefit in Q1. You're going to see a lot more benefit in Q2, Q3, Q4. It really builds towards the end of the year. People are using up some of their other supplies and have just decided that they're going to make a change, and we think it's for the best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's something that you already know is going to be in the cards for the second, third, fourth quarter of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, these are commitments that have already been made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the other reason for that base business improvement, you mentioned some other I guess efficiencies. Can you elaborate on what else that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There have been &#x2013; a number of really good initiatives, and Teva is always working on its API process to drive down its costs of manufacturing to get in the right place with the lowest potential cost for us. And so we've done a lot of that work.</p>
          <p>We've done a little bit of pruning of the portfolio. You might have noticed a little bit of share change this quarter. That is because there were a couple of products that we just took out of the portfolio because the margins were unacceptable, and we've turned that volume, used that &#x2013; or that capacity, manufacturing capacity, for other more profitable products.</p>
          <p>So I think movement around the portfolio has been very helpful.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen &amp; Company. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple questions. First on Lovenox, Bill, can you give us a sense of any movement with the agency? So an update there.</p>
          <p>Also, although I'm sure you're not going to comment on anything surrounding Ratiopharm for yourselves, can you give us a sense of why a Pfizer, and taking that more broadly speaking, large pharma, what you see as their actions in getting into the space in a broader way? It looks like a Ratiopharm is not really a platform. It's more of an add-on for a company like yourself. So what they may be thinking.</p>
          <p>And then finally Eyal, some of the settlement costs this quarter were for Famvir. I was wondering if you're planning on setting up a reserve for settlement losses? You seem to be getting the benefit when you launch these products, but keeping it off the P&amp;L when you settle on them. Although it was not a major cost to you, how are you going to deal with that in the future so that we can fully incorporate potential losses of these at-risk launches? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, do you want to take the first one and also the last one? Shlomo will take the one on the Ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, Ken. The issue on Lovenox is obviously &#x2013; who knows when. We've seen some really nice flow of information coming from back and forth from the FDA. We feel that this is a sign of more likely approval coming, but I can't ever tell exactly when. You never know what will happen.</p>
          <p>So I am more optimistic than I was a year ago, because the data flow back and forth is very, very good. But I can't really be more specific than that. All I can say is that when that approval comes, we'll be ready.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the one on the settlement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If you want me to roll right into the Famvir settlement, I think it's more important for Eyal to really discuss whether we want to set up a reserve.</p>
          <p>But honestly, Ken, our issue is whenever we can take a liability like this off the books, this the right thing to do. We have done this very effectively. This was an excellent settlement that we're really excited about.</p>
          <p>We will still stay in the market, and we think that makes a lot of sense. This is the right kind of &#x2013; this is the right kind of settlement for both ourselves, for the brand company, as well as the consumer in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing on the accounting treatment, we can't reserve if we don't have a high level of certainty on any kind of expense. Even if we want to do that, the auditors will not allow it.</p>
          <p>So all our reserves are done &#x2013; when we reach a level of certainty, we look at the pricing settlement, we didn't settle all our pricing litigation, but once a major litigation was settled, we could take provision for the rest of what we believe is open. Same approach on patent settlement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, as for the Ratio auction or bid, let me say the following. First of all, as you may expect, I cannot say anything regarding any potential acquisition, and I would prefer not to say anything regarding this one as well.</p>
          <p>I can say only two things, which I believe will help you a little bit to better understand the business environment, or if you wish, the background. One, Europe is one of our key strategy targets for the next five years. If you remember the presentation that Gerard gave there, he very thoroughly went on the key European markets and definitely a part of them are very attractive for our future growth.</p>
          <p>And as for the big pharma stepping into this generic potential arena, first of all, this is not new news. I would like to pay your attention, there is a today article in The New York Times, if I will remember, dealing with this phenomenon as part of their probably &#x2013; let's call it remedies for their own other issues or subject. But I don't want to speculate more on that kind of thing.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein Asset Management. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, when I look at your numbers for 2010, you can draw a pretty broad range of outcomes in EPS &#x2013; depends on longevity of products like Prevacid, oxali [oxaliplatin], Lotrel and Adderall XR. It feels like you've been a little bit conservative here in where you decided to draw the outcome for the year.</p>
          <p>Can you give us a little bit more color about what assumptions you made about the longevity of those products? I know you can't &#x2013; you won't discuss specific around products, but overall, what was your philosophy in thinking about those products for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, Ronny, we've got to think about products like Adderall, and Adderall is a product that there has been a lot of supply interruption or a lot of, again, lumpiness around the API supply. So although today we have a pretty good share on that product, I don't know &#x2013; we target more of about a 50 share, but right now we're holding about a 60 share. That's going to change.</p>
          <p>Amlo ben [amlodipine benazapril], we just got some competition coming in on amlo ben. We see lanso [lansoprazole], although we took a lot of early share on lanso &#x2013; and that's because we usually react and move very, very quickly &#x2013; we think our share is going to come down on that.</p>
          <p>So I think we've got a pretty good handle on where this goes. And I think our track record stands as being very appropriate at predicting this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you don't think you have necessarily been conservative on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second, I think in the press conference in Israel this morning, you mentioned a target of about 800 to 900 million for biosimilar revenue by 2015. One, if you can confirm that? And second, what will that entail in terms of building sales and marketing infrastructure, primarily in Europe, where a lot of those products have at least half of their sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ronny, if your first question was regarding the biosimilars by 2015, I can confirm it. This is what we anticipate now. Let's call it the first wave in the timeframe of our next five years strategy plans, and we said it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said it in New York, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said &#x2013; yeah, but that's why we can confirm it now. So I have no problem to tell &#x2013; to say it again for you, Ronny. And what was the second part of your question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Eventually what will that entail in terms of investment in sales and marketing sales forces, primarily in Europe, where a lot of the early entrants will take place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you like to refer to that, Gerard, from your perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will. First of all, we see different models in different European markets currently, involving &#x2013; if you look at the TevaGrastim rollouts across Europe.</p>
          <p>You may remember, Ronny, that we spoke about the launch in Europe on TevaGrastim as a small product that is not going to move the dial, but it's allowing us to understand much better what are the dynamics in the marketplace looking like, if you look at the selling process of a product in the bio-g [biogeneric] area.</p>
          <p>We see markets where it's a very concentrated hospital-driven business, where we have limited resources to invest. In other places, you really have to go to out clinics and to generate prescription. And we see all the variations in between.</p>
          <p>So I think currently it's very difficult to predict precisely how that is going to be developing, and we have an existing sales force across Europe that's dealing with that. It's the right size, and depending on the timing of the launches that will come through, we will adjust that based upon the learnings that we're going through now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gregg, the SONG Study, we're very excited about those results, and that will be going in the first quarter. And as far as the review time on that, we're hopeful that that would be an expedited review, but it's more likely within a year. And I think over time, one would expect that the low volume would replace the 1-mL because it's going to be a real &#x2013; it's really important for the patient. The pain and the injection experience is better. Any time you can inject less, it's good thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you care to summarize any of the findings of the study? Or do we have to wait for a publication there?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to add one thing. I think we're going to publish the results, so can't get into the details, but I think the fact that we have positive outcome, if we look at the 0.5 versus the 1-mL, I think we all realize it's important, definitely for an injectable product, and specifically for Copaxone as a daily injectable product. So I think for the patient it would be a great deal.</p>

          <p>Gregg, this is Bill Marth. No, right now, 2010 is the existing products. We are holding over a 50 share on ProAir. We are running between 52 and 53. And I would just remind people that we've always guided that 50 share for us would be a really good thing, and we have held that, and that's been very good.</p>
          <p>Where we're most excited though is Qvar. We have had really good results with Qvar in the ICS space, and that's growing. But no new opportunities in 2010.</p>

          <p>Let me give you &#x2013; and I apologize for not being prompt or specific here &#x2013; in a kind &#x2013; more of a general answer. First of all, yes, acquisition is part of our growth path, and we said it in the investors meeting that we held last month when we presented the five-year strategy plan.</p>
          <p>Basically, what we are looking are acquisitions that are fitting to our strategy plan, in either market share in the generic arena or more specific molecules or technologies that help us to grow and sustain our interesting branded franchise. As for example, the licensing of the Phase III OncoGenex product that I just mentioned in my part in the presentation. And if you go back and read our strategy, you can easily find where we are going to concentrate our targeting efforts for acquisition for the next year.</p>
          <p>Then to complete the answer, I would like to remind you of the three criteria that we using in acquisition. One I already said, which is it should fit our strategy. And the second one, of course, the economics. And last but not least, it should be accretive in the first year after the acquisition.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, gentlemen. Two quick questions please. One on Copaxone outside of the U.S. and Europe. You had some delayed tender effects in Q4. Is it a catch-up from the strong Q3? Or should we see you a catch-up more in Q1 of next year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you provide us with your biosimilar sales in 2009 and a little bit of color on the breakdown behind that? And also could you tell us what could be the design of the Phase III trial for Neugranin please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Moshe. I think as far as Copaxone, outside of the U.S., we see a very good and solid growth. In some markets, the question of timing of the tender really affects the sales in this quarter. But overall, I think in Europe we see strong double-digit growth, about 13% in 2010 and '09, and we see really an increase in our share &#x2013; market share in most of the markets in Europe.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I think, apart from the timing, all in all we are in a positive trend in Europe and in the international market. Those markets actually are not affected by tenders. We see a growth both in the Lat Am and in other markets as well.</p>

          <p>Sure, the intranasal formulation of Qvar beclomethasone, when do you think you may be in a position to file on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are planning to file it in 2011. We are applying for the Qvar nasal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, on the ADAGIO results for Azilect, can you give us a sense of what patient sub-groups where you expect to see greater usage with the inclusion of that data in the label? And are you going to be asking for an expedited review as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; actually the ADAGIO study was one based on early patient, and that's what we see the major benefits, in both areas. Definitely on early diagnosed patients, but we think that physicians will now start much earlier the treatment, and in this segment, we believe that we can increase significantly the share of Azilect, and we see more and more physicians that are starting with Azilect versus the other way therapy or the traditional levodopa.</p>
          <p>We believe that we see good effects based on the data that we have from our add-on study on Azilect in more advanced patients, and we believe that based on the results and based on the &#x2013; I would say halo effect on the ADAGIO, we see more and more patients are getting Azilect as an adjunct therapy or as a first adjunctive therapy to levodopa.</p>
          <p>And since &#x2013; as far as the second question, since we have already discussed the Azilect data and as Shlomo mentioned, we met with the FDA, so we believe that the FDA will have all the information needed in order to look at the data and to come back with their response or their reaction to our filing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, first question for Eyal. On sales and marketing trends, expense trends in the quarter, I know you talked about this a little bit in your prepared commentary, but if you just look at 4Q, saw an uptick to around 19.5%, the highest run rate for the year.</p>
          <p>I'm just curious what may be underlying that sequential increase and anything you could provide that might help us think about what could be some of the swing factors in terms of thinking about your 2010 guidance, which I think implies roughly a 200 basis point swing between the high and low end of guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I said that in my part, but there were two major factors compared to last year: the growth in Copaxone, which is driving royalties to Sanofi-Aventis. Most of them are going to be eliminated in Q2 2010, which is a major factor as to how to look at it going forward.</p>
          <p>And the other one is the re-launch of budesonide, which according to our agreement, drives royalties. And we had a nice launch in Q4. And the level of royalties are reflected in our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>As I said, in 2010, in my guidance, we believe that the average for the year will be between 16 to 18%. The majority of that results from the fact that we will no longer pay 25% of our sales in the U.S. as royalty to Sanofi, starting with the second quarter. So you can make a calculation. It's a pretty big number.</p>
          <p>And on some of our other products, there will be less royalties. It's mostly about the royalty component. The run rate of our regular sales and marketing expenses &#x2013; the sales and marketing activities &#x2013; is going to be more or less in line with sales of maybe a little less than sales growth, because we've got to become more effective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then if I can ask an additional question about 2011, as well. I know someone attempted this at your strategy review, and you guys didn't really provide any color on EPS guidance for 2011.</p>
          <p>But I guess thinking with the big run-up in 2010, given the Copaxone royalty elimination, I guess there's increasing concern that you're facing a relatively flattish year in 2011. And I'm wondering, at this point, if you can just provide some color commentary as to whether or not that's actually going to be a growth year for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Bill will be happy to answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Elliot, thanks for the question. I think that, really, when you look at it, the answer is pretty simple. We are going to grow in 2011 over 2010.</p>
          <p>What people seem to miss is that in IMS alone, you've got about 64, $65 billion worth of innovator value coming off patent between that period of '10, '11, '12. And our own data shows that we have targets &#x2013; around 100 targets worth about 70ish billion within that same range. So there is plenty of opportunity.</p>
          <p>And the names you know. There's atorvastatin, fenofibrate, YAZ. Some people forget about olanzapine that will come in within that same period. Escitalopram. There's just a litany of products that are available.</p>
          <p>And the one piece I would add to that, too, is remember what Shlomo said in the beginning. We are growing on our balanced business model, both geographically and by business segment. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could sneak in one more question here, since we have Moshe on the line. You guys kind of underplayed the branded pipeline a bit at the strategy review day. I'm just wondering if there were a couple of particular events you might want to point to highlight &#x2013; to look for over the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the activities that we presented on the different segments, starting with MS and definitely we see the potential with laquinimod, and believe this is a product that we can actually bring good value to patients based on &#x2013; as we see the competitive landscape, and based on the, I would say, efficacy and the safety ratio &#x2013; good ratio for that. We are now going full steam ahead with our additional neurology product based with fytoclone and with ALS program so everything is going actually according to plan, and I think that we don't have any additional news at this point of time.</p>
          <p>Shlomo mentioned the licensing of OncoGenex, that's what we are planning to continue to do that and to bring more products and to develop other products all the way to the market, and I think that the activities in bio-g is going as planned, apart from &#x2013; we mentioned NEUTROVAL and Neugranin which is interesting and big potential for us and we are making progress in all our monoclonal antibodies product that we are developing. So all in all, I think we are in good shape to realize the numbers that we presented in our strategic day &#x2013; strategy day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add by saying, this is Shlomo here, that I can assure you that 2011 will be another year of growth for Teva as we first of all committed ourself to growth in the last time that we mentioned our five-year strategy. So 2011 is not an exception there. And in more specific terms, beside what Bill already mentioned, which is that you can see already based on the pipeline and pipeline projections or anticipation, we are working always on additional business initiatives and some other business ideas that in the size, diversity and our business expansion, geographical expansion, you may expect that from now to 2011, you are going to see more ideas other than what you can see just from looking into our future pipeline.</p>

          <p>Hi. This is Jim Dawson for David Buck. Where do you stand on generic Prevacid ODT and generic Temodar as far as approval timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, a couple things. On the &#x2013; with respect to the Temodar, we expect that approval any time, but there is continued core proceedings going on on Temodar right now that they've appealed to &#x2013; we expect the appeal to the Federal Circuit, and so that's going to delay us a little bit there. Lanso ODT is also in the queue, we think, for approval relatively soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And what about organic growth in Europe ex-acquisitions or ex-Barr? And what is your forecast for the whole year for 2010? And also, just pricing outlook currently and in 2010 for Europe and Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, would you like to take the European part?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will. As you know, David, we do not give very specific information on that level. But I can give you a few perspectives on it anyway. I think if you look at what we've done in the markets where we were not acquisitive, you have seen that we have shown some good performance through last year. And we don't expect that to change in the coming year.</p>
          <p>There's one market I mentioned, I think, in the previous quarter which has been a bit difficult this year, which was the Italian market, but that was across the board. But despite that, we managed to keep our number one position there. We grew our business in Hungary to a number one position organically. We grew our business in Germany to a number four position from number five organically. We grew our business in the U.K. organically. We grew our business in the Netherlands organically. We grew our business in France organically, and in Spain.</p>
          <p>So I think if I sum it up, these were markets where we were not acquisitive last year, or if you take Germany, we were acquisitive, on top of that acquisition we generated some good underlying growth. So the launch, as I mentioned before, and our ability to wire our business well into the needs of our major customers and our specific customer needs in countries, have been bringing out the ability to grow faster than the markets on top of what we have done in terms of acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how about just on pricing? Can you just talk about that in Europe and Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Asia, I cannot comment. I can comment on Europe that the pricing compared to I think the second half versus the first half is, again, that is widespread across Europe what's happening. We've seen a reasonable stable price setting in the central European markets. We've seen in segments of the German business, meaning the bit of the German business that was tender driven, we have seen price competition like we have seen in the U.K. and in Netherlands. In France and Italy, we've seen some strong push on prices, but not as bad as expected in the second half at least. In the first half it was more fierce.</p>
          <p>So it is moving, and it goes up and down. So while we've also been able in some places to get some pricing slightly improved or to stabilize that. The nice bit about price push is that in many markets, we also saw some good volume growth compensating for that. So I think all in all, it's a good blend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add on the Asian part of your question. As you well know, we have, for the time being at least, relatively very minor business in Asia. We have a few very limited volume of sales in China and Japan, which as I mentioned in my presentation, we are growing the business there faster by, I believe, with the acquisition of Taisho. That will definitely boost our business and our sales in Japan starting 2010.</p>
          <p>In other parts, it's still on the back burner for the time being, as I said. But this is one of the long-term projects for Teva once we will solidify our business in this part of the world. By the way, interestingly to add that talking about pricing or price pressure in part of the world that we all come used to, in the end of 2009, we see an increase in one part of the world, which is Latin America and certain countries, price increase, whether it's going to be &#x2013; disturb other regions in the world, of course this is still to be seen. But it is interesting to mention it talking about the pricing issue.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks. I wanted to get some more detail on the GALA trial. How is that going to be different than the SONG Study that you recently completed? And &#x2013; okay, I'll just stop right there.</p>

The GALA study is looking at Copaxone on the higher dose of Copaxone with less frequent dosing, and it will be looking at the result of these new dose regimens for Copaxone, while as you know, the SONG is about the &#x2013; covering dose regimen going from 1 mL to 0.5 mL. We are very pleased with the fact that we have completed all our preparation, and we are going to embark on the study shortly, and we believe that we can execute it in a fast manner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thanks. And, Eyal, just had one question for you. You mentioned 6 to 6.5% of R&amp;D spending on total sales going for 2010. How much of that is &#x2013; do you expect to be going to the biologic side? It looks like you will try to ramp up this whole Lonza JV, and I just wanted to get your thoughts on how much that's going to cost for you in the next couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the biologic is not in that number because it's done basically in the joint venture with Lonza, which we call TL Biopharmaceutical, and it's not in there. That's why I differentiated in my talking points between the net R&amp;D, which uses the number 6 to 6.5, and the gross R&amp;D which you can add about $100 million to that. So the total number, R&amp;D which is done outside of our &#x2013; of the Teva reported P&amp;L in the joint venture. All in all, for biologics, it's under $100 million for next year.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from John Boris with Citigroup. Please state your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on Apotex. I think if you look at their product line from the two facilities in Canada, they line up pretty well with yours. What are your assumptions about Apotex' supply? Any kind of price firming? And how long do you expect them to be out of the market?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; it's really tough for us to comment on a competitor like that. I mean, I don't know what they're dealing with with the agency. We hope that they'll get through this fine and they'll get back into their position. I think where most people are concerned is that if Apotex comes back online, does everybody go and do a student body right and switch their product back to Apotex from Teva or Mylan or whomever? And that's really not the case. Our customers have been very, very loyal. They understand that we came to them when they were in need and filled a gap, and so that's &#x2013; we think that &#x2013; we feel very positive that, that's not going to happen. My guess is that when Apotex comes back in, it will be a slow start for them.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a follow-up on Prevacid. Obviously the agency hasn't approved additional generics, what might be holding up the agency? And what's your assumption around Prevacid? And how long might you have limited competition on that asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the lanso ODT, we think we're, again, in the final preparation for that approval. It should come in the relatively near term. And then we do have a period of exclusivity for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about on the conventional formulation though? Obviously there's others that haven't been approved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lanso &#x2013; if you go back to our earlier comments on this a year ago, it's not an easy process. And we know what we went through getting our approval, and right now there are three competitors out there. And the market is dividing up very well. We've got about a little bit more than 50% of the market today, we expect to hold maybe a bit under that 50%, but again, it's not an easy process. I don't see a lot of people jump &#x2013; a lot of people getting into the market immediately. However, I don't know where all the files sit at the agency. I can't really tell.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one last follow-up question for Eyal. Thanks for the color on 2010, but can you just provide some commentary on what your foreign exchange assumption is for 2010? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't really have too many assumptions. Our base model assumes that exchange rates will be in the vicinity of where they are today. Of course we know that this is not going to be the case, but as I have said earlier and we have been discussing this for a long time, the impact on sales could jump right up or down. The impact on profit is minimal because of the balance between the different geographies and the different currencies.</p>
