        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay, starting on slide number four, I'd like to make a few comments about our performance in the third quarter and then I'll talk about our performance against our strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>So on slide five, you can see that we had a very strong third quarter. Net sales were up 16% in constant currencies. This is driven by very strong performance across all divisions.</p>
          <p>Our core operating income was up 25%, which is very good leverage with that sales growth and it shows good cost control. This drove our net income up 10% and EPS up 6% despite incurring almost $800 million in one-time charges. So we also had some significant good pipeline news in the third quarter, most notably the approval of Gilenya in the U.S. for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>So on slide six, you can see that every one of our businesses grew ahead of the market in the third quarter and this was led by Sandoz and Vaccines and Diagnostics, which grew both over 20%.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, Jon is going to go into more detail about the numbers, but I just wanted to describe the progress that we've made on our three strategic priorities. And that is extending our lead in innovation, which is helping us to continue to build the best pipeline in the industry; accelerating growth, which is turning that pipeline innovation into sales and profit growth that hits the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And then third, driving productivity to increase margins to ensure that we are able to continue that investment in the cycle of growth.</p>
          <p>So starting on slide eight, we're extending over lead in innovation, you can see that we have made great progress, beyond Gilenya, we had a positive CHMP opinion in Europe on Tasigna as a first-line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia.</p>
          <p>We also reported some compelling data on Onbrez versus salmeterol in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is driving Onbrez off to a very good start, and you will hear more about that a little bit later.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, all of the divisions made good progress on innovation. So for example, in Sandoz, we launched enoxaparin, which is a complex differentiated injectable. And enoxaparin had sales of close to the $300 million in the third quarter. So this is an excellent example of how a successful first-to-market launch can really drive the business.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, in vaccines and diagnostics, we published a Phase III study that showed that our MenB vaccine generated strong immune response and the results also demonstrated an acceptable probability profile when administered with other routine infant vaccines. And this, we believe, supports the use of MenB during the first year of life when the medical need is the greatest. This could be the first vaccine to provide a broad coverage against this deadly disease.</p>
          <p>So on slide 11, you can see that the highlighted area show the progress that we've made against the pipeline in Q3 across-the-board.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, this is really our second priority, which is to translate that innovation into sales and profit growth. And you can see here on the right-hand side that newly launched products accounted for 20% of our total sales, which is up from 15% a year ago, so it really demonstrates our ability to transform this portfolio ahead of the Diovan patent expiration in Europe in 2011 and the U.S in 2012.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, you can see that Sandoz achieved great growth, over 20% in the quarter behind the launch of enoxaparin, good growth in biosimilars, strong growth in oncology injectables. And in the fourth quarter, we expect sales to slow due to the Losartan pricing decrease that we are going to see in the U.S. and some other issues that we will go into a little bit later.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 14, Vaccines and Diagnostics grew over 20% versus a year ago, and this was driven by a very strong start to the flu season with 35 million doses shipped to U.S. customers in the third quarter. Also, I have to say that the Menveo launch is off to a very good start and we've begun shipments to 15 countries beyond the U.S.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, Consumer Health grew 9% in the quarter. So it was also a very strong quarter. CIBA Vision share of contact lenses continues to grow. So we are the fastest growing lens business in the world. In the U.S. share was up three points to 27% of the total market, and this is behind our AirOptix brand.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, our OTC business achieved a great milestone in Germany in the third quarter. Our pain medication Voltaren became the leading self-medication brand in Germany, passing aspirin. So Voltaren has about a 44 share of the topical analgesic market.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, it shows we've completed our 77% ownership of Alcon. We have established a project office to ensure that we are capturing growth and cost synergies. Of course at arm's-length, because Alcon is still a public company. But I have to say that the interaction between management teams is positive, and both companies see opportunities to improve their results.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we saw double-digit growth in emerging markets. Sandoz saw particularly good results in emerging markets and achieved strong double-digit growth in the emerging markets of Central and Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific and Turkey and Africa.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, I want to stress that we are continuing to drive commercial innovation by operating with hospitals in new and different ways that will position Novartis as a customer of choice. So an example of this is what we are doing in Germany with a large hospital group. We've worked with them to develop an e-file for ophthalmology patients, which will improve efficiency and quality of care for patients. So it's a new approach, but it's paying off.</p>
          <p>And then finally, on slide 20, our third priority, which is to drive productivity to improve margins, is also paying off. So we are making good progress. One area of focus continues to be marketing and sales expense; and you can see that we have reduced this 200 basis points versus last year, down to 25.2%, primarily through geographic reallocation of spend.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 shows how we're translating this into margin improvement. So in the third quarter, Sandoz improved their core operating income margin by 180 basis points, and Pharma improved it by about 110 basis points.</p>
          <p>On slide 22 you can see how much progress we're making in procurement. When I went to the Pharma division about three years ago, we had pushed only about 4 to 5% of our spend through e-sourcing, some kind of e-sourcing, and you can see that we're now up to close to 40% this year, which is driving significant savings. We still have a long way to go, but this is definitely helping us.</p>
          <p>And on slide 23, one area that will not be a source of margin improvement is R&amp;D spending. And I've said before that healthcare is fundamentally about innovation, and as long as our R&amp;D machine continues to generate a strong pipeline, we will continue to invest. And so this chart proudly shows that we spend 440 basis points more than the industry average in Pharma research and development.</p>
          <p>Now the key is not just spending, obviously, you have to have the best scientists and physicians in the world, and we think that we have them at Novartis.</p>
          <p>So with that I'm going to now turn it over to Jon Symonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe and good morning or good afternoon everyone. So let's go straight to the numbers on slide 25. Now the reported numbers include Alcon. In some senses I hesitate to say including Alcon, because Alcon is now part of the business and <mark type="inaudible" />. In addition, given that we won't start lapping the Alcon numbers properly until quarter four next year, it's going to be a strong feature of our results for the next four quarters.</p>
          <p>So in summary, sales grew by 16% in constant currency. The strength of the dollar reducing sales by 3% to 13% reported growth. Core operating income grew by 29% in constant currency, with currency depressing the reported result by 4%.</p>
          <p>Reported operating income grew by 3% in constant currency, thus 26 percentage points below the growth in core operating income. There are two principal reasons for this, which I will explain in more detail in a moment, but they are the impairment charges we announced earlier in the month and Alcon where the core-operating income was largely offset by acquisition-related provisions. The bottom half of the P&amp;L has also been affected by Alcon, particularly on the associated company line, but also in EPS, which is where the 23% minority interest in net income is deducted. So on this basis, core earnings per share grew 19% in constant currency to $1.36, and EPS by 12% to $0.99. Meanwhile, cash continues to flow in, 2.9 billion for the quarter and 8.2 billion for the nine months.</p>
          <p>I'll go through the impact of Alcon on slide 26 and 27, and I'll do this in some detail so that you fully understand how to model for it. In future, I'll just treat Alcon as another segment of the business and won't go into this level of detail.</p>
          <p>The effect of incorporating Alcon in the quarter has to be separated into pre and post acquisition periods. Firstly, pre-acquisition the, period where Alcon was an associated company. There are two effects here. Firstly, we were required to revalue our original 25% stake to its fair value. This resulted in a gain of 204 million.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the change of majority owner triggered some charges in Alcon's books immediately prior to closing. And we picked up our 25% share of these items. These were highlighted in the Alcon press release this morning. Although we did not take up our full share of these, of their 133 million charge as part it related to an adjustment that was made for U.S. GAAP only.</p>
          <p>The second period relates to the post acquisition period from the 25th of August. And I'll try to lay out here again a link to the numbers Alcon reported. Obviously you won't see them exactly. This is only one month of their third quarter, but you can see that there is a clear link to their reported results. They have $26 million of adjustments to get from their reported to core. And there are 191 million of consolidation adjustments that we have taken to reflect our acquisition costs.</p>
          <p>So we have 222 million of core operating income from Alcon and 5 million of operating income.</p>
          <p>On slide 27, you can see the adjustments we made more clearly, and how they compare to the estimates we gave you on the 26th of August. I had commented that the employee stock vesting triggered before closing and was therefore was recorded in Alcon prior to completion. In other words, we only took up our 25% share.</p>
          <p>The inventory step-up is in line with the full month estimate and we've not incurred any costs, direct costs relating to the realization of the synergies. I do need to give you a general health warning here, the purchase price allocation process is a big exercise that won't be completed until the end of the year. And there could therefore be significant changes to these estimates. The preliminary purchase price allocation is given on page 37 of the release.</p>
          <p>So let's get you to the underlining business on slide 28 and the picture is pretty robust.</p>
          <p>Sales in the quarter grew 10% in constant currency and core-operating income grew by 22%. As Joe has already said, great operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 shows the buildup of sales. The important point to note here is that the volume growth continues to be very strong at 11% with a relatively small impact of pricing. In pharma, pricing is down overall by 1% with the impact of price acquisitions in Europe 6% for the quarter, 4% for the year-to-date and the biannual price reductions in Japan being offset by mix and benefits in other markets.</p>
          <p>We're clearly benefiting from the balanced geographic portfolio and product portfolio we have, although price reforms in the U.S. will not be fully felt until next year. You can also see during the quarter currency turned negative as we predicted last time and I will return to currency again at the end.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 summarizes the top line performance by division. What is striking is how strongly all divisions have contributed to the result. Vaccines and Diagnostics grew 21% on a strong start to the flu season. We were able to ship our product of the market much earlier than last year and in larger quantities.</p>
          <p>Consumer health grew strongly with all the components, CIBA Vision, Animal Health and OTC performing well.</p>
          <p>Sandoz had an outstanding quarter with the launch of Enoxaparin where sales were just short of 300 million. We're still the only generic on the market but of course we can't assume that this will last forever. But it will be wrong to put this quarter down just to Enox. Jeff and the team have delivered a strong performance across the board. Emerging market growth was strong. And Western Europe recovered with a good double-digit performance.</p>
          <p>Finally, pharma delivered growth of 6%, which David will cover in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Our sales continued to be driven by recently launched products as you can see on slide 30. In the third quarter recently launched products contributed 2.3 billion, 20% of sales and a growth rate of over 40%. Pharma delivered 1.7 billion with the other divisions contributing over 600 million.</p>
          <p>For the nine months, sales of recently launched products totaled 6.5 billion or 7.9 billion if you include the sales of H1N1.</p>
          <p>Slide 32 gives a geographic perspective for quarter three and for the nine months. You can see that the emerging markets growth continues to outpace growth in established markets. While there is no doubt that we can do better in the emerging markets, I think our growth in the developed markets where the impact of recently launched products is most pronounced, we'll be a match for any of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Slide 33 shows the components of profit growth and how we move from a 2% decline in reported operating income to a 29% growth in core operating income in constant currency. There are three components to this. Firstly, Alcon, and I've already highlighted to you the movements which take you from 5 million in operating income to 222 million of core operating income.</p>
          <p>Secondly, as we announced a few weeks ago, the termination of Albuferon and Mycograb programs, resulted in an impairment charge of 584 million. Note that the disposal of Enablex to Warner Chilcott was completed earlier this week and will generate a gain a 394 million, which we'll record in quarter four. And finally currency had a negative impact of 4% on reported profit, slightly higher than the impact on sales.</p>
          <p>Slide 34 shows how each division contributed to operating leverage. Yielding an overall improvement in margin of 2.7 percentage points. The strongest contributor is Consumer Health with a margin increase of 3.9 percentage points. And as you can see from the Consumer Health section of the press release, around 2.3 percentage points came from a disposal gain and the effect of provisions made in quarter three, 2009. That said, the divisional performance was very strong.</p>
          <p>Benefiting from a strong start to the cough and cold season and a very disciplined cost management, where a strong top line drops through to operating income.</p>
          <p>Sandoz was the second best contributor with the margin improvement of 1.8 percentage points, driven by the strong top line. Even though gross margin declined by 3.1 percentage points as a result of mix shifts and inventory write-offs.</p>
          <p>Pharma margin improved by 1.1 percentage points. Gross margin is back on an improving trend and there were positive benefits from sales and marketing although the overall result was flattered a, little by the impact of provisions made in quarter 3 of 2009. These benefited margins by around 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>Slide 35 gives you another dimension of the margin improvement. While the fundamentals come through strongly, you can see that the benefit of one off-credits in 2010, compared to largely debits in 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally on margin, slide 35 brings together the story on productivity. Joe has given you some very strong examples of sales and marketing productivity gains and the benefits that are coming from purchasing, which overall yielded 3 percentage points of margin improvement in the quarter, of which around half is being reinvested mostly behind new products in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>One other point to note in the nine months column is that H1N1 benefited margin by 2.1 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Of course, it won't be as high as this for the year, as we didn't begin to record sales until the fourth quarter of last year. But it's something that you will need to factor into next year.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the bottom half of the P&amp;L on slide 37, which shows our 2% decline in reported operating income translates into 10% increase in net income and a 6% increase in reported earnings per share.</p>
          <p>The right-hand side of the slide gives you the core reconciliation. There are four points to make. In, associated companies, I've highlighted the one off revaluation of Alcon but in quarter three last year, there was one off charge in both Roche and Alcon, which was totaled a 199 million, giving us an overall swing this quarter of almost $400 million. The interest charge now picks up the impact of the second stage, Alcon acquisition.</p>
          <p>The tax charge is 17% in the quarter compared to 15.2% in 2009 and of course, between net income and earnings per share you have to remove the 23% minority interest in Alcon's earnings.</p>
          <p>On slide 38, cash flow. Our cash flow performance continues to be very good as I have already mentioned, 2.9 billion generated in quarter three and 8.2 billion for the nine months.</p>
          <p>Slide 39,  sets out where our indebtedness is after the Alcon acquisition in August. Net indebtedness is 19 billion of which 8 billion is in cash and marketable securities, 3.3 recorded in Alcon, which of course we cannot pool. The strength of our cash flow is such that we have already repaid the 700 million of the CP issued for the Alcon acquisition and the outstanding amount of 30th September is 7.5 billion and it's lower today.</p>
          <p>So before handing you over to David. Let me summarize where we are. Clearly this has been another strong quarter with all divisions contributing to 16% constant currency sales growth, which through good operating leverage generated core earnings per share growth of 19% in constant currency.</p>
          <p>The outlook for the year is low to mid-teens sales growth including Alcon leading to improved operating and core operating margin. But before finishing, there are two final comments.</p>
          <p>First is, if you think about the final quarter. There a number of moving parts to take into account, H1N1 sales commencing quarter four last year and the program is now complete.</p>
          <p>Sandoz' last year included four months of EBEWE sales in the final quarter and so we'll begin -- start to begin lapping it now. And of course in Pharma, there were the legal provisions made in the final quarter.</p>
          <p>Secondly, currency. As predicted, the third quarter was negative for both sales and operating income as a result of the dollar strengthening. Since the end of the third quarter, the dollar has weakened a lot with the result that if rates stay where they are today, then the currency impacting quarter four won't be as severe as quarter three. And for the year as a whole, the overall impact should be broadly neutral to both sales and operating income.</p>
          <p>One conclusion you can draw from this is that even though the current situation with the euro is weak and the Swiss franc is strong, which is generally bad for profits, our broad geographic base and business base means the overall impact is significantly muted by the appreciation of other currencies.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand you to David now for a review of the Pharma business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jon. It's my pleasure to update everyone on Novartis Pharma's robust Q3 where we were able to deliver 6% top line growth and core operating income as well as free cash flow roughly double that top line growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 43, we see that just as importantly recently launched brands, those brands that we've launched since 2007 now account for 22% of our portfolio as we continue to rejuvenate our sales base. And compared to Q3 2010 to Q3 of last year, that's a 34% growth on this basket of products.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 44, this should be a familiar chart. These are the eight brands/franchises that we are increasingly focusing our investment on, because we believe this strong portfolio of recently launched products has blockbuster potential and all will have patent protection beyond 2015.</p>
          <p>What I'd like to do for most of the rest of the presentation is focus on just three of these brands. Those brands where we had the most interesting recent new data. Starting on page 46, where I'd like to give you an overview of the $11 billion MS market. As you know, this market has been led historically by just three classes of drugs, the interferons, Copaxone as well as Tysabri. The total market is approximately 430,000 treated patients world-wide and more than likely well over 1.5 billion patients in terms of worldwide prevalence, giving us some expectation that the market will continue to expand over time.</p>
          <p>Looking now at page 47, we had the opportunity to just recently launch, introduce Gilenya, an oral therapy for relapsing multiple sclerosis patients. And that first launch has now occurred in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On the back of very significant data which shows that Gilenya reduces relapses by 52% first data interferon, intramuscular. And importantly, it reduces the risk of disability progression by 30% versus placebo, which broadly translated mean that these patients can enjoy a better quality of life. We were able to negotiate with the FDA, I believe a very good risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for the patients who have the appropriate screening prior to their first dose.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the page 48. I would like to focus now specifically on the U.S. opportunity. And as you can see, approximately 55% of the U.S. diagnosed patients are treatment naive are on first line  therapy. And while it's true that most initial patients for Gilenya will come for patients that are either currently on medications or those who are previously refused medication because of the fear of getting an injection. We believe that the market opportunity for Gilenya is quite good in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In Europe, it is likely that the label will be more restrictive than in the U.S., most likely a second line label, but given the dynamics of the market, we would not expect that to have much impact on patient or physician demand.</p>
          <p>Prior to the launch of the product, we did quite a lot research talking to both physicians, payers and patients about their experience in getting access to MS drugs. In addition, we knew that the on boarding of the patient onto Gilenya would be a little bit more involved given the pretreatment screening. And we want to design a program that would address their needs.</p>
          <p>I can now tell you after just a few weeks in the market that the feedback that we're getting from patients and from physicians is quite strong. And what we've done is we've developed a process that allocates an MS nurse to each of the patients who signs up for the program. And starting with pretreatment through the first dose evaluation, and then with ongoing therapy, we provide a range of benefits including coordination of medical evaluations, co-pay support for pretreatment tests, education material and streamline access to pharmacy.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at page 50, you can get a better sense of the support that we have provided in the context of getting patients on to Gilenya.</p>
          <p>Starting on the left-hand side of the pie what you see is as we do for many of our other drugs, we do have a Novartis, Patient Assistance Program or PAP, which provides Gilenya at no cost to patients up to 500% for the federal poverty level.</p>
          <p>In addition for Gilenya, we have provided funding to a co-pay foundation for underinsured patients. And what's truly novel about this program is our Gilenya prescription in medical, co-pay assistance where we provide medical co-pay coverage of up to $600 for those prescreening tests and up to $800 per prescription with an annual cap or just over 10,000 per patients who have large out of pocket co-pays.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page 51, you see that we will, we plan to and are continuing to invest in Gilenya. One, to continue existing trials to get longer term safety and efficacy data. We now have individual patients who have been on drug for more than five years and doing well but we would like to have a much larger database. In addition, we have underway a trial in primary progressive multiple sclerosis, which we hope over time will further expand the potential of this exciting new medicine.</p>
          <p>Page 52 lays out for you, the timing of the expected reviews, approvals and launches worldwide. The next decision expected is an approval in Switzerland during the fourth quarter with launches in Europe staggered over the course of 2011, as we gained approval in reimbursement.</p>
          <p>The second franchise I'd like to focus on starts on page 53, and this is our BCR-ABL franchise targeting the chronic myeloid leukemia market. As you know, we recently introduced Tasigna as a -- initially as a second-line therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia and now have launched into the U.S. for the first-line indications. On the back of that launch, we have seen significant growth in Tasigna with a growth of almost 100% from Q3, 2009 to Q3, 2010. And you see the overall franchise is growing double-digit, 11% in this particular period.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the quarter we were able to receive CHMP positive opinion for the first-line indication. That occurred in September. So we would expect to be able to launch by early next year for this first-line indication.</p>
          <p>Looking at page 54, we have our first snapshot of how this first-line launch is progressing in the U.S. market. And you see the nice bend in the curve and the uptick up to Tasigna since that launch and in the second generation TKI market, we are now catching up to our number one competitor.</p>
          <p>I'd been asked a number of times, what additional clinical data is being generated to help inform physicians about which patient should potentially be switched from Glivec to Tasigna and what you see on page 55, or what I believe, or we believe are the four most important clinical trials, looking at patients who have suboptimal responses to Glivec. And as you'll note, we'll have data both at this year's ASH as well as next year's ASH and I think that this data will help provide the confidence physicians will need to help put their patients on the best therapy given specific patient type.</p>
          <p>If you look now at page 56, you see another part of our strategy beginning to play out. It is quite clear that physician community has moved over time from relatively crude measures of patient success to more sensitive measures. Basically moving from hematologic response to cytogenetic response and now to molecular response. Unfortunately, the technology that's in place around the world to measure molecular response is often fairly cumbersome and some times can give varying results from sample to sample or lab to lab.</p>
          <p>We have now put in place an agreement with Cepheid to help standardize that process with a simple to use blood test, which will provide simplified, standardized reports back to the physician, which will help them better understand, which patients to keep on Glivec or perhaps switch to a second-generation agent.</p>
          <p>I would say, even more importantly, we're working with Cepheid on a next-generation diagnostic, which will be even more sensitive. This new device will help us understand which of the Glivec patients really have control and which would benefit potentially from being on a more effective agent like Tasigna.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to speak about one more franchise, this is our really emerging respiratory franchise, I'd like to start with Onbrez, which is our first launch for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As you can see, we were able to present data showing the superiority of Onbrez versus salmeterol 50 micrograms twice a day, which is the standard of care.</p>
          <p>Our first launch market was Germany, where we are off to a very good start, as you can see from the right-hand side of the chart.</p>
          <p>Looking now at page 58, you can see our strategy in a little bit more perspective. Onbrez is just the entry into this market, and Onbrez is combination of a very effective molecule as well as a very well received device called the Breezhaler. Our plan is to bring some market, in addition to this LABA, a LAMA as well as a combination of Onbrez in that <mark type="inaudible" />, the LAMA called QVA149. And over time, we will then bring additional combinations into the marketplace, including a combination of Onbrez plus a once-a-day steroid. All these different products will use the same device, making it easier for physicians and patients to switch among the family of Novartis medications.</p>
          <p>We believe in time that our respiratory franchise could become a very important third leg behind our cardiovascular and oncology business at Novartis.</p>
          <p>I'd like to now summarize on page 59. It is very clear that we have quite a lot of news flow planned over the coming months. Our development colleagues will be extremely busy, and I believe our customers will be quite happy with the innovation that we are bringing to market.</p>
          <p>Just as a quick reminder, we expect imminently a decision by the CHMP for a new indication for Lucentis in diabetic macular edema. We will present the first head to head data of Onbrez versus tiotropium from a Phase III trial on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We will see the initial Phase III data for ACZ or Ilaris in gouty arthritis. We have regulatory decisions coming for Tasigna, new data for Tasigna coming at the American Society of Hematology. And finally, we expect the U.S. FDA decision on SEGA associated with tuberous sclerosis. And as you can see into 2011, we expect continuing news flow.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'd like to wrap up and hand the meeting back over to Joe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Okay, just to wrap up. I feel good about the progress that we are making against our three strategic priorities, particularly I think in the area of innovation. Now, we still have a lot of work to do in all three areas but I believe, we will continue to execute well against these. So the final slide just restates our guidance for the year. So with that, I'd like to close the presentation and now open it up for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Three questions, please. Firstly on Zometa, did you confirm that your data will be presented at San Antonio. And then following on from that, is there any possibility of maintaining your market activity or patent protection beyond 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. You are breaking up, we can't hear the question. Maybe if you could get closer to the phone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Now that's much better. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. So the first question is on Zometa. Just to confirm that your data will be at San Antonio. And then second, is there any possibility that you could use, additional patents or user codes to try and extend your period of patent protection beyond 2013.</p>
          <p>Second on Elinogrel, given the wealth of riches at your disposal. I'm somewhat puzzled by your commitment to a very large and presumably, going to be very expensive clinical trial for an agent which has some hair on it already. Perhaps you could just outline your rationale there?</p>
          <p>And then finally and quickly, on your anticipated filing or rather Sandoz's anticipated filing for a generic Advair in Europe. Perhaps you could update us on the timelines for that? And whether indeed you may actually filed it already? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, I'll take the Zometa questions and then I'm going to hand it over to Trevor for Elinogrel. So there is an interim analysis planned on the Azor study. This is done by a third party organization. We believe that interim will occur before the end of the year. Whether or not they decide to submit that data to San Antonio, I can't speak for them. Regarding the patent extension, I do not see a -- any clear road to a patent extension for this brand. Trevor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Elinogrel actually remains, I think, an important part of our cardiovascular franchise. In the sense that, in this -- I think, a very good opportunity, which is around treating chronic coronary heart disease patients with high risk over a chronic period. They really are only two players in the game. One is ticagrelor and the other one is Elinogrel right now. Maybe with some low level usage of topidigril. So I think that, if you look at the INNOVATE-PCI study, we had very good efficacy in our safety, and bleeding risk looks very manageable. So it's up to us now to get the dose exactly right. But we are certainly intent on starting that early next year. And we have certainly staged it in terms of interim data and facilities. So that I don't think, that the outlay and resource is unacceptable for the potential return.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Graham Parry from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Firstly on Gilenya co-pays, I was just wondering what percentage of commercial patients you think would actually reach the co-pay limits of up to $10,400 for Gilenya. Is that around half the patient, 20% of patients. If you can just give us a feel for that proportion?</p>
          <p>I was just wondering, if you could, secondly give us an update on MenB phase III starts in the U.S. any timelines, and when we might see some data in the catch-up populations in Europe?</p>
          <p>And then, thirdly on the sustainability of the consumer margins seen in Q3, if you could just give us a bit of a comment about how you see that margin progressing going forward?</p>
          <p>And then similar question on the Sandoz Q3 margins, in particular on the margin you are generating on generic Lovenox sales. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a break out of that and comment as to how sustainable you see your Q3 margin for Sandoz? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, Graham I would expect most patients over time will be covered under their pharmacy benefit. And this will be a, typically be a tier 2 or tier 3 drug. Out of pocket for patients like this are often in the range of 40 to $100 per month, and of course there is a lot of variability around that. So I would think very few people would get up to the upper limit of our cap.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As for MenB, first in the U.S. We have now requested officially enter phase II meeting with the FDA. Initially, we planned that for phase III, but we decided to include the study results of the good phase III study that we saw from outside of the U.S., in that package and it will surely has a positive impact on the discussion with the FDA. And based on that feedback then we will design and decide another phase III program in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And additional catch up data in Europe, you'll see data coming in over the next 12 months from toddlers, from adolescents, but also from adults. And we will give you a comprehensive update at Investor Day of Novartis in November about exact status and what to expect when.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Jon said the operating margin increases 3.9% and 2.3% of that, of percentage points of that is due to one off. The underlying trends for the year is relatively good. And that is sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Sandoz?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Graham I'll comment both on the sustainability question that you asked around margins and growth as well as on Enoxaparin, but l'lI break those two out. In terms of sustainability of performance for Sandoz, we expect the improved Sandoz performance to continue, but at more modest top and bottom line growth rates and clearly, Q3 was a strong quarter.</p>
          <p>But I think it's important to note that one cannot simply extrapolate the good Q3 into Q4 and beyond for a few reasons.</p>
          <p>First of all, Enoxaparin sales included a significant stock-in, as is common with big first-to-market launches. And as competition could come at any given time, it's in our interest to maintain significant stock in the channel.</p>
          <p>Secondly we had four months of EBEWE sales last year as Jon mentioned. Third as Joe mentioned earlier, we have increased competition on our key products globally particularly, our U.S. products, tacrolimus and the end of 180 day exclusivity on Losartan.</p>
          <p>And then of course, we have the ongoing margin impact of Western European price cuts. And the German market declined because of the tender situation.</p>
          <p>Enoxaparin is specifically, the results exceeded our expectations, since July 23 when we launched. Our market share is currently tracking at slightly over 45%, putting it at the most successful generic injectable launch ever in the U.S. But as I mentioned before that does include a significant stock-in. So I think that I would leave it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it also possible to quantify the exact dollar amount of the stock-in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd prefer at this point not to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ms. Alexandra Hauber from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Several questions, please. Firstly, on Glivec, what happened this quarter outside the U.S. when you went from plus 6% in the first half to minus 1%? Is that all Tasigna taking huge share or would you have to maybe then a local currency growth rate for ex-U.S. for the franchise combined?</p>
          <p>Also on Tasigna, so I look at your -- at these three studies, which you showed on slide 25. Can you really elaborate a bit on those -- how those studies really are supposed to drive the switch, which of the three studies do you expect to be most impactful? They're all quite small studies. I mean, what kind of end-points can you even look at that? So if you could elaborate a bit on that, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Moving on to emerging markets, you did flag your good performance in India and South Korea. But of course, that begs the question, what happened really in Brazil and China, where you probably, global 13%? Or is it all Turkey, which is pulling you down for the overall growth rate?</p>
          <p>And then the final question is on biosimilars. In the past you have declined to give an absolute numbers and I think, the reason you pointed to what because it was not yet reaching a significant level. And I had assumed, it would reach that level of significance pretty soon. Or have you changed your attitude on that and it's just you'll never disclose an absolute figure for the biosimilar sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with David on the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, Alex, a couple of things. If you look at Glivec and Tasigna each quarter this year and compare it to the similar quarter last year, we've been growing the combined franchise about 11% per quarter. So it's fairly steady.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Outside the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you go -- yeah, I don't have the numbers right in front of me. We can check, but when you look at smaller parts of the world, and you start seeing the impacts of tenders in any given quarter. So I would not read anything into that.</p>
          <p>Now, what is really happening is like with all medications, we are feeling increasingly the impact of negative European pricing during Q3. We're getting more of a full effect, which is hurting us. And in addition, in Japan, we had a fairly significant price cut on Glivec and Tasigna this year. So you're starting to see that piece evolve a bit more. But overall, the franchise is doing quite well and there are no untoward trends or nothing has really changed.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Tasigna trials that we had on page 55 of the presentation, you can see that they are basically lined up against different subsets of what we would call suboptimal patients. Those that have suboptimal phytogenic response, no complete molecular response, which is a 4.5 reduction after 2.5 years, or suboptimal molecular control.</p>
          <p>I think these studies are reasonable size, we believe they are powered sufficiently to give us a clear answer as to whether or not there would be benefit from moving these patients from Glivec to Tasigna. We've modeled the statistics based upon what we've seen with the drug so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is the end-point ultimately just going to be, you're bringing more patients to molecular response or to whatever you're starting recruiting criteria is or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The typical study design is to bring more patients either into molecular or complete molecular response. And then of course, there are correlations between that better response and better outcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on Glivec, is there any way how you could quantify how much of your business is actually subject to tender? And if you can't do that, is it -- I mean, we know that tender business in Russia and in Brazil, any other geographies we should be aware of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are tenders throughout the world. So it would actually be a fairly long list. I do not have a number in front of me to actually quantify how much is tender. And of course the definition of what really is a tender and what isn't is kind of fuzzy as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Alexandra, on emerging markets for the group, we took a big hit in Turkey. The big price decline that is forced in Turkey is suppressing our emerging market growth. China while it grew double-digits is not where we want it to be, I think in we said in the past that we had some disruption in terms of the regionalization of that business.</p>
          <p>And so, we do believe that the underlying performance of our emerging markets portfolio is strong. And as we get through the pricing issue that we've had in Turkey and China begins to climb, we're going to see that number go up. So Jeff, on biosimilars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We -- Alexandra, we gave an annual U.S. dollar figure at the end of 2009, which was a $118 million globally, which was up 73% versus prior year. We are not giving quarterly breakouts, but we plan to give an annual figure at the end of the year. What I can say is that, we grew 72% in constant currency in the first half of this year and 41% in Q3. So our year-to-date growth is 59%.</p>
          <p>The drivers of that has been threefold. One, Omnitrope in the U.S. has overtaken Teva's human growth hormone to become the largest U.S. biosimilar. And we've made significant share gains versus other competitors as well. Secondly, we've rolled out the Binocrit, that is the EPO product, high strength oncology indications in Europe. And third, we've seen very nice growth of our G-CSF, Zarzio product particularly across Europe this year in 2010.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. Florent Cespedes Exane BNP Paribas. Let's start with the European Health Care Reform. Could you give us an idea of which products are the most affected by the price cuts in Europe or is it all across the portfolio?</p>
          <p>Secondly on Sandoz, can you give us an idea of the magnitude of the sale that will lose exclusivity in Q4 in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And the one pipeline question, could you have an update BF-312 and do you still confirm that the rationale of being more specific is still better for the tolerance of the product?</p>
          <p>And the last one on Tasigna. Could you tell us, if you work or not, if you are working or not on the once a day formulation of the product, because obviously your competitor is very aggressive with this point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so let me do the first and fourth questions. And then we'll hand it over to Trevor for the BF drug and then Jeff. Yeah, in terms of price cuts across Europe, I think, the easiest way to think about it is, is that price cuts have been typically rolled out in, let's just call it in a widespread equal kind of manner with the exception in some markets, drugs that are more innovative or drugs that are orphan drugs end up with lower price cuts.</p>
          <p>So our portfolio is heavily weighted towards our orphan medicine, so sometimes we're at little bit better competitive position.</p>
          <p>Regarding Tasigna once a day, interesting because as we entered the market, we thought the fact that we're twice-a-day would a potential disadvantage and what we're finding out is actually it is not holding back the share gains for Tasigna.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we have here our development people here try to come up with a once a day formulation and we are doing that work. Trevor?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>May be, you have an idea of the timeline for this development, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm not prepared to do yet because it takes a while to find an optimal form.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Florent, on the BAF studies, so we will have the phase II results in multiple sclerosis in a very substantial dose ranging study coming out in the first quarter of next year. There are some differences between the doses, but I think we fundamentally have to wait and see what the efficacy is before we can say whether there is a difference due to the selectivity of that compound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jeff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Florent, as to the magnitude of sales, that are losing exclusivity in the U.S, I'd prefer not to break out the specific number what I will do is give you a sense of the competitive dynamics on a couple of the key products.</p>
          <p>On Losartan, which was for six months that we had exclusivity shared with Teva over 130 million in sales of the generic Cozaar and Hyzaar. That has now lost exclusivity and the price has come down to a couple of cents from the dollars. So that product effectively to some degree disappears.</p>
          <p>We still have volume, but at a much lower price.</p>
          <p>Secondly on tacrolimus, which after enoxaparin, is one of our most important products in the U.S., Reddy's did come in a few months ago. Mylan entered the market in September and Watson over the summer entered with one strength, in the high strength side.</p>
          <p>And then finally on lansoprazole. On the capsules, we've seen increased competition. I believe Watson just launched. Having said that, we just launched last Friday and then over the weekend the oral disperable tablets where we have a new 180-day exclusivity shared with Teva for the next six months; obviously a much smaller segment of the market than the capsules, but it's a nice product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should say that is an authorized generics with Tekeda. So you have to factor that into your margin assumptions. That is not a high margin product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have quite a few people in the queue. So if you could maybe limit your question to maybe two questions, we would appreciate that, as the next question is asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mrs. Jo Walton from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will limit to one question, which is, some help please, on the longer-term margins that we should be able to achieve in vaccines. There seems so many moving parts with pandemic flu and now with increased investment, and with the emergence of Menveo and then more R&amp;D on MenB. Can you give us some help us to whether any of the margins that we're seeing at the moment is going to be illustrative of the margins that you can sustain in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo, I'll take that. I think there are going to be a number of moving parts for a while. The one piece of moving part that will disappear is H1N1 and we tried to indicate what is happening there. But of course, the preparation of the filing in the launch of MenB is going to be a big opportunity for the business. And Menveo is still establishing itself. So we've got a very good-looking early pipeline.</p>
          <p>So with a volatile unpredictable flu business on top of it, I think you're going to have to, it's going to take a while before you see the true quality of the business that will really merge, but it will come through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I also ask for some help on the core corporate line? Each quarter so far, that's gone down. Is the third quarter again representative of the quarterly charges going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question. I wish I knew what the representative corporate charge was. I mean, it is to some extent by its nature somewhat of a volatile entity. I mean, I would hope it will come down over time. But I wouldn't look at the Q3 as being particularly representative of where it's going.</p>
          <p>And I would expect Q4 to be higher than Q3. And not only have you got the corporate operation in there, you've got pensions, which in itself is volatile. You've got some environmental provisions as we've seen and so on. So there is a natural degree of unpredictability in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have two questions. I'll ask the first one and then the second one after. On QAB149, I wonder if you can just give us a bit more color on this process and the U.S. approval process and the trials that you are doing. Really particularly as you're exploring lower doses of this product?</p>
          <p>Do you think that you're going to get a true once daily product on the market with what you're seeing or is there potentially you might have to back up with twice daily dosing in some patients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we indicated in our release, we have resubmitted two doses 75 microgram, and 150 micrograms once a day in the U.S. And I think that comes out of a fairly substantial patient group, we looked at about 2,000 patients. The one thing is very clear in that data, which is that this drug is really once a day drug. So I think that aspect is certainly going to be supported. And the process now going forward is the usual review in this case, and we should see what happens sometime early next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second question is just really regarding the starts on Alcon, because since August, it's been fairly clear that you've now got a much cheaper access to cash, if you want it. You've got a stronger share price. So you basically have a much stronger acquisition currency than you had say, 3 or 4 months ago? There was no real restatement of your previous thoughts on valuation in your release.</p>
          <p>I'm just wondering, how the environment in regards to your financing and your share price at all change your thoughts on how you think about valuation? Or in terms of what you might offer in terms of cash and share mix for Alcon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, as the offer that was made in January was 2.8 shares of Novartis, for every share of Alcon. We have two things happening to Novartis share price going up, and the Swiss Franc appreciation that, that without changing the offer, the value of that offer has obviously increased pretty significantly. So I think -- obviously, I cannot say what the IDC is thinking, or the Alcon board we'll see how it plays out. But in terms of cash versus stock mix, it would also be premature to talk. We said this is an all stock deal. And again see what conditions will look like at the time of the deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Questions on Gilenya and then on the Sandoz side. On Gilenya, I've seen a fair number of health plans in the U.S., that seem to have prior authorization put in place, kind of a sale first policy selling other therapies first. And my question is, how often are you likely to face prior authorization policies?</p>
          <p>And what are the therapies that patients have to fail? Is it usually just kind of standard interferons?</p>
          <p>On the Sandoz side, two questions. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on the generic insulin opportunities. Is that an attractive area or not? What should we expect Sandoz may be doing in that area, if anything, over time?</p>
          <p>And then the last generic question. Your expectations that, other generic versions of enoxaperin will be approved in the U.S. at some point over the next 6 to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is David. It's not that unusual that with a new specialty, medicine, which is perceived to be pricey to have a basically default to prior authorizations until the discussions with the health plan have occurred. We would expect that to be reduced over time. I don't think it's worth speculating on the definitions that the few plans that will put this in place, what those definitions would be? We don't expect access to be an issue in the U.S market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, generic insulin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Tim, we have prioritized investments in monoclonal antibodies over insulin, where we see significantly higher potential for returns. Insulin is a more challenging market, given lower pricing, given higher manufacturing costs and entrenched competitors in the space. So, we felt that it would be a better and high CapEx. So we felt that it would be a better use of our investment dollars to really go after the monoclonal antibodies.</p>
          <p>On the second question with respect to generic enoxaparin, competition in the next six to 12 months, I think your guess is as good as mine. It's hard for me to speculate at this time as to what will happen looking forward.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Kevin Wilson from Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two questions on Sandoz. Could you give us a sense of whether the level of price decrease you saw in the third quarter is likely to be repeated in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And secondly could you talk a little bit about your respiratory portfolio, and particularly why you've put a two-year plus delay into the QMF development by moving from the Clickhaler to the Concept One. I think you were very sold on the Clickhaler earlier on. And could you talk about why going to a single dose device is a good idea, given it will put you some way behind most likely GSK's new once-daily combination. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Kevin as you've seen for the first three quarters of this year, we saw 7% price erosion. Historically, it's been 8 or 9%. I think a couple of factors will make it higher -- would likely make it higher in Q4. One is the increased competition on exclusive and semi-exclusive products in the U.S. that I mentioned earlier. Two is the rollout of the Q3 tenders in Germany, where we expect the market to be negative double digits in net terms both in Q4 and in 2011. And the third factor is the continued price cuts and pricing pressure that we're seeing in Western Europe, particularly in the generic segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of the QMF and the Concept One device, one strong factor there was that we've seen the reception of the Concept One device increase and be very well taken up by both patients and physicians. Particularly when you consider they're extremely simple device and the drug is given once a day, so it mitigates any issues around the multi dosing.</p>
          <p>The other thing being that the first part of this Q family is really in COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, where this device really plays extremely well. So the first QMF indications we are looking at would be in COPD and I think it &#x2013; there is a tremendous utility as well to have a single device across the entire family really simplifies dosing for patients.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Amit Roy from Nomura here. Just a couple of questions, firstly on QAB. Will you be releasing the lower dose data from the <mark type="inaudible" /> meeting before we get the approval. Thought I might ask the question..</p>
          <p>And secondly just on enoxaparin. If my understanding is correct, the heparin market is only one third penetrated by Lovenox, is that true or not? And if so, do you see any price sensitivity of this market with your generic entry and then possible expansion of the Lovenox market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Amit, this is David. Could you repeat the QAB question, I'm not quite sure we heard it correctly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, so on QAB, the lower dose data you've re-submitted to the FDA, will we be seeing the at any medical meeting coming up shortly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're looking at releasing that data next year around the ATS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>ATS, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the heparin market, I think Amit, what I'll do follow up with you after the call, there is not a whole lot more than that I can say and I don't have data off the top of my head on the substitution for -- of low molecular weight heparins like enoxaparin for the other portion of the heparin market. I do see your conceptual logic of saying with lower pricing could this drive more of the overall market and heparin, we can come back on that.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Eric Le Berrigaud from Raymond James. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon. Two questions, please. First on Menveo, I guess probably the figures are still insignificant but could you elaborate a little bit on market share in the U.S. perhaps versus Menactra and kind of ramp up feeling outside of the U.S. and secondly mostly for 2011, could you disclose a little bit more on the Mylan agreement on Femara, just to figure out whether it will be a full year impact or only partial on the next year too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Menveo, the majority of the sales to-date come from the U.S. and we're six months into launch and we have the achieved market access to the large majority now in all of the public and private accounts. It is in the double digit million range already and we are satisfied with that. The progress, it is as expected and obviously to really expand the brand aggressively and we will have and we will -- we are focusing on our indication expansions. and we expect the title indication to be approved earlier in 2011. And then of course that secondary indication which we plan to file by year-end is what would really make this the complete brand and probably the leading ACWY brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe the second question was when we would anticipate generic Letrozole to launch in 2011 in the U.S. market? I think specifically you asked about Mylan our best guess would be some time in the second quarter of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mrs. Marietta Miemietz from Societe Generale. Please go ahead madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My first question relates to Alcon-related flow back. Do you know at all what proportion of the Alcon minorities would effectively be forced to sell their Novartis shares either, because Novartis is not in their benchmark or universe or because they're special sets of people? And are there any measures at all that you can take to alleviate the pressure from the flow back? In particular, is it theoretically feasible to do a buyback of these shares?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on Gilenya reimbursement in Europe, if you do get a restricted label, given that off-label users isn't normally reimbursed. So would it actually be possible for the payers to ascertain whether a patient has failed other treatments and has high disease activity and so forth, and therefore refuse reimbursement in those patients that strictly speaking aren't covered by the label or is it not really an issue because the lines are too blurred between the lines of setting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jon on --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Marietta on the first question, I mean in terms of the detailed make-up of the Alcon register you probably get a better indication from Alcon, because they get the exact data but if you take out the larger shareholders and it had been relatively stable, there has been quite a lot of hedge fund movement coming in recently as you would expect. So out of the 23, I would judge not much more than five would be in index funds, could be a bit more than that but not significantly, who would have to sell.</p>
          <p>In terms of the actions of the other people it's actually quite difficult to work it through, because if you follow actually the short interest in the Novartis ADRs, quite a lot of people have already taken their positions on it. So you can work flow back through, but in my experience actually a large part of flow back actually occurs before the date of completion because no sensible investor, normally wants to sell into a market that's going one-way. So it get sorted out in the weeks before hand so it's a factor but not one that it worries us greatly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just to try to provide some color on Gilenya in Europe, pricing, lines of therapy et cetera. First thing, it is important to understand is that, MS drugs across the board cost less than they cost in the U.S., so you have to take that into your model. And within acceptable pricing ranges, to the extent the label is more restrictive for example, second-line versus first-line, is the ability to negotiate a higher price goes up. So getting actually a second-line label in Europe may be beneficial from a reimbursement perspective.</p>
          <p>Now, to your specific question is, if some -- if there is a second-line label and a physician chooses as the first-line what do you get paid for and the answer is, it varies country-by-country, hospital-by-hospital and there is no one answer.</p>
