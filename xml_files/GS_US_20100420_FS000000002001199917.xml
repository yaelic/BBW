          <p>Good morning.  My name is Gerald, and I will be your conference facilitator today.  I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.  After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Also, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, April, 20, 2010.  Thank you.  Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  Today's call may include forward-looking statements.  These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control.  The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements.  For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in the current annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 2009.  I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website, www.GS.com.

          <p>Thanks, Dane.  I'd like to thank all of you for listening today.  I'll give an overview of our first quarter results and then ask Greg Palm our general counsel to discuss the SEC complaint against Goldman Sachs.  We'll take your questions at the end.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report strong first quarter results for Goldman Sachs.  Net revenues were $12.8 billion, net earnings were $3.5 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $5.59.  Our annualized return on common equity was 20%.  During the quarter, book value per share was up over 4% to $122.52.  Faced with a still difficult although improving macroeconomic operating environment, our performance in the first quarter of 2010 continued to demonstrate the benefits of a diversified business model and deep client relationships.  While certain businesses including FICC and equities produced sequentially higher revenues they were partially offset by the impact of lower levels of completed investment banking transactions and lower revenues from asset management and securities services businesses.</p>
          <p>While individual businesses will have differing performance based on the operating environment in any given quarter, economic growth around the world remains the single most significant long-term driver of our firm's opportunity set.  Our constant focus on clients despite the challenging environment of the past two years continued to bolster our performance via elevated market share and strong demand for our services.  We entered 2010 with robust liquidity and risk adjusted capital levels.  In keeping with the firm's long standing policy of repurchasing shares to offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share based compensation, the firm repurchased 13.2 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion.  Despite these share repurchases, our common shareholders equity still increased by $2.2 billion to 66 billion.  We remain committed to maintaining a conservative financial profile and appropriately managing our capitalization.  Our Basel 1 Tier 1 ratio of 15% and a global core excess pool of liquidity which averaged $162 billion during the quarter reflect that commitment.</p>
          <p>I'll now review each of our businesses.  Investment banking produced net revenues of $1.2 billion, down 28% from the fourth quarter.  First quarter advisory revenues were $464 million down 31% from the fourth quarter.  Goldman Sachs ranked first in announced and completed M&amp;A globally year to date and advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter.  These include Novartis's $39.3 billion acquisition of the remaining stake in Alcon, American Life Insurance Company's $15.5 billion sale to MetLife, and Schlumberger's $12.2 billion of Smith International.  We were also advisor on a number of significant closed transactions including Burlington Northern Santa Fe's $35.9 billion sale to Berkshire Hathaway, Cadbury's $22.4 billion sale to Kraft Foods, and Liberty Global's $5.2 billion acquisition of Unitymedia.</p>
          <p>First quarter underwriting net revenues were $720 million.  Equity underwriting revenues were $371 million down 41% from the fourth quarter as the market for new issue activity was less robust.  Debt underwriting was up 3% to $349 million with strength across leverage finance and investment grade markets.  During the first quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions including Sumitomo Mitsui's $11.1 billion follow-on offering, IMSL's $2 billion term loan and $1 billion high yield note issuance, and Hartford Financial's $1.7 billion follow-on offering and $575 million convertible preferred stock offering.  Our investment banking backlog was essentially flat from year-end levels.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Trading and Principal Investments, which is comprised of FICC, equities, and principal investments.  Net revenues were $10.3 billion in the first quarter.  FICC net revenues were $7.4 billion in the quarter representing a significant increase from the fourth quarter as every major business including credit, interest rates, currencies, commodities and mortgages generated higher revenues.  This quarter's FICC rev results are also more balanced with broad contribution across products and regions.  Our FICC performance reflects solid market share and generally strong levels of client activity despite lower levels of volatility.</p>
          <p>Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.4 billion, up 22% sequentially.  Equities trading net revenues were $1.5 billion, up 45% versus the fourth quarter largely driven by a sequential improvement in derivative activity.  Net revenues from our principal strategies business were positive but not a significant revenue driver in the quarter.  Equities commissions were down 4% sequentially to $881 million due to generally lower market volumes during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the first quarter was $161 million, down 11% from the fourth quarter.  Let me now review principal investments, which produced net revenues of 510 million in the first quarter.  Our corporate principal investment portfolio generated net gains of $760 million largely in corporate debt and public equity investments.  This was partially offset by our investment in ICBC which generated net losses of $222 million during the quarter.  Our real estate principal investment portfolio was not a meaningful contributor during the quarter.  In asset management and security services, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, down 14% from the fourth quarter.  Asset management produced revenues of $946 million which were down from the fourth quarter largely due to seasonally lower incentive fees.  Assets under management declined 4% sequentially to $840 billion driven by money market outflows consistent with industry trends, partially offset by net inflows and fixed income assets and market appreciation primarily in equity assets.  Security services produced net revenues of $395 million, down 11% from the fourth quarter due to a less favorable mix of customer balances.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to expenses.  Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll, taxes, and benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43%.  The first quarter 2010 compensation ratio is our lowest ever first quarter ratio, 650 basis points lower than our historical reported first quarter average compensation to net revenue ratio of 49.5%.  The significant reduction in first quarter compensation accruals reflects the current strength of our revenues and relative competitive position and recognition of the broader environment in which we operate.  Going forward, the compensation ratio will continue to be impacted by these and other factors.</p>
          <p>First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, 23% lower than the fourth quarter, which included approximately $620 million in charitable contributions.  Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 33,100, up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Our effective tax rate was 33% for the first quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, based on our long-standing policy of offsetting the dilutive impact of employee based compensation, we repurchased 13.2 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The broader economic environment remains fragile and the future set of operating and regulatory guidelines remains in flux.  However, we believe our long-term success hinges on a core set of principles.  First and foremost, we will focus on serving our clients' needs on a global basis with a diversified product portfolio.  Second, given the importance of human capital to our success in meeting clients' needs, we must recruit and retain the most talented people in our firm.  Third we will continue to foster a culture of communication, long-term thinking, collaboration, flexibility, and risk management excellence.  Finally, we will strive to provide industry-leading returns by combining these principles with a compensation structure that pays for performance and aligns employees' interests with those of our other long-term stakeholders.</p>
          <p>As we stated last quarter, we believe that financial institutions have a significant and critical role to play in promoting economic growth, jobs, and wealth creation for society.  Our business model and culture is consistent with these significant responsibilities.  As a major participant in the financial markets, we remain committed to supporting initiatives that improve the long-term stability of the global financial system.  Thus we will continue to work with governments, regulators, and peers across the world to strengthen standards and processes.  With that, I'd like to pass the call to Greg Palm, our General Counsel.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.  As you are aware, last Friday the SEC filed a civil complaint against the firm and one of our employees.  We are very disappointed that the SEC would bring this action which relates to a single synthetic CDO transaction involving two professional institutional investors in the face of an extensive record which we believe establishes that the allegations are unfounded.</p>
          <p>I should note that since this is active litigation, I will have to be somewhat constrained in my commentary. To begin with, I want to make very clear one important point.  We do not in any way dispute the necessity and the importance of the SEC's role in protecting investors and supporting fair, orderly, and efficient markets.  Our dispute is with regard to the respective views of the facts in this case and the applicable law.</p>
          <p>The process which resulted in this action began in August 2008 when the SEC first asked for information on this transaction.  Over the past 18 months, we have provided staff with an extensive amount of documents and testimony relating to our activities in the mortgage space generally and this transaction in particular.  The core of the SEC case appears to be based on the theory that one of our employees and thereby the firm misled two professional institutional investors, ACA and IKB, in connection with a synthetic CDO transaction.  Specifically the SEC claims that we failed to ensure that the offering material disclosed the role of another market participant in the transaction, namely Paulson &amp; Co. Before delving further into the facts of this case, I want to make another point clear: we would never intentionally mislead anyone, certainly not our clients or our counterparties.  We have never condoned and would never condone inappropriate behavior by any of our people.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, we would be the first to condemn and to take all appropriate action.  Our responsibilities as a financial intermediary require it, and our commitment to integrity and the firm's business principles demand it.  As to the case and by way of background, there were only two professional institutional investors other than ABN AMRO acting as counter-party credit intermediary involved in this transaction.  Both of these investors were institutions with significant resources and extensive experience in the CDO market.  At year-end 2006, ACA, a specialty financial services company, managed 22 similar CDOs with 15.7 billion in assets.  IKB, a large German bank, had a separate mortgage group and was an active participant in the CDO market.  Indeed as of January 2007, according to IKB, they had launched and managed more than 16.8 billion of CLOs and CDOs and viewed securitization and CDO investment as an integral part of their business model.</p>
          <p>From the outset, the transaction enabled ACA, IKB, and Paulson each to achieve certain desired exposures to be Aa2 rated subprime securities of the 2006 vintage.  Our role as a financial intermediary and market maker is to bring together such market participants.  ACA and IKB were positioned to benefit from an increase in the value of their reference portfolio of securities, and Paulson was positioned to benefit from a decline in the value of this portfolio.  As professional investors, they fully understood that a synthetic CDO transaction must have both a buyer and a seller, that is both a long and a short side.  And each had the resources necessary to analyze the reference portfolio of securities which was completely itemized for them.</p>
          <p>In the process of selecting the reference portfolio, ACA, which was both the portfolio selection agent and overwhelmingly the largest investor, evaluated every proposed security.  Although ACA received input from both Paulson and IKB, ACA had sole responsibility for determining and did determine the final portfolio and was paid a fee for performing that role.  ACA used proprietary models and methods of analysis to develop its own independent view of the relative riskiness of each security.  To that point, ACA rejected more than half of the securities suggested by Paulson.  All of that being said, the particular securities in the reference portfolio were not ultimately a key factor in the performance of this transaction. The entire pool of Baa2 rated securities from the 2006 vintage performed similarly amidst an unprecedented market collapse.</p>
          <p>The SEC complaint also alleges that ACA was led to believe that Paulson would be buying an equity position rather than taking a contrary position against the portfolio, which skewed ACA's approach to dealing with Paulson.  We simply do not believe that the evidence cited by the SEC demonstrates that ACA was misled into believing that Paulson was going to be buying an equity position and the term sheets and offering circular did not reflect an equity tranche.</p>
          <p>Finally a significant point missing from the SEC's complaint is the fact that Goldman Sachs retained a significant residual long position in the transaction.  Our overall losses in connection with the transaction exceeded 100 million, including 83 million with respect to the retained long position.  We certainly had no incentive to structure a transaction that was designed to lose money.</p>
          <p>In summary, there are four key points to consider.  First, this was a transaction between institutional counterparties who well understood the risks they were taking.  Moreover, ACA and IKB knew that the transaction must have a short position opposite their long position.  Second, ACA's portfolio selection agent was solely responsible for and in fact did select the securities in this portfolio.  Third, there was never any representation that Paulson was to be a long equity investor in the transaction.  Fourth, GS had no economic motivation for this transaction to fail.  In fact, our incentives were aligned with ACA and IKB.  Finally, we want to emphasize again that we do not in any way dispute the importance of the SEC's role in protecting investors and supporting fair and efficient markets.  Our dispute is with regard to our respective views as to the facts in this case and the applicable loss.  With that, we'd like to thank you again for listening today and we're now happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  Just first one, just follow-up on the case, I'm curious on one thing.  If Paulson &#x2013; if there was no misrepresentation about Paulson being a long, how were they introduced into the process?  In other words, they were obviously making suggestions into what securities ACA should include, but under what capacity were they introduced if it wasn't a long or a short?  What were they doing there basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, my first comment would be and I think you probably know this very well, which is, in this market, there has to be a long and a short.  That's perfectly clear.  And the other point I really emphasize is that in order to have a transaction in this market, you have to have some reference portfolio of securities which is satisfactory to both the longs who are looking at the portfolio, they're not looking really at anything else, and the shorts who are looking at the same portfolio and deciding that, and as you know whether the shorts are us or anyone else.  Paulson entered the process here with ACA and at least based on the record we know, we actually have no idea where ACA got &#x2013; assuming they did, because that's what's alleged here &#x2013; the impression that Paulson was a "equity investor."</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how did they know that there's a transaction going on?  Meaning, I know Paulson approached you and wanted certain exposure.  How did ACA get introduced to Paulson?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure we would have put them in contact with each other, but to get into the &#x2013; do I recall precisely what date that occurred on, how that -? No, there's no evidence been adduced to us as exactly what that involved.  But, you know --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I think I read --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, actually, you're also &#x2013; the question is what was ACA thinking? I don't know for sure what they were thinking simply because, as I have described, we've been part of this case, and the only evidence we've been given as to what they were "thinking" is the SEC statements as to what they were thinking, and as to how we influenced that thinking as to what they were thinking you see it in the complaint, so I have no knowledge beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about a more straightforward one.  The risk factors in the prospectus, what I was &#x2013; what I've been seen &#x2013; shown, seem pretty clear of what you're not representing at the time, and they seem from a nonlawyer person like me to cover any misrepresentations.  Because you're not making any representations at the time. So I'm curious to know how that factors in, if any, because like I said, the risk factors seem to say you're not representing anyone's role in this, and there might be nonpublic information, blah, blah blah.  But how much does &#x2013; what kind of role does a prospectus play in a case like this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the case itself is about the offering circular in terms of the risks, and just to back up and not be too legalistic, these investors and these investments what's relevant to the investor is the reference securities.  And although this isn't a registered U.S. offering, there's a particular SEC regulation called AB which specifies the types of information about the securities you have to put into a prospectus of this type.  Because unlike an investment in Ford Motor Company where you put in a description of Ford Motor Company and certain required disclosures, you're mostly just describing the company in a variety of ways.  Here unlike that you're describing and providing to the potential "investor" a list of all the particularized assets that he or she is investing in, in this case since it's a CDO, the financial institution is investing in.</p>
          <p>The reason for the risk factor of which as you can see there are many, we're making no representation other than the fact that, yes, these are the securities that are referenced in the portfolio, because after all, the performance of those securities had nothing to do with anything but the future, i.e., how was the mortgage or housing market going to perform in the future.  So that's the role that we play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last legal one.  Are there other Wells outstanding on this or other issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I'd say about that is our policy has always been to disclose to our investors everything that we consider to be material, and that would include investigations, obviously lawsuits, regulatory matters, anything.  Whether there's a Wells or not a Wells, if we consider it to be material, we go ahead and we disclose it and that's our policy.  To get to your question, we do not disclose every Wells we get simply because that's just not -- that wouldn't make sense.  And therefore we just disclose it if we consider it to be material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously at the K, you didn't think this one was material.  Okay.  David, believe it or not I have a question on the quarter.</p>

          <p>Risk weighted assets up 6%, but your leverage is still way low and your cap ratios are great.  Just curious where those risk weighted asset ratios are showing up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  One of the things we've told you over the course of last year is that we were transitioning from Basel 1 being regulated by the SEC to Basel 1 being regulated by the Fed, and in doing so we had to get some models approved and other items that would change the way risk weighted assets were calculated.  I think that increase in risk weighted assets was largely due to transitioning to the Fed models and we're now fully on all of the Fed models.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Okay.  And the last quickie, did anybody have to approve the buyback even though you have the best capital ratios in bank land?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>I would say it like this Glenn: we don't do anything with our capital without the knowledge and approval of our regulators.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with a question on the quarter, and then we'll transition back to the case.  On the quarter as Glenn noted, the assets grew, the risk weighted assets grew a bit.  But the VaR fell, and I was just curious whether the decline in VaR was some sort a conscious de-risking choice, or is it the result of declining volatility and swapping out a high vol quarter for a lower vol quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a combination of two things that I'd say.  It was lower vol, which definitely reflected it, and then just a continuation of the opportunities there being, you know, high velocity on the balance sheet, off the balance sheet, very liquid stuff.  So it was a combination of those two things which drove the VaR lower.  It was not a conscious decision, just the opportunities that we saw and how it's impacted the VaR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the decision to repurchase some shares, obviously we haven't really seen that much elsewhere in the industry to date with most people saying as you have until now that the uncertainty about the capital regime is such that one prefers to retain capital.  What was the thought process there as you chose to go ahead and repurchase some capital, even though as you made clear, your capital nonetheless grew?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>I think, Glenn (sic) [Guy] , it's just a question of balance.  I think all of those statements you made are still applicable to Goldman Sachs as well.  There's still a lot of uncertainty out there.  We still want to maintain high capital ratios. But even with the buyback, we did grow our equity by over $2 billion, our capital ratios are quite high and remain quite high, and I think we're committed to continuing to maintain very conservative high capital ratios, and we'll make decisions about buybacks within the context of that commitment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I can just follow up on the comp ratio at 43%, I mean obviously given the operating leverage inherent in your business, the very strong top line results, it makes a certain amount of sense.  And yet from a policy perspective, you really never have wavered from the idea of a very high 40s to 50% early in the year ratio, and then you true up as we go on.  So I'd like to explore the thought process there just a little bit more if I might.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say is that our compensation ratio was based on our performance, our competitive positioning, and the external environment.  And any of those could change in the future.  But that's -- that was the balance we struck right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then if I could ask a question or two about the SEC's case.  Greg, you said that you had an $83 million, I guess, principal loss on the retained long position and some other losses that aggregated up to over 100, which is a little bit more than what you had said in the earlier press release, which I think was about 90 million.  What's the difference between the 83 and the total loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Either David or I can do it, but the first point I would just make is I think in our first as you call it release, we talked about it being over 90, so from that perspective --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over 100 is still over 90.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We thought 100 was a round number and that would make it read better.  If David wants to go through the number, he can.  Or I will, I don't <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn (sic) [Guy] , there were several other aspects to the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Guy, but that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Guy, I apologize.  Guy, there were several other aspects of the transaction that included positives like fees and bid/offer spreads, but then there were also collateral securities that we managed on which we lost money and other aspects of the transaction when you added them all up, the net losses to Goldman Sachs were over $100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up to that, is it &#x2013; was the loss &#x2013; was the fact that you had the position essentially that it was an underwriting position that you weren't unable to distribute?  And if that was the case, how routine would it have been in this type of a synthetic mortgage CDO for you to have a holding of that type?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take a hand at that question, just two things.  One on the generality, how often or whatever, I must admit, I've never done a frequency analysis, so I can't tell you for sure, because it's not that relevant to the investor on the other side, the investor on the other side is actually told in the prospectus that in fact we're selling it, and from their perspective, we are the short.  So from their perspective, it's irrelevant.  And the only other point I think I would make here is when the transaction was effectuated, as it were, the final transaction, when the dust settled, we obviously didn't have to do a transaction if we weren't willing to sit there and hold this long position which is what we did.  Now, whether or not we were going to sell it in the future or try to sell it or whatever else, you know all that could be true, but when we did the transaction, we obviously held the position and we kept holding the position.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the call and appreciate Greg joining today as well.  I'll start with one on the complaint.  Are there any client businesses that cannot be conducted in normal course or impaired due to the filing of the SEC complaint or formal enforcement investigation by the FSA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the FSA?  The short answer is I'm not aware of any at all.  We'll stop &#x2013; all firms in our industry are investigated all the time about everything and it doesn't cause anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then second, it's clear that you strongly disagree with the complaint, but how do you think about the timeline and impact of resolution from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, obviously since we were somewhat surprised you might say on Friday morning that this was a filed complaint since no one had told us about it in advance, we've certainly at the early stages of this case, so in terms of resolution, there all's the mechanical things involved in cases which I'm sure you'd like me to speak a long time about, but everyone in this room would probably get bored.  But we have not yet been served.  There's a process in the court where you have to "answer within 20 days once you're served."  Except there are extensions to do that.  So the litigation would play out over time.  Whether it's resolved quickly over time, takes a long time or not, I really couldn't say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then switching over to the business, David, very strong sales and trading results continue.  I guess can you speak qualitatively to where you think we are in that handoff of improving client volumes and normalizing bid-ask spreads?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boy, it's a very tough question, and there's no data to support things.  I would say, bid-offer spreads have tightened somewhat.  They're certainly not as robust as they were early in 2009, but they're still healthy, and there's still very good client activity.  Yet as we've said repeatedly, if GDP growth around the world picks up, we would expect client activity to pick up as well.  So good client activity, but hopefully it will get better and bid-offer spreads tighter than they were but still healthy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know we're just a few weeks into it, but just post the end of the Fed's impact on the mortgage purchase program, what are you hearing in terms of business heads and seeing in terms of client activity as we see the extraction of some of these quantitative easing measures on the core business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the Fed has done a terrific job at that.  One of the things the Fed made very clear is they signaled way in advance what they were going to do, and they signaled and they told the market and they told the market again and they told them again.  And then when the day came that they were going to stop purchasing the mortgage securities, it was hard to find any market participant who didn't know on that day they were going to stop shouldn't be a market participant.  So I think the market was completely ready.  I think there hasn't been much effect because of that.  So I think they're doing a terrific job.  But, it's too early to say two weeks into the quarter what's going to happen this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And then just a clean-up question, David, any &#x2013; what was the impact of DVA and some other smaller puts and takes within this quarter's trading results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was very small.  CVA was about $100 million positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.  One question for Greg.  Just I guess when we look at the SEC process, this is very unusual relative to how they usually operate.  So just trying to understand and Howard was asking about the timeline, but maybe what are the options or what happens?  Meaning is it trial is one stance, or settlement?  I'm just trying to understand more what we should be looking out for over the next three to six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, you've already obviously hit the options.  You go to trial, which is what we're doing, and you always have the option of, if there is an agreeable settlement to both sides settling at any point in time too.  So the timeline as stated before is actually totally unknown at this time.  It will just either take a lot of time, a little time, but we just don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just on the client side, just dealing with these headlines whether it's employees, the management team, you know you had some of the Greece headlines, these headlines, what are you telling the clients, and is there a heightened level of concern, or is it more one-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I would say is we were out talking to our clients.  I think you can see from our results last quarter that our clients still support us.  Our view is our clients will support us as long as we provide very good service to our clients, and that's the key to our success.  It's been the key to our success for a very, very long time.  Our people through the entire financial crisis were out talking to their clients, were out providing service to their clients, were out providing prices and liquidity to their clients and we're still doing that.  And I think that as long as we continue to perform for our clients, they will be happy with us.  And if we stop performing for them, then they won't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just last one, just on some of the regulation or where regulators are focused, it seems like it's a lot down the food chain.  So whether it's derivatives, certain trading areas, on your conversations, with all the regulators, is anyone focused on the underwriting standards or the beginning of these transactions versus what goes on over time?  And then just on the trading side in terms of recent derivative regulation, some firms have pointed out what the potential impact would be from clearing over the counter transactions.  I guess any way to size up how significant derivatives are for you and any potential impact. Clearly we're still early in the process, but any clarity there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, it's very hard to quantify what effect any of the legislation could have because it's very uncertain and how it affects all the different market participants is uncertain.  As far as some of the derivative legislation, we said this before:  We support greater standardization in the derivatives market.  We support the increased use of central clearing houses.  We think it will make the market safer, and frankly given that we're very conservative in our credit terms, we think it will make us more competitive.  And so we're supportive of much of the derivative legislation that is out there.  As far as underwriting standards, look, I think that all of the regulators always are and always have been focused on underwriting standards.  That's one of the most important things in driving a safe and efficient market is having good underwriting standards.  And so I'm not sure there's any new legislation on it, but I think it's a big focus of every regulator and it's a big focus of ours and always has been.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Just one on the case.  How many of your CDO transaction -- I think, the data I have says you had 39 in '06 and 34 in '07.  How many of those has the SEC reviewed and concluded reviews of so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The concept of -- I think as I indicated in my remarks, the SEC, for the past 18 months has been looking generally at the mortgage market, our mortgage deals and with a particular focus on what we're talking about here.  And that's really basically all I can say on it right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Okay.  All right.  Moving on to the business.  David, can you help us maybe a little bit with any particular areas of strength on the client flow side, because most of the indicators that we have looked at as regards to the flows have been mediocre and definitely not 75% up from the fourth quarter, and bid-asks from what we can tell, are pretty much at their tights.  It sounds like you don't agree with that.  So any color you can give there on particular product areas of strength in the flows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what it showed is how broad and deep our client franchise is.  It was strength across every one of the business units, across every one of the regions.  It wasn't dominated by one particular product or one particular trade or one particular region.  It was really just broad strength across our entire franchise.  I think that's what really -- as I said, it was very balanced, and that's really what drove the performance this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you'd say &#x2013; sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question, I guess, following on that is, with the Lincoln legislation, what are your thoughts on -- what's your read on the slots language basically is calling for these businesses to be completely spun out of the dealers or lose access to Fed borrowing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I'd say is I think that derivatives serve an important role in the world's financial markets.  And my guess is they will continue to in some form, and we'll just see how the legislation turns out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Maybe in some other countries.  Okay.  And then lastly on -- so in equities, you said the sequential increase is mostly derivatives.  So I guess fair to say then that derivatives as a percentage of your equities trading revenue is probably at least 50% if not maybe two-thirds of that business now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's why I want to be very careful.  It drove the delta.  It didn't necessarily drive the performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But your delta was $400 million, right, so that would at least get you to a third, and then some portion of the billion in the fourth quarter was derivatives, right?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not the lawyer either, but it seems like a lot of the SEC's case relates to page 12 of the SEC's complaint where they say investors were assured that the parties selecting the portfolio had an alignment of economic interest with investors.  And I guess that relates to two points: one, that Paulson helped to select the portfolio; and, two, Paulson was going short.  So in very simple terms, why would the SEC be wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In very simple terms, the portfolio here was not selected by John Paulson.  The portfolio here was selected by ACA.  ACA had the responsibility to do that.  They were paid to do it.  They did do it, and they were the largest investor in this transaction overwhelmingly.  So they certainly had every incentive to do it.  And as I indicated in the prepared remarks, way more than half the portfolio are things that they suggested and we use the word suggested.  You know, these transactions get suggestions from all sorts of people typically.  So that's why I would say there's nothing to what's in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And at what point does materiality kick in?  If John Paulson had suggested all the securities in the portfolio and ACA selected them all, would that then be material?  I mean, if he selected one and they accepted one, that wouldn't be material.  If he selected all, maybe that would be material.  At what point do you cross that threshold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I make two comments here?  Number one, as you know, I believe, it didn't matter what was selected here.  If you bought in the 2006 vintage, you got crushed when the market collapsed, which no one could predict.  This was just basically taking a view on what was happening in the housing markets.  So it really didn't matter at all.  Secondly, think about the fact that ACA was the economic purchaser of more than 85% of this deal.  So they selected the portfolio, they were paid to select the portfolio, and they invested totally in the portfolio.  So once again, I have to end up with the same conclusion.  We just disagree with the legal theory here as well as the way the facts are characterized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last follow-up on this point, even if morally you're absolutely correct, there's just three parties, everyone knew what was going on, but under the law, perhaps there is a required disclosure, even if ACA knows what's going on, there's a required disclosure in the offering circular to simply say who was involved in the process.  Why is that argument wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you sort of start out with if the law requires it then why is the argument wrong.  We don't believe the law requires it and we certainly don't believe it's material in this context at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then how typical would it be for hedge funds to meet with third parties for selection of securities in a CDO?  How did that market work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, commenting on your description is somewhat challenging.  One point I would make is that the Abacus transaction, as you can see from reading the SEC complaint, seems to stand on its own unique facts including, I'll use the word, allegation that somehow one of our employees misled or &#x2013; and it could be negligently misled ACA into thinking that Paulson was something other than he turned out to be.  So the facts here are incredibly, I would say, narrow in that sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just the last follow-up.  Let's assume everything you did here was legal, for the moment, which I know you believe.  Let's assume this doesn't go away soon.  Why not just work with the SEC?  Why &#x2013; I mean, when you fight city hall, some bad things can happen, so at what point do you say let's just put this behind us.  The SEC has a point of view; we disagree; let's just find some middle ground and settle and disclose more and pay some kind of fee?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I think most of my questions have been answered, but I'd just be interested in, as you read the SEC's complaint, what in your opinion are they trying to extract from Goldman Sachs?  Are they after a punitive damage of some sort?  Assuming the SEC is successful, where will they attempt to go with this in terms of how they deal with Goldman Sachs?  Will it be punitive damages?  Will it be restricting Goldman from some business practices?  Will it be both?  How do you think about your down side risk even though you believe you're right regarding where the SEC is trying to take this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, first of all, I have no idea how the SEC is approaching this, obviously because the case came as somewhat of a surprise.  Secondly, when the SEC may do cases like this, they typically want some type of a fine, and other types of things.  I must say given the nature of the allegations in here which is whether or not an individual affirmatively misled someone about something, that's a pretty narrow set of facts.  We certainly agree that there should be prohibitions from people misleading people, and we would never permit it if we knew about it.  So I don't &#x2013; I have no idea what the SEC would think about or so on or so forth.  So I can't really comment beyond that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on your asset management business.  You had pretty significant outflows this quarter, and the results have been choppy for the last six quarters.  And I know you've had some personnel changes.  Can you comment on that and can you comment on what you're doing to address what looks to be like some disruption of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Meredith, I'd say the results this quarter, the outflows this quarter were basically all in money markets, and that is pretty consistent with I think what we've seen going on around the world.  Basically what's happening is the world is re-risking, so they're taking money out of money markets and putting it elsewhere.  And we don't control all of the dollars, so we didn't keep all of them, but we did have inflows into fixed income which is pretty consistent again with what's been happening in the world. So we don't view that as having been choppy.  The changes that we have made have really had nothing to do with performance.  They had to do with people deciding it was time to retire and move some other people around.  So we're still pretty pleased with how that business is going and the growth we've had over time, and the mix of the assets.  So I think that's all I'd say there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.  A couple questions on the quarter.  This is kind of been touched on, but when it comes to the fixed income trading environment, I mean, we kept hearing how competitors were gone and there was very little competition, only a few people actively committing capital.  With spreads not really coming back in all the way yet, what are you seeing as far as competitors coming back into some of the fixed income businesses?  Are they back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I think you just saw it from the results from our competitors that a bunch of them are certainly more involved in the market than they had been over the last 18 months or so.  But so there's definitely more competition than there was last year, and as I have told you a bunch of times, we expected that was going to happen.  In fact we expected it was going to happen sooner than it did.  But our client franchise and our market share has remained extremely strong.  I think what we have done and being there for our clients throughout has helped us and hopefully will continue to help us, and the breadth and depth, the product portfolio that we offer and our willingness to provide liquidity and make markets for our clients when they need it I think has helped us a lot, so our market share has stayed very strong, but there's definitely more competition there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Covering as many products and geographies as you do, are there specific products where the competition really hasn't come back as much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's pretty much starting to come back in most places.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  You also then on sec lending mentioned the year-over-year change in the composition of securities lending, customer balances and such.  Any changes sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Same thing.  I would say same thing.  You know, it's -- I think people are more nervous to short with harder to borrow securities given how robust the markets have been.  I think that's really what's been driving it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I guess one thing on the case.  At this point, we're talking about a civil -- an SEC civil complaint.  I mean, has there been any conversations with the Department of Justice or anything beyond civil?</p>

          <p>Yes, hi.  The first question is regarding litigation reserves.  Have you taken any reserves regarding this SEC complaints, and what are your outstanding litigation reserves currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take litigation reserves for anything that is estimable and probable as we're supposed to do, and we don't disclose anything for individual cases because that wouldn't be prudent for us to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And in respect to the DoT financial regulatory bill, is it possible to get into a little bit more quantification considering the bill is now relatively detailed both in respect to the Volcker rule, the end user clearing, and the trading on the ASEF platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually find it very difficult to quantify exactly what the effects would be, because it's very hard to know how the markets would unfold, very hard to know how competitive positioning would unfold.  You know, we continue -- as we have said many times, we stated our support for the efforts of the administration and Congress for reform that improves the safety and soundness of the financial system.  We think it would be very important for any reform to move forward on a global basis, not to be fragmented in different places in the world, but very hard to quantify.  We think that as long as regulation is consistent around the world and for all competitors, we'll do just fine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>All right.  And regarding the Basel consultation paper for Basel 3, I assume you have replied to the consultation paper at this point.  And I was wondering, what are the key issues that you would like to see changed in Basel 3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have responded to the qualitative comments because that's what was due last week.  The quantitative impact isn't due until the end of the month, so that's not done yet.  And without getting into specifics, we just want to make sure that the regulators in Basel who are looking to make the system safer which we support don't go too far and do things that will stifle growth and stifle lending. We want to make sure that those unintended consequences don't happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there any specific issues, leverage, where you can, derivatives, minority, all these kind of things, are there issues that you see should really be changed that are high on your list?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to get into specifics of our comments here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And lastly on FICC revenues, I remember a while ago you said you have a very high market share in FICC revenues, and although you expect the tide to be relatively big, continue to be very big, your continued size of the pie could shrink.  But if I look at these revenues, I don't see that.  So can you explain in what areas you had significant performance and what business segments of FICC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually think I said the opposite.  I said that if you think about what ought to happen when our market shares were so high last year is that if you think of what should happen, as the world got better and competitors got healthier, that they would come into the market, and so our market shares would probably decrease.  But that that ought to be timed with the &#x2013; as the world's getting better with greater activity levels, and therefore the pie increasing.  So my expectation was that our market share would decrease and the pie would increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's what I meant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but it was pretty certain that those things would not happen at exactly the same time.  So that was kind of the backdrop.  As far as specific areas where you asked about, I think one of the things I mentioned was it was not a specific area that drove FICC.  It was very good performance across all of the products really.  That's what drove it.  You know, good balance both by product mix and globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thanks, David.  Most of my questions on the lawsuit have been answered, but a couple of questions on the quarter.  You mentioned that the backlog this quarter was flat from the prior quarter.  That sounds a little bit less strong than we have heard from some of your competitors.  Can you put some color around where there might be strength or weakness within that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know, I think that you always have to be a little careful of backlog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because as you know, a lot of deals -- certainly financing deals will quite often get done that don't get into the backlog at all, and I would say the mix shifted a little bit, and so you probably had a small increase in advisory backlog, a small decrease in the debt underwriting backlog.  But I wouldn't read that much into it.  Directionally, it's usually pretty good, but absolutely it's not.  And we're still seeing reasonably good dialogue, and I think if the world continues to improve, the economic world continues to improve, I think we'll see more activity.  And if it doesn't, then we won't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question on you mentioned in terms of FICC that the geographic breakdown was pretty solid.  Would you make the same -- would you characterize the equity performance as basically being the same internationally versus the U.S., or are there pockets of strength within the equities business geographically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is really across the firm, pretty consistent with what we have seen, but again it's always hard to measure because we're a global business.  But a little bit over 50% of our revenue is in the U.S., a little bit under outside the U.S., and I think that mix will probably shift in the other direction.  And, you know, outside the U.S. probably two-thirds or so, Europe, and one-third Asia.  That's pretty much where it's from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one regulatory question, you mentioned in the fourth quarter conference call that Goldman had no intention of changing its charters in terms of having a bank charter.  Can you confirm that that's still the case?  And I guess more to the point, with all the pending regulation, in your view, would it even matter if you were a bank or not a bank?  Wouldn't the regulation basically apply to you regardless of your status?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's one of -- I think I mentioned that.  We have no intention to change anything as we sit here now, and I think it is, at least from what we see, it is pretty clear that in the regulation where they're going to have firms deemed to be systemically important firms, that we will be one and that we're going to be covered by those same regulations.  And so I don't expect anything different than that.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from David Trone with Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'll switch to the handset.  I am still not a hundred percent clear on something.  The synthetic needed a short; presumably ACA knew that construct.  Did they know that Paulson was that side of the trade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no idea what ACA knew.  I read what I read in the complaint, and I read what they say was caused by us negligently or otherwise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So because it strikes me that if there's a synthetic and if ACA was as experienced as you say, they must have known that there was a short.  So then it comes to the question of when Paulson was making recommendations, did they, A, solely think that they were long?  B, did they think that they were the short side of the trade?  Or, C, did they think they were going to be the short and maybe hedge it with the equity tranche?  I guess that's really the crux of the matter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think probably a pretty good job of coming up with the variations.  I have no idea.  So I really can't help you out there.  As I said somewhere in the prepared remarks, this all seems to be as I said at root about whether or not someone intentionally misled someone, and as I have also said, that's something we certainly wouldn't approve of or sanction.  But, again, beyond that I have no idea and I can't really speculate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean you as a person or Goldman Sachs itself has no idea?  Because you were the -- you kind of were the broker, right, you kind of brought the parties together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Me as a person?  I'm speaking on behalf of Goldman Sachs right now, so what I'm saying is --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so how could you not know -- you were the broker.  You brought the parties together.  So --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the facts as we know them, the view is that we have no basis for knowing why ACA concluded what it concluded.  The SEC obviously alleges that there was a negligent or whatever intentional, there are all sorts of alternatives to this, it's a very technical document, by an employee of ours, and it cites these e-mails, which are sitting in here in the complaint for that proposition.  I think if you read the complaint, it certainly provides no basis for a representation by us or anything else.  But again, we're at the beginning of this litigation, and as I said at the beginning, our view of the facts is different from the SEC's view of the facts, and the case will proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask you customarily forgetting about this transaction, but just generally, in a synthetic where there has to be a long and a short, wouldn't it be totally legitimate for the short side of the trade to negotiate with the long side of the trade what they were going to include?  Kind of no different than if I'm going to bet on a basketball game with a friend, he and I have to negotiate the spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd agree with you entirely.  And because if you think about it, you can't do a synthetic trade unless both sides are amenable to whatever you're talking about.  And whether or not -- whether or not a financial institution such as ourselves who sits in the middle of the market and tries to bring people together, talks to both sides all the time, then comes up with the construct iteratively going back and forth or otherwise, of course that's the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then last question, if it was synthetic and didn't need the equity tranche and the full capital structure, I'm not a hundred percent clear on why Goldman had a position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our position wasn't in the equity tranche.  Our position was a slice of the super senior.  We had a slice there which is similar to the same slice that ACA would have had on the swap that they did using ABN AMRO as the credit provider in the middle, okay, it was a protector in the middle.  So it was part of the super senior.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And but why -- but why did you take that?  You didn't have to, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we didn't have to take that position, and obviously I've been asked the question, wouldn't you have wanted to redistribute it or whatever else?  Which is somewhat irrelevant to the proposition that when we closed the transaction, we took on the position.  And if you look at proposed regulatory changes which David alluded to, this concept of having skin in the game, the 5% rule or whatever is talked about, if some of that gets adopted in some way, you could say this part of that underwriting we had skin in the game, we held the position.  Whether or not we decided to distribute it or wanted to distribute it a month later is somewhat quite irrelevant, because we didn't have to do the transaction.  If we weren't willing to take on the risk, we wouldn't have taken on the risk.  If we believed there was something wrong with this transaction, we obviously wouldn't have put our skin in the game in that way as it were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take that a step further.  Could the transaction have been consummated without you taking a position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no idea.  You'd have to have a different transaction.  Because right now you have to have a long and a short, correct, and therefore --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but you already had them without you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we didn't have matching positions.  So we don't know if it could have been consummated without us or not because it wasn't consummated without us.  But we don't know if it could have been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so in essence, so it sounds like you needed to take the position to make it happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We took a position and the deal got done.  Hard to say what would have happened if we didn't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay.  And then lastly, did you hedge that position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason you see the loss that's been described is because we held the long position and it deteriorated in value substantially as did all the securities in this market, or interest in this, and that's why we have the loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  So when you're giving us that number, you're not just giving us a gross, you're giving us the -- ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the net loss to the firm.  That's our so-called P&amp;L on that I'll call mostly L on that transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Just checking.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate your answers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Ron Mandell with GIC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there's one aspect of the legal issue I'm not sure I completely understand, and that is as you say, ACA involved ABN AMRO in the deal, and so it's not clear to me that ACA ever had or when the deal closed that ACA had that significant an economic interest in the deal.  So I was wondering if you could elaborate on that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They had the full economic interest in how the deal performed.  ABN AMRO's only role was in essence to stand between ACA and us simply because it was a credit question, meaning -- and a collateral posting question.  ABN AMRO was willing to take on the possibility that ACA would have financial difficulties have nothing to do with this particular transaction whether it went up or down.  They were there basically I'll call it as a credit protector, so we faced ABN AMRO with a mirror to the same type of swap arrangements going over to ACA.  And as the deal fluctuated in economic value, ABN AMRO really had no care or interest in that.  Ultimately the only real question was at the end of the day, would there be any kind of overall credit problem with ACA because of its total business and whatever else they happen to be doing?  But ABN AMRO was there for that reason.  And as you know, all the major financial -- I should never say all.  But financial institutions like ABN AMRO or like Goldman Sachs, we were willing to post collateral one way or the other depending on how the positions are moving between each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so in the end, ABN AMRO did suffer a loss from this deal because ACA had losses overall not just on this deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Entirely correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I actually do have a business question, and that is in regard to the asset management business, you mentioned the outflows in the money market funds.  But the equity flows have been weak, were slightly negative this quarter and haven't been that strong in the past, in the recent past whereas they had been more robust earlier.  Is there a bigger story there that you would kind of elaborate on David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ron, again I would say that's pretty consistent with industry trends as well.  If you look at what happened really through the course of 2009 in the asset management world, you saw &#x2013; forget about Goldman Sachs, as I said in the industry you saw outflows in money markets and inflows into fixed income funds and very, very little.  In fact I think gross in the industry, I may be off a little, there were still outflows in equities although it was pretty close to flat.  And it's really only recently that you have started to see small inflows into equity funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're happy with your performance in the funds and there's no issue in that regard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're never happy with our performance.  We always think it can be better, and so we're always striving to make it better in asset management as well, but we think relatively we're doing okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay good.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And your final question comes from Richard Staite with Atlantic Equities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to the compensation ratio, you said it was 43% reflecting the strength of your business and the current environment.  And so if for the remainder of the year, revenues remain strong and the environment doesn't change, should we be looking at 43% for the next three quarters and then a dip into the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I would say is I mentioned three factors: our performance, the competitive environment, and the external environment.  And I think the only thing I can be sure of is that all three won't stay exactly the same as they are today.  And so we're just going to have to see how that unfolds, and that will be the basis of us deciding what compensation should be as we go through the course of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And how should we think about the U.K. bonus tax in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The U.K. bonus tax is not considered in those numbers.  The U.K. bonus tax we view as a separate one-time item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Okay.  And just a very separate question.  In terms of your overall revenues, could you give some guidance around how much is generated from governments as a client?  The obvious question being if certain governments decide they didn't want to deal with you anymore, would that have much of an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, as you know, I've been asked this question many times before.  It's a very, very hard question to answer because we have a very integrated sales and trading model.  But the very, very vast majority, in fact almost all of what we do, starts with our clients and starts with trades that our clients want to do and that we're providing some type of service or liquidity for our clients.  There is, you know, small walled-off proprietary business like GSPS which we've talked about, but the great majority of what we do is client -- is based on our client franchise.</p>
