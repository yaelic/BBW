        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for joining us today.  Last week we reported our third quarter revenue, profit, earnings per share and free cash flow results.  At that time we also reaffirmed our full year guidance.  Today I want to take you through the details behind the results.</p>
          <p>This is a tough environment, but we were ready for it.  We were executing a play that we called some time ago.  It has two major elements.  First, we've been investing to capture opportunities in the emerging markets.  You can see the benefit in our results again this quarter with double-digit revenue growth and good return.  Second, in the more established markets, our goal has been to drive productivity.  We've been systematically attacking our spending base, taking out infrastructure costs, reducing our cost and expense levels and improving our efficiency.  Because of these actions, we have a more efficient structure.</p>
          <p>So in the third quarter, when the revenue growth in the major markets slowed, we had great margin performance and hit our profit objectives.  These ongoing actions to address spending shore up the base in tough times, but they also improve our balance point over the long run.</p>
          <p>Our focus on continuous improvement is an element of our model and an important driver of our 2010 earnings per share roadmap.  Now there's another important aspect of our model and that's the balance between annuity and transaction type businesses.  We have a number of annuity businesses, like outsourcing, maintenance and the majority of software that only provide a good revenue foundation but also provide a steady source of profit and cash.  We've been building these businesses and their recurring revenue stream for years.  They're part of our DNA and they provide a sustained advantage in today's environment.</p>
          <p>So, our annuity base together with our ongoing in our structural changes in the business resulted in solid profit performance in the quarter.  We've been focused on this for some time and it was clearly the right game plan for the third quarter.  We'll continue this same operational plan in the fourth quarter and into 2009 as we focus on delivering solid profit and cash.</p>
          <p>For the year, we expect earnings per share of at least 8.75, which is up 22% over last year and while the current environment is challenging we have the right operational plan to drive double-digit revenue growth in emerging markets, substantial productivity in the major markets and continue to extract cost and expense from our spending base and drive ongoing improvements to meet our full year objectives.</p>
          <p>So now let's get into the third quarter performance starting with the financial summary.  Our revenue was 25.3 billion, up 5% as reported and 2% at constant currency.  We had outstanding margin performance.  Gross margin expanded two points, led by services and software.  Together with focused expense management we grew pre-tax income 19% over last year and PTI margin expanded 1.8 points and with a 0.5 point improvement in our tax rate net income grew 20% and margin expanded to over 11%.  Bottom line we delivered $2.05 of earnings per share, up 22% year-to-year.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet and capital structure are also on very solid ground.  We finished the quarter with almost $10 billion in cash on hand and we demonstrated strong access to the debt markets by raising an additional 4 billion last week.  Our liquidity position is also very strong.  I'll address cash, balance sheet, and liquidity later in the webcast.</p>
          <p>Let's get into the details of the quarter with a few different views of revenue.  I'll start with the geographic view.  Our total geographic revenue was up 6% as reported, 3% at constant currency.  Europe had the strongest performance, up 4% at constant currency while Americas was up 2% and Asia Pacific up 1%.  I'll discuss these results through the lens of our major market and growth market organizations.</p>
          <p>In the more established markets that we address through our major markets organization, we are uniquely positioned to assist enterprise clients with high value transformational projects as they retool for efficiency and cost savings.  Our model in these markets is based on delivering high value solutions and driving productivity.  This quarter major markets grew 5% as reported and 1% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you a sense of how some of the larger countries performed at constant currency.  Of the G7, Canada had the fastest growth for the second consecutive quarter with 6% growth.  The UK grew 3% while Italy, Germany and France, each grew 2%.  The U.S. grew 1% and Japan declined.  Now in the emerging markets, we've been investing heavily to capture opportunities to build out public and private infrastructures.</p>
          <p>Our Growth Markets organization grew 13% as reported and 10% at constant currency, representing 19% of IBM's geographic revenue in the quarter.  The BRIC countries, a subset of our Growth Markets, grew 19% as reported and 12% at constant currency with strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia and India.  However, our results in China slowed to 3% growth, down 4% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>The Olympics were a tremendous success for China.  However, we do believe the focus caused a delay in IT spending decisions and we did not fully anticipate the breadth and duration of this delay.  We believe that the fundamental growth opportunity in China continues to be compelling and we are continuing to invest in capabilities to capture the growth.  I should note that the Growth Markets organization excluding China grew over 12% at constant currency, in line with the first half growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to another perspective on revenue, the business from our industry sales units was up 6% or 3% at constant currency.  I'll comment on few of the sectors.  We have strength in the public sector driven by government and healthcare industries.  Healthcare growth accelerated this quarter as clients continue to look for more cost effective business models.</p>
          <p>In government, we had good growth in both major and growth markets.  In the U.S. our government business grew 7%.  In our growth markets, revenue grew 33% as the governments in these countries use technology for national development.  Lagging overall performance was the industrial sector as concerns with the credit markets and margin pressures impacted near term spending decisions.</p>
          <p>Worldwide financial services results were roughly in line with our total sector performance for the fourth consecutive quarter.  I'll remind you that about 50% of our financial services revenue is in annuity businesses.  The U.S. revenue was down 1%, slightly better than our second quarter performance.  However, outside the U.S. where we generate over 75% of our business, revenue was up 10% or 4% at constant currency.  Globally, we had growth in banking and insurance, but financial markets revenue was down at constant currency.</p>
          <p>There have been some comments recently about closings and consolidations in the financial services sector; I'd like to address those comments now.  Earlier this month the New York Times using Bloomberg data published a timeline of buyout and take-over activities of major financial institutions in the U.S. and Europe since the middle of last year.  There were 21 companies in total, you can see the names here and we have included the original exhibit from the article in our supplemental charts.</p>
          <p>The amount of revenue IBM generates from these institutions is only about 1% of IBM's total revenue and about the same portion of our outstanding receivables.  So this should give you some perspective on the amount of business we do with these firms as it compares to IBM's total business.</p>
          <p>So now let's look at our revenue by segment.  From a segment perspective, software had the best growth rate, leveraging a solid annuity base as well as acquisitions.  Services revenue continued to be driven by good short-term signings performance.  Systems and Technology was most impacted by a slowdown in transactions at the end of the quarter, but we had strong demand for high end systems as customers look to optimize their infrastructures through virtualization and consolidation.</p>
          <p>In global financing, financing revenue was up 6%, though this was more than offset by a decline in the sales of used equipment.  I'll come back to our financing business a little later.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to expense.  Total expense and other income was up 6%; approximately 4 points of growth was due to currency and we estimate that 5 points of growth was from acquisitions driven primarily by Cognos and Telelogic.  So operational expense actually improved by 4 points year-to-year.  Underneath this we are executing our investment strategy and allocating our spending to areas where we see the best opportunity.</p>
          <p>In our growth markets, where we are investing to capture the fast growing opportunity, SG&amp;A excluding currency and acquisitions was up 15% while in the rest of the world it improved 4% year-to-year, reflecting our focus to drive productivity in our major markets organization.  Our emphasis is not just on expense but on our entire spending base and you see the benefit of these operational actions in our margin.</p>
          <p>Let me give you an example of the type of things we are working on.  We spend over 15% of our $90 billion spend base on what we call global support functions.  Think of it as back office functions like finance, human resources, and sales support.  Our objective is to drive 5% savings annually.  We are well on our way to achieving our 2008 target, having reduced our spending by 4% through the first three quarters and by the end of this year we will have reduced our spending by 1.4 billion since the end of 2006.  We are continuing the same approach to improve our spending structure and drive efficiency into the fourth quarter and 2009.</p>
          <p>Before I show our margins by segment, I want to comment on the items that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter.  First, we took additional specific reserves against our accounts receivable balance; reflecting the current economic environment in many industries.  This contributing to a year-to-year increase in A/R provisions of about 125 million and increased our reserves coverage on accounts receivable to 2%, up 50 basis points from a year ago and up 30 basis points from June.</p>
          <p>Second, retirement related plans generated about 380 million of costs and expense in the quarter for a savings of about 275 million year-to-year.  For the full year, retirement related cost is expected to be 1.5 billion, which is 1.1 billion better than 2007.  This includes the termination of the Career Choice retirement plan in Japan in the fourth quarter.  That will result in a one time benefit in retirement related costs of approximately 100 million.  This will be largely offset by fourth quarter workforce actions in Japan designed to improve Japan's structural competitiveness.</p>
          <p>Now, before getting into the segments, I will quickly show you our margin performance by segment.  You can see that we had good margin performance in both services segments and in Software.  Despite a benefit from mix, hardware margins were down, due primarily to the performance of our industry standard servers.  Overall, gross margin was up two points and pre-tax margins up 1.8 points.  This is driven by our ongoing cost and expense initiatives.</p>
          <p>I just talked about one to address expense.  Let me mention another to drive our more efficient cost structure.  GTS [Global Technology Services] service delivery contributes over 1 billion of annual productivity savings by shifting resources to global delivery centers, improving our processes and improving our tools, all designed for more efficient support to our clients.  You can see the benefit to its services margins.  GTS was better by over two points year-to-year.</p>
          <p>So now I'll move on to a broader discussion of our services segments.  Our two global services segments leveraged their very strong margin performance to drive strong profit growth this quarter.  Together pre-tax profit was up 23% on revenue growth of 8% as reported and 4% at constant currency.  This was the highest level of services pre-tax margin in six years.  It's especially important given that we did it in the seasonally challenging third quarter.</p>
          <p>Signings were 12.7 billion at actual rates, down 4% while at constant currency signings were 11.1 billion, down 5% year-to-year.  Overall, short-term signings were up 13% at actual rates and up 8% at constant currency.  Short-term signings are up in both the growth markets and the major markets.  Long-term signings were down 16% at actual rates and down 15% at constant currency, coming off very strong performance last year.  But we had good long-term signing performance in the growth markets, up almost 60%.  We signed nine deals larger than 100 million and our backlog was an estimated $114 billion.</p>
          <p>So let me tell you what we are seeing in the marketplace.  There are a lot of enterprises dealing with the tough environment; looking for ways to reduce cost, conserve capital and in some cases just to survive.  So, there is a lot of good services opportunity out there but frankly there are also many deals that have very unattractive economics and while these may be interesting to some of our competitors they are not to us.</p>
          <p>It's not hard to drive revenue in a services business on a weak book of business.  But we built a strong and profitable business and we're not going to put that at risk just to show a higher level of signings.  I think the most impressive aspect of the business this quarter was the margin expansion and profit growth.  This is a function of the quality of our portfolio of contracts and our ongoing programs to drive operational efficiencies and structural changes to our cost base.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years we've talked quiet a bit about the changes we're making to our delivery structure in services.  We've built a delivery platform that takes advantage of the best skills and costs globally.  It's a platform that maximizes flexibility, enabling us to put our people where the work is.  The end result is higher utilization and the ability to get optimal pricing while continuing to deliver value to our clients.  These changes have contributed to our recent profit performance but more importantly we will continue to drive structural changes that will result in a more efficient delivery cost base by focusing on ongoing process efficiency and productivity.</p>
          <p>So, now I'll go through a few specifics on the segment results.  For Global Technology Services revenue was up 8% and 5% of constant currency.  Short-term signings were up 19% at actual rates, while long-term signings were down 17%.  Our strategic outsourcing revenue was up 8%.  We had very strong performance in the growth markets, up 21%.  However, growth in the major markets moderated as we wrapped on a number of large contracts and we were impacted by the lower level of long-term signings over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 11%, signings were up a very strong 19% as the momentum in our ITS key infrastructure plays continues.  We had signings growth in all geographies and all sectors.</p>
          <p>Our Global Technology Services pre-tax profit was up 16% and margin was 11.6%, up eight-tenths of a point year-to-year.  This margin expansion was driven by improved cost structure, a mix of higher offerings in ITS and year-to-year savings in retirement-related costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 7% as reported and 3% at constant currency.  Our revenue growth was impacted by year-to-year declines in two countries.  Japan and Australia combined were down 13% at constant currency.  The rest of Global Business Services was up 8% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>Short-term signings were up 10% at actual rates.  Signings were up in Europe and Asia but down in the Americas.  Long-term signings were down 16% at actual rates.  In the third quarter last year, long-term signings for GBS were up more than 85% year-to-year at actual rates.  So, it was a very tough compare.</p>
          <p>Global Business Services delivered a record level of profit.  Pre-tax profit was up 39% and margin expanded 3.3 points to 14%, their best ever.  About two points of this improvement was driven by better utilization, pricing, and cost and expense management, with the remainder coming from lower retirement-related cost.</p>
          <p>Turning to Systems and Technology, revenue of 4.4 billion was down 10% year-to-year or 11% at constant currency.  We continued to see strong performance in our high-end systems.  Customer demand for virtualization and consolidation drove double-digit revenue growth in System z and high-end System p.  However, this was more than offset by declines in our low end products and in storage.</p>
          <p>Building on the momentum established in the first half of the year System z had another quarter of solid performance.  MIPS grew 49% and revenue was up 25% with double-digit growth in all geographies.  System z continues to sell very well even in a tough environment thanks to its ability to consolidate the workloads done by many different servers onto a single virtualized platform.</p>
          <p>Specialty MIPS grew 120% as customers exploit the capabilities of System z to bring new Linux and Java applications to this highly efficient and cost effective platform.  We are also seeing customers in emerging countries leveraging this platform's stability and efficiency.  For example, the Philippine Savings Bank consolidated seven online transaction processing applications spread across multiple servers to just one Linux partition resulting in better productivity and energy savings.  System z performance reflects a strong value statement in this environment and good sales execution and we believe we gained market share.  Converged System p was up 7% reflecting strong demand for IBM's virtualization technology and energy saving capabilities.  This is the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, again gaining share and extending its market leadership position.  High end servers were up 19% year-to-year and mid range servers were up 21%.</p>
          <p>Legacy System i revenue declined about 80% year-to-year as we continued to transition our customer base to the converged POWER platform.  This is a very small piece of our portfolio reflecting prior generation technology.</p>
          <p>System x server revenue declined 18% year-to-year and blades were down 8%.  This quarter's weakness was driven by sales execution issues, a very competitive pricing environment and a continuation of the slowdown in the x86 market.  We expect to see improvement in the first quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>Our storage revenue declined 3% year-to-year after a first half of strong growth.  Disk grew 1% and our high-end DS8000 increased 2% driven by our strong System z performance.  Tape declined 11% as customers decided to purchase additional media to expand the utilization of their existing devices rather than commit to new capital.  Gross profit margin in Systems and Technology was down 2.4 points year-to-year driven primarily by industry standard servers.</p>
          <p>Software revenue of 5.2 billion grew 12% year-to-year, 8% at constant currency.  Branded middleware grew 15% year-to-year to 2.8 billion and in the quarter comprised 54% of our total software segment revenue.  Customer demand continues to be focused on software products that generate short-term return and improve operational efficiency, for instance, our virtualization technology which is in both our operating systems and Tivoli storage products, sold well in the third quarter.  This software helps customers improve utilization and significantly lower data center costs.</p>
          <p>Information management grew 26% year-to-year as we had strong demand for our relational database products.  Our Cognos acquisition was a key driver of the 26% year-to-year growth in our information management brand.  Lotus grew 10% in the quarter capping its sixteenth consecutive quarter of growth.  Customers are investing to improve their workforce efficiency and drive effective global teaming.  Lotus Notes growth continued and our advanced collaboration technologies had a terrific quarter.</p>
          <p>Rational software grew 23% year-to-year, fueled by our Telelogic acquisition.  With the addition of Telelogic only Rational can provide a common framework for software and systems delivery across a client's business.</p>
          <p>Growth in WebSphere and Tivoli was impacted by the slowing growth in the United States and Europe.  However, both brands enjoyed strong growth in Asia.  The annuity nature of our software business provides a predictable and growing stream of profit and cash for IBM.  The software segment pre-tax income grew 19% year-to-year to 1.5 billion even after absorbing acquisition related items and PTI margin expanded 1.5 points to 25.9%.</p>
          <p>Turning to IBM's cash performance, we generated 2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which was down 500 million from last year's third quarter but we were up 1.3 billion year-to-date.  The decline in the current period was primarily driven by our working capital, in particular our inventory levels increased due to our hardware performance.  That said our collections performance was excellent.  DSO improved three days year-to-year and resulted in the best third quarter DSO level in eight years and our collections remained strong throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Through the first three quarters our free cash flow was $6.4 billion.  As I said this was up 1.3 billion year-to-year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the uses for the year, we have invested 6 billion in acquisitions.  We have also returned 11.8 billion to shareholders.  We bought back over 83 million share for 9.8 billion including 2.7 billion this quarter.  And at the end of September we had 6.3 billion remaining from our last Board authorization.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with almost 10 billion of cash, flat to June.  With liquidity such an important topic, let me spend a minute on IBM's liquidity position.  At the end of September we had $4.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding.  This is down from 5.8 billion at the end of last year.  Our experience in the CP market has been consistent over time.  We continue to access the same one to three month tenors and our pricing remains well under LIBOR.  We have not experienced any problems at all accessing the commercial paper market.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have a $10 billion credit facility available as backup liquidity.  And last week we raised 4 billion of term financing which adds to our already significant flexibility.  We could eliminate our reliance on the CP market if we chose to.  But as I mentioned, our experience has been positive and furthermore, we would expect to have access to the federal program.  We could use this to reduce term debt maturities in the fourth quarter and next year.  So some of this could be pre-funding for those maturities but in the end the recent financing simply increases our flexibility.  So we have a very strong liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Our non-financing debt was 9.9 billion and debt to cap was 29%.  We continue to run our Global Financing business at an appropriate 7.1 to 1 leverage.  Let me spend a minute on our Global Financing business.</p>
          <p>In light of recent turmoil in the financial markets, I thought it appropriate to revisit some of the key dynamics of this business.  First of all, I think it's important to understand the mission of this business is to generate a strong return on equity and to facilitate enterprise client's acquisition of IBM hardware, software and services.</p>
          <p>Let me put our financing business in the context of overall IBM.  Global Financing's revenue in the quarter was about 600 million or 2.5% of IBM.  The segment pre-tax income was almost 350 million about 9% of IBM's pre-tax income.  And Global Financing's external receivables were over $24 billion about 21% of IBM's total asset base.  97% of the portfolio is in a core competency of technology financing so there is nothing exotic in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, we have rock solid book of business and very creditworthy customer base.  About 60% of the portfolio is with investment grade clients with no exposure to consumers or mortgage lending.</p>
          <p>Looking at the reserve coverage on that client base, we took it up to 1.8%.  That's an increase of 40 basis points since last year.  Of that the rate of identifiable losses increased from 1.1% to 1.3% and our rate of anticipated losses increased from 0.3% to 0.5%.  Now, we closely monitor the credit of our clients and adjust as needed.</p>
          <p>It's important to remember that the majority of the assets we are talking about are in support of critical IT operations and have substantial value.  Our leases are non-cancelable and we are financially protected in the event of a merger or acquisition.  The assets we finance are critical to major financial institutions.  In the event of bankruptcy, leases are often reaffirmed by the bankruptcy court sustaining our expected lease payments.  If necessary, the financed assets can be recovered and resold through our highly refined marketing operations which extract significant value in the event we have to repossess the equipment.  So, we have the ability to manage our risks.</p>
          <p>Let me put this in the context of recent events.  If you take those same 21 financial institutions that I referenced during the sector discussion, IGF had exposure to ten of them and we have not been adversely impacted at all.  Overall, this is a very solid business and gives us a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Now, let me start to wrap up with a discussion with the drivers of our 22% earnings per share growth.  We had revenue growth of 5% including 3 points of currency benefit.  At constant mix and margin this 5% revenue growth contributed $0.08 of year-to-year EPS growth but by far the biggest driver of our earnings growth was gross margin expansion led by services and software.</p>
          <p>Gross margin improvement contributed 27 of the $0.37 of EPS growth in the quarter.  Of that about $0.09 was due to the year-to-year benefit from our retirement related plans that flowed to cost.  Our expense growth impacted EPS by $0.03.  So as I mentioned earlier, our operational expense, that is without currency and acquisitions, was better year-to-year.  Our $0.04 contribution from share repurchase was less than we've seen in the last few quarters as we wrapped around on the benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase and finally a 50 basis point year-to-year reduction in our tax rate yielded the last penny.</p>
          <p>When you look at this chart it's obvious that the growth came from margin expansion, the result of an ongoing focus on increasing operational efficiencies and good tactical cost and expense management.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, I want to address one other item that is embedded in the EPS bridge above and that's currency.  We report the top line impact from currency each quarter and we provide an estimate of future quarters based on current spot rates.  Typically there is not much movement in currency rates over the course of the quarter.  We've seen this in the last six quarters.  But in the third quarter we saw a significant strengthening of the dollar.  And rather than the 6 to 7 point benefit to revenue growth that we would have expected, currency added only 3 points of year-to-year growth.  The difference was $800 million.  At current spot rates, currency will shift from a tailwind to a headwind.  So in the fourth quarter, as compared to the 3 point benefit to revenue growth we had in the third quarter, at current spot rates we could have a 4 point hurt to revenue growth from currency in the fourth.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of currency impact on EPS, we can't precisely determine the currency contribution to the bottom line, because we don't know how much of the currency impact was passed on to our customers in price, or how it affected our sourcing decisions.  In the third quarter, we estimate the currency net of the hedging activity was not more than about 20% of our total EPS growth.  But in our experience, pricing and sourcing actions reduce this.  So you can think of this as a hypothetical upper limit.</p>
          <p>Now let me wrap up.  This is a tough market but we have a lot of things going for us in this environment.  We have a very strong liquidity position.  We have 4.5 billion of commercial paper with continued access to market at sub-LIBOR pricing and 1 to 3 month maturity, just as we've always done.  We've had absolutely no problems at all with access to the market.</p>
          <p>Now let me re-assure you we are not reliant on CP.  We ended the quarter with nearly 10 billion in cash.  And we maintain a $10 billion back-up credit facility.  So that's $20 billion that we could access at any time.  So if we wanted to exit the CP market because of some macro event, we certainly could.  And last week we demonstrated substantial access to the term debt markets by raising an additional 4 billion of cash across 5, 10 and 30 year maturities.  We think it's smart to go long in this environment if you can.  So with our cash balance now enhanced by our recent term debt issuance and our backup credit facility, it is clear we are not reliant on the short-term commercial paper markets for funding our business.</p>
          <p>To continue to build our balance sheet, we have a business model that is designed to deliver profit and cash.  An important element of that model is our disciplined approach to aligning investments to growth.  So, just as we aggressively invest in high growth markets, we're driving productivity from the more established markets.</p>
          <p>We've been managing the major markets to deliver productivity for some time.  We've made a lot of progress in our initiatives but still have a lot of opportunity to continue to improve our balance point.</p>
          <p>Earlier I gave you a few examples of actions we've been taking to optimize our spending profile.  Let me give you a flavor of what we are working on going forward.  In Global Technology Services service delivery we will continue to generate $1 billion annually in productivity.  In addition, we have aggressive plans in place to accelerate our shift of resources to global delivery centers.  In 2009, we plan to increase our global delivery center population by 25%.</p>
          <p>Within our supply chain function, we expect to reduce spending by another 3 billion to 4 billion in 2009.  This is consistent with what we've done in the past.  Now some of this goes to price and some goes to offsetting the increased labor cost, so not all goes to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a couple of specific initiatives we're working on.  Product design teams will reduce supply chain costs by eliminating redundant components and substituting lower cost alternatives.  Our procurement team is consolidating the number of suppliers to leverage our spending and working closely with these suppliers to improve cost and eliminate waste.  This work combined with our investments in decision support tools and improved processes to enable us to optimize our worldwide supplier base, have already identified over 300 million in future savings.</p>
          <p>Now in our Global Support functions, we will continue to expect 5% annual reductions.  I have mentioned in the past that within my function, finance, more than 40% of the function is located in Centers of Excellence both in the U.S. and around the world.  Our goal is to improve this to 50% by 2010 and other functions are making similar shifts.  By 2010, our IT function will increase the number of people in Centers of Excellence by 17%, HR will increase 9% and our sales support function will increase 16%.  All of this drives better productivity and efficiency with our functions while enabling us to reach our cost objectives.</p>
          <p>These initiatives are useful in getting you through tough times.  This quarter they helped us deliver two points of gross margin improvement and four points of operational expense improvement.  In other words, they paid off at the bottom line.  And they have another benefit.  They ultimately improve our balance point, so that when the market turns, we'll get better leverage off a leaner cost base.  Overall, we feel confident in our ability to deliver at least 8.75 of earnings per share for the full year 2008.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.  You may ask your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Just a follow up to that, Mark; if I think about it the other way it's obviously a very turbulent market environment and there still is about half your business that is transactional.  So the question therefore is, what kind of IT spending environment would we need to see for you not to be able to hit your full year guidance?  So, if your revenues were down 5% year-over-year assuming current currency levels and IT spending was also down, would you still feel confident in your ability to hit that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know Toni; it's an interesting way to phrase the question because I am sure there is always an environment that could prove quite challenging to us as we enter it.  So, once again I'll just go down the elements. I mean this quarter we delivered strong profit growth without the benefit of the lift of what we saw in the major markets in the first half of the year.  And I think that is a pretty strong position.  So we would have to have major markets fall off much more substantially and we just don't see that in our load data.  Again I'd go back to the comps &#x2013; the data that we had from both our services organization and our software organization going forward.</p>
          <p>We'd have to see a dramatic slowdown in our emerging countries.  But we don't see that.  In fact, if you look at the emerging countries, once again double digit performance, a strong base of business, Russia up 51%, Brazil up 28%, India up 24%, a little stall I think in China as we grappled with the Olympics, but I expect that to come back at the end of the quarter.  And I think underneath this, even in a weaker demand environment, Toni, we have put exceptional focus on cost, expense and margin management and regardless of what happens in the economic environment, those action plans are going to come through.</p>
          <p>And if you had to pick one attribute that accounted for those margin performance in the third quarter, it's that focus on systematic cost take out across our businesses and our headquarters organization, both the back office content where we have taken billions out to deliver to the bottom line, our work that we've done to take costs out of our service delivery organizations.  All the work we done to provide more productivity in our sales organization and it's that cost take out and systematic margin performance that I think gives us confidence as we go into the fourth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Mark, you gave us a lot of information on things that you are doing to drive, incremental cost savings into next year and with that said, given the economic and currency backdrop, it's conceivable revenues could be flattish on a reported basis.  So, if you take out the pension out of the equation, is it conceivable that margins can still expand in that scenario and can you review for us the key margin headwinds and tailwinds as we enter next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean if you look at the contribution of pension to our gross profit margin in the third quarter it was about a third.  So, in other words, two thirds of this was strong operational performance flow through and I expect that to continue as we go into the fourth quarter and next year.  As we look at the content in the cost and expense actions that we are taking, they should really continue to support that margin expansion play that we are driving across each of our businesses.  I mean as you look at margin headwinds and tailwinds, I mean really the biggest headwind that we are dealing with overall is the economy.  The volatility of currency could be a headwind but if you are talking about just margins and our roll through I think the mix of our business is a real tailwind for us.  I think our focus on systematically solving our customer problems with real value add solutions is a real tailwind for us and I think the momentum that we've seen this year, also in a difficult economic environment, gives us confidence that we can continue to roll out this play.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much.  Given the sharp moves in the equity and the fixed income markets so far this year, can you help us understand what the help or hurt you expect from pension in 2009 relative to the 700 million year-over-year pre-tax benefit that you outlined during your analyst meeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and David I want to go back to how we established the roadmap to begin with.  When we first established the roadmap and we said there is $0.90 from that pension contribution cumulatively from '06 to '10, the amount that we are accounting on you know in our '09 work was about $500 million year-to-year.  Now, it did move over time, but if you go back to the initial roadmap and what we have been managing to, at that time, we thought we'd get about 500 million.</p>
          <p>If you now took that work and updated it for the close of business on September 30 and we looked the return on assets that we've gotten in our U.S. pension fund, which by the way came in about minus 10%, now that's certainly not what we're looking for overall, but a lot better than the industry because we have about 43% mix of fixed income and you also updated for discount rates and other assumptions and return profiles amongst all of our world trade pension funds as well and if you said well that's the profile that we'd use to find the year and updated all of the performance then that year-to-year benefit about 500 million in our base 2010 model would be reduced by about half and would be now about 250 million year-to-year compared to our '08 run rate.</p>
          <p>Now, that doesn't include the one time event that we had with the Japan Pension Fund that we described but that kind of gives you the kind of characteristics.  All of this is dependent on how we turn out at the very end of the year.  You know what the discount rate is at the end of year.  What are the return assumptions globally at the end of year and we'll update you with how we close out the fourth quarter and what that means as we enter 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks a lot.  I guess, in clarification over the roadmap, Mark, if you could start in just the 10, 11 given what you just said that the 10 to $11 looked possible and further on that within the roadmap there is a revenue growth assumption of 3% and then maybe 5 plus in your up scenario to $11.  There's numbers in there of $1.55 as well in terms of $1.50 in contributions plus in the roadmaps from revenue growth.  And in 2002 in a recession you guys declined in revenue et cetera.  So, I guess the question is if revenues are flat-to-declining, which is frankly what all my clients are telling me and won't believe me if I tell them you're going to grow, what happens to the roadmap?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ben, I think that's a very good question.  Let's now go back to the roadmap and how we set that up and what the elements of that roadmap were.  I think the important aspect of the 2010 roadmap is the granularity of actions that we have at our disposal to achieve that end result.  So it's not just revenue, it's revenue, it's margin, and it's margins submitted supported by our mix, move into higher margin content.  It's margin supported by our aggressive cost takeout plans; it's share repurchase and it's ability to use to cash to most support our shareholder base.  It's the momentum that we see in our growth plays like virtualization, which frankly have exhibited themselves, actually more through margin than revenue growth as we've gone through the year and in addition then last within that operational profile, the performance of our acquisitions, which right now if you looked at our acquisition portfolio in its entirety Cognos, Telelogic are ahead of their profit plans.  But if you look at all of those and put them together, I don't think they will all play out exactly as we have laid them out.  If you look at it right now, you'd have to conclude, I think, that we're well ahead of track in aggregate and we're ahead of track especially on margin performance.  I think we have very strong operational characteristics on margin performance across our business units.  We are ahead of track on share repurchase.  I think we've done a very good job there.</p>
          <p>The acquisition base that we need to deliver on, we have basically acquired already and I think we can deliver against those profit objectives.  The revenue base, we obviously did better on that revenue performance in the first half than we did in third quarter but the third quarter you could really see all the work on margin coming through.  So, I think if I put all of those characteristics together and roll it through that &#x2013; the period through '08, '09, '10, I feel quite confident that operationally we should be able to get to that $10 amount on operational performance and maybe even exceed that.</p>
          <p>And then we also said that whatever pension was that would be additive to our model and at the time as I explained in the last question that pension adder in the roadmap is about $0.90.  If we now made that same update and we said we will let's take the year ended September 30, carry all of those metrics and parameters to establish the year, assume we return back to more normal position next year.  That would take that $0.90 of pension benefit in the 2010 roadmap and reduce it to about $0.50.</p>
          <p>So at that kind of a level, you can see we are still in that same range of 10 to $11, albeit I think the metrics will come potentially through different elements of the roadmap, some will be stronger and I think over the course of that period from '06 to '10, it's not going to be a straight line.  I mean there will be a stronger periods and periods of less overall growth but over the longer term we feel pretty confident that we have a good game plan to achieve that objective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I &#x2013; first of all, the &#x2013; our x86 content did lag. I mean these clearly were not the results we were looking for and it was, I think, more characteristic of a couple of things.  The industry standard market I mean that's not the market where we have our best opportunities to show our value add to our customer base.  So we were weaker in our hardware base on the more industry standard content.</p>
          <p>I do think as we go into the fourth quarter, we're going to have opportunity for improved margins on the x86 space.  And as we go into '09 the work that we're doing to improve our sales execution, I think will pay off as well and will be returning to a stronger footing.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thank you.  Going back to your financing strategy, are you seeing any signs of any material credit constraints for your SMB customers and/or reseller partners and if so are you increasing or considering increasing your level of customer or partner financing to counter this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our, the bulk, if you look at that distribution that we showed you on the Global Financing chart, that's much more driven by enterprise than it is the small medium business content.  There is virtually no exposure as you know to consumer issues, but it's much more driven by enterprise and as we look at the financing and our partner financing whether it be support of the partner or the financing through that organization, we are very tough minded on the credit evaluation and the certainty of a repayment, regardless of the product opportunity.  We have a very aggressive and disciplined program to price for risk, again regardless of the installation opportunity and I think it's why you've seen our reserves on a relatively controlled basis.  So, when you look at financing, financing for us is a fairly narrow skill set that we apply very specifically to technology.  We don't go outside of those bright lines.</p>
          <p>And within financing, the strength that we have aside from the ability to asses the credit profile quite specifically, the real strength that we have, is I think we have some of the best capability to evaluate the take down curve on technology and evaluate that residual value and as you all know the residual value is a very powerful opportunity for us because at end of the lease we bring that box back, we remanufacture it, we ship it out to either used equipment or equivalent to new and recoup a lot of the value.  So it's a much more operational manufacturing brand driven organization than strictly a financing opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, good afternoon.  I want to get a little more context around the services profile, Mark, if I could.  You've talked about the deal pricing environment getting a little tenuous out there and we're hearing chatter about Western Europe having some difficulties in the outsourcing side.  How much of your confidence in the IBM profile is really driven by any sort of marginal increases in the level of recurring revenues in your services business versus perhaps the benefit of your cost takeouts allowing for a much better service platform and a much better economic platform you can provide your customers allowing you to take share right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think there is three things that I would say as we go forward on that.  Number one, the things that give us confidence is the short-term signing profile and how quickly those short-term signing profile yield as we go into the next quarter.  As you have seen throughout the year, we get very good performance on that short-term business and we expect that to yield as we go into the fourth quarter.  We talked a lot about all the work that we've done on cost takeout but underneath that, I can tell you that we're very encouraged by the gross profit of the business that's in that backlog.  One way to look at it is that frankly it's not that difficult in a services business to build a backlog to just drive revenue but it's very difficult to do that and reap the kind of margins we're looking for.  And so, we don't go after the offering that has terms and conditions or a pricing structure that we know won't yield over the course of the contract.  I mean we get request for terms and conditions like in Europe we had a request for large deal and they simply asked us to takeover their pension base population.</p>
          <p>Well, I don't want a pension base in Europe.  I've got lot of experience with pension and I don't need any more pension base in Europe.  So, we turned that contract down.  Would it have expanded signings?  Yes, but it would not have expanded gross profit.  I mean we've had a request for unlimited liability for data security breaches in a contract in the U.S. even though the customer wasn't willing to install the needed security measures and products from our portfolio.  Now why would I do that?  In that case the customer is really looking for an insurance policy.  I mean we are not here to write insurance policies just to drive signings.</p>
          <p>So underneath this it's really the confidence in the quality of the deals that we've signed, I think moving into the fourth quarter and then last I would reiterate we see good pipeline an I'd go back as an example in the GBS pipeline why I just thought I was it was quite powerful that we've already been awarded about 65% of the deals greater than 20 million that we needed.  So, obviously in all of this there is a lot of work to do to get through the fourth quarter.  We've got to continue to take cost out.  We've got to yield on the signings.  We've got to drive margins.  We've got to maintain discipline in the business but I think we've got a good footing again as we go into the fourth.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Just a follow-up on that last question, it looks like backlog deteriorated sequentially for the second consecutive quarter.  Can you provide some color around that deterioration in the backlog?  And secondly, has the pricing environment changed significantly in the past several months and to what extent has the HP-EDS deal had on the competitive environment overall?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  I would not say that the pricing environment has changed over the last couple of months.  It certainly didn't become more difficult as we went through the quarter.  I mean, one interesting fact on those short-term signing performance as we progressed through the quarter, they in fact accelerated as we went into September.  I mean, sometimes I think we've looked at this and say well there must have been a deceleration in the month of September.  On short-term signings, we had pretty good growth in the quarter but they definitely accelerated as we went into September.  So, I don't think they would have accelerated had we had real pricing pressure as we exited the third.</p>
          <p>And as far as the erosion you saw this quarter, it's still within historical norms.  It can be a bit like signings.  It's not very consistent across quarters.  We always have some level of terminations, re-scope and adjustment of volume.  So, I didn't see any distinct trend this quarter.  And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we see enough opportunity for us to continue to grow our short-term signings across the Services business and in fact grow our long-term signings as well.</p>

          <p>All right, thanks.  Good to be &#x2013; thanks for taking the question.  Mark, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about mix in that, is it your impression given the environment that hardware will continue to exhibit negative growth rates in this and subsequent quarters?  And then related, how does that make you think about the cash flow, because the cash flow I thought was a little disappointing this quarter, does that come back in Q4?  Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I think that's a good question.  The cash flow issue that you mentioned in the third quarter was really to some extent driven by hardware.  And within hardware there was some inventory build up as we move into the fourth quarter as well.  But when you look at the mix of business going into the fourth quarter I'd remind you that we had very good growth in our zSeries platform and our high end pSeries platform, where we have unique value and actually our best margin performance.  And I think that is likely to maintain a fairly consistent mix as we go into the fourth.</p>
          <p>I do think that the industry standard content, which for us is not where we show our best value proposition and it doesn't have the margin inherent in that to begin with, will probably be &#x2013; continue to be a challenging environment within the fourth quarter.  Now the mix clearly is going to have a strong component of this highly profitable Services business.  I mean we had the highest margins we've had in six years and I think a very strong mix of highly profitable software content given the pipeline that we see going into the fourth.</p>

          <p>So let me thank you for those questions and let me take the opportunity now to just close up.  Now, I hope that there were a number of things that you took away from this call.  There are obviously some very specific points we wanted to make, which I would like to summarize.</p>
          <p>I mean number one, I mean we have a manageable level of exposure, I think, to the large financial institutions that have been impacted by the financial crisis.  We've kind of explained it, if you look across that industry because we have 75% of our business in fact outside of the U.S.  But another interesting statistic if you look at it, the breadth of the opportunity in the financial services sector, at least by the analysis that we have seen, if you in fact ranked the largest banks based on assets globally and you looked at those top 50 banks, really only four after the consolidations or I would say five of the four are in the top 50 are in the U.S.  If you said what portion of those are in the top 10?  It's really only one after the consolidation.  I just give that as an example of how broad this financial services sector opportunity is and I think you could see that in those pie charts that we gave you, where really the exposure in both revenue and AR was for both of those in the 1% area.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I think our financing business has a very solid footing.  As I had said earlier it's kind of a narrow mission.  We don't get outside those bright lines where I think we have a tremendous skill set.  We do aggressively manage those residual values and the risk profile of our business.  And I would add that we look at that end of lease as another business opportunity to what we'd call remanufacturing, which has its own challenges because you have to take the content that you're taking out of the back of that truck when the lease is over and renew that and match it to demand.  And we do that.  If you looked at our financing IT structure you'd find that the most sophisticated software that we've installed is in fact aimed at the back-end of the lease, not the front-end of lease for that reason.</p>
          <p>I think we have very good access to the CP markets.  I can honestly tell you we have not had problem accessing the CP market at all this year.  It's a very good source of financing leverage for us, but we're not dependent on it.  I mean, we have about 4.5 billion right now, but if you look at our opportunity otherwise, we have 10 billion of cash.  We've got another 10 billion in our revolver.  I mean, clearly if there were to be a problem in commercial paper, we could source from some of those other areas.  But I personally &#x2013; I do not think that the IBM Corporation is going to have a problem accessing commercial paper.</p>
          <p>We have a great portfolio of products, we talked about that.  I think it's not just a portfolio of products we enter the year with, but the solutions aimed at solving our customers' problems on cost management, on capital conservation, on risk and compliance, all the elements to help us continue to drive short-term signings up 8%.  And if you then said well, within the financial services sector what did short-term signings grown?  The third quarter, globally they were up 12%.  In the U.S. financial services sector short-term signings were up 33%.  I think that's a function of those solutions and how we've oriented to solving our customers' challenges in this environment.</p>
          <p>So, I guess to conclude, we're focused on the things we can control.  We think we have shown real momentum, especially in that margin performance in the third quarter and we're confident as we go into the fourth quarter and 2009.  So I want to thank you again as we conclude the call.</p>
