          <p>[Operator instructions and technical difficulties]. Good morning.  My name is Sheryl, and I'll be your conference facilitator today.  We apologize for the technical difficulties.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  [Operator instructions].  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us today.  Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, are ready to provide insight into the company's second quarter results and our expectations going forward.  Before I turn the program over to them, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language.</p>
          <p>Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company.  These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2007 Form 10-K and first quarter 2008 10-Q reports.  These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This conference call is being webcast and will be available on our Investor Relations website for a few weeks.</p>
          <p>In his remarks, Kurt will refer to UPS's cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Reconciliation is included with the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS IR website.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the program over to Scott.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  It's obvious to everyone in the business world that economic conditions in the U.S. continue to slow.  Economists hold a bleaker outlook for the second half of this year than was the case even three months ago.  Soaring fuel prices, falling housing starts, increased unemployment, weaker consumer confidence, all of this paints a picture of a faltering economy.</p>
          <p>While GDP and industrial production may bottom out in the second half of this year, recovery is expected to be a slow drawn-out process.  Predictions are that it will be 2009 before improvement in the economy becomes apparent.  Deteriorating economic conditions and high fuel prices had a significant negative impact on our Package business.  Volumes in our Premium Products declined at a greater pace than in the first quarter and our costs increased.  We are feeling the impact of higher energy costs throughout the company, not just at the fuel pump.  This includes such items as purchased transportation and increased utility expense.  I assure you that we are pursuing a range of initiatives to address today's marketplace challenges and trends.  Some of these will have short-term benefits.  Others will take longer.  Kurt will provide details shortly.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult economic environment, UPS's focus is on long-term growth opportunities.  Our investment to develop supply chain management capabilities, which is now paying dividends, is a good case in point.  Going forward, the proposed contract with DHL is another such opportunity.  As a reminder, we're developing 10-year agreement with DHL to provide airlift for their Express, Deferred, and International volume within the U.S., and between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  Both sides are working diligently and making good progress towards conclusion of this agreement.  This illustrates how UPS is looking outside the box to develop growth strategies that we might not have considered in the past.</p>
          <p>Another great opportunity is China, where we are the in-country sponsor of the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing.  Starting three years ago, UPS began working with the Beijing Organizing Committee to develop and manage the logistics for the games.  We are serving three Olympic villages, managing 35 game venues and four distribution centers, moving everything from kayaks to shot puts.</p>
          <p>During peak operation, UPS will have 2,000 people and 138 vehicles on site.  This is a complex undertaking that demonstrates our broad worldwide capabilities.  Our goal is to be the leading global package delivery, freight and logistics company in China.  This sponsorship is an important step in strengthening our brand presence in this key market.</p>
          <p>Despite economic pressures, our service levels are at all time highs and I am proud of the effort and dedication of the UPSers I see everyday.  Often in our history we have dealt with challenging economic issues.  For example, in the 1930s, UPS expanded its service area from the West Coast to the East at the heights of economic turmoil.  And in the '70s, we started to develop our international business in spite of the oil crisis.</p>
          <p>In many ways, tough economic times have provided a launching pad for innovation that led to years of growth.  Despite the current challenges, we intend to do the same thing today: adapt our business to meet current conditions and position our company for long-term growth and success.  Remember, although these downturns in the economy are painful, the strongest companies like UPS will come out in the best competitive position.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the program over to Kurt for comments on the second quarter results and on our outlook for the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Scott and good morning everyone.  As we look at the second quarter three major trends affected our Global Package business: escalating fuel prices, volume declines and a sharper reduction in the use of premium products, the last two being related to economic conditions.  Fuel had a significant impact in the quarter, increasing $470 million, or 67% over last year.  Fuel price increases had ramifications beyond just the direct cost.  They caused our indirect expenses to accelerate, items such as purchased transportation, utilities and the cost for outside service providers around the world.</p>
          <p>Crude prices increased from $100 a barrel in early April to 140 by the end of June.  This rapid increase during the quarter magnified the impact of our fuel surcharge lag.  As you know there is a two-month delay in the application of fuel surcharges to capture this increased expense.  This factor alone accounted for over half of the profit decline in both the U.S. Domestic and International Package segments.  The 1.3% decline in total U.S. domestic volume was a larger shortfall than we had expected.  All products posted declines, from 6% on Next Day Air products to a little less than 1% on Ground.</p>
          <p>This is a good news, bad news story.  Due to the investments we've made in our broad product portfolio, we have retained customers and kept them in the portfolio.  However, some of them shifted away from our premium products in an effort to control their own costs.  These trends pressured our operating results.</p>
          <p>The International segment performed significantly below our expectations because of volume, mix and fuel price issues that I just discussed, and slowing economic conditions.  Although Export volume and revenue growth were robust, it should be noted that the 10% Export growth was aided by the timing of Easter.  Without this benefit, Export volume would have increased around 8%.  This is market leading growth.  Import volume into the U.S. from every region of the world declined, however.  But strong intra-regional activity continued outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>The second quarter saw a rapidly changing business environment with Export volumes posting slower growth with each successive month of the quarter.  The decline in the operating margin in this segment reflects those strengths, although at almost 14%, it remains the highest in the industry.  Costs in our International business are more fixed than in our Domestic model, making it difficult to respond quickly to changing conditions.  But we are executing initiatives to enhance profits in this business and expect to see benefits over the next few quarters.  If trade flows continue to change we will adjust our network to ensure that it is properly aligned with volume and revenue growth patterns.</p>
          <p>While adapting to the current environment, we are still investing to expand our global presence.  During the quarter, we completed the network integration of Tamworth, our largest ground hub outside the United States.  This will greatly improve efficiency in that region.  We also assumed full control of our joint venture operation in Korea, announced plans to move our intra-Asia air hub to Shenzhen from the Philippines to reduce transit times and began flying five weekly flights between Nagoya, Japan and Shanghai to enhance customer service in Asia.  Most of the headwinds in our package business stem from economic slowdown and skyrocketing fuel prices.</p>
          <p>As Scott mentioned, we have established short-, medium- and long-term initiatives to identify actions and fundamental changes we can take to address the impacts of current economic realities.  Our short-term plans are focused on reducing costs for the rest of this year and next, while still supporting growth initiatives. For example, we've eliminated hiring in non-sales positions, cut back on relocations, and reduced travel, among other things.  We're also focused on operational efficiencies in addition to numerous fuel conservation activities.</p>
          <p>In the medium term, focus is on increasing revenue while refining our operating model to adapt to today's business climate. This includes a range of initiatives such as, first developing new revenue growth activities and a focus on revenue management; second, ensuring our global network is appropriately aligned with changing customer demand; and third, leveraging technology to both increase revenue and improve our efficiency.  These kinds of initiatives will take effect in the near future and throughout 2009.</p>
          <p>Longer term planning broadly addresses the structure of our network if fuel prices continue their dramatic escalation.  We're looking at three fundamental questions: how will our customers and their business models change, how do we leverage our global integrated network to best serve our customers and their changing trade patterns, and what new growth opportunities exist?  This is a comprehensive scenario planning effort.  As such it entails a longer term view of our company and our industry from various what-if perspectives and it will take some time before conclusions are reached.  However, I want you to know that we are always actively managing the business to control our destiny and continue to lead the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to Supply Chain &amp; Freight.  This segment again exceeded our expectations.  Revenue increased almost 11% with profits up over 50% led by Forwarding and Logistics.  The Air Freight relaunch introduced in January has attracted new customers and many existing customers have also increased their use of our expanded range of freight services.  The Logistics unit maintained its focus on profitable revenue growth and it has developed superior capabilities in healthcare and hi-tech and has new facilities coming on line in Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and Canada.</p>
          <p>In the Freight business, LTL revenue was up over 7% and strong yields continue to reflect the value of our service offering.  Shipments declined 2.3%, although results strengthened month-over-month throughout the quarter.  In addition, all productivity measures improved and technology, specifically WorldShip and Quantum View, is driving new customer wins and increasing repeat business.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, UPS Freight expanded its reliability guarantee to shipments moving in and out of Canada, an extension of the guarantee put in place for U.S. shipments in January.  It's a clear signal to our customers of the confidence we have in the improvements made at UPS Freight.  The Freight unit also enhanced time in transit on nearly 1,000 lanes.</p>
          <p>No quarterly update would be complete without touching on the company's financial position.  For the first six months of 2008, UPS generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, invested almost 1.4 billion in capital expenditures and paid dividends of over 1.3 billion.  We also spent $2.4 billion to repurchase almost 35 million UPS shares.  The company remains on pace with our repurchase program and has over $7.5 billion remaining of the 10 billion repurchase authorization.  Even with this financial activity, we ended the first half of the year with $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p>
          <p>Through the end of the second quarter, free cash flow approached 3.4 billion.  This includes approximately 1 billion in federal cash tax benefits related to the company's withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan.  Our CapEx budget at 3 billion for 2008 will be below 6% of our revenues.  This is towards the low-end of our historical range.  We'll continue to look for opportunities to cut or defer investment if we can, but we'll continue to invest for growth.  The Worldport expansion, the Tamworth hub in England and expansion plans in Asia are only some of the investments underway to meet anticipated needs down the road.</p>
          <p>Now let's look to the future, and I'll address my remarks to the second half of 2008 in its entirety.  Three months ago, we told you that we anticipated the domestic market would be flat to down 1% and that our volume would track market behavior.  Current thinking is that the small package market will contract up 2% for the remainder of the year as will our U.S volumes and we'll see a continued decline in Premium Products.  On the positive side, in August we will begin operating under the economics of the new labor contract, with its more moderate range of hourly wage increases.  This obviously will have a greater effect in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Domestic operating margins will remain below last year; however, they should improve over the first half of '08.  The slow economic conditions that I mentioned earlier will cause our International segment to experience mid- to high-single-digit Export volume growth with an operating margin in the mid-teens for the year.  Remember the third quarter is generally lighter in Europe due to a slow August.  And we expect the Supply Chain and Freight segment to continue to show profit improvements over last year with margins at or above 5%.</p>
          <p>Given all these factors and assuming business conditions remain reasonably steady we expect results in the second half of this year to improve modestly over the first half, resulting in full-year earnings per share within a range of $3.50 to $3.70.  Comparisons to last year will be more difficult in the third quarter and moderate in the fourth.  In conclusion I'd like to remind you that UPS is no stranger to economic adversity.  We have managed well through down cycles in the past and I'm confident that we will do so again.</p>
          <p>Now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Your first question is coming from Jon Langenfeld of Robert Baird.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just talk a little bit about the demand destruction, a little bit more on the demand destruction on the Domestic Express side?  First off, it looks like the surcharge is probably going to go from 24% in the second quarter to 34% in the third quarter, so I am assuming there is more price elasticity you're going to bump up against this year, and then secondly, do you think historically as customers have shifted away from Express, is that a permanent shift or do they typically &#x2013; is there some element that comes back with a better economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jon, certainly that's been a topic that's had a lot of discussion lately.  First off, this behavior is a typical cyclical process, and in slowdowns in the past, we have seen that our Next Day Air products and most premium products are more economically sensitive.  Frankly, when the economy is hot, there is more need to get goods urgently to their end destination.  So it's important to keep that in perspective that there is a substantial amount of these current trends that are seasonal or cyclical.  On the other hand, clearly with fuel hitting unprecedented levels and the surcharges being high, there is increased pressure and customers are looking for ways to cut costs, and so we are seeing some shifts in our products.  Our sense is that that's probably beginning to stabilize.  Clearly, if fuel takes another run and we have a $40 increase over the span of the quarter like we did in Q2, it's very difficult to forecast.  But we expect overall our surcharges to be up on the Air about 8% this quarter, not quite as dramatic as you quoted. And our guidance clearly includes our outlook for continued declines in premium products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, we saw back in 2002, 2003 that Express products were negative both years.  Came back in 2004, Next Day grew at 7% plus.  I am not expecting 7% plus necessarily next year or two with the energy prices where they are but this recovery's not <mark type="inaudible" />  they can't come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good, good color.  And then the follow-up question was on the international trend.  Did you see similar trends on the Heavy Weight Freight side in your Supply Chain business as you commented on the Parcel business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit but not quite as dramatically, I guess.  We have seen some recent numbers for May and June that suggests some slowing.  We had a good solid quarter.  Clearly, the freight coming into the U.S. has been anemic.  On the U.S. side, on our Small Package side, all regions of the world really were down as far as their shipments to the U.S., and we did see some slowing on the Freight side.  But we've got a lot of new offerings, the Air Freight portfolio is being pretty well received and that may be helping to offset some of it. And we continue to see strong growth in our Asia-to-Europe lanes even though there has been some external discussions of that slowing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, the first question on the competitive environment, can you give us a sense of whether the base rates have gotten more challenging &#x2013; the base rate increases have gotten more challenging to achieve in light of how much fuel surcharge customers are paying and just whether the competitive dynamics have gotten a little bit worse or if they are still pretty stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first off, certainly with the surcharges in the Air as high as they are, the fuel surcharge has become a part of price negotiations in an increasing fashion.  So it is much more a part of those discussions than it was before, and as a result it gets a little harder to isolate pure price-taking versus fuel surcharge.  But in general the market's healthy, pricing is very rational, clearly this is a business where you've got to cover your costs and growth alone doesn't provide synergies if you're not getting value.  We are focused right now on making sure that we go through our customer base and that our rates and surcharges are appropriate.  In some cases there are caps on our fuel surcharge that seemed pretty benign back a year ago that now are -- really don't fit the economics.  So we do have some initiatives underway to recalibrate some of those and make sure that we find an appropriate balance of price for customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the follow-up question.  In terms of the margin performance, I know you highlighted fuel as being a pretty significant factor, I think you implied it would -- maybe 180 million operating income impact is the number I came up with the way you characterized it.  And I am wondering if, do you think margins will year-over-year will -- performance will be a lot better, if we see fuel stabilize, or is it really much more about weakness in volumes and it's kind of hard to see margin trends improve at all without the volumes really changing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really &#x2013; really this whole fuel phenomena you really have to separate into two buckets, Tom.  One is the absolute level of fuel, and the other is the rate of change.  In the second quarter, the most notable difference was this rapid increase from crude of 100 to 140 by the end of the quarter.  That's just unprecedented and that was the major impact that caused our, half of our operating profit declines in the Package business.  So the rapid increase is a short-term issue that, as fuel prices stabilize, will cease being a headwind. And then if fuel prices drop significantly, we'll have a tailwind and finally recover the substantial amounts that we've had shortfalls on as fuel has been on a run.</p>
          <p>The second issue is the absolute high level of fuel, and that is one that will impact customer demand.  Certainly it's driving cost both in our fuel line and, as I mentioned, a lot of other line items.  And there the issue is A, our ability to recover that cost and B, the impact of those fuel prices on the economy.  So, the short-term issue, yeah, if things were to stabilize we would have less drag on our earnings as fuel stabilizes, although it would sure be nice to see a little decline in that cost to get some real boost on the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you for the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is coming from Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Scott, hi Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's assume that the overnight doesn't come back, not because of the economy but because of fuel and so growth starts to be in other less high yielding products on a secular basis.  What can you do in your network and at what point could you improve Domestic margins do you think, given that context that the rest of the business is going to grow and the overnight air is on a secular decline?  And then maybe as a follow-up just what the DHL contract &#x2013; could you give an update on how that might play into the whole thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ed, we've been looking for months, doing some scenario planning on what happens if oil is at 150, what happens if oil is at $200 a barrel, how does that change the business, not only Domestic Air but International?  If we see prolonged very high oil, you may see trade lanes change, you may see more near sourcing in the future, people building the goods closer to the end consumer.  So we certainly had to kind of look at a lot of scenario planning from that standpoint.  There will be some challenges, obviously some of the distances shipped may be shortened as we go forward but there are at least some opportunities out there.  We think that there is a &#x2013; I've talked to a lot of CEOs who have company owned fleets, and have courier services that frankly are going to have a lot of trouble with these energy levels.  So we see new markets that we really don't participate in today, opening up and with the efficiency of the UPS network we see an awful lot of revenue opportunities and again that's all about utilizing our network more efficiently which should help margins in the future.  So I think there are some challenges for us but there is also some great opportunities as we move ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'm not talking about the revenue side, if you look at the cost side, can you get the cost to a position where the network can work with kind of a secular decline in an area if other areas are growing and <mark type="inaudible" /> on DHL, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah back to &#x2013; well, I guess I will answer that with the DHL question.  Clearly as we looked ahead there is some risk to the domestic express market as we look at the next 4 or 5 years.  We don't know if it's going to grow, be neutral, but clearly we lessened our risk with the DHL line haul contract. It's something that we are not &#x2013; haven't completed the contract yet, but things are working, making an awful lot of progress. We think that's going to &#x2013; the additional volume with that will clearly make for more efficiency, better asset utilization of our air network, not just airplanes but also the hubs for sorting purposes.  So that's one major step I think in the better utilization of our network in obviously helping the margins as we move forward.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to ask about the way you could maybe address some of these network changes <mark type="inaudible" /> change.  Would you ever reconsider now maybe upping the dim weights on the Ground from what you've currently got?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Upping the dim weight, meaning taking larger packages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Meaning changing the &#x2013; basically making it as you charge for Air where it's all dim weight as opposed to actual weight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly there &#x2013; we look at all options Bill but the on the Ground, the cubic size that's not as big a driver of total cost to the product as it is in Air.  So with our current dim weight we really look for the outsize packages that are over three cubic feet and those are the ones that we make sure we are being -- charging appropriately.  So it's not something at this present time that we're evaluating but we'll continue to look at revenue management opportunities and clearly our basic strategy in our pricing is to make sure that we price appropriately to reflect cost, so that's always an option.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then as you look at the changes that fuel is forcing on your customers, where is the weakness most pronounced?  Is it sort of B2B that you're seeing it, can you parse it up from the economy, is it B2C, where is the big change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think proportionally it's similar in both segments.  B2C continues to have better performance than does B2B but it is sequentially over the last three or four quarters, it has seen actually a greater slowing than the commercial side.  So that &#x2013; the consumer clearly is in question right now and we're watching those trends very carefully, both for our big retail companies that we're delivering to and then in consumer business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Long-term I think that you if think about B2C, it really is much more efficient to have UPS delivering a package to your house than it is for you go to the mall, buy that package.  So I think that even the high energy prices will probably drive B2C business over the long-term and benefit the consumer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about changes that were, I guess, at the high fixed structure of the International.  What kind of changes to that network do you envision that you could make to maybe make it more variable in nature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Ken, clearly that's an area of very high focus for us.  We saw fairly substantial changes over the course of the quarter and as you know we've had an incredible run over the last five, six years on the International side.  But we did see some slowing from April to May to June frankly that caught us a little off guard.  One of the core issues around International is the big worldwide services, where we have the major flights going across the oceans.  That is a more fixed cost unless we choose to take a substantial step-down in capacity.  Frankly, if flows between the continents continue to slow, then we will be looking very critically at perhaps reducing temporarily some selective flights between the continents and that assessment is underway right now looking at how we can take some cost out.</p>
          <p>We continue to see a very strong growth intra-region and both Asia and Europe showed high single-digit to low double-digit shipments within the regions.  And so, in the short-term, we are seeing some of that regional trade flourish even as the worldwide trade is slowing.  So, some of these things are recalibrating our network, some there is perhaps taking out capacity.  Also in the International, we don't have quite the same variable structure as we do in the U.S. on the Ground.  Labor laws and the nature of our employee contracts are different by country and some we actually pay monthly salaries to our employees rather than the typical hourly rates that we use in U.S. where we can adjust on a daily basis.  So, it's a large business with very many different moving parts but we are on high alert right now and all of the regions are looking at local plans and global plans for how to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And then you made another comment earlier, Kurt.  You said that -actually it was also in the release, that you are going to see an improvement in the second half of results and obviously your targets indicate that with your second half EPS targets.  I am just wondering is that, kind of just mostly on the fuel catch-up on the surcharge, and if so, what does the &#x2013; you keep highlighting the move from 100 to 140, what does the move back down to 130?  Is that significant at all in helping with that catch-up and does that maybe even further enhance your second half target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, there are some company specific issues, Ken, that we have been talking about and we are confident will begin to provide us a little more of a tailwind starting in the second quarter.  Certainly the new labor agreement we have with the Teamsters is one that we feel will be favorable to us basically in any economic climate.  The inflation of wages will moderate substantially.  The increases are split into two tranches, one each six months, so our effective increase in August will be substantially less than it was in the previous year.  We have some more favorable language regarding eligibility for healthcare for our part-timers, still giving the best benefits in the industry for those part-timers that stay with us a year or more, but not necessarily giving eligibility after 60 days or 90 days.</p>
          <p>So there are a number of specific issues there.  Also certainly the assumption we have is that fuel will stabilize, I guess.  We're not counting on a precipitous decline, so at least that big headwind that frankly put us on our heels a bit in the second quarter, will moderate.  And then we've got a lot of initiatives on the international to make sure we are reacting appropriately.  And then last but certainly not least we're seeing great results in the Supply Chain and Freight unit.  The LTL environment does seem to be stabilizing a bit, and clearly UPS Freight should be able to benefit from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This outlook Ken is really based on crude oil right around $140 a barrel.  So if it goes up that's purchased, if it goes down it helps us some.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just my first question is related to the International side.  I was curious, you guys mentioned that you saw strength inter-regionally, International &#x2013; intra-regionally, rather International.  I was curious if you could quantify around whether or not you thought that was more market share growth and company specific driven or I guess -- we've begun to hear reports that Western Europe has slowed a little bit from some of the heavier industrial companies that have reported.  And then on the Export growth side, you had mentioned in the release that you saw slowing throughout the quarter and I wanted to get some color on that, maybe you could detail the growth month-by-month in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well first up, I guess, Justin, on the market share gain.  We've been gaining market share in this International segment for 10 years now and we're pretty confident.  We continue to have a superior business model with the integrated network, broad range of offerings in every geography.  But we did see some of those trends that you've seen externally, and there was a significant slowing from April to May to June, really with June being the weaker in most of the regions, and so certainly Europe was a part of that.  Europe had a strong April but partially because of the Easter distortion, but we have seen some slowing.  The nice thing about our portfolio though is that we are continuing to see this regional trade pattern in Europe moving forward, and as fuel prices get high, our sense is that European companies are looking to Eastern Europe rather than the Far East perhaps a little more and so that helped offset things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I noticed in the Freight division that the weight per shipments in LTL was down.  Many of your competitors in their early kind of notes on the quarter have mentioned that they are seeing an opposite trend.  And I was curious what you would attribute the lower weight per shipment to?  Is that increased leveraging across the Small Package network and the Freight networks as you get more &#x2013; as labor's more organized within the Freight division? How are you guys viewing that trend within your Freight business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't put too sharp a point on it.  It's 5 pounds for a 1,000-pound average shipment, so...  No, I think the good news is that the weight per shipment has stabilized.  That's a good sign economically and clearly our value proposition is working well and we're continuing to target medium-sized shippers and large shippers also. But I think the weight stabilizing is good news and the other companies are validating that also.  What we are seeing great results on though is our continued success in our yield management and our revenue per hundredweight.  So that's more of a priority for us than focusing solely on the weight per shipment.</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  This is actually Brandon Oglenski.  Not to belabor the point on International, but you guys had mentioned that you are looking at intra-regional growth that's continuing but global lanes are slowing a little bit more than anticipated.  How should we think about the profitability impact of this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly both flows have good margins, but from an economic perspective, at least in the short term, the worldwide flows have much higher proportion of fixed costs.  Volume was negative coming into the U.S. from all regions.  But frankly, we weren't able to take down any of those big jets coming in from those regions.  So, in the short-term, the shift is a headwind for us because there is less variable cost in those worldwide products.  And on the flip side, on the regional, intra-regional we do have more options, so it is more variable and so it behaves more like a typical U.S. shipment would, where we can adjust pretty well and adapt.  So, it's the process of adaptation to these things and as those trends continue, it will mean we will have less lift going across oceans and more lift moving across the continents, and that's some of the long-term issues that Scott spoke to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, we'll end up the year with still mid-teen margins in International, which is obviously the best of any of the competitors. Not as high as we'd like them to be but that's certainly solid margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and if you do decide to take down some of this global and intercontinental capacity, is that going to place further pressure on the Domestic network because I am sure that some of the Export products are actually moving through the U.S. network, so does that place a little bit more pressure on the flexibility of the merchant network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're going to put up lift for any packages that want to come into the U.S. or anywhere else.  So, we will match capacity to demand, we're not going to truncate demand with capacity reduction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions, if that's okay.  On the European business, now that the Tamworth hub is integrated, what are the next priorities for expanding the European network?  And just on acquisitions, actually, you'll see they're rumors in the market again of consolidation of the sector, so can you just update us on UPS's strategy on acquisitions?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our strategy on acquisitions has not changed, I think, to what we've talked about in the last couple of years.  We &#x2013; what I've said in the past is clearly we're not going to do anything domestically in the Package business but Supply Chain &amp; Freight, we said we wanted to have a couple of years a good execution and improving margins.  We're seeing that &#x2013; we're seeing some good progress there.  The one area that we'd be most interested in still is International Package, areas that make sense, and that's been the case for the last several years.  Certainly, Asia and Europe are areas that we're interested in, particularly Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, sorry about that, I am just asking you now that the Tamworth hub is fully integrated, what are your next priorities in expanding the European network, I guess from what you're saying, or expansion in Eastern Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, yeah.  Sorry, I didn't pick up the Tamworth.  Yeah, the Tamworth is a very large ground hub that allows us to complete the operational integration of the acquisition we did at length several years ago.  And it was a big step and actually created somewhat of an operational challenge for us in the second half.  But we now have the ability to have one interlined operation.  We've aligned the customer portfolio and so that really is the kind of the capstone on our UK acquisition, and we'll be harvesting the benefits of that going forward.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to benefit from the acquisition we did in Poland.  That's been a great one for us and strengthens our position.  And clearly, we would like to continue to strengthen the Central and Eastern Europe theaters, certainly because of their increased focus on regional trade.  So, that's an area that we are investing in and we will certainly continue to do organic expansions with capacity.  We expanded our Cologne airport just a year ago and we will keep looking for organic opportunities and certainly selective operations or acquisition is not off the table either.  So a combined strategy of both organic growth, which has served us well in Europe, and then keeping our eyes open for opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had a question on the two-month delay in the fuel surcharge.  Is there any kind of structural impediment that prevents you from tightening that down a little bit, so that you are doing better a job of matching the surcharge with the actual underlying fuel price?  And as a corollary to that, is there any kind of a delayed effect here because the big fuel prices really aren't probably kicking in until right about now?  Are you fearful that there could be an acceleration of a trade down from premium products here during the months of say July and August?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, when we set this index, I think we wanted to be fair to our customers, give them advance notice of what the rates would be.  We are going through an unusual phenomenon right now, where oil has gone in one direction.  It will not go up forever and when it comes down, it will get equalized.  So, I think the right thing to do for our customers is to give them that 45 day notice of what the surcharges will be.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just maybe one follow-on here, regarding the International business, have you seen much of a trade down from air to ocean?  And if so, have you been able to capture some of the ocean movements through your Forwarding operation and if so can you give us a sense for the relative profitability of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not seen huge shifts, I mean clearly we are working with a lot of customers as we evaluate supply chains and Scott referenced that too.  But actually ocean seems to be struggling perhaps more.  I know the recent data showed a 6% decline in ocean, that's not company's specific, but some external numbers in the U.S.  So, I think all modes right now are struggling and really the big message is the U.S. engine that drives a substantial amount of imports into the U.S. is slowing right now and so all of the theaters are seeing sequential headwinds.</p>

          <p>I think we would expect it more ocean freight growth with the fuel prices, but with the market data, you're not seeing that, you're seeing a negative &#x2013; certainly in June the market data shows negative growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, within our Air Freight portfolio, we are seeing more rapid growth in the Deferred and Forwarding products as compared to the Express Freight, so that easy choice for getting customers to move from the guaranteed Express service down to Deferred Forwarding, we are seeing that flex back and forth.  So it's just another example of our 'keep it in the portfolio' strategy that we've been building towards.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is coming from David Campbell of Thompson, Davis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, some of -- good morning everyone.  Some of your competitors have mentioned an improving price control, the improving revenue trends in June and the less-than-truckload in trucking business, that is the capacity to improve pricing better than in previous months, did you see the same thing and what does that tell you any -- if anything about economic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, we really have not seen the headwinds on pricing, David, that's been one of the real positives with our new value proposition with the guarantee we launched in January, with the deep integration to our WorldShip application for generating freight shipments.  Yield has not been a challenge for us.  We feel pretty comfortable with our yield.  What we have seen though, I guess to support the market anecdotes is a firming of demand and also a stabilizing of weight per shipment, which are both good leading indicators we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, if we look at the economy, we think that the second quarter GDP is probably going to be the best GDP of the year helped obviously by the rebate checks. I think the number will be a bigger number than most people expect.  But as you move ahead throughout the year, we still, we're not the leading indicators, but certainly what you read and what you see, we expect probably slightly, slightly positive growth in the economy, but still anemic.  And really the, probably the important provident we follow is manufacturing IP. Manufacturing IP was negative in the first half of the year, slightly negative and expected to be slightly negative for the year.  So, it's not going to get a lot worse, but <mark type="inaudible" /> better for the rest of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and the decrease in Export yields in the second quarter after increasing in the first quarter, can you add, explain that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Export yields have been fairly steady, both on a pre-currency and post-currency basis.  We've seen steady Domestic increases and the overall Export yields have been flat, slightly negative and that's primary a mix issue that we talked about for a number of quarters with the trans-border services growing faster than the worldwide services, so trends are fairly stable there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen.  Most of my questions have been answered but Scott and Kurt, you alluded to the fact that if things don't change and if say fuel is at these higher levels permanently you are going to have to make structural changes.  I know this is kind of a hypothetical but do you have in your mind kind of a period of time that you look at to say if fuel is at this sustained level for say six months or a year, there's kind of an inflection point in time where you decide you have to make major structural changes to the network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Art, it's a long-term phenomena.  I think it's an evolutionary process and so we have done a lot of scenario planning on this topic and I think if something -- if companies decide that they want to start building goods closer to the end consumer, it's going to happen for many, many years.  It's won't happen overnight.  It's a big shift for businesses so you may see a slow movement to near sourcing, but it won't happen very quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I &#x2013; we don't want to put too much emphasis on it.  I mean it's prudent for us to stay in the future and think about the trends.  We thought it was appropriate to share some of our thinking to let you know that we are long-term players in this industry and we are going to stay ahead of the curve.  But as Scott said these are evolutionary issues and we don't expect any rapid changes even if fuel stays hot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is coming from John Mims of BB&amp;T Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I am standing in for John Barnes.  Looking at CapEx going forward, if these current conditions persist, could you all reach a point where you put some of the larger CapEx projects on hold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to evaluate CapEx in an ongoing fashion and frankly we tightened it up prior to giving our guidance for 2008.  So we will be right at 3 billion, which is below our 6% of revenue threshold, typical.  But we've got a couple of major investments right now that are full speed ahead.  We are expanding our Woldport hub that will continue to pay dividends.  It allows us to optimize the air network.  It allows us to sort faster and fly slower, which saves air fuel &#x2013; fuel for our aircraft.  And should our contract with DHL be completed, having that extra sort capacity in Worldport is absolutely essential.  So domestically, there are investments we are making and those will wrap up in the next year, year-and-a-half or so that will continue.</p>
          <p>And then globally, certainly we will adjust Air Freight appropriately but we are continuing to build capacity.  China is a very busy place for us right now.  Scott gave you an extended tour of all the Olympics activities.  But behind the scene also is a substantial amount of increase in our geographic coverage, browning up the country, if you would, and building an infrastructure there, so a lot of work going on.  We do have a lot of control over CapEx.  We have some committed aircraft in the future but it's a modest amount and frankly as 2012 comes around and some of the aging aircraft directives come in, it will be a natural transition for us to replace our DC-8s with 767s.  So we feel real good about where we're at from a CapEx perspective and we'll be reacting but not -- we don't feel that it's going to hamper our capabilities at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will continue to make the right decisions for the long term for this company, but rest easy that we will be &#x2013; we're vigilant about investing capital.  We are focused on economic profits so we will always do CapEx that makes an awful lot of sense for the company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is coming from Matthew Froy of Citi Investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks.  Just revisiting an earlier question, I was wondering, the economic assumptions underlying your outlook, I understand the value of your network visibility as a coincidental economic indicator.  There is some forward-looking capability given delivery stock and your sell through of what you're actually moving through to your customers, but looking at the dashboard of your outlook, you mentioned IP, what are the other key metrics you evaluate in determining your broader outlook?  To what extent....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  A lot of it is, I mean certainly IP is probably the best barometer but clearly retail sales, I think, combined with IP, are the two that we'll look at closest as we move forward and again the outlook that we see as we move through the rest of 2008 is -- retail sales got a bump in the second quarter with the rebates. They will moderate.  They're still growing below inflation levels at this point in time.  Manufacturing IP is going to be flat to slightly negative.  So we really, our economic assumptions for the rest of this year are just real slight growth in the U.S. economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To what extent did that economic outlook incorporate customer dialogue and really what is the visibility you've got, is it two months, is it three months out, I'm just trying to get a good sense of how we should weight your economic read with some commentary we're hearing from other industries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The macroeconomic really comes from consensus estimates out there but we talk to our customers all the time and get a feel for where their business is going, particularly as we ahead into peak season.  We've got to &#x2013; we have to plan our peak season months and months in advance.  So, we talk to an awful lot of our shippers to get an idea for what they see as inventory stocking levels.  So, it's a combination of the macroeconomic data available and certainly talking to our customers.  And I think the feedback we're getting from our customers today is somewhat consistent with our macroeconomic outlook.  It's going to be anemic growth, growth but anemic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And follow-up question in times like this in service-based industry, customers often lean on their suppliers if not on price then for greater value or more service.  Are you seeing &#x2013; you talked about the trade down from premium that's occurred in addition to some lower traffic levels.  Are customers asking you to do more for them, whether to commit your assets as rolling warehouses or put your balance sheet to work on their behalf?  Is there something that you see the margin customers are asking to do that might have been different than 12 months ago?  Thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they are asking us to do more for them but I think what it is, is they want us to help them adapt.  And so although there is certainly cost pressures we've got a number of just great anecdotes where we're working with companies to realign their distribution as the balance of transportation costs and distribution expenses change.  So it's a very busy time for our customer solutions group working with customers to partner and help them figure out how to manage.  And in some cases we cannibalize revenue and in other cases we grow revenues substantially by broadening the relationship, so it's a very busy time but frankly an exciting one for our sales and solutions people.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just had one follow-up question.  I know that it's a ways out from 2009 but if you look at the prior downturn Scott, I think you had talked about Air volumes being down a bit in either '01 or '02 or '02-'03.  And it seems like you don't necessarily get a quick recovery the second year after or the first year after a downturn.  Is it reasonable to think that margins could be up in '09, if volumes are kind of flat to slightly up, given the Teamster contract, given DHL, or do you really need to see more meaningful volume growth in 2009 to get margins moving in the right direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think with not a lot of growth we are still going to see a better 2009 than 2008.  We're optimistic about the outlook.  We've done a lot of good things for the company, including the contract which will benefit us, including the potential DHL contract which we hope to have signed here soon.  That's going to help us as we move into 2009.  We feel good about the outlook.  We think that the business is solid in all areas.  Any comparisons obviously get a little easier after 2008, so we are obviously optimistic about '09 at this point of time.  Clearly growth helps us.  If we see the volume grow, it lowers our effective wage rate increases.  That's also helpful.  Right now we are seeing certainly the effect of wage rate increases, probably to the contract increases through the July 31st period.  Now we are getting to August, that will be less painful as the rate goes down, or rate increase goes down.  But I think that we can show improving margins without a lot of volume growth, certainly volume growth will help us on effective wage rates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, just a follow-up to a question I asked before on the timing of the DHL contract.  When you had announced it and DHL announced it you talked about $1 billion of potential annual revenue, I was under the impression that was for 2009.  Is that still the thought process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The discussion &#x2013; with the contract still being negotiated and it's going to depend on their levels of business as we get into it.  So we are not &#x2013; until we really sign the contract, we can't really I guess determine that number thoroughly, but really the full year, the first full year would be 2010 I guess.  We'll have it fully implemented we hope by the second half of 2009, so the first full year will be 2010 that we're talking those types of levels.</p>
