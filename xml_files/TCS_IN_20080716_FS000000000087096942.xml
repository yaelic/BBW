          <p>Ramchandra and Maha will all begin with a brief overview of the company's performance, followed by a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, TCS does not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Furthermore, anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future, or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement, must be viewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. These risks are outlined in the second slide of our results presentation.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. And again, good morning, good evening. The new financial year has been challenging one so far. Global macroeconomic factors, including the ongoing problems in the global financial sector, rising oil prices and the threat of recession in some developed markets have had an impact on large global corporations, leading to uncertainty and general caution all around.</p>
          <p>Despite facing this macro level situation and other client-specific challenges, I am happy to announce that TCS has grown its business in quarter one. Quarter one revenue was at INR64,107 million, has grown over 24% on a year-on-year basis, and this translates into 6% growth sequentially.</p>
          <p>As you are aware, we have rolled out our new customer-centric organization structure in this quarter. We are extremely pleased with the alignment and efficiency achieved. Our performance in quarter one demonstrates the underlying strength of our business model and highlights our value proposition to our customers. This is evident in the strength shown by our international business, which has essentially grown at 7%. Each of the major markets, North America, U.K. and Europe grew in excess of 6% individually, and collectively they have grown at 8% sequentially, higher than the company average. New growth markets have grown at a slower pace, partly because they are cyclical in nature like India.</p>
          <p> Turnkey. Our diversified vertical strategy is also helping us in the current uncertain climate. A negative demand impact from some of our BFSI clients in this quarter, for instance, has been made up by increased orders from customers in other sectors. But manufacturing, retail and life sciences are also proceeding, as we planned. We are managing our business mix to compensate for any fall in demand due to customer-specific problems, and Chandra after this will provide more color on these aspects of the business.</p>
          <p>From a TCS perspective, what is also important in today's challenging environment is to take control of the circumstances that are within the company's zone of influence. For instance, there has been a need to focus on cost controls, to ensure that we are doing everything we can to manage costs and become much more efficient at running the business.</p>
          <p>In this respect, we have embarked on a strong program of cost control that have helped us to reduce our SG&amp;A expenses from the quarter four levels by 217 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This is despite planned wage increases being factored in during quarter one.</p>
          <p>TCS has also crossed another billion dollar milestone this quarter. Despite the uncertainties, we continue to generate cash and we have over $1 billion in terms of cash in hand. Given the circumstances, this will be a competitive advantage for TCS going forward as it expands its operations across the globe.</p>
          <p>We continue to dialogue with our customers and communicate our value proposition and our agility and focus on an ongoing basis. We believe we'll be generating demand in the coming quarters. I would also like to add that there is still uncertainty in the environment and this could result into issues for specific companies.</p>
          <p>Having said all of the above, there is a demand for IT services, and there are opportunities therefore for growth. We continue to hire people as planned and invest for the future. Overall, cost efficiencies, continued focus on retention of customers and demonstration of our value proposition in challenging times will be the theme for the immediate future.</p>
          <p>I will hand over to Chandra now.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ram. Hello, everyone. I would like to explain the key aspects of the operational performance during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Specifically, I would like to provide some commentary on the operating conditions in four different areas, namely the BFSI segment, what is happening, and what happened in Q1. And growth in the major markets of the US, UK, Europe and emerging markets, how we're seeing it, what has been our experience in Q1; also, the different industry portfolio, the pricing environment in general, and what they expect going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, coming to the BFSI segment, when we had this call during the last quarter, we mentioned that there are two specific lines that we are facing issues and we are likely to see the revenues drop. We did have material impacts in revenues coming down in those two clients during the quarter one.</p>
          <p>Then we have one large banking client, who is going through a de-merger process to a consortium of banks in U.K., Latin America and Europe. And while we managed to get the same revenues from the client in the business as usual committed area, the discretionary spend and revenues due to that came down during quarter one.</p>
          <p>The third aspect is we also had a revenue dip in the products business, primarily because some of the decision-making got delayed in the product business. So these three contributed to revenue drops in our banking and financial services sector. We made a vast majority of this drop by ramping up with our clients some of the deals we announced in the banking sector, and the net result is the drop you see in the, we will say, as a percentage of overall revenue.</p>
          <p>Then coming to the major markets, the U.S.A., U.K. and Europe together grew substantially, 2.2% in dollar terms during the quarter. And this must be seen in light of the BFSI hit I talked about. That BFSI hit happened in the major markets and we managed to compensate for that and still achieve a 2.2% of dollar term growth in these markets.</p>
          <p>Coming to the organization, we rolled out the new organization this quarter. As Ram said, we are very happy with the way it is has gone. In the new organization, we created a special unit called the Industries Solutions Unit, which is predominantly to serve the key clients across verticals in the major markets, and this unit posted a revenue growth of 9.9%. So that has worked extremely well for us.</p>
          <p>Then coming to the emerging markets or the new growth markets, we had hit in both India as well as in Latin America. In India, it is a cyclical market and we had a revenue drop in absolute terms in Q1 compared to Q4. Then in Latin America, we got impacted significantly because of the discretionary spend coming now and the revenues going down with the banking client, who is going through the demerger I talked about. And so, the overall growth you see, the 6% in rupee terms, has primarily come from the major markets. Not only the Latin America and India have not grown, they have taken a revenue dip, so that must be seen in that light.</p>
          <p>And coming to pricing, the pricing environment has been generally stable. We have had some contract renewals, and we have not had price cuts in any one of those contracts. They have been stable. And the drop in pricing you see in this quarter is primarily due to two factors. Our transformation project has come to an end; it is reflected in the overall fixed price revenues going down this quarter, and the product-related revenues have contributed low this quarter. And those two have affected the drop in pricing, and we see it is a one-off this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, coming to the future, of the three client scenarios I talked about, the two clients which I articulated during the Q4 and the banking client which is going through the demerger. Today, these three clients, we have turned the corner with two of them and we expect incremental revenues and growth during Q2 with two of those clients. With the third client, there is going to be a hit during <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>The deal pipeline, we did close twelve large deals during the quarter in Q1, three of them in the 75 to $100 million range. And going forward, our deal pipeline is healthy. We have a pipeline of 20 qualified large deals currently we are pursuing, and a good number of that are in the banking and financial services sector also. If you see the deal wins that we have announced, we have announced some deal wins even in the BFSI segment.</p>
          <p>Our performance in the manufacturing sector and retail sector has been very satisfying. They have grown significantly during Q1, and we continue to see growth in manufacturing, retail and utilities and high-tech sectors in the coming quarters. There are a large number of opportunities in these sectors with regard to bringing in sourcing optimization and transformation.</p>
          <p>With regard to telecom, we see growth opportunities in the equipment sector in the developed markets, and system integration and transformation engagements in the developing markets.</p>
          <p>Overall, I would like to add that the environment especially in the financial services sector is uncertain. So, we have to look for any specific client-related situations that can happen and we've got to proactively address that. Otherwise, we remain very confident about growth in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and over to Mark.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. I will cover the results for the quarter, a couple of accounting changes and some details regarding our foreign exchange program. As we go through these, I would like you to keep in mind two key points. First, in these times of slower growth and market uncertainty, a strong focus should be on driving operational efficiency and cost containment. As you know, this is a position, TCS has growth &#x2013; the growth pattern as the business picks up.</p>
          <p>Second, our Forex program is performing as designed. Our Forex program is essentially the insurance program which protects our downside risk while allowing upside benefits.</p>
          <p>Before I discuss Q1 financials, I would like to walk you &#x2013; walk you through a couple of changes in reporting. TCS is taking this opportunity at the start of  new fiscal year to switch to reporting US GAAP and US dollar instead of Indian rupee.</p>
          <p>First, this change will help facilitate the understanding of TCS financials by global investors. Second, US dollar statements will provide investors with a better understanding of the health of the underlying business. As you know, approximately 50% of our business is based in the US and denominated in US dollars.</p>
          <p>To smooth the transition from Indian rupee to US dollar, we've published a US GAAP statement denominated in Indian rupee as well as in US dollars for this quarter. Prior to the earnings call for Q2 results, we will make available the historical quarter financial statements in US dollars. This should facilitate the reconstruction of the financial models by the analysts. Additionally, this change will also necessitate a change in how we account for the cash flow hedges that have been previously recorded in the revenue line. With a change to US dollar US GAAP statements, all gains and losses from hedging will be recorded in other income expenses.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are making a change in the method of calculating the depreciation of computer assets effective this financial year. In order to align TCS factors with the actual computer you are using and also with warranty of images and software by vendors, we will begin depreciating these assets over four years instead of two years. This has resulted in an overall reduction of approximately INR497 million or 67 basis points in depreciation expense this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let us look at the income statement. The revenue increased 6.02% Q-on-Q and 24.8% Y-on-Y in rupee term; 0.5% and 20.8% respectively in US dollar terms. Chandra has already covered in detail what is driving the revenue growth and revenue performance. The following growing the breakdown of revenue growth quarter-over-quarter: volume, 1.3% increase, pricing, 90 basis point decline, effort mix, 50 basis point increase &#x2013; this is a shift from offshore to on-site, foreign exchange 5.1%. Total revenue increased 6.02%.</p>
          <p>Operating margin stayed roughly in line with the previous quarter in spite of absorbing rate increases that impacted margins by 196 basis points. The breakdown of various items that impacted margins quarter-over-quarter are as follows: Q4 '08 operating margin was 22.32%, SG&amp;A efficiency gave us 2.17% positive. Forex impact, 2.3% positive, wage impact, 1.96% negative. Pricing and productivity is 2.94% negative, on-site shift 0.17% negative. Total negative of .26% and therefore, Q1 '09's operating margin was 22.06%.</p>
          <p>Overall, SG&amp;A for the quarter came down by INR580 million in spite of adverse impact of rupee depreciation. In terms of percentage of revenue, SG&amp;A came down to 19.99% in Q1 compared to 22.16% in Q4.</p>
          <p>We have a comprehensive cost containment program. On the one hand, this program focuses on conducting our projects more efficiently and managing manpower results better. You will see the impact of this part of the program over the balance of the year, in areas such as improved utilization and increased offshore leverage. Additionally, we have also carefully been scrutinizing and tackling our non-salary cost structures. We have taken several proactive steps to reduce these cost structures, focusing on a number of areas, such as travel, power consumption and IT and communication costs.</p>
          <p>Quarter-over-quarter, these non-salary costs, excluding depreciation of equipment and software costs, actually declined by INR400 million. Adding back the negative impact of rupee depreciation on these non-rupee costs, the total decline would have been INR760 million. The cost containment program, as we can see, is working. Then examining net income, margins declined by 137 basis points largely attributable to a reduction in other income of 143 basis points <mark type="audio gap" /> Rupees in 'Q4 FY 2008. This was partially offset by a tax credit repeat from an overseas geography.</p>
          <p>I would now like to take a closer look at our foreign exchange hedge program. Total net foreign exchange losses booked in our income statement for Q1 was 753 million or approximately US$18 million. This loss was booked to other income stock expenses as a net foreign exchange loss.</p>
          <p>I would like to take a few moments to clarify some of the descriptions related to foreign exchange hedge programs. The basic philosophy of our hedge program is to protect foreign future earnings at certain rates without sacrificing the ability to benefit on the upside. I think it is best to look at our hedge program as an insurance program, which protects downside risk by allowing us to benefit from the upside. The first question is, what do we hedge? We have a regular program that hedges existing risk, existing receivables and net revenue as well as future risks, net project revenue. All the existing risks and hedges against these risks are mark-to-market every quarter and the gains and losses are recorded in other income expense.</p>
          <p>Second, in addition to these hedges of existing receivables, we also hedge future revenue from specific projects. These hedges are undertaken to protect the future profitability of these projects and can extend to over next three to four &#x2013; four to five years.</p>
          <p>These contracts are also mark-to-market every quarter and the gains and losses from mark-to-market are recorded in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. Since these contracts hedge future revenue, then it is prudent, both from a business and accounting perspective to match the impact of these hedges with the risk being hedged and to keep gains and losses on these contracts and balance sheets and the actual realization of the revenues.</p>
          <p>The next question is, how do we hedge? That's that we protect downside risk when the rupee on the upside. We hedge our exposures through a combination of forward contracts and options contracts, with a substantial portion in options. This combination allows us to protect our downside risk of rupee appreciation, while at the same time to protect the upside of rupee depreciation. The dynamics of our hedging program is clearly seen over this past year. During the sharp rupee appreciation during FY 2008, we had a significant Forex gain, largely offsetting the losses that occurred as a result of depreciation &#x2013; as a result of the appreciation.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in spite of strong depreciation of the currency during this past quarter, we have been able to participate in approximately 65% of the benefits. For the balance of the year, we will be able to participate on 80% of the exposure.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned about, the mark-to-market of the cash flow hedge program is according to other comprehensive income. Additionally, we record here option premium expense associated with cash flow, hedge options maturing at a future date. The Q1 imbalance in other comprehensive income is a loss of INR4.08 billion. However, it is important to note that this among the strongest to impact the income statement and also that any impact of the income statement will be spread over probably eight to 10 quarters.</p>
          <p>The final amount of direct gain or loss that will impact the income statement will ultimately depend on the exchange rate at that time the contract actually matures. For example, if the rate does not move from the current rate of 43, then the actual effect will only be INR1.686 billion, spread over primarily eight to 10 quarters and not INR4.08 billion. The difference between these numbers has to do with the required percent of -- contracts to market. The existing contracts have been marked-to-market at an average rate of 45.</p>
          <p>In this scenario of constant rate of 43, at least 52% of INR1.36 billion would actually be recorded in FY 2009 income statement, based as follows: INR505 million in Q2; INR213 million in Q3; and INR200 million in Q4. And if we receive of the interest 43, then you would be translating that revenue at better rates. If, on the other hand, the rupee appreciates, we have downside protection as you saw with the large Forex gains that we realized last year.</p>
          <p>Therefore, all current risks and hedges associated with these risks of mark-to-market every quarter-end in the income statement. In the event of the rupee depreciation, we participated nearly 80% on the upside. Mark-to-market of cash flow hedges at INR45 level is for INR4.08 billion. At the existing level of 43, the figure is only 1.686 billion, spread over 8 to 10 quarters.</p>
          <p>In closing, it is clear that we are operating in a difficult environment. It is therefore critical that we drive operational efficiency and contain our cost structures, so that we can better position TCS as business improves over the year. We'll continue to build throughout the year on the success that you see in Q1. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Nelson. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from the line of Ms. Diviya Nagarajan from JM Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. You spoke about two or three clients actually turning around the corner during the quarter, and the third client actually getting a hit in the 2Q as well. Do you think the extent of the hit would be as significant as what you've seen with these two clients in the first quarter, or do you expect that to be any different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I talked about three clients, of which I said two clients are turning around because &#x2013; turning the corner and we are expecting to grow this quarter. And the third client, the extent of the hit is smaller compared to the hit that we have had in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically, what drives the confidence of growth in BFSI going forward? Who will contribute to the growth, do you see the clients that you have erstwhile seen not performing and giving you hits actually as contributing to growth as well or do you expect them to remain flat at current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, there are three factors which have contributed to the decline in revenues, because it's not about only growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I am talking specific to BFSI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. With respect to BFSI, there are three factors which contributed to the issues in Q1. One is these two clients I talked about in Q4. The second one is the banking client who is going through the demerger, the third one is the product revenues came down substantially from Q4 to Q1.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at our pipeline, we see definitive growth in these two clients, out of the three. And in the third client, we have quantified the extent of hit we are going to take. That's understood. And then, a number of other clients have grown during Q1 also and they are in a ramp up stage, and they have contributed to wipe out the drop in Q1 also. So, we are going to see growth in those clients. Also in the product business, we think we will grow in Q2 compared to Q1. So, all of this put together, there is confidence that we'll grow in Q2.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the employee addition point of view, what we have stated is we will be adding 30 to 35,000 gross during this particular year. And as far as quarter one is concerned, we have added 8,982 and we are on track.</p>

          <p>Overall, if you remember, last year we had offered 22,400-odd offers for the campus recruits, and they would be joining &#x2013; some of them have joined and the rest of them would be joining through the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Just one question and comment up for a follow-up later. SG&amp;A, we have seen a significant drop this quarter. Do you expect SG&amp;A to remain at current levels of percentage of revenue going into the year, or do you expect some increases as you continue to invest in the group?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, as I have said, we have focused on this cost containment program and we expect the results to continue to show.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Nagarajan. The next question is from the line of Mr. Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. One of the things that just sort of jumps out of the numbers as I look at the net addition of new clients, it appears to be one of the lowest numbers. You guys have been running around 50 per quarter over the last couple of quarters. This quarter's number seems to be one of the lowest. Can you just talk a little bit about what that trajectory of the new clients would mean in terms of overall growth as you kind of think about this going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think it's a good question. Fundamentally there has been no change in terms of the quality of the clients we are adding. The large-scale clients, where we develop deep relationships, the client additions continue to be normal as we have had in the past quarters. We also have clients who are on a one-off project basis, and there has been a decrease in the addition of some of those clients where we add one-off projects. And I think other than this, we think the client addition is on course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a way to think about this &#x2013; maybe even though there's less number of clients, are they &#x2013; the number of the net new clients that are coming on line, are they potentially bigger clients? And is that why we shouldn't worry about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the point is right. See, actually, we have what is called a target universe. There is a set of companies that in each market we are targeting and then trying to win. And the net client addition that you see is from the target universe, and they are large companies where we expect to grow on a continuous basis. So, that's the reason I said you shouldn't worry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just relative to the margin components, would it be possible to just walk through the pluses and the minuses on the operating margin level? There's a lot of different numbers. I just want to make sure I have gotten the data there correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Julio, as I said, the operating margin, we started with plus 22.32 for last quarter and SG&amp;A efficiencies contributed 2.17% positive. Foreign exchange impact was 2.3% positive, freight impact was 1.96% negative, pricing and productivity was 2.94% negative, onsite shift was 17 basis points negative and therefore, totally 26 basis points negative, making a Q1 '09 operating margin of 22.06%.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Quinteros. The next question is from the line of Ms. Kanchana Vydianathan from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my first question is, starting with respect to your large deal signing, in the past three quarters, you've continued to sign these large deals. Can you help us understand now, are these large deals, are they ramping up on track as to the way you expected or just given the economy, are you seeing a slowdown even in the ramp-up of these large deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The ramp-up is quite good. Actually, if you really look at the metrics, we announced a number of deals in the manufacturing sector last quarter, and in Q3. And you see the effect of that ramp-up, almost more than a 30% growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis on the manufacturing sector. And as you see, retail again, we've had a significant growth this quarter because the ramp-up is happening in both in the deal we announced in the UK last quarter and also in the deal we announced in the US in Q3 last year. So the ramp-ups are happening, all of those are on track. Also we will see such kind of ramp-up in the utility sector on the deals we announced towards the end of last quarter. The initial phase is over in Q1. So we expect to see that ramp-up producing results in Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. One other question, I guess, with respect to -as the quarter progresses and as you continue to have conversations with the clients, can you help us understand, did anything change during the course of the quarter where the tone with the clients and even the decision making process, did it accelerate during the quarter and then again, are you seeing a slowdown? Or I guess if you were to compare, in the month of March, what happened in June, and even right now, what are you seeing? I mean, are you a little more positive now? Or are you still feeling the same, with respect to delays in client decision-making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are two points I want to make. The good news to us is that we identified issues with the two clients. And then the demerger of the European bank was also very well known. And the issues we had in the financial services sector clients stayed with these clients. No new issues we identified. So, to that extent it was as anticipated. The other side, the caution is that the financial services industry is still in a turmoil in the US. So if &#x2013; are we sure that there will not be any specific client situations? We can't answer that question. As of today, we have not identified any other specific situation with any other client. So to that extent, we are confident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing, with respect to the slowdown, are you experiencing any such slowdown in any of the other verticals, and also if you were to look at Europe, are you seeing any impact from those regions as well, except--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think interestingly, if you look at Europe &#x2013; even in this quarter, if you look at the deck that we have put out on the Web, there are deals we have announced even in the financial services sector and those deals have come from Europe. So even in the financial services sector, we are seeing deals getting closed. So we have announced three deals will be &#x2013; in that segment in the &#x2013; as part of the deck. As we said, we are continuing to see wins across other sectors. In total, we closed 12 large deals during Q1, three of which is above $75 million. So I think barring the caution that Ram said, and I also articulated again, with specific client situations that may arise that we don't know of. I think it's all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Vydianathan. The next question is from the line of Mr. Pankaj Kapoor from ABN AMRO. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Chandra. First a couple of questions on the three clients you mentioned. You spoke of two turning the corner and one European bank which is still in the researching mode. Is it right, or is this client included in the two who have turned the corner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there are the three clients. The two &#x2013; the two clients on the European bank.  These three too we expect to grow during Q2. In one of them, we will have issues. See, you should also know that the European bank is going to restructuring. We will start this procedure at three different clients going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that one in which we are sourcing issues, is it a client in which we have been facing problems for the last two quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This problem, we started towards the end of Q4 and we did say it in the analyst call that we are seeing problems with this clients. There will be &#x2013; there is likely to be a ramp down and that happened in Q1, and is going to continue in Q2. We think that somewhere in the middle of Q2, we should be through with that. But we have quantified exactly what we &#x2013; we had discussions with the client. We exactly know what their focus area is, what is it that they are dropping in terms of projects, discretionary spend, so that's quantified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just next on the pricing environment, you spoke of stability and you're seeing that the stability may continue happening. One of the factors you have mentioned is that the asset leverage solutions sales was slower this quarter, which led to the overall pricing decline. You're saying that going forward, this class again may see lower spend given the uncertainties that we have. So the pricing may be still continued and under pressure even going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think so, because it must been seen in light of the revenues increases we have had in the product business in Q4. So if you really look at it, we did have a growth in the asset leverage solutions from Q3 to Q4, and then it did drop this quarter for the reasons I explained. We think from the current levels, it will grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should it be right to assume that the blended pricing actually see a peak from now going forward from the current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it is definitely stable at these levels. And, you know, we don't give absolute numbers, but from this level, because all of the time and material contract that we have, there is no decline at all in pricing. So I think at this level, it will be stable. And if we managed to win a lot of transformation business going forward, then it can see a positive bias, but not at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I had just one question on the cost management. I was just trying to understand that what is the rationale which is driving this, given that the currency is already giving us some leverage. So in this environment, while we are cutting out on the SG&amp;A expenses instead of probably reinvesting it into the business. So can you just help us understand what's driving the rationale behind the cost cutting and where do you see this moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we have a fairly good position in that. It is really on the administrative aspect that we are cutting down. We are not cutting down on any of the selling or pre-selling activities. So that we are fairly clear about and we have had events and so on even in the last quarter where we continue to drive. And the new structure itself is focusing on a lot of selling orientations. And therefore, the success of this program has been &#x2013; these are quite reasonably good because the &#x2013; it has been reasonably good because in spite of increasing our focus on the selling activity, we are able to ensure that we hit a much better reduction in the other costs. Also, the new organizational structure brings in certain amount of consolidations and that eventually is driving also the cost reduction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Kapoor. The next question is from the line of Mr. Anthony Miller from Arete Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Well, I've got one question in two parts, so you can spread it among yourselves as you wish. But, one, first of all, on the banking products business, that you said suffered delays in the quarter, yet Infosys, they saw their banking products business expand in the quarter. And I can't quite reconcile the two. Why do you think that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can talk about our pipeline. And in some of the deals that we are pursuing in the developed markets, that have been delays in decision-making in this quarter and that's what we have experienced. And having said that, we are very bullish about the opportunities for the banking products business. We have a large portfolio of that product. So we expect to see an update, but in this quarter, we did face delays in decision making, that's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Were you losing business to Infosys in particularly in the banking products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not that I know of during this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question is on BPO. We've had a couple of big BPO deals in the UK which were awarded recently. Obviously, there's the big one at Aviva, which WNS won, and then very recently, NHS Choice, which went to Capita. Now, I do know that TCS did throw its hat into the ring on NHS Choice. Can you let us know whether you were bidding for the Aviva business? And more generally, how your BPO, particularly your U.K. BPO business, is progressing, because other than Sun Life, we haven't really have seen &#x2013; seen much since?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, to answer your first question, in general, we do not talk about specific clients or specific deals for both confidentiality reasons and also for competitive reasons. So we do not talk about specific clients or specific deals.</p>
          <p>Overall, if you look at the BPO business, the strategy that we articulated is going on extremely well. We had three important elements. One is, we don't do voice business. We predominantly do processing work. Second one is, we look for integrated IT and transaction processing opportunities. Third one is the platform play. And apart from the insurance platform, we have announced our HR platform. It is gaining a lot of traction. And we are on the verge of closing two or three deals where we have been short listed under the contract negotiation. So we should be announcing some deals in the BPO platforms going forward. So overall, I think our strategy is to do integrated IT BPO deals, transaction-intensive and platform-opportunistic and that is going on very well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Are you expecting to see any new deals on the Diligenta platform this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you Mr. Miller. The next question is from the line of Ms. Mitali Ghosh from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Firstly, I just wanted to understand the pricing environment a little better. I heard the comments in the quarter. But have you seen any customers coming back for renegotiation of prices maybe mid-term or even at the time of the end of the contract? And what is the situation in terms of maybe ramping up volumes with that coming as a comment to the sort of volume discount? If you could comment in a little bit of detail on what you're seeing customer behavior at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two points, Mitali. The first one is that we have not had any renegotiations during the quarter of &#x2013; that is renegotiations which are not due of any kind, that we have reduced rates or anything, none of that. The second point is that we've had a couple of renewals of large clients and there also, we have not had any decrease in rates. The pricing has been stable. So that's my view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And when you say stable, it's not sort of linked &#x2013; that doesn't have any implicit volume discount either that your customers are asking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. It is not the rate for our &#x2013;  the realization has not come down. In fact, it has not &#x2013; there has been no decrease due to volume discount or any other spin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Then, secondly on the manufacturing and retail, I just wanted to understand, manufacturing is seeing good traction. So if you can give us some color in terms of what kind of sub-verticals they are outsourcing and where is the demand really coming from? And you also mentioned retail is growing well, which is interesting given the environment. Maybe if you can talk a bit about what you're seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the manufacturing, we did announce a few wins last fiscal year, one large auto deal we talked about and that has ramped up and continuing to ramp up and you are seeing the revenues coming in. And then there was an auto part supplier in the automotive sector, we announced another large win and that ramp-up is beginning to happen. And then, we also talked about the win in the metals area and that again is beginning to ramp up towards the end of Q1, and we will see more ramp-ups in Q2. And we also announced another large win in the auto sector during this quarter, Q1, as part of the results of that ramp-up also will begin sometime in Q2.</p>
          <p>So it's the auto sector, engineering clients, and also we are seeing growth in our EAS. This quarter, it increased from Q4 to Q1. Also, you will see that as a percentage of TCS revenue, the EAS group grew this quarter and there also, we have seen traction.</p>
          <p>In terms of the retail, we did announce a large deal in the UK and that ramp-up is happening and you saw some of those revenues flowing in, in Q1 revenues. And also, we were engaged in a very large transformation program and that went live. We also mentioned it as part of the revenue highlights this quarter and revenues from that came in and we have got some follow-on contract. So the retail sector is primarily related to outsourcing of ADM and we're seeing a lot of IES and BPO opportunities in the retail sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just finally, if I can check on just the momentum you are seeing in the market in terms of, let's say, in the last three months. Are you seeing the sort of deal pipeline additions increasing or any client &#x2013; further delays? If you can just talk a bit about incrementally, what is the kind of customer situation in terms of ramp-ups, new deals, delays in decision-making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Mitali, our position has been articulated already. I think Ram also mentioned it, I also mentioned it, I'll mention it again. We think the situation is very specific client-related. That's the way we see it. So we have got to watch clients carefully and we talked about three specific client situations in the BFSI sector, about which I given enough commentary. Apart from that, at this point in time, there is no specific client situation that I have to share with you that causes concern, so that the deal pipeline is a combination of growth from our existing clients by cross-selling our portfolio of services, plus the new deals. On the new deal pipeline, we have mentioned that we are pursuing about 20 deals of significant size at this point in time, qualified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so you would say there is no slowdown in the pace of decision making or new deal flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am saying, so &#x2013; would you say that there is no slowdown in the pace of client decision making or new deal addition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That &#x2013; we have said that in terms of large scale transformation projects, from client to client, it varies. I cannot make a industry statement, but specific clients can take that view. And so we have got to be &#x2013; well so really what we are doing is that we are identifying opportunities with each client and there are clients focused on sourcing optimization and IT systems transformation. So we are proactively approaching those clients with both set of offerings.</p>
          <p>And there are clients who are interested in enterprise transformation like going to a single instance with SAP R and single instance Oracle and we are approaching those clients with those opportunities. There are other clients who want a complete infrastructural rationalization like server consolidation, et cetera. So our whole sales process has become much more final and that's what we are doing with our sales teams. Ram, you want to add?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Having said that, Mitali, one has to be also conscious of the happenings on the ground and any day, any news and the bad news can hit any company. So we need to be conscious of that, that's the caution and to be cautious, personally I would like to articulate.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Thank you so much. I think that's been really helpful.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Ghosh. The next question is from the line of Mr. Harmendra Gandhi from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions. So, Chandra, so next quarter, we should look at one client where the restructuring is happening, you have quantified the downfall or whatever, the slowdown, so we should look at a normal quarter &#x2013; at this point of time, you are looking at a normal quarter in line with industry growth rate for the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First is that we don't give quarterly guidance or annual guidance. The second thing is that in terms of any specific client situations, we do not comment. Otherwise, we think &#x2013; we expect things to be on the normal course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, what was the &#x2013; I think Maha gave some figures, if the rupee stays at current level, including the premium which is around INR45, what will be the Forex &#x2013; what will the P&amp;L impact on the Forex loss during the next three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, of course, the Rupee is around 43 and I was predicting it at 43. The 45 figure I mentioned is in terms of the rate at which we have mark-to-market. So, anyway, as far as the total loss that may come, that's the maximum one. At the 43 was 90 growth of Rupees, for the rest of the year put together. And I gave a breakup. It was actually 15 in Q2 and 21 in Q3 and 20 in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Gandhi. The next question is from the line of Mr. James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Mr. Friedman, your line has been un-muted, please go ahead with your question.</p>
          <p>There appears to be no response from this participant. The next question is from the line of Mr. Moshe Katri from Cowen &amp; Co. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. I just want to say, nice execution in a challenging environment. First, last quarter when you had your conference call and also during the Investor Day, you spoke still about project cancellation, delays, and deferrals and we are not hearing that commentary this quarter. Should we read in anything into this, and I guess this questioning is in line with some of the other questioning about your tone and your feeling about the outlook? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; if you really look at this quarter results, there are three, four messages to pick up. The first message is that we expected certain hits in specific clients in the financial services based on what we read, towards the end of last quarter. And we couldn't exactly quantify at this point in time, but it had happened in only those clients. And we took those hit and we know exactly what to look for with these clients in Q2, both in terms of the growth in a couple of clients and even the third client, so that's one piece.</p>
          <p>The second piece is that, in spite of that hit in the major markets, we've grown 2.2% dollar terms. In fact, if you take the US alone, the growth there has been higher. So that has been a positive thing for us. The third thing is that the revenues have come to compensate in other verticals, especially manufacturing, retail, hi-tech have played a good role during the quarter. And the deal price lend in those industries are also quite healthy. So these are the data points we have, and that is why we have given the commentary that we've given. I really don't know what else to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No that's fine, that's understood. And then going back to all the questions about pricing, have you &#x2013; last quarter, you spoke about free transition, there was a lot of, obviously, controversy that, that term kind of created. Have we seen any instances of free transition this quarter? And then, are you seeing any irrational pricing from your competitors? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is that &#x2013; now that everyone is in the call, it is rather unfortunate that we didn't take a little bit of time to explain in the last quarter what we meant and I think subsequently, I think we've spent enough time on it giving the details. That particular situation we talked about is behind us. The transition is through and we're in steady state in that contract. Now coming to pricing, as I said, the environment is stable. We have had a couple of normal business encore renewals this quarter, and they've gone off quite okay. With respect to undercutting, etcetera, that's a very deal specific, company specific, it is very difficult to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and nice quarter.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Katri. The next question is from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I just had actually two quick questions here. First, just to be clear, I think that this is the point that you guys are trying to make. In your present client base, you've seen or you've already &#x2013; you kind of have some visibility on what the potential issues are with those three clients, but you feel pretty secure with the rest of them. And I think the cautious tone that you're taking is based on the overall economic environment. Is that about accurate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's quite accurate and the cautious tone is based on the economic environment and more and more financial services clients are coming over their results on their situations. Whenever we read about in the papers, et cetera, then we have got to analyze deeply. If they happen to be our client, there has got to be a lot of analysis whenever we read them. That's why we take this cautiously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But budgets for the most part are closed, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly here, I think you talked about your recruiting plans for fiscal 2010 and you had about 22,000 campus offers out there. Last year, how many campus offers did you make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year also, it was around the same number that it was previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So how can we &#x2013; what should we extrapolate from those particular numbers? Are you expecting pricing to be up, are you expecting demand to be up? How would you make up for relatively stable numbers? I am just curious as to how we should look at those two numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One is I think there are three different angles in which we look at those. First one is that we definitely want to increase the productivity, so we have started initiatives to bring growth that delinks the addition. One of the initiatives is the products business, so we expect to do more business with the products business this year than the last fiscal for example, so that's one.</p>
          <p>The second one to look at it is that we still have levers on the utilization, okay? While we continue to operate between 77 to 79%, it is one thing to say that you have to be at the 77 to 79% on a particular number, then you are not growing. But on our base, that is a significant number. We are about 115,000 people and even if you take 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82%, still, we have a substantial number of people.</p>
          <p>So on our base, there is opportunity to flexibly maneuver the utilization number depending upon the demand. So the sensible thing to do for us in the current macroeconomic environment is to stick to the number that we talked about. We are on course, we have not reduced it but we have kept it. Rama, particularly in the beginning of the year, it was during the Q4 call, why we were putting the number same as last fiscal year. And that is something that we'll continue to monitor and then see where it goes. But we've got levers, which we can very, very opportunely apply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just real quickly, the new clients that you're adding, what is the reasoning behind there, reason for going to you? Is it to save costs or what are you hearing from them? And thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a combination. There are customers who are going for transformation. By transformation, I mean it could be sourcing optimization, in some cases where there is a lot of fuel outsourcing required. And there may be situations where they want to go for a single instance ERP, for example. And we have one client, with 100 instances &#x2013; more than 100 instances of ERP, we're trying to bring it on to a much smaller number.</p>
          <p>There may be situations in which we are doing large scale fixed price projects like this pharmacy application we have delivered, which is more than 250 <mark type="inaudible" /> of work. Overall, the value proposition is delivering excellence. Clients love us for the way we deliver and that's been a significant value proposition, whether it is maintenance or whether it is transformation. Also, the full services play is still playing out. We continue to get these where we do IT services, as well as infrastructure, leveraging our global presence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foresi. The last question for this evening is from the line of Mr. Sandeep Shah from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just on the hedging side, wanted to confirm this 4.08 billion is being reference to the rate of 45 and you said if it is 43, then it is 1.68 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. Yes. That is right, but when you essentially mark-to-market, you follow a certain practice in terms of the value you take and that is what I mentioned that it would be at the rate of 45. But, yes, the main point that I was making was that people were getting really concerned about this kind of thing. The &#x2013; it has proved when I hold anything to maturity, it becomes lot less expensive and we are not getting out of any positions. Our hedge ratio is also small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this next three quarters, you said roughly around 90 crores, so this is a part of 4.08 billion or it's a part of 1.68 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>4.08 becomes 1.68.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>1.68.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because when I hold to maturity, rather than go through that, it get immediately reduces to 1.67, of which 90 or 900 is really in this financial year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you also talked about the tax credit received during this quarter. Can you actually quantify this amount?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax credit was in the order of about INR350 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>INR350 million, and it's been included in the tax provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it does reduce the tax provision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, sir, lastly, just based on the deal pipeline, and looking at the outlook given by the NASCOM, as well as one of your competitors, do you believe this year you will able to achieve that growth rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, we don't give guidance and I think we have shared a fair bit of information about the environment, about what we see specifically with our clients, and what we see specifically in the deal pipeline. So we don't want to give annual guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, the NASCOM estimate that you get is a consensus from member companies. We happen to be the largest member company of NASCOM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So we expect the rest of the three quarters to be as normal as that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks and all the best.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Shah. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to hand the floor over to Mr. David Nelson and the TCS Management for their final remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Rochelle. I'd like to pass or turn the mike over to Mr. Ramadorai for concluding remarks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. All I want to summarize is that there are global macroeconomic factors which will certainly be leading to uncertainty and that's the reason for our cautious optimism and caution. Having said this, the demand for IT services are there and there will be certainly opportunities for growth. Like I said, cost efficiencies and focus on customers is going to be the key. And we'll continue to dialogue with our customers and communicate our value proposition very clearly. Hopefully, we will be generating demand in the future. Thank you so much for being with us on the call.</p>
