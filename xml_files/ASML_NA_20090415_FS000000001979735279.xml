        <plist>
          <p>Thank you operator, and good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at ASML. I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast. As the operator mentioned, the subject of today's call is ASML's 2009 first quarter results. Hosting today's call are Eric Meurice, ASML's CEO, and Peter Wennink, ASML's CFO.</p>
          <p>At this time I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and first quarter results presentation, both of which you can find on our website at www.asml.com. This statement will cover today's call as well as today's ASML publications. The length of the call will be 60 minutes. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Craig. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you all for attending our Q1 2009 results conference call. Peter and I, as usual, would like to provide you an overview, some commentary on the quarter before we open up for questions.</p>
          <p>Peter will start with a review of our performance in Q1 with added comments as to the short-term outlook and I will conclude -- complete the introduction with some further details on our near-term strategy. So following this introduction, we will then open the call to questions. So Peter, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Eric, and welcome to everyone. First of all, I would like to review some of the events of the last quarter as well as some details on our first quarter results. The collapse of the semiconductor equipment demand continued in the first quarter due to the reduced end demand for semiconductor devices and the associated industry response of utilization reductions, capacity adjustments and inventory corrections.</p>
          <p>In spite of these exceptional economic circumstances, we were able to maintain our business focus in generating cash while continuing our high level of R&amp;D commitment, by creating and delivering all intended new products. Our first quarter sales of &#x20AC;184 million were within our guided range. We shipped a total of 11 systems, seven of which were new and four used. Amongst the new systems there was only one immersion tool causing a moderate new system ASP of &#x20AC;13.8 million with the ASP of all systems being &#x20AC;9.2 million.</p>
          <p>Limited purchases of performance upgrade options for systems installed in the field, and reduced tool utilization, impacted our service revenues this quarter, as our total net service and field option revenues came in at around &#x20AC;83 million.</p>
          <p>Unit orders in Q1 remained low at eight systems, but provided a book-to-bill in value terms of about two with a net bookings total of &#x20AC;207 million. The net average sales price of orders booked was &#x20AC;25.8 million, including seven immersion systems. This leaves our order backlog as of March 31 at &#x20AC;853 million with a total of 38 systems, 25 of which are immersion.</p>
          <p>The company's first quarter gross margin was close to 7%, which was the direct result of the extremely low level of sales. We maintained our focus on R&amp;D with a spend of &#x20AC;118 million, which is a 7% efficiency reduction from the fourth quarter of 2008, with SG&amp;A expenses coming in at &#x20AC;41 million, that's a 12% reduction from the fourth quarter last year and a 30% reduction as compared to the run rate in the middle of last year.</p>
          <p>Net cash from operations was 82 million. Cash flows were positively impacted by management of our working capital and the cost structure, which was offset somewhat by lengthening of receivable collection periods and continued capital expenditure for the completion of a new manufacturing facility. This facility is needed for future generations of lithography, most notably EUV.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with &#x20AC;1.15 billion in cash, an increase as expected over the fourth quarter of last year. To support the financing of our activities in EUV development and the production ramp, ASML has signed a &#x20AC;200 million loan facility with the European Investment Bank. This floating rate facility can be drawn on in tranches within the next 18 months and is repayable in annual installments after four years with the final payment seven years after drawdown.</p>
          <p>As far as -- for our outlook, although we do not expect to see a full-blown recovery at this time, we are beginning to see the first sign of the return of lithography technology buys. It is most evident in the area of 45 nanometer technology transitions of our foundry customers and the 5x nanometer transition of our DRAM customers. The fact that some of our customers have been able to access the capital markets may also prove to be helpful.</p>
          <p>This cautionary turn to some level of technology buys enables the shrink roadmaps as defined by our different customer segments. The litho spend to support these roadmaps is modeled at the quarterly revenue level of between 4 and &#x20AC;500 million, which could potentially be reached somewhere in the second half of this year. In this respect, our Q2 immersion bookings and the current order growth activity gives us some level of comfort.</p>
          <p>We expect Q2 2009 net sales to fall in a range of 210 to &#x20AC;230 million, with gross margins expected at around 9%, again reflecting a very low level of sales level. R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses are again expected to be at &#x20AC;118 million and &#x20AC;41 million, respectively. We expect cash from operations and investments to be neutral over the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>And as a closing remark, we'd like to inform you that our proposal presented at our 2009 general meeting of shareholders, to declare a dividend of &#x20AC;0.20 per share which is approximately &#x20AC;86 million, was accepted and has meanwhile been paid.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn it back over to Eric for more on our strategy for the coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Peter. So indeed Q1 provided an extremely challenging environment for all semiconductor capital equipment companies, not only ASML.</p>
          <p>Our customers froze new equipment purchases. They basically virtually waited for market directions as to their own end demand led to their inventory of semiconductors correct to current demand level, optimize their installed base usage, either idling or transferring some of the capacity to a more aggressive set of processing layers of nodes, which although not very, very efficient was possible in view of the low overall capacity utilization rates.</p>
          <p>We have now started, however, to see some signs where overall need for capacity is catching up with the installed base. There is indeed some spurts semiconductor demand, you may have heard, from China at this point. There is some inventory catch-up leading to increased utilization, but most importantly, we see that technology transition activity, not yet orders, but activity is picking up. Certainly the fact that the end customer semiconductor demand is starting to stabilize with an ever growing mix towards new product, that means transition to new nodes, is forcing installed base upgrades.</p>
          <p>As of last year, only the leaders had invested a bit of capacity in 45 nanometer Flash, 55 nanometer DRAM or 45 nanometer Foundry Logic. The rest of the market is now organizing their conversions during this year, 2009. And during this year, the leaders themselves, who had already started these conversions are now involved in even more aggressive conversion, namely 35 nanometer Flash and 45 nanometer DRAM development. And these things will materialize also this year.</p>
          <p>The founding of TMC in Taiwan, although certainly not resolving the DRAM industry consolidation that some had expected, is in any event clarifying the playing field and is triggering technology investment planning by the different players, who have been holding their investment, waiting to see what TMC's influence would be.</p>
          <p>We have modeled the market needs for those lithography technology transition, as you know, it's our old traditional model. And as Peter confirmed again today, we believe that ASML revenues of between 400 and &#x20AC;500 million per quarter would support these technology transitions that we expect this year. We believe that we will see this level of lithography equipment revenue therefore reached within the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>In other terms, we confirm our views, voiced at the beginning of the global economic crisis, that after numbers of month of extraordinary low level of sales like we are having in Q1, ASML will stabilize on technology buy levels until capacity picks up. So in other terms, we saw three phases, a very low sales phase, that we are currently suffering through; a stabilization at a higher level when the industry, even through recession, will still need a minimum numbers of technology transitions, which are the numbers we just mentioned, 400 to 500 million per quarter. And then only after we get out of recession, the capacity buys picking up and adding up to these bases.</p>
          <p>We are certainly not seeing the capacity pick up at this time, but we see the broad technology buy types. We are therefore continuing our investments in new products, targeting introduction of our new cost-effective platform called the XT4 and the new double-patterning platform, called the NXT this year, as well as the delivery of five EUV tools for -- that we have on order for 2010.</p>
          <p>We are also introducing a new suite of lithography-aware design and manufacturing tools supported by our Brion subsidiary, aimed at making full use of the litho hardware architectures that we have provided. This quarter we have even proved a first in the industry. We have proved an EUV imaging with full &#x2013; first full field system at image size of 28 nanometer dense lines, which were presented at the SPIE Advanced Lithography conference in February.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have been confronted with a demand freeze in the very short term and we now see the first signs of and are preparing for a pickup of technology purchases. These sales level will enable us to continue our downturn management strategy, which we prepare for a broader recovery or while we prepare for a broader recovery of the semiconductor industry in general.</p>
          <p>During this period, we intend to not burn cash, maintain our technology investment leadership and work on our costs structure efficiency for the future. So with this, Peter and I will be pleased to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get in as many callers as possible in the time allotted. Now, operator could we have your instructions and then the first question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Today's first question is from Mr. Nicolas Gaudois. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Nicolas Gaudois at UBS. First question is a clarification of &#x2013; follow-up, a clarification is -- of over 25 immersion tools in backlog, how much is new and how much is refurbished? And if could remember or recall for us what it was for 19 in Q4. And a follow-up question is where we look at your, at least 400 to &#x20AC;500 million of revenues quarter run-rate at some point in H2 is orders at hand for immersion plus refurbished business, non-immersion plus refurbished revenues basically should secure you about &#x20AC;400 million per quarter of revenues in Q3, Q4.</p>
          <p>And I guess anything incremental from here into Q3 could be incremental and effectively give these revenues towards the higher side. Or inversely, one could say at the lower end of this 400 to 500 assumes that quite conservatively any orders coming through here would be effectively offset by push outs. So if you could comment on that, but firstly maybe clarify your backlog for immersion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Peter, can you clarify the immersion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 25 immersion tools are split between 23 new tools and two refurbs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I think your question was, should we go under 400 or would there be turns in Q2 that we will materialize in Q3. At this moment, we do not expect at all any push out. We understand, of course, every of those key projects for Q3 and Q4. So we are pretty solid as to above 400. And yes, we are expecting a certain numbers of turns, but we do not know how many, which is why we've guided between 400 and 500. Those turns means orders which will be received -- some orders which will be received into Q2 and into Q3 for deliveries in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Q4 also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess, a reasonable vagueness of what you said on revenues depends -- is basically a timing issue more than anything else on these things coming back and wherever we land in Q3, Q4, potentially slip in Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, again in the mobilization of life that we have, we see no real possibility for customers to delay those ramps that -- you know what I'm talking about when I say leaders are already converted in 55 nanometer DRAM, which means the second players definitively have to be in the business of 55 nanometer this year. We would not expect a significant slips into Q1 of these things, which is why again -- but again, we've brushed a guidance of between 400 and 500 to have some leeway into what it could be, but we'd be highly surprised if it is -- in fact we do not expect it to be lower than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Simon Sch&#xE4;fer. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. It's Goldman Sachs. Just a, kind of same vein of question really. In order to get to this 450 or between 400 and 500 in quarterly revenue, are you expecting your Q2 backlog to be up, do you need your Q2 backlog to be up sequentially to achieve that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it would be natural, yes. But we have seen even in the Q2 timeframe, we are seeing some customers with requests for turns within three months. So you could imagine a certain numbers of orders which will be discussed with the customers within Q2, which will not be booked into Q2 because we would still negotiating a specification or something, and we will ship immediately in Q3. So you cannot mathematically immediately say that what we will book -- we will book in fact all the orders for Q3 into Q2. I could expect in the current situation, discussions. But there would be more technical discussions than they are need discussions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then also Simon, I would like to add to that, coming out of this period, every customer assumes that we're drowning in inventory. And that also puts a bit of a pressure on us to actually ship quick, which actually drives this turns business as Eric calls this also. Now that's not always the case, because sometimes the tools that we have in inventory area different configuration that they want, so we need to remodel them. But that is also one of the reasons why customers have the impression that they don't need to honor our standard lead times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, thanks. And my follow-up question would be, just wondering what the infamous ASML model is saying about supply and demand in DRAM and in NAND for the second half of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The famous model --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I may have misspoken that. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the famous model has an input, which is in fact your question, which is what is the rate of growth of DRAM and Flash. And then from that rate of growth we input in the model, we find out how many machines we need and then we can issue a guidance.</p>
          <p>Okay, if you ask your question differently, if we ship 500, it's 450 million in Q3 and 450 million in Q4, how much capacity will we have created in the world of DRAM, Logic and Flash. And the answer is basically near zero, near zero gross. Because these machines will be doing the new critical layers of the new nodes, so in other term, the new node will take 10% more layers, roughly. And these machines will suck out of the current installed based, machines which will be used for the same node but non-critical layers, and those machines will be less efficient in the new usage.</p>
          <p>So the total numbers of wafers out will be smaller or in fact say, about the same. So in other terms, 450 million twice would not add wafer capacity. Of course, it will add bit capacity and there is -- and to be honest I don't know the exact number at this moment, but we are not concerned about bits ourself, as you know we're concerned about square meters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But maybe I didn't express my question appropriately, just in terms of what is the -- what the installed base is today, do you think the industry is undersupplying compared to what demand may yield in the fourth quarter, which is allowing you to think that capacity orders may indeed return sometime in early 2010? Or is that too premature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, not because I know anything about the numbers of unit, but because I know the mix towards new nodes that shrinks in fact the capacity available. So I know that at this moment, if you project another six months and if you project those transition to tighter nodes, there will be not enough capacity in the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. James Crawshaw. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. It's James Crawshaw, S&amp;P Equity Research. The question was on the impact on gross margins from the shift in mix towards immersion. I can see that clearly it's a higher ASP product, but interested to know what the sort of variable margin is. If I look at your guidance for the second quarter for 9% gross margins, and look at the revenue that you are guiding to, it looks like a -- an &#x20AC;8 million increase in gross profits on a &#x20AC;36 million increase in sales, which is a variable margin of just 22%. Perhaps you should help explain why we wouldn't see a bigger increase in gross profits given that revenue uptick in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can not project with any certainty the gross margin on such a very, very, very, very, very, very exceptionally low level of sales which we are having in Q1 and Q2. You can imagine that if you sell one more used unit or one less, or you have a slight change of mix, and I told you that there was a bit of a discussion at this moment with customers about which specification they really want. If you take of course a machine for which we have inventory, versus a machine that we have to rush with new components, all this, on a ten machine business, will make your margin go up or down by five points or so, without you being able to make a translation on the trend.</p>
          <p>So, I would like to go back to a normalized margin when we are above 500, 600 and by then we will get back to a business, as I said all the time which will be managed beyond 40% gross margin. But as I say, under this -- at such level of sales, you can't -- you cannot project anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on top of that, 45% of that number for Q2 is based on service sales, and spare parts sales and option sales, which of course is currently in our planning. But that can also change in terms of the mix. So the granularity that you want to put into, let's say trying to explain the gross margin, like Eric said, at these very low sales level that -- that is not very useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perhaps as a follow-up then, if we reach your targeted level by the fourth quarter of 400s or &#x20AC;450 million of sales. What sort of gross margin would you expect to be generating on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer. We had last quarter call, we explained a bit our cost base. We said we have a cost base of about 280 million, as a matter of fact, it's a bit lower today. Well, let's say we said then 280 million which was split between 120 million of -- you could say fixed cost which is, people, running costs of the factory, service, cost of our service people, 120 million which is in cost of goods.</p>
          <p>And we have -- that is the remainder, 160 million is R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. Now you can see for R&amp;D and SG&amp;A we're a bit lower than that 160 million. But, so when we are then at 400 or &#x20AC;500 million level, we are targeting what we call a direct material margin of anywhere, let's say around 55 to 60%. Now, if you then take the material margin of that sales number and you subtract the 120 million of let's say, fixed costs, you can calculate the area of where we will be in our gross margin target.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, JPMorgan. Eric, with respect to the orders, would now say that in terms of the technology buys at least, that the order intake in technology buys has bottomed out and you expect now for the rest of the year the technology buys to be improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's so bad today that I can answer with a big wholehearted yes, we expect a pickup for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the order intake, do you see any -- I mean is it across the board within the DRAM and NAND companies or is it mainly the DRAM companies because they haven't really bought tools as yet? And within the DRAM companies itself, do you see them across the board making shift towards an existing order, or is it still just touching the feet into this -- into the new waters really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's mainly DRAM, although it is true that as you may know some Koreans, companies make it a bit difficult for us to know if those machine goes at the last moment to DRAM or Flash. But from what we know and in particular, because potentially the ones I'm talking about early on are not Korean.</p>
          <p>I would say the immersion will be driven by DRAM 55 nanometer nodes. But clearly the leaders, as I say, who have already invested in 55, are starting to develop the new nodes which is 45-ish nanometer DRAM and 35 nanometer Flash and those one will probably trigger the second batch of orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then to follow up, in terms of the second batch of orders, you expect them to come in the next couple of quarters, in this current quarter and the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is exactly where the uncertainty of life is now, where we would not be surprised by about 450, 450, but we could be surprised with 500, 400. We could be surprised with 400, 500, of this nature, and all this depend on these different timings we were just talking about.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Timothy Acuri. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citi. Hi, couple of things. First of all, if you look at your backlog and if you look at it relative to your current business level and certainly your business level is depressed below typical downturns. But you have a much greater backlog relative to your current business level than you have during virtually every other prior cycle?</p>
          <p>So I'm wondering, does that make you worry that customers will pull from backlog at least kind of out of the gates, so when you're kind of getting to that 4 to &#x20AC;500 million level in Q3 and Q4 that they're pulling from backlog upfront and that your bookings don't in fact lead the industry, that they might lag a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a bit what I was telling you about the difficulty of reading the backlog -- sorry the bookings number, not so much because the customer will take from backlog. At this moment, I would expect the backlog to be remaining fairly consistent around this 800ish million or even growing.</p>
          <p>But I expect turns. So I expect the opposite -- completely the opposite of what you just said that is, the customers for which we have backlog, we know where they are, the spread. In fact, they are more spread than normal on the next three quarters. And you're going to have, in addition to that, a lot of turns.</p>
          <p>So that's how it's going to work which is not abnormal in a recession of that nature when, as Peter said, most of the customers said hey, you guys have inventory and you have capacity. So we're going to take the last moment before we shoot you some orders. That's probably scenarios of the next six months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess kind of that comes down a bit to the fairly big slug right now that's in backlog from the Taiwan DRAM companies because that probably doesn't ship in the back half of the year. So if you strip that out, then there have to be some turns on the kind of other stuff to kind of get you to that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you were trying to hint to me that in the backlog we had anything from Taiwan, the answer is, you may be wrong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I guess my next question is, can you update us on breakeven and on any further plans maybe to take it lower?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we have, we are targeting a breakeven level at around 450, that's for the second half of the year. We are currently in a process of reviewing all activities in pretty granular detail. All activities in the company, the outcome of that process still needs to be internally discussed. So that's something which I'm not going to comment on today, but that's clearly an activity that is ongoing as we speak.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one more, can you give just a little bit of clarity in terms of the four debookings, what -- were they ArF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering when you are going to effectively record bookings of EUV tools, because I understand you plan to ship some in 2010 but that's not yet in the backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. I think, we are conservative in our bookings, even normal situation, the rule is such we would not take bookings longer than 12 months lead time ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... for security purposes. So it is true that in -- we are going to get into the 12 months lead time for EUV. I will probably have a discussion with Peter here, this is the first time the question is asked. I think we're going to take a conservative view as to us being certain of shipping on time, because we still have to prove a certain numbers of concepts with EUV. And when we are reasonably certain that those machines are meeting the target spec, then we probably will recognize that, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, by that time they will be within the 12 month window.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to make sure those -- we have orders for five systems. So those orders are already in. They're not shown in the backlog, because they're outside the 12 month window, but when we get more absolute certainty about shipment time then we're likely within the 12 month window and then they will pop up in the backlog, but we will split them out. So you will see it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Redburn Partners. Thanks very much. Two questions, first one is just on the backlog yet again. I just wondered if you could give any additional granularity on the maturity profile of the immersion backlog in terms of age and particularly on the delivery date, if indeed that's known to you I guess, beyond the next two quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the reason why I think the backlog is more spread than usual, if I'm not mistaken, 60% of the backlog to be shipped in six months which is normally, we're better than that usually but it's a bit more spread, is because we have a large order of immersion machine which is spread longer than that ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...for Flash. The rest is pretty natural.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's no question of orders lingering in the backlog and customers refusing to take delivery and you not being knowing when you can be in a position to deliver them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be -- you always have one or two lingering friends, but yeah, I am looking at the numbers here, no, there is no more lingering then normal in this industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a follow up on NXT and could you give us an idea qualitatively if need be on your expectations for the ramp-up of demand for NXT and how significant it could be in 2010, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so NXT as usual about three months before shipment, we should ship already into July. We are starting to have the normal white hair, where we discover the latest and greatest little issues and nagging problems. So, therefore the first shipments we will do in Q3 will be within Q3 and I think it will be not a high volume. These -- the NXT will prove its overlay, which is supposedly 2 nanometer, which by the way, we have already proven, so we are pretty comfortable with that. And this 2 nanometer will make it the only tool in the world capable of this by a factor, probably 2 to 3 multiplier, that should get it a 100% market share in all serious double-patterning businesses, so that would be 22 nano Logic, 35 Flash, 40 nanometer DRAM.</p>
          <p>So therefore then the volume ramp will depend on when those three nodes are already ramping and that, at this moment, we don't really know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Good afternoon. Niels de Zwart, Fortis Bank, Netherlands. My question would be just be one slight clarification. The 4 to 500 million revenues you are hinting at for the second half of this year on a quarterly basis, they do include your expected shipments of the NXT 1900i, 950i?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Didier from RBS. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd just like to have a clarification on the cash flow, I can see you've taken a charge for inventory obsolescence, I believe of about 23 or 24 million. Did you book that in cost of sales, and therefore did that sort of depress your gross margins, and will that basically flatter perhaps your gross margins at least to a certain degree when this equipment is shipped maybe second half or maybe '010, that's my first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yes. That was a self explanatory question in a sense, yes it is. Your assumption is indeed correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's basically the equipment that we are not selling much at this moment in time. So it's largely on dry equipment, so that's KrF, dry ArF, that type of equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Can you say how many units?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just, it's been parts, modules. So those are not full tools, but there are parts of the tools, modules that we use to assemble the tools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And a follow up maybe, I mean that's the $100 million question that everybody is looking for an answer at this, so I'd like to have your opinion. Why -- you've lowered your cost base. You've done some restructuring, but the chip equipment industry peak-to-peak was flat 2000 to 2007 and if you address for currency, lithography was no different.</p>
          <p>Obviously, ASML is a market share gainer, extremely well-positioned. So my question would be everything else being equal, do you think that your next peak EPS will be higher or lower or the same as 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a billion dollar question. But the answer is --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it is a billion dollar question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have easy questions. The answer is, yes, we expect the EPS to be higher because we expect this crisis to lead us to be more effective on the cost structure. I would prefer not to answer any quantitative question at this moment. And we expect the euro to remain at this current level.</p>
          <p>If you remember our history for five years, the euro has appreciated versus the yen by 60% or something, and we had to eat this 60% inefficiency. So on a stable euro, we would expect that we would gain. So, first of all our cost structure will be better. Secondly, the euro should be stable-ish. And third, we are having new products, in particular, the products coming from Brion, which allow us to think that we sell more value per tool. So, these two -- these three themes should converge in bringing us a better EPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on top of that, I will add that, when we do our work, infamous or famous modeling, on the technology node transition, on the increased number of layers, and on the need for, let's say, NXT double-patterning technology, and from 2012 onwards EUV, we are still highly confident that we can reach our 5 billion sales mark which, of course, is higher than our previous peak so that adds to that significantly also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And 5 billion, how much market share is that and what's the size, the time that you're looking at then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 70% market share. We don't think that we would go further than that. I think there is stability of 70 &#x2013; 30ish. So we don't -- we're not more hungry than that at this moment but -- and therefore the market would be about 7 billion or a bit more.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Credit Suisse. More of a longer term question. I was wondering if you could give an update on what you think is the impact for lithography from self-aligning double patterning? Does this have any impact on how to think about the lithography opportunity as we shrink the 32 nanometer for NAND and 55 for DRAM?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, the -- you have heard a lot of activities by our customers who try to find ways around putting more bits onto a piece of silicon without using the most expensive lithography tool. So some of them have used a self-aligning double patterning, which we also call spacer, which is a way to do simple structures, one-dimensional structures by using lower-cost lithography but more of them. So when you are having a lot of installed base and you do not have utilization, this is the best thing you can do on earth because you use more of the old stuff which is fully amortized so it's zero cost. And you sell off a line so you shrink. So everybody is happy.</p>
          <p>So we see some of that and some of our customers are using this techniques to use, in fact to solve their problem of utilization which is why also potentially we've seen here some customers able to delay. However, self-alignment has two problems, one it is still having a lot of processing steps, so it is costly. And secondly, it is using a lot of capacity. So when the business comes back or when you want to shrink further, you can even do self-alignment with the newest lithography tool and then you are even better.</p>
          <p>So we -- in other terms, we see a bit of a negative impact, if you will, when there is no utilization, when there is utilization then self-aligning double patterning or normal double patterning or single patterning, et cetera, is about the same business for us.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just as a follow up to that, most of the time DRAM and NAND factories run at 100% utilization rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is this comment more applicable for Logic? I mean, from what I hear this technology is more applicable for NAND Flash &#x2013; a lot of the NAND companies running 100% utilization, trying to leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first time in history, in the December timeframe and a bit in Q1, NAND and DRAM did not run at 100% capacity, first time in history. So it's -- and therefore, you have heard the noise about customers saying, well let's use this opportunity to do bit of shrink using the available capacity. But at the moment demand comes back, they get in trouble because they lose market share. So you may have heard one or two of those players starting to complain that during the slight pickup they are losing market share, of course it's good in a sense that the price goes up. But they are -- at this moment some quote, unquote activity to rebuild a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the reason why of course they actually idled their tools and didn't run the fabs at 100% utilization because the sales price for their devices was lower than their cash cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so then lastly do you guys see any activity on lithography repurchases from the used market given that there is at least two or three DRAM factories that are going to come offline from the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so on 200 millimeter this has already started, but the wave of available machinery is so large, the supply is much, much higher than the demand. So we believe that this would be a good market for us to participate into because we are a refurbishing company. As you know we refurbish about five to ten machines per quarter.</p>
          <p>So the market at this moment is more like in the five-ish range. There is going to be a lot of used machine available. And when they find homes, we will be there to refurbish them. But again at this moment the demand is weak, yeah? On the 300 millimeter, you're probably referring only to one company at this moment who has -- who is under protection and they have, I think, two 300 millimeter fab and I guess that they will try to sell their equipment.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Mehdi Hosseini, FBR Capital Markets. In your booking for Q1, it seems to me that the ASPs went up significantly, and I'm just wondering, did you have any EUV tools that was booked in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Those were immersion tools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Immersion tools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So units are pretty much similar to Q4 so it's just higher ASP immersion that drove the 200 and some?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, like we said also during this call and in the press release, we have seen significant or let's say, if you would look at the total bookings it's &#x2013; fairly significant. The demand for immersion tools is driven by the need for the technology transitions that we've talked about -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is 45 nanometer Logic, that's 55 nanometer DRAM conversions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And even in our sub 40 nanometer Flash. And that needs immersion, so that's why the relative part of the immersion bookings in the bookings of Q1 was that high and they simply carry high value, the price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So as a follow up to that, in your earlier comment you said that Taiwan wasn't present. So it seems to me that maybe it's all driven by the one etch company in Korea and maybe one company in Japan. So was that true to assume that number of immersion tools booked in Q1 were just primarily from two companies? Or customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No &#x2013; the companies that you suggest were -- are not in there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really one seed to these, you can't really write any significant trend with what we've seen. So it's ...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... one at a time, most of the companies are having significant activities, not bookings. When any of the big names that you mentioned, comes they will be coming with a little bit bigger numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then when will we expect to see the bookings for these ten EUV tools that I think you said it will be revenue in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Five EUV tools.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we are going to take a conservative approach, when we are sure that they meet spec. So it can be in Q4, it can be in Q1, even if we have to ship in Q2, Q3. I want to take my time with --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anyway we will be fully visible, the tool price is not the final price. These are five pre-production tools, they don't have the market price yet but you will see what we've agreed as a prototype price et cetera, et cetera. So all this will be publicized in due time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then you have to also for revenue recognition purposes we have to take account of protocol SAB 101, which means you could argue this is new technology that needs to be proven first at the customer site. So that means that there's a later moment of revenue recognition with new technology, that's something we will still need to look at. And also based on the maturity level of the tools once they ship, so it could be like Eric said, we could be shipping tools in 2010 and recognize revenue only in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one quick follow up, actually more to do with the cash flow in Q2. Would you expect to be cash neutral in Q2 or burning cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would say we would be -- our expectation is to be cash neutral for the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it could be that we could are &#x2013; that we could be burning slightly in Q2, but clearly our focus would be on not burning cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember that when we burn cash sometimes it's for the good reason because we have six, nine months lead times. So if we were to burn more cash than necessary, you may get happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Weston Twigg. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Wes Twigg, Pacific Crest. Just wanted to follow up on something I believe I heard earlier. I think you said in your backlog, you have a large order of immersion tools for a Flash customer. Just wondering what's your level of confidence there and then -- that those go out over the next two months or two quarters? And which model would it be to meet the resolution requirements down at the 3x nanometer node?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are fairly comfortable with the shipment of these -- the orders we have obviously. And then they are staged like clockwork at this moment in view of the DRAM business and the price of the end product which improves, we feel pretty okay that their schedules will be set.</p>
          <p>In addition, those products are compatible with the 3x transition that is being planned.</p>
          <p>So, the idea at this moment is at these installed base which I remind you has an NA of 1.35, we never -- we didn't talk about this for a year and a half or something, but we are also unique in the industry with a very large lens and that large lens makes this installed base compatible to 3x Flash. I didn't say the customers will use this as a base, because they are hesitating between this machine called the XT and the NXT. But the XT could definitively be doing some of the layers of 3x and the whole question will be cost-effectiveness. And in fact, we are in the middle of the discussion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it sounds like some of those tools may convert to NXT orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, remember -- if you were completely focused on one node, it would make sense for you to you buy NXT for say four layers, and XT for the other six. But customers would say that's fine for day one and then in day two, I prefer ten NXTs. But these type of things, you -- we don't really control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a quick follow up. You mentioned the new customer in Singapore, just wondering what technology node that's for and if they're ordering any immersion tools yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Deutsche Bank. My first question is on TMC, I mean given the kind of course of events of the last few weeks, what is your impression of the sort of timing and potential size of any order momentum there? And then my second question -- just to follow up on the cash flow question obviously, you pay your dividend in the second quarter and in order to make -- to make the first half cash neutral, are you actually expecting to generate positive operating cash flow or is that really just referring to the combined H1 level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To that last question it's referring to the combined H1 level.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that includes indeed the -- let's say, 86 million of dividend payment that we have done recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To refer to TMC, as you know, the business model, I think, of TMC is still being discussed by TMC. And at this moments, these alignments, TMC and Elpida in terms of serving certain numbers of technology processes together. Micron-Nanya aligning as a competitor to TMC and requesting equal treatment by the Taiwanese government. So the issue is not so much what TMC is, the issue is that they have now triggered a clear set of decision that has to be taken by Micron-Nanya on one hand and by Elpida on the other. So we are now discussing with those two companies their rep. And this is what is being -- don't at this moment, not at all, a direct TMC question.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hello I am Jane Call, Martin Cullie. In terms of TMC or certainly, the Taiwanese DRAM situation, can you maybe quantify the potential orders upside from this source, maybe give us an idea as to the timing that you anticipate in terms of when we'll see fresh orders in the backlog from this source?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would prefer not -- I think, how can I answer you then, constructively. Because again remember those two customers are working on competitive ramps and any statement is a bit, would be awkward for me, but I would guess that an order of a new player into a new fab, putting one line, would go for say at least four tools in the first batch. So how can I answer that better? So, four would be a minimum, then how many batches or how many lines you want.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes, hello. Nomura. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about R&amp;D. I understand that you have the aspects of a business model that &#x2013; and through efficiency you can even reduce some R&amp;D without touching strategic programs, but a large part of the overall R&amp;D is contributed by the supply chain. So do you have the feeling what the aggregated R&amp;D budget looks this year compared to last year and could you describe how the supply chain is coping with this difficult situation that we have?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is a good question. So we were on a run rate last year, I would say of about &#x20AC;125-ish million per quarter. We're trying to go now 115, 118 million, so it's about 10 million savings. It is not a full impact on what you call the supply chains, that is, the contractors in a sense that we do about 5 million of the savings just by our own self, losing less wafers, being more efficient at the numbers of prototypes that we're building which cost a lot of money.</p>
          <p>The other 5-ish millions is an impact on our contractors who are, in fact, at this moment to be honest, half of it, 2.5 million per quarter, would be contractors which have temporary workers basically. So, they are not really contractors in the sense of adding value. They are contractors in helping us source engineers. And then the other, the rest 2.5 million would be from those very large institutions. So in other terms, our 10 million saving per quarter has been spread and it should not have any strategic impact on them.</p>

          <p>Just to clarify, when we talk about flexibility in R&amp;D, It is not that we source the R&amp;D from our supplier base that also provides modules for manufacturing. So it is R&amp;D flex, but it is from, let's say, temporary agencies like you have -- engineers that are in a kind of a super manpower kind of organization that we source. So that is not that is R&amp;D that we pay through the regular supply chain. There's only one instance where that is really significant, and that is with our supplier, Carl Zeiss, that -- they do R&amp;D, but that R&amp;D is basically in the cost of the lens.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And just coming back on services. Could you give us a little bit more granularity on whether it's more of the upgrade revenues or the time on the materials side which is what you're planning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the time and material is the biggest part of sales, it's about 75% of total service revenue. That's more stable. The spare parts and the field upgrades, that is much more dependent on where the customer needs are and also are more subject to cost reduction projects that are run by our customers.</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
