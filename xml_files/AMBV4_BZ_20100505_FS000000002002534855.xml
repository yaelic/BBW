          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to AmBev's First Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. Today with us we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for AmBev, and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After AmBev's remarks are completed, there will be a question-and-answer section. At that time further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Maureen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to discuss our 2010 first-quarter results. Before I start, I would just like to remind that as usual, the specific change discussed during this call are both organic and normalized in nature. Normalized figures refer to performance measures before special items; special items are either income or expenses, which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the company. And as normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, we disclose our consolidated net income, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>I will start the call by sharing a brief overview of the quarter, and then Jo&#xE3;o will provide you with an overview of our results in Brazil, HILA-Ex, Quinsa and Canada. I will close by providing more specifics regarding the first-quarter financials.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results, during the first quarter our consolidated EBITDA was close to R$2.8 billion, which represented a 15.3% organic increase when compared to the first quarter of 2009, while our margins contracted 40 basis points to 45.8%.</p>
          <p>Our Brazil EBITDA increased by 17.8% in the quarter, supported by a 14.1% volume growth and by a 5.2% revenue per hectoliter growth with EBITDA margin decreasing by 90 basis points to 50.2%, driven by higher SG&amp;A mainly due to marketing investments to support our brands and our innovations as well as by higher cost of goods sold in the period. Jo&#xE3;o will provide you more details of the key drivers in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>In HILA-Ex, we delivered a negative EBITDA of R$22.8 million in the quarter and registered an organic growth of R$4.5 million versus last year as a result of improvements in our top line and also the industry recovery in most countries where we operate.</p>
          <p>Our Quinsa operations have once again delivered strong results with EBITDA growing 14% during the quarter, thanks to revenue management and cost savings initiatives despite volume contraction in the region and higher marketing expense.</p>
          <p>In Canada, domestic volumes increased by 2.3% in the quarter while our EBITDA declined by 3% with margins declining 140 basis points.</p>
          <p>Normalized net income reached R$1.7 billion in the quarter, which was 25.2% higher than last year. Normalized earnings per share increased by 24.7% in the quarter. I will comment further on net income at the end of this call.</p>
          <p>Now I will hand it over to Jo&#xE3;o as we start to look a little deeper into the results of each of our operations. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by discussing our consolidated performance for the quarter. During the first quarter, our normalized consolidated EBIT totaled 2.8 billion representing 15.3% organic increase. Industry performance across most markets in which we operate improved from the last quarter trends except for Argentina and Chile. In consolidated volumes delivered really solid growth of 9% in the period mainly driven once again by our Brazilian operation.</p>
          <p>Moving deeper into Brazil, the positive macroeconomic environment continues to support the good performance of the industry and our focus on innovation and brand equity continues to deliver very good results in terms of market share. Our normalized Brazil EBITDA for the first quarter increased organically by 17.8% driven by strong top line growth with somewhat lower margins mainly due to higher marketing investments prior to the World Cup and also some higher variable costs. Specifically regarding Beer Brazil, the positive trend in the market continues as a result of 2 main factors from the external side. The first is the better than expected macroeconomic scenario which have disposable income and impairment level somewhat better than last quarter last year.</p>
          <p>The second factor is weather which despite larger amounts of rain in the quarter, which certainly didn't help, it was somewhat hotter than the first quarter of 2009. We have taken advantage of this improved macroeconomic scenario, weather and we continue to invest behind our brands and behind all the innovations that we introduced in the marketplace which led out markets share to average in the quarter of 69.3 which is 220 basis points higher than last year. As a result of the combination between market share and industry growth our Brazil Beer volumes grew 15.9, almost 16%, in the quarter, also benefiting somewhat from early Easter versus 2009.</p>
          <p>Talking about some of the innovations, Antarctica Sub Zero rollout to other states in Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro, continues delivering important results along with the rollout of the 1-liter bottle to some additional regions in Brazil which were not present last year. In addition, we expect to launch also other innovations continuing on the path of liquid and packaging and one example is the 5-liter keg which continued to be an important contributor to our results this year. In terms of net revenues per hectoliter for beer, it increased 4.8% as a result of price increase than last year before the summer season. Our price increase during the period was slightly offset by a packaging mix and a higher tax on sale while excise tax remained flat versus 2009.</p>
          <p>Now talking about COGS. Brazil Beer COGS per hectoliter was up 4.7% in the quarter as we were negatively impacted by higher packaging cost and currency hedges. We were negatively impacted also by the shortage of cans for CSD and Beer in Brazil and therefore are paying more for the imported aluminum cans due to the local suppliers' lack of capacity, which could be the case for the remainder of the year if products grow. And if that happens we could adversely be impacted on our average cost in 2010 depending again on the volume growth.</p>
          <p>Beer SG&amp;A grew by 23.8% in the period as a result of volume growth, general inflation, incremental investments to support our innovations, the phasing of expenses prior to the World Cup and somewhat new the higher logistic cost as a result of changing the sales mix more towards the north and the Northeast of Brazil.</p>
          <p>Normalized Beer EBITDA finished the quarter with strong 20.1% growth versus last year EBITDA declining by 60 basis points. Our CSD and NANC business in Brazil performed broadly in line with our expectations, delivering a 9% volume growth in the quarter as a result of an improved macroeconomic and industry condition, and slightly impacted by a negative 40 basis points decline in share. We're now at 17.7% in average for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our net revenues per hectoliter in CSD grew 3.5% organically in the quarter as we continue to be impacted by price increases from last year and partly offset by the higher state taxes. COGS per hectoliter increased organically by 9.2% as a result of our currency and sugar hedges, partially offset by means of productivity initiatives and lower prices for the non-hedge commodity such as corn.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation and amortization increased 13.5 in the period as a result of general inflation, volume growth, marketing investments and also logistic &#x2013; costs like in beer. Our EBITDA continued to grow increasing by 5.9% reaching 300 million in the quarter with a margin contraction of 290 basis points.</p>
          <p>Turning now to HILA-Ex, volumes increased by 7.4 in the beer as a result of good performance mainly in Peru and Dominican Republic and also better industry growth in most of the countries where we operate. We're improving volumes in the Dominican Republic and in Peru mainly due to &#x2013; through our focus on brand initiatives and production efficiencies. HILA-Ex EBITDA improved by 4.5 million in the quarter as I said as our teams in HILA-Ex continued to make important progress towards our long-term growth in each country across the region.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Quinsa, the Latin American south operation, we reach the 40% EBITDA growth in the quarter despite the industry contraction observed mainly in Argentina. Our track record in terms of EBITDA growth was reinforced as we achieved perspective quarters with double-digit growth for over 3 years. Even though our volumes still suffer the impact of 2009 economic slowdown, we are optimistic as some our operations are already back to the growth path in terms of volume.</p>
          <p>We overcame those products with revenue management initiatives, cost discipline and strong support through our main brands. In Argentina we reinforced the Quinsa brand leadership with strong innovative campaigns. The new thermo-sensitive labor our campaign celebrate 120 years for the brand and World Cup sponsorship campaign are a few examples of the focus and innovation we are putting in our brand in Argentina. We are also supporting our local juices in the regions such as Pilsen in Paraguay, Pacena in Bolivia introduced in Uruguay.</p>
          <p>A good thing is that the World Cup also involves important campaigns in Paraguay and Uruguay to support our flagship brands. This quarter our volumes were down 3.5 with Argentina suffering &#x2013; operations suffering most of the volume decline. We suffered a market share loss in soft drinks business as a result of price and management initiatives aiming at maximizing our profitability. We have launched the 3-liter bottle and implemented other actions aiming to be working the recent share losses.</p>
          <p>Net revenues per hectoliter grew organically both in beer and soft drinks as a result of price increase introduced in line on inflation and focused initiatives in terms of trade spend and revenue management. We are also successfully exploring the premium moment in the last region in the Latin America South regions, still our market share in preference are at record levels since they were launched. In Argentina, it became the absolute leader among premium, performing direct or better once again this quarter. Local premium brands such as <mark type="inaudible" /> Uruguay are also growing above average improving our margins and helping to develop the category.</p>
          <p>Our efforts of reduce costs and expenses compensated the negative impact of higher labor and transportation cost. We benefited from effective hedges in aluminum encouraged by sub increases in soft drinks concentrate as a result of higher sales in sugar. In addition, we are already achieving important synergies in Bolivia with the Pepsi bottling acquisition. Higher SG&amp;A is a result of strong investment in our brands with clear objectives of sustaining our brand health.</p>
          <p>Turning to Canada, Labatt's first quarter was characterized by 3 features. 1, a strengthening economy and Winter Olympics combined to lift beer industry volumes; 2, continued industry competition pressured top line growth. 3, Labatt hedging and productivity programs led to a reduction in variable costs based versus prior year. The sectors combined for first quarter EBITDA decline of 3% versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Volume improved by 6.2% versus first quarter of 2009. Domestic volumes were boosted 2.3 on the back of industry growth and export volumes increased over 30% during the last sub comparison in first quarter 2009. The result in a sizable mix &#x2013; this of course resulted in a sizable mix shift between domestic and export volumes which explains over a half of Canada's year-over-year decline of 4.6 in net revenues per hectoliter. The remainder of first quarter net revenue per hectoliter decline is the outcome of 2 factors. First, a strong promotional offering in British Columbia during the Winter Olympics to compete against competitive sponsorship rights and secondly carry forward of the aggressive fourth quarter pricing environment in Central Canada.</p>
          <p>Canada market declined by 0.9 percentage points in the quarter and share gains in March were not enough to offset the decline we experienced in January and February. The January and February share declines were fueled by the same factor that impacted net revenue per hectoliter as Labatt struck a balanced response to the competitive environment. Entering March, we made a number of adjustments which put us in a better position to address both net revenues per hectoliter and market share gaps opened in the quarter.</p>
          <p>COGS per hectoliter declined by 5.5 in the first quarter as a result of decreased material pricing and improved efficiency throughout our supply chain. As an example, the Canadian beverage consumed 8% less water and energy per hectoliter in last year and improved productivity by a similar margin.</p>
          <p>At the end of March, we announced the closure of Lakeport Brewery, in Hamilton, Ontario. This was a necessary step to address excess production capacity in Central Canada and ensure the company is structured to compete most effectively in the Canadian marketplace. It resulted in a one-time close provision of 46.1 million. Following this move, Labatt has now 6 breweries across Canada, 2 in the West, 2 in Central Canada, and 2 in the East.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A excluding depreciation increased by 3.6 in the first quarter of 2010 as an improvement in the solution efficiencies were offset by incremental commercial expenses in the quarter. In the second quarter, we'll again see additional commercial investments versus prior year as the Canadian team announced some exciting initiatives at the start of the busy summer selling season as opposed to midway through as was the case in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now going back to the overall AmBev business, I want to wrap up by saying that we are confident to be in the right direction. We started 2010 with a great first quarter, based on our cost-connect-win approach. And we'll make again innovation and productivity our priority this year to continue delivering sustainable and profitable EBITDA growth.</p>
          <p>For the balance of the year, we expect to take advantage of the improving macroeconomic scenario for most of the countries where we operate, but we're desperate to have in the second quarter and to a certain extent in the third quarter more challenging comparisons for variable costs as a result of higher sugar and packaging costs including the potential impact of imported cans and currency hedges and well as for marketing investments raising due to the World Cup. Finally, I would like to say I'm confident and we will succeed in our plans, thanks to the quality of our people who are the major assets of our company.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to go back to Nelson.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jo&#xE3;o. In this final section I would like to guide you through the main items between the normalized EBIT of R$2.5 billion and net income of R$1.65 billion as disclosed on page 3 of our release.</p>
          <p>Our net financial expense reached R$186 million which is 42.6% lower than last year. This is explained by lower net interest expense as a result of our lower debt and interest rates which were offset by loss on derivatives instruments which relate to the result of our ongoing hedging activities and loss related to currency effects over trade payables mainly in Venezuela and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate in the period was 25.4% compared to 23.9% last year. The main reason for this increase are the lower income without taxation, higher deferred tax liabilities, plus a higher EBITDA which is taxable at full rate. Our operating cash flow generation in the first quarter reached R$2.4 billion which is around 26% better than the first quarter of '09. And we were able to achieve all that while growing our profitability in international brands as evidenced by our market share and brand health indicators in our market.</p>
          <p>Our net debt decreased to R$1.7 billion at the end of March compared to 3.2 billion at the end of December '09 driven by cash and equivalent increase. However, we paid R$1 billion in dividends and interest on capital on April 1. Therefore this cash settlement is not reflected yet in this payment. Finally, we continue to pursue opportunity to improve our cash flow generation while investing to increase capacity and meet demands.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand back to the operator and open up for questions. Maureen, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day, everybody. I had a question, it wasn't really economic, but it's been about 10 years since the last time you guys decided to put the stock and I know it's not fundamental or economic, but it does have an impact in terms of market making, it does have an impact in terms of retail. And as you consider that, what might influence or delay the decision to split? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. It's Nelson here. We, I mean, usually look into the possibility of a stock split as we did it in the past, I mean, always trying to adjust. I mean &#x2013; I think what we have always learned is that if the share price is out &#x2013; is way above a certain range, it starts to compromise liquidity, be it the ADR or be it the shares in Brazil, we always consider the possibility of a stock split. Today, it's not something that we are looking at deeply, but eventually it could happen, but not that we could anticipate at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the other thing I want to just delve upon is is my understanding is that Sicobe &#x2013; well, my perception is that Sicobe is having an impact in terms of some of the prices spun in the industry. What's the likelihood that you see Sicobe system being used somewhat for soft drinks? I know it's a little bit expensive but it seems as if the industry is moving in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Bob, this is Jo&#xE3;o. I mean, definitely Sicobe is already having, to be quite honest, an impact also in soft drinks industry okay. We have about 170 companies that are considered medium to small soft drinks companies that are in an association. That association has already said that they will want and will comply to the Sicobe, maybe around 20% of their associates have already entered the Sicobe system and more are going to join. Therefore, I think, we're actually already seeing an impact on a lot of the small players in soft drinks and I think this will continue to be the case going forward as they have announced that they will try to adjust as soon as possible. So there is already a timeline given that you have many more players than you have in the beer industry that will take a little bit more time, they've been asking for some delays, they've been asking for a few changes, but they are definitely going to join and again the impact, we are already seeing the impact in their pricing strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congratulations on a really strong quarter. I guess, I wanted to ask a couple of questions in Brazil Beer. The first is that your pricing did look real solid in the quarter and I know you mentioned some issues in terms of mix in the past and I'm wondering if, you're seeing, I don't know the switch to one liter start to level off. I wonder if you could comment a little bit about what you're expecting in terms of state excise taxes as we progress throughout the year? So that's one question, just to get a better outlook for your pricing in Brazil throughout the rest of 2010.</p>
          <p>And the second is notwithstanding some amazing revenue growth you had in the quarter, your margins were down again and obviously it's the SG&amp;A, and I know that there have been a lot of one-off factors, the bonuses last year, some of the timing of marketing investments. But assuming you have a positive or continued positive momentum top line, at some point should we expect to see your EBITDA margin grow? I mean, why shouldn't you start to see positive operating leverage as you progress throughout 2010, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Lore. Well, I think just to &#x2013; as an overview, talking about the Brazil Beer's strength that we talked about just now, we're really very excited with the results. I mean, excited and proud, I think we &#x2013; a lot of things that we've done in the last few years are coming to fruition. I mean, everything worked in our favor for this quarter, market share, industry growth as well as pricing. And tackling straight to the pricing question, pricing, to be quite honest, there are two components. One is a lot of things have not changed regarding to last year.</p>
          <p>We said during the last year that actually the main impact on the pricing were taxes, around 75% of the impact of the price issues that we had and maybe 25% were the mix effect. What happens now is that state taxes continue to evolve exactly as they have been evolving for the past 4 or 5 years. They usually go up in line or slightly above inflation. Federal tax is what makes a huge difference. We had a federal tax increase of 15% last year and a 5% decline for competitors including, FEMSA, Itaipava those guys. And now we have so far 0 federal tax increase.</p>
          <p>So, the mix effect that you actually see this year is not very different from what you saw last year. Of course, the later &#x2013; it's not growing every, let's say, every month in terms of the mix effect. It is leveling off a little bit. But you still have the same sort of impact than you had before because you're comparing the first quarter with the first quarter of last year where we had very little. So, the impact, let's say, for the third and fourth quarter in terms of mix is pretty much the same as you have in the first quarter. So, therefore, just to reinforce what we were saying last year that we were putting prices in line with inflation price to consumer. But the taxes were taking a major toll. What happens now is mix continues to take a small effect but the taxes increases of federal are not there. That's why you're seeing a much more solid growth which we're used to see in 2005, 6, 7, 8 where there was no federal tax increase.</p>
          <p>And did not see in 2009 because there was a federal tax increase. So going forward, as we progress the mix effect should continue to be small and maybe could diminish a little bit. This state tax will continue to have the same effect. I think the big question mark will be federal taxes, right? So we mentioned last quarter that we are talking to the government for the reasons why we should not need to have a federal tax increase from our standpoint because we think we're investing a lot, the volume is growing, so they can actually have a bigger tax collection without needing to increase the tax. And as a counterpart somewhat to that is that we are investing between 1.5 and 2 billion and that would also generate jobs and also generate other tax because there are also tax on investment. They have not given any final answer to that it's looks like, first and second, first of course the second quarter it will not be there, but it could be decided for the second half.</p>
          <p>I think the good thing is that we went as an industry, as a whole industry, to talk to the government, which makes a difference. So it was the first time that we're able to gather together the whole industry to go with that request because we think it's a win-win. It will depend on a lot of things. We will continue to preach what we just said. If nothing happens, than you should continue to see the same trend in terms of price. If it happens it will depend on the sort of price increase &#x2013; tax increase that the federal government could put there. So that's the pricing outlook, let's say, from a tax perspective and from a mix perspective. I think the final part of the equation on price is comparative response. So we've seen most competitors actually following us, in all regard, usual time lag, I mean, a little bit less, with expectation of FEMSA because it has not really followed the industry price increase for whatever reason, whatever we did in the last year. So that's been the lagging piece. So, it will &#x2013; we'll see where we with this. So I would say that's a good momentum for pricing competitive wise, because we're holding a much share position and preference position.</p>
          <p>Going to your last question in terms of the margin, we continue, Lore, to believe on this sort of a SG&amp;A growth related to the equation, that we've talked about in the last few years, which is that our SG&amp;A should first move up in line with the inflation, let's say, 4.5 to 5. Then the volume of course when volumes grow by 10%, it's probably got an additional 3 to 4 points to our SG&amp;A. So that would take us to 8 or 9, which is a reasonable number if we had that sort of volume growth. What's happened in the short term that should not continue to happen in the longer term or for the year, is that we're making all those investments and a good majority of being the North, Northeast which should decrease the important impact of the logistics cost that we had in the first quarter. So that should diminish somewhat in the second and the third, and if even during the fourth, because then most of our new openings of events will be in place so that should diminish that</p>
          <p>Regarding marketing expenses, of course there is a <mark type="inaudible" /> of the World Cup for the first and the second quarter, which could not be there in the third and fourth. So that combination should help us to find some additional leverage &#x2013; operating leverage from the top line to the bottom line. I think they're only news from the equations that what we said all along last year and continue to say is that we will invest behind good ideas. I think we found good ideas last year, we continue to find good ideas and if we need, if we find that they are working, we'll continue to invest behind them, okay? Because that's what I think will guarantee the future and guarantee the health of our different type of our brands, which at the end that's what drives the whole equation of the P&amp;L okay? That's pretty much where we are in that front.</p>

          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone and again congratulations for an excellent quarter. My &#x2013; 2 questions, 1 of them regarding working capital and the other 1 regarding Canada. Regarding working capital, I think this is one of best quarters that we've seen in quite a while. I mean, you're consistently improving your working capital and you continue to do so. So I guess the first question is, should we expect further improvements in terms of working capital for the remaining of the year and what is driving this type of improvements? And then the question regarding Canada, if you could explain to us which are the main brands that you're exporting and can you give us more color in terms of the pricing dynamics and I know that there was an easy comp in terms of the exports and in terms of the overall volumes for Canada, but I would like to understand better how those exports will be influencing the volumes of Canada going forward? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan. Thanks for your comments and questions. It is Nelson. Well, starting with the working capital that is something that we have been consistently focusing on for a while now. If you're looking to the type of results we're getting, we couldn't go back to 2007 and then also 2008 and '09 and now we continue to focus on that. I mean in combination it's the whole focus on top line growth and EBITDA growth. They're always trying to seek opportunity now on working capital management. I think, a couple of things I think we have been doing right there. We have been on the payable side, given a bigger focus on the negotiation between terms and price, making sure you're not paying more for the longer term as well as trying to optimize it for a supplier. <mark type="inaudible" /> for instance the payment terms and I was trying to harmonize then in a way we could expect value from the whole negotiation. There are areas that we still believe we can improve, as we can imagine with the whole incremental complexity that we have been &#x2013; implemented in increasing the supply area with the whole, I mean, new SKUs and innovation.</p>
          <p>We said, we've opportunities to improve our inventory management, since we live in a new world right before, we used to say we live in a world of pretty much a type of package, now we have 4 or 5 different package, that even the different types of plants, not only in few plant that are complex now. I mean the number of plants that are complex today is increasing. So that's why, we believe we do have opportunities to improve our overall working capital. Then we &#x2013; of course when we talk about accounts receivable is more a focus on making collateral money. We put a lot of efforts on that last year, especially when we're in the beginning of the whole macroeconomic crisis and we're worried about what could happen, specially with small borrowers and in terms of the liquidity and possibility of bankruptcy I think in the end in Brazil the market had a less than &#x2013; the impact was lower than what we could have anticipated. But anyway we have been focusing on why don't keep moving collecting the money, make sure we are invoicing properly the super marks and we avoid disputes and so on. So, the final message is, yes, we booked a lot. We don't see the low-hanging fruits anymore, but we do believe that opportunity to continue to improve in our working capital is an important source &#x2013; funds for us. Going back to your second question, I'll turn now to Jo&#xE3;o to talk about the Canadian brands.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well basically, in terms of the brands with the sale to KPS I mean basically Labatt, all the Labatt bond is going to KPS. But we also have some exports of Kokanee and Beck and some other brands that will go to ABI. That's basically the 2 sales and there is a phasing when we &#x2013; and basically Labatt is the big volume there, and there was a phasing effect because of the timing of the sale to KPS and that's why only in this quarter you'll see this is big jump. That should not be the case going forward to the other quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we think &#x2013; again pricing in Canada is always an issue. The perception we have now as we entered April and prices were moved up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impression we have is that prices are now more stable than they were for the fourth quarter and the beginning of the first quarter. So, we do believe that and I think when we &#x2013; one example to that that we just launched Bud 4 above the minimum price which is consistent with that profitable growth objective that we have and that was for Quebec, Bud 4, okay. And we also moved the prices in the province in April, but it's early to say whether they will stick, but I think those are till right now since somewhat positive standpoint.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning and congratulations, my question is regarding carbonated soft drinks in Brazil, I mean, you could give us an idea of the market dynamic, you mentioned 9% volume growth with some erosion in market share, I would like to know if this is a trend we could expect or what are the initiatives that you are taking? I mean, we should see  stabilization in the market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Luis, basically when you look on a yearly basis we have been able to somewhat maintain our share &#x2013; if you look back 3, 4, 5 years actually gaining somewhat, so we went from 17, then to 17.1, 17.8 and that's the average we have maintained. So actually if we maintain the current level that we have today we would be pretty much in the same level of last year, so it's much more of a quarter scene let's say than an issue. So we should be able this year to either maintain or have a slight growth in the market share. So although we see this 40 bps, this 40 basis points from 18.1, 17.7 we don't see a market share loss for the year, okay. I think the issue, I mean, the dynamics are actually very good. I mean, the growth has been in line to what we expected, but it's still very aggressive for the first quarter. I mean, 9% is still a solid growth. I think the World Cup will also help us in the short term, not just beer, but also soft drink for the second quarter. The issue that we have more and again especially in the second is that cost of goods sold. Okay, cost of goods sold we have the worst comparison because of the currency hedges when you look year-against-year and that too has an important impact on the EBITDA for the year because the sugar hedges are for the year, but specifically for the second quarter because the combination of the sugar hedges and the worst moment for the currency hedges.</p>
          <p>So I see more of an issue this year for the EBITDA growth than I see for the top line. I think we will be define top line both in terms of price given that we have, I think, 2 rationale players Coke and us, looking to actually grow the market. So I think we're both working towards that object and that's happening, both rationale in price. And given what you just said regarding the Sicobe question, I think the big brands, which still have, a little bit less than 30% in the marketplace, I see a positive outlook also for top line <mark type="inaudible" />. But again, the issue is on cost of goods sold and therefore its impact on the EBITDA growth.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Marcel Moraes, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My first question is also regarding production cost. But for the beer division in Brazil if you could follow -- I mean, follow the same rationale for production cost because what we saw in the first quarter was COGS per hectoliter increase of about 4%. But we saw at the same time aluminum prices &#x2013; wheat prices going down a lot last year and probably hedge it. So I thought that for the full year in the beer division in Brazil we would see kind of a decline in COGS per hectoliter. Could you just comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Marcel. It's Nelson speaking. Regarding the beer COGS and that is &#x2013; some of the elements as Jo&#xE3;o mentioned about soft drinks, they also apply to beer. So, what we have been saying for a while is that our expectation for our COGS per hectoliter for the full year would be pretty much in line with inflation, analyze that, because if on one side, we have overall commodities hedge at the better price level, so that's the case for aluminum, that is the case for all the commodities. The only commodity that we have hedged for 2010 at a level that was higher than 2009 and was sugar, so that's why the situation is more complicated for &#x2013; in soft drinks.</p>
          <p>But the fact is from one side you have the &#x2013; a positive impact from our commodities hedged for 2010, on the other side, the average implied FX rates in our COGS for 2010, given the hedge we've put in place last year, is around 1.99 versus the 1.88 we had last year. So in an important part of our COGS not only in soft drinks but also in beer, we had this negative impact of the currency that &#x2013; the currency hedges. So, in a nutshell, we have a higher currency impact partially offset by  commods, but the currency impact is bigger than the upside from the commods side in our COGS also for beer. On the other hand, I think it's important to emphasize that on a quarterly basis, everything I'm saying is going to be more or less intense. So, for instance, you have &#x2013; just to give an example, in Q2 we're going to have the toughest comparison in terms of currency hedges. So on an average, as I said, it's going to be from 1.88 to 1.99. But in Q2, the increase is going to be higher than the average $0.11 that we had for the full year.</p>
          <p>So Q2 will have a combination of higher impact of currency hedge. The logistic cost that Jo&#xE3;o mentioned, they're going to be at the higher level given the type of growth we see today towards the North and Northeast also because of the fact that our plants are not &#x2013; the new plants, the new investments we are making in the course of the year, that we will now optimize our footprint, they will be ready only for Q4. So we are going to see in the course of the year different variables affecting the overall costs in the business.</p>
          <p>I think the other point to emphasize is that we already had a little bit of that in Q1. And of course depending on the volume growth evolution we could have a higher impact of imported cans in our COGS. So in a way, during last call when we said that cost as a whole in Brazil, right, should be in line with inflation, cost per hectoliter, we start to see a scenario that depends on the volume growth. The number could be above inflation, if we'll have even higher impact of imported cans in our mix. So, I think this we will see as we move all of course higher volumes or higher than anticipated would mean bottom line and upside of course, but specifically on the cost per hectoliter they can put a little bit of a pressure on top of inflation in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, Nelson what is the level in terms of volumes that you think would start pressuring your COGS per hectoliter above inflation? Is it double-digit growth or what kind of volume growth that you're referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Marcel we don't give any specific guidance on volume, I mean, what we had said, I mean, right for a while that we are investing this year to be ready for a volume growth between 10 and 15%. I think that's what the additional capacity the investments we're making. So we want to be ready for that, and of course the higher the volume then higher is going to be the impact.</p>
          <p>I think it's also important to emphasize in terms of volumes and specifically talking about Beer Brazil that 15.9% we had in the first quarter, you have to take into consideration that from one side the industry continues to be strong but also we have an easy comp in terms of market share because since we have been gaining market share in the course of 2009, we entered 2010 at a level that again is close or above the 6 to 9% so that impacted positively. The volume growth, of course, is going to become tougher and tougher as we go &#x2013; as we move along the way. And another element that we &#x2013; it's always difficult to quantify but there was an impact of an earlier Easter in 2010. So part of the volumes that we saw last year <mark type="inaudible" /> in April this year we were presenting in March. So in a way we had easy comps in market share, we had an earlier Easter, so things are going very well in the top line but you have to factor all these other elements so we should see that the volume growth for the balance of the year, of course, we're going to have tougher comps until December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. And finally, on soft drinks in Brazil, do you see any need of a price adjustment to compensate for these very strong increase in the COGS per hectoliter going forward, I mean, assuming 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again we don't open that details This is Jo&#xE3;o again, we don't open the details of the pricing strategy. I think what I said is the direction, it's a rationale industry that wants to grow the industry profitably. The movements we make, again, we are the runner up, we are not the leader of soft drinks. So, any price moves will also depend on the leader, as the leader moves we may have some more space. But I would say that both companies have moved prices at the end of last year before the summer season. There is no other, I mean, certainly plans to move away from that.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Celso Sanchez from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. On the cans issue, I guess a couple of questions, 1 if you do have to continue importing cans, is there any reason to believe you wouldn't pass on some of that additional cost through prices at least for that type of presentation, that would be the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Again, just a little bit similar to what you saw, of course we're importing cans, it will be a positive mark-up sale, right? We will not be having negative mark-up on can imports. So we'll have a smaller mark-up but a positive mark-up, therefore I would not say that we expect what I think could be positive is that if you take the last few years where there is a price &#x2013; some sort of price fight, it's usually on cans, okay. So if you look at the behavior of cans in the past, maybe 3, 4 years, you always have a price activity mostly on cans on the second and third quarter. Given that no one &#x2013; everyone is having problems to supply the market with cans, what could be positive is not a price increase but it's the lack of a price decline. Okay? Which is actually positive on comp terms, okay, that's what I see as a potential positive outlook for can price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then another kind of quick can-related question. The cans that are &#x2013; it sounds like if everyone else is suffering it's not necessarily just the innovative can, the thermographic ones that turns blue when the can gets cold, is it any specific type of cans or does it affect those innovative cans that have done pretty well for you particularly in the last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's also &#x2013; yeah, it's actually for most presentation, but it does include, for example, one big hit we had with the 269.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 269 was a big hit. I mean, we basically sell what we got, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right? So the lack of cans is across the board because, I mean, for the can makers there are 2 issues. I mean, first what sort of plans and formats that they can produce in those plants, because every time they change format, they lose efficiency and sometime they not even able and then what do they have outside of Brazil to be able to export to Brazil, because now they suddenly have the same format. So, the short answer is, yes, it makes a difference for all the cans and will also make a difference for some of the innovative cans that we have sometimes capping the sort of growth that we could had. Okay?</p>
          <p>That's why we &#x2013; a little bit we anticipated this. So we were ready to supply the hot summer season and also to supply the good momentum that we have for the last few months with the imported cans. So the good thing, I think, is that we were prepared for that situation from the extent we could be because of course you cannot build a can plant with your supplier overnight, so we were able to actually fill that hole with the imported cans, but the impact was somewhat across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for that. And kind of a follow-up question and on the FX hedging, if I look at the performance of the real a year ago, it seems like the worst part was really kind of in the middle of the first quarter. So I know that you'd always adhere to a strict 12-month policy but with some leeway around that, and you talked about second quarter being an even worse hedge base for you, even though the currency started improving somewhat materially last year in the second quarter. So 1, I just want to be as precise as possible, is that &#x2013; that's been the case of the second quarter hedge terms or worse than they were, and then related to that, I know we've talked about this before, offline at least, the benefits of having a much stronger spot currency when you have to buy materials, particularly imported ones, that for volume growth has been extraordinary, that presumably does mitigate some of that margin pressure, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you're right, sales &#x2013; 2 things I'd like to down based on your question. So in terms of the hedge terms, when I said the second quarter is tougher for us, is not because the hedge for 2Q 2010 or higher than the LIBOR we had in Q1 2010. And you're right, I mean they are slightly lower, but the problem is, if you go 2009 hedge, there was a major appreciation of the real in 2008 in this period. So the decline was even more intense between Q2 '09 and Q1 '09 this what we have between Q2 2010 and Q1 2010. You see it again the gap is bigger. Even for lower level of currency hedge between first &#x2013; second quarter and first quarter of 2010, it's not the comparison that is tougher, not the absolute number of the currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second point about what we call the under hedged, right, because every time you hedge on a rolling 12 months based on a certain expectation of volume and purchase of the products, and you are right. I mean since the volumes are above our expectations or the amount that we hedged before, there is an upside given the current FX rate. I mean, around 1.73, 1.74. <mark type="inaudible" /> then it goes up 1.78 and goes down, so it's really volatile. But on average, everything we're purchasing on top of the hedged amount is at the better rate and that may imply in the couple of cents of reais advantage in our COGS.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, I had 3 questions, 2 on Brazil Beer. First one would be just a general question on how you see the outlook for the industry in 2010. Obviously, we have the number of good factors including the World Cup in the second quarter, also there was quite a bit of packaging innovation last year and there is some more this year. So, I'm just wondering to what extent you see that having a good impact on industry volumes? You mentioned the Northeast being more important. I imagine that there is a lot of growth coming from there. So if you could comment on that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, if you could give a sense of what the market share was towards the end of the quarter. I know you have given us an average market share for the quarter, but I'm just wondering in terms of direction between the beginning and the end of the quarter and, related to that, how this could potentially affect your pricing and the levels of discounting in the market. So those are the first 2 questions on Brazil. I'll come back to the third question afterwards.</p>

          <p>Okay. Hi, David. Well, I think first of course we have a very good momentum in the business here. Again as I said in the beginning we're excited that a lot of things we did are now coming to fruition at a time where Brazil is quickly recovering from a very tough year, last year where GDP declined by 5 points, basically didn't grow although our volumes were very strong, we're in that positive slope. We had a very strong first quarter. It's true, as Nelson said, if you remember our volumes last year we basically grew 7% in the first half, 7  and then at 12 on the third and fourth, 12 in the fourth quarter. So we have a lot of things going for us, but it is also true that we have &#x2013; the first half is an easier comp because you're growing above 7 and the second half you're growing above 12. So we have different comps for the second half in volume terms and also in terms of market share comparison because I mean we went from, let's say, somewhat, the 66, 67 to the 69, 70 from the beginning of the year, end of 2008 to the end of &#x2013; to the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>Therefore I think when we were having conversations throughout 2009, we went from cautiously pessimist to cautiously optimistic and now we're somewhat optimistic. So I think we're more optimistic going forward giving that everything that we're doing is working, giving that Brazil is having a good record. We are in an emerging economy. So, we always should be watching out, but we put our money where our mouth is. So we put the capacity in the marketplace, we will put the capacity towards the end of the year and we will continue to play the role that I think a leader should be playing which is to grow the category. So I think we've found ways to do that. I think the package innovation and the liquid innovations are actually helping us to grow the marketplace. So I don't think it's just, let's say, Brazilian economy the reason to couple somewhat sometimes from the economy, up or down because of the income, because of different things, but we also found a way as a leader to help the category to grow. So in that respect we are &#x2013; we have a positive outlook for the volume going forward, because of all those things, innovations work and the category is growing because the innovations are helping both packaging and liquid as well as we are positioning ourselves for this growth in the North and the Northeast. In terms of share, I would not like to disclose the details. I think what matters is that we are at what I think is a good market share average for the quarter, the one we disclosed after a price increase. So we are in a better position to fight potential price activities if there are. We're not seeing that being the case or actually to enjoy growth if our innovation continue to grow. So, we would not talk a lot about share, but positive outlook in terms of pricing for that respect.</p>

          <p>And just on the &#x2013; the third cost question I had was regarding Canada and that is mostly about pricing and I understand there were some issue around timing of promotions, and I think Molson Coors had a comment on that during their conference call, the Q1 results. So, I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of how the year-on-year pricing should be looking like in Canada for you going forward in the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay I think that's a fair question, a very good one. We heard some of the comments in the Molson call. I think basically, we had a great start with Bud Light Lime launch in May of last year, okay. We did see softer volumes in the fourth quarter 2009 due to, to be quite honest, extremely competitive pricing on Molson's import brands with both Corona and Heineken at minimum price levels in Qu&#xE9;bec. So, therefore so far for this year the brand continue to gain share in the import specialty segment which is the one of the growing segments in Canada. So I don't foresee them continue to do what they did, very heavy promotion in important brands such as Corona and Heineken. As they do, we will find the balance &#x2013; a balanced response. But if not then we should see better comps. One way to signal that to show that to the marketplace and that we launched Bud Four above the minimum price, Corona and Heineken were playing at the end of the year at the minimum price level, but not because of that we launched the new brand at that level. So we launched that above that in Quebec, Bud Four. So that's, sort of, I think, our response to the comments we saw and hopefully we will not see that going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, everyone. Not to spend too much time, I know you've talked a lot about today on the call about cost pressures, but I'm just trying to clarify that it seems like a lot of these issues whether it be from a comparison standpoint of the hedges, the issues with the hedges, that this was something that you did anticipate as you were thinking about planning for this year that nothing has actually incrementally gotten worse from that cost perspective standpoint. So I just, once if you can highlight the change there, there's been any change with expectations on the COGS line. And then if I could also ask about CapEx spent this year, you've given some preliminary guidance, I guess, as far as investing more behind the Brazilian business. So if you could just give us a sense of how that's trending and how that spent &#x2013; they flow through over the course of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think there is a change, Lauren, to what we said before. What we actually said in the beginning of the year in our last call, we said that we did expect cost of goods sold to be in line with inflation. Okay, that's what we gave as, I think, very specific outlook for COGS and there is one big change, there are some minor changes, but there is a one big one, which is the need to import cans. So we weren't prepared to import cans if needed but when we started the year, given the, I guess let's say the volume outlook we had, when we talked about the COGS per hectoliter we did include that potential need given the outlook of volume we had. That's why what we're saying that if the markets continue to outrun, the perspective we had we will be above the guidance of COGS per hectoliter being in line with inflation, okay. If it comes back to other levels, then we will continue to be closer to the inflation.</p>
          <p>Of course, we were already impacted in the first quarter by that. So we were closer to inflation in the first quarter already because of that. So, going forward, one of the biggest levers whether it we will be very close or farther away, it will depend on that. Basically, that's it, so you know that we don't give guidance on this, we give an outlook of the COGS factor behind the inflation, the changes will depend a lot on what happens going forward. So, for example, there is a federal tax increase in the second half, we decided to patch that one. This could have an impact &#x2013; this one could have an impact in can forms. We will not have the need to import more cans and therefore COGS will get closer again to inflation. If that doesn't happen, for example, and volumes continue to boom then we may need to continue to import cans and then we will move away from that sort of a direction we use for the COGS per hectoliter. So, basically there was a change in perspective.</p>
          <p>Regarding the CapEx, we -- what we said is that we would be vesting. We were at the point in time closer to 1.5 billion and then we said that we will be closer to 2 billion on investment in Brazil in reais, not in dollars, and we are in full speed to put those investments in place. So a lot of those investments have already taken place or we have already inaugurated some of the lines we bought in some different states and we have a lot of new lines coming into place every month, from now until September. So the CapEx that we mentioned is still the CapEx that we see happening for the remainder of the year. Okay?</p>
