          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year earnings review for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Nawi, you may begin.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Lacy. Good morning to everyone and welcome to the Travelers discussion of the fourth quarter and year-end 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.Travelers.com under the Investor section.</p>
          <p>With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO, Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer, Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer, Alan Schnitzer, head of our Financial, Professional and International Insurance business, Joe Lacher, head of our Personal and Select Businesses, as well as other members of senior management. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it for questions.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jay I would like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company's reserves and other topics.  The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.  Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors.  These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.  We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.  Also in our remarks, our responses to questions we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our web site, travelers.com.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Jay.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us today. We have a lot to cover, but I think it's important to put today's reported results, as well as some of the other topics that we'll be discussing today, into the broader context of our organization.</p>
          <p>This year's performance is reflective of Travelers' long-standing approach to managing risk in order to achieve our targeted results over time. I've said many times before that our fundamental business is one of managing the balance between risk and reward both on the liability side as well as on the asset side of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>What you see in our results today, an operating return on equity of 12.4% and importantly a four-year average annual operating return on equity of approximately 14.5%, comes from this core cultural value, and this is so important, decisions we've made and actions we have taken or not taken over the past several years, not just this year.</p>
          <p>Looking back to what we said this time last year, we assessed the insurance market place more or less correctly. We expected it to be more challenging from a margin perspective and it was. With that said, we are very pleased that our initiatives over the last few years have paid off. For example an increased flow, we are also pleased that our metrics suggest that we've continued to maintain our underwriting discipline. On the investment side, market conditions were clearly much more challenging than anyone anticipated. However, all things considered, I could not be more pleased with our performance and the position of our investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>We've received a number of questions in the last few months on how we are able to avoid so many of the investment issues which plagued the market this year. The answer is not that we saw everything coming, but in many areas we believed that risk was underpriced. In that regard we were fortunate. As I've also said, if certain asset classes had been better priced we would likely have been somewhat invested in at least a few of them.</p>
          <p>As it relates to pricing I've noted in the last six months that the world feels like a riskier place. Recent data suggests that we may now be starting to see an improvement in the pricing environment. We are by no means ready to declare a bottom, but we like the data and we will discuss it in more detail with you this morning.</p>
          <p>On the investment side we are still seeing a big spread between the bid and ask, but conditions in some investment areas in 2009 may provide more opportunities. Our results over the last few years have demonstrated a consistent and successful approach to assuming and managing risk, in order to achieve an appropriate return for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Nothing in that approach or in our culture has changed. I believe we continue to be well positioned to meet both the challenges and opportunities posed by the current environment and deliver on our long-term strategy. While I'll not go through the specifics of the quarter, I just want to highlight our strong results, superior returns and importantly increased book value in 2008.</p>
          <p>With that let me turn it over to Jay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay. Turning to page four of the webcast, let me start by saying that our investment portfolio, our reserves, our capital and our liquidity continue to be in fine shape despite the continuing turmoil in the financial markets.</p>
          <p>Our operating company capital remained at or above all of our target levels, our debt to total capital ratio of 19.5% was below our 20% target, the mid-point of the 15 to 25% range that derives from our AA ratings target. Holding company liquidity was $2.1 billion remaining at almost twice our target of one year's worth of interest and dividend, this after contributing $450 million to our qualified pension plan which was funded at a 92% funding level at year-end.</p>
          <p>We have negligible amounts of debt maturing in the next three years and do not rely on commercial paper. Book value per share ex-FAS 115 of $43.37 increased 5% for the year, after repurchasing over $2.1 billion of common shares and paying $712 million of common stock dividends and once again we closed the year with over $25 billion of common equity.</p>
          <p>On page 5 we updated recent areas of market disruption and their impact or lack thereof on Travelers. Overall we continue to be unaffected in any significant way. Note that we have no direct investments related to the Madoff matter and are not aware of any indirect investment exposures we may have, based upon on inquiries we made of our fund managers.</p>
          <p>Page six shows that cats and net favorable prior year reserve development continued to play a meaningful role in our quarterly results. Prior year reserve development favorably impacted our fourth quarter GAAP combined ratio by 5.1 points, and a downward adjustment of estimated costs associated with current year cats, mostly related to Hurricane Ike which included the Texas Wind Pool assessment and Hurricane Gustav, favorably impacted this quarter's combined ratio by 1.6 points.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to point out that we reported an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of Unionamerica, our UK runoff business subsidiary. The sale of Unionamerica also produced a small realized gain in addition to this tax benefit, it eliminated $790 million of net reserves which included $265 million of A&amp;E and it freed up supporting capital. Ex cats and net favorable prior year reserve development, our GAAP combined ratio was 92.5% and we remain very pleased with the underlying profitability of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Page seven of the webcast shows the three major contributors to our operating return on equity. Fixed income NII plus interest on corporate debt remained the major driver. This passage of time component contributed 8.7 points in the current year, down slightly from the prior years, entirely due to lower short term interest rates.</p>
          <p>A much smaller contributor to operating ROE but one that does vary from period to period is non fixed income NII which contributed a negative 0.6 points this quarter &#x2013; negative 0.6 percentage points this quarter due to the difficult investment market conditions we faced, as compared to a positive 1.4 to 1.6 points in the prior years. And underwriting income contributed 4.3 points for the year below the last two years due to the high level of weather related losses. Cumulatively from January 2005 we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.5% consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid teens ROE.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter net investment income of 438 million after tax as shown on page eight, was down significantly from recent quarters. The after tax yield on our fixed income portfolio was 3.7%, consistent with prior years, that is the long term fixed income portfolio, I should say, while the short term portfolio yielded 1.1% due to the actions taken by the Fed to lower short term interest rates. The non fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 14.9% giving back a third of its 2007 NII as private equity real estate partnership and hedge fund valuations were impacted by the challenging financial markets.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our practice we were diligent in updating our non fixed income returns through December 31, despite the usual time lag in which investment managers report results. Accordingly our fourth quarter non fixed income portfolio loss of 164 million after tax included 56 million of after tax losses that were recorded, based upon information requested by us and recently made available to us by certain of our investment managers. As you will see in our guidance we are hoping for a considerable improvement in our non fixed income returns in 2009 but fully realize that they will be subject to evolving market conditions.</p>
          <p>The composition of our $71 billion investment portfolio remains unchanged from recent periods. At year end, fixed income comprised 94% and non fixed income 6% of the portfolio. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remained at AA plus. Its duration was 4.2 and the below investment grade portion was only 2%. And given movements in Treasury rates, credit spreads and equity markets during the quarter, our after tax net unrealized investment losses were reduced to $144 million at year end, an improvement from 818 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our investment portfolio remains well diversified across industries, investment types and individual issuers. We continue to apply very rigorous processes to identify investments for which write-downs should be made. During the fourth quarter we reported net realized losses of $138 million after tax, including impairments of 129 million after tax, bringing full year net realized investment losses to 271 million after tax, which represents a very small percentage of both our investment portfolio and our capital.</p>
          <p>The information that appears on page nine is based on a schedule that will appear in our form 10K showing unrealized losses on investments for which estimated market value is less than 80% of amortized cost. This amount has increased from the third quarter. It now stands at 744 million with the vast majority in this position for 30 days or less. Whilst this still represents a small fraction of both total investments and shareholders' equity, we do closely monitor these investments. And with that let me turn the microphone over to Brian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay. To give some context to the business results I'd like to start by offering some broad comments and then address the business insurance results specifically. Obviously the economy is in a turbulent state. It has impacted our industry broadly and for many individual companies in a profoundly negative way. Yet as our results will show we are favorably positioned for and effectively managed this environment delivering positive results for our customers and for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>As an industry we are sensitive to macroeconomic forces such as decreased demand for goods and services and higher unemployment. These and other pressures drive down payrolls, receipts and consumer and business spending, thereby limiting the overall growth in insurable assets and impacting insurers' ability to grow the top line.</p>
          <p>In addition the current economic environment has also resulted in significant dislocation in the financial services industry driving customers, agents and brokers to more strongly than ever consider the financial and operational stability of their business relationships, including with their insurance carriers. This flight to quality has complimented the fundamentals we have developed during recent years, including our broad risk appetite, underwriting specialization, ease of doing business and claim effectiveness. The resulting stability we have experienced has allowed us to focus on the consistency of our strategy and to deliver superior products and services as well as solid financial performance in these turbulent times.</p>
          <p>Given that context let's review the details beginning with the business insurance results on slide 10. Business Insurance delivered operating income of 619 million compared to 729 million in the same quarter last year. The combined ratio as adjusted on the page was 93.2 for the quarter, a deterioration of 1.8 points from the fourth quarter last year and still at a healthy level. The deterioration is primarily due to the earned impact of the modest rate decreases and loss inflation we've experienced throughout the year, as well as some large loss activity which in the fourth quarter was again above normal levels.</p>
          <p>Net written premium, as shown as slide 11, declined slightly for 1% overall from fourth quarter of 2007. The overall economic contraction is affecting the top line of all of our businesses, but most dramatically in Construction, builders risk policies in Inland Marine, large property accounts in the Trucking business. So given the impact of the environment, we are very pleased that in the aggregate we have a basically flat top line.</p>
          <p>So as we look at the production details on slide 12, we can see how we've been able to maintain level premiums in a contracting economy. First, retention remains high across all our domestic commercial businesses and has increased to 88% in commercial accounts, our core middle market unit. We've been speaking all year about the importance of high retention and these results are a direct outcome of our conscious strategy to maintain stability across a variety of market place conditions and are a critical factor to our success in today's environment. They also speak to the flight to quality dynamic and the value of our products, services and brand in the market place.</p>
          <p>Looking at renewal price change data for the BI segment, you can see that the change is generally consistent with recent quarters. But this data is not total price change and we thought &#x2013; this data is total price change and we thought it was important this quarter to look at components of the change to see what is really going on with pricing. So on slide 13 we graphed the two components of price change, that is rate and exposure and here we see two distinct trends that essentially net out in the RPC. That is for us rates have been generally improving over the last four months while exposures have been generally declining. So although premium is relatively flat, all other things being equal our margin picture is improving.</p>
          <p>The magnitude is different by customer group or line. In businesses like National Property, the shift have been significant with rate change improving dramatically in recent months, while in Commercial accounts rate improvement and exposure declines have been more moderate, but steady. Even in small Commercial, which is not shown on the slide, we have seen a shift with marginal month over month improvement in rate change and offsetting deterioration in exposure growth in each of the last four months.</p>
          <p>Obviously three or four months of activity is not enough to declare a change in the market and we always remind you that we don't have a crystal ball on where things are going. The run rate for these measures has shifted since September. Turning to slide 14, the amount of new business written in aggregate is down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2007. In Select, our small commercial business, new business in second half of the year increased as the result of product and platform expansion we've spoken to you about in the past. Across our other domestic commercial businesses, new business dollars are down or flat reflecting current economic environment and competitive new business pricing dynamics.</p>
          <p>In analyzing new business it is important to speak to the new opportunities or flow of new business that we see. Flow statistics were up in nearly all of our businesses this quarter. This increase follows the trend we've been seeing throughout the last two years and is the result of both our strategy to drive more opportunities across all our businesses and the flight to quality we are seeing in the marketplace. Some of the quarters increase in flow is attributable to other carriers in stability but most is a result of our new product offerings, platform enhancements and strong positioning with agents and customers.</p>
          <p>Even though we are seeing strong new business deal flows, but the new business pricing environment we have to compete in remains very competitive. We've been rigorous in adhering to our underwriting standards and therefore our hit ratio or the percentage of quotes that we are writing has declined. As we have previously emphasized on both new and renewal business we are maintaining our disciplined underwriting standards, so in the aggregate we are very comfortable with the quality of the business we're writing. So overall in the Business Insurance segment, basically level top line and solid margins and in these market conditions this is a result we are very pleased with.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Alan Schnitzer, for the Financial, Professional and International Insurance results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. Turning to slide 15 in the Financial, Professional and International Insurance segment, operating income was $154 million for the quarter as compared to $184 million in the prior year. The adjusted combined ratio for the quarter was 92.4% up 2.7 points from the fourth quarter of last year. The primary driver was small number of large losses in the International business, although our large loss experience has improved from prior quarters.</p>
          <p>Net written premiums in the quarter declined 3% from the fourth quarter of 2007. In bonded financial products the decrease in net written premium is primarily due to lower volumes in the surety business. In International the decrease resulted from foreign currency translation.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 16, in our management liability business in the quarter, the tension remained high and consistent throughout the year, renewal price change was slightly positive at 1% all attributable to rate, and new business was strong. The new business gains were driven by an increased flow of new opportunities from a flight to quality in the public company liability business, partially offset by decline in new business in our financial institution book due to disciplined underwriting. In the international business retention was at 76% in the quarter, down both year over year and over recent quarters, primarily due to intentional underwriting actions. Tier rate in the quarter was flat after eight quarters of negative rate change and other RPC was a positive 6%.</p>
          <p>This time last year we provided you with information about what we termed subprime exposure. Over the course of the year we broadened the scope of our attention beyond subprime to include management liability exposure arising out of the disruption in the financial markets more generally. Starting on slide 17 I'd like to provide you with an update.</p>
          <p>We've consistently focused on building a well diversified portfolio, management liability products sold through various business units. We believe that this diversification and more specifically a lack of over concentration in any one area, such as large publicly traded financial institutions, provides substantial mitigation against shocks coming from the events such as the financial market disruption we've seen over the past year.</p>
          <p>As you can see we write approximately $1.6 billion of management liability premium. In the current economic environment many of these liability products are certainly subject to some level of increased exposure. We've broken down our management liability exposure into four product groups, D&amp;O, E&amp;O, Fiduciary Liability and Other, and we have identified the amount of premium within each product group that we estimate that is subject to a significant elevation of exposure emanating from the financial market disruption. We estimate that the written premium from accounts at elevated risk as a percentage of our overall management liability portfolio is a modest 17%. As a percentage of Travelers overall gross written premium, it is only about 1%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 18. It is important to consider the specific characteristics of these products and our disciplined approach to underwriting. D&amp;O, E&amp;O, and fiduciary coverages are written on claims-made forms that contain defense costs within policy limits. Policies with elevated risk levels contain limits that are generally low between $1 million and $25 million, but more importantly average approximately $4 million. These policies are about evenly split between primary and excess coverages. Average attachment points for excess are relatively high, $46 million for D&amp;O alone and $37 million when including fiduciary E&amp;O. For larger accounts excess coverages comprise approximately 70% of the total.</p>
          <p>We also note that we continue to use reinsurance to further mitigate portfolio risk. Our current analysis of 2008 claims indicates little chance that we will approach the $375 million recovery cap. For 2009 we revised our treaty to respond to frequency more than severity. On slide 19, I'd like to walk you through the actions we've taken over time to address our potential exposure to financial market disruption.</p>
          <p>Since the first quarter of 2007 we have been proactively incorporating the financial market environment into our underwriting discipline. As we told you last year we conducted an individual account analysis on all accounts which reported claims and for those individual accounts we felt had a heightened level of exposure. The scope began with accounts that included credit related announcement or individual accounts with elevated risk characteristics such as financial institutions, subprime lenders, bond insurers and home builders and suppliers.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2008 on a monthly basis we continued to update the analysis and expanded the scope to add more focus on community banks, and consider exposures related to the Madoff matter. We continue to monitor the situation closely and revise our underwriting accordingly. Considering our diverse book and the way we've approached the market and managed our exposure we expect that any potential issue would likely be a more manageable issue of frequency, not severity.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, let me tell you how all this translates into our results. The case of claim notices arising out of financial market disruption reported in 2008 was consistent with 2007. With average limits of excess attachment points slightly more favorable in 2008 as compared to 2007. Our estimate of financial market disruption losses for 2007 improved from last year to this year and excluding our exposure to the Madoff matter, our estimate of losses for 2008 is consistent with our current estimate of losses for 2007.</p>
          <p>While it is early days, of the firms and individuals identified publicly as having exposure to the Madoff matter, we have identified accounts in our management liability business with total exposed limits of approximately $150 million net of reinsurance. We currently estimate our actual aggregate losses from Madoff matter including accounts not yet identified will be less than $75 million pre-tax or $50 million after tax. Some of which we recorded in 2008 and some of which we will record in 2009. We have recognized estimates for financial market disruption and Madoff losses in our 2009 guidance. After considering all items I've mentioned we expect our management liability business will remain profitable as it was in 2008 and 2007. With that, let me turn it over to Joe for a discussion of personal lines.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Alan. Personal Insurance had a good quarter, strong earnings and growth in policies in force. The business continues to demonstrate sound fundamentals. Looking at page 21, you can see operating income is up $25 million compared to fourth quarter of 2007. Driven primarily by favorable cat results and offset by unfavorable net investment income. Fourth quarter had a favorable GAAP combined ratio of 85.6% versus fourth quarter 2007 of 90.8%. Our expense ratio decreased 1 point from fourth quarter 2007, primarily driven by a favorable adjustment to our estimate for the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses from Hurricane Ike. Adjusting for cats prior year development and current year re-estimation, our adjusted combined ratio is slightly better than last year.</p>
          <p>Overall our written premium increased 4% despite challenging market conditions. As you can see from our production results on page 22, we continue to see solid business statistics in both auto and property. Looking specifically at property, production results for the quarter were strong with policies in force increasing 3%, retention stable at 86% and a consistent renewal price change of plus 6%. Homeowners new business is somewhat related to home sales. Against the back drop of significantly declining home sales we remain very pleased with continuing growth of the Quantum Home product, and its ability to increase new business volumes. Quantum home policies now represent more than 13% of our policies in force.</p>
          <p>Shifting to auto, our production results remain solid. We continue to see increasing pressure on new business in the market place, but our renewal price change increased 4%, retention remained in line with prior quarters, policies in force grew 2% over the fourth quarter 2007 with new business premiums up slightly. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.1% or 5.3 points higher than fourth quarter of 2007. It is driven by a difference in prior period development and after normalizing for this prior period development the combined ratio was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Page 23 provides a view of our auto loss trends. As you can see total auto loss trend continue to be relatively flat in the quarter. Severity trend was slightly increasing and was offset by decreased frequency. The market place remains competitive we're seeing some increasing signs of firming, particularly in the auto line. We are continuing to monitor loss trends, profitability, market place conditions as well as the changing economic climate and will appropriately adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with the growth of our business, its underlying performance and look forward to building on that success. With that I'll turn it back to Jay.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Joe. Pages 24 and 25 set forth our guidance for 2009 along with certain supporting information. We're projecting fully diluted income per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.90 which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 10 to 11%. Our guidance assumes: cat losses of $360 million after tax or $0.62 per diluted share; no prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable; a 2.4% non fixed income portfolio yield; 1 billion dollars of share repurchases which would be a reduction from recent years reflecting potential investment returns that more properly reflect risk, along with the uncertain economic conditions that all businesses face rather than a shift in our capital management strategy; no significant change in average invested assets ex FAS 115; and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 585 million shares after share repurchases and employee equity awards.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll open it up for questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. I had a question on the guidance. Jay, could you give us a bit more insight in terms of your comfort level with the 2.4% return on the non fixed income portfolio? And Travelers in my view will probably be one of very few property casualty insurers that'll be buying back stock in 2009, can you talk about your comfort level there, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First with &#x2013; and we'll split this. First with respect to the investment yield, the reason that we provided it obviously is because of the uncertain environment that we're in. And one can be more optimistic or more pessimistic and this was &#x2013; this really ties to our budget for the year and it's premised on a real estate portfolio for which we continue to collect rents, that will provide a positive return, that's offset by what I would characterize as a fairly nominal return in the rest of the alternative investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>So it's a blend, but it does not assume obviously in the aggregate a continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter, but one can obviously have a different view, which is why we decided to provide the number more specifically this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to cover the share repurchases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the share repurchases, as we've said before we manage our capital beginning with the operating companies and our operating companies are very well capitalized. So we look at things that will impact that. We've got earnings projections. We've got moving dividends out of the operating companies up to the holding companies. We've got what we think is a generation of excess capital in the place and we're going to prudently manage it.</p>
          <p>We are saying that the billion dollars of buybacks which, it's not &#x2013; it shouldn't be viewed as a plan. We're going to execute based on what market conditions look like and we're going to execute based on what opportunities look like to invest in our investment portfolio, as I said earlier. But for the purposes of guidance and the overall feel of the place, we will be generating excess capital, and to the extent we don't have the investment opportunities and everything else, including liquidity and having the appropriate capital cushions recovered, we'll return it to shareholders through buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jay, just to add a bit to that comment, it's possible that investment yields become more appropriately reflective of risk in 2009, and as a consequence the alternatives for buying back shares may, certainly not making the prediction, but may become more robust than they've been in previous years.</p>
          <p>In previous years the alternative was a relatively modest bond yield of let's call it 4.5%, even at its highest levels, and it's possible given the markets, and given the credit markets specifically, that returns in other highly rated &#x2013; I'm not speaking now about moving either down in credit quality or long in terms of return, I'm really just speaking about more appropriate returns for appropriate risk assets for a property casualty company, they may be more robust.</p>
          <p>So one of our alternatives this year as we go through the year is to evaluate what's the best for providing shareholder return over time, if there are investment opportunities in the context of other fixed income instruments that are more reflective of long term returns, we'll do that. If not, we've always said we would right size capital and we'll return it.</p>
          <p>I do think Jay's comment about being more reflective generally of challenging economic environment is a real one. The last thing we'd ever want to do is to be buying back shares in one period and then finding ourselves in a position of having to issue equity in the next. That's just a head scratcher for us, and so we're going to manage that just judicially as markets evolve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and if I could just get one more quick one in. Could you update us on your outlook for the surety environment in a tough economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Tom Kunkel is with us today, he's the CEO of our Bond &amp; Financial Products division. Why don't we let Tom take that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you, Alan. The outlook for the surety business, clearly there has been some level of drop off in public construction spending. We are looking though to see what kind of impact any public works program may have on what we're going to see for surety revenue going forward.</p>
          <p>As far as the condition of the contractors in our portfolio, clearly I think the larger contractors still have some pretty robust backlogs. The middle market people have seen some backlog shrink and they've seen some increased competition on bids. All that said, the truth is, is that they're still showing the highest internal credit scores or near the top that we have actually had.</p>
          <p>And in addition to that, I would say that our underwriting continues to be very robust. We're doing comprehensive financial analysis. We're investigating credit relationships. We're closely monitoring new projects that are acquired and the margins they're attained at and closely monitoring the progress of projects as they proceed towards completion.</p>
          <p>All those things said and done, we know management very closely in these companies to the point where we're out walking job sites with them. So I don't think anyone could say that we feel that we're immune to what's happening in the economy. But we do feel like our people are still very well positioned going into and being in the middle of this economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the context of loss perspective in that regard, though, it is credit sensitive business and it will likely show higher losses in a more challenged credit environment than it would have in a less credit challenged environment. Tom, I think is providing the perspective of an underwriting oversight and the way that the business is managed, but recognizing that it is certainly a more challenging economic environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Jay, it's more challenging than it was 24 months ago. Yup.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning. Just curious about your thought process in putting up about half of the policy limits for Madoff, and what would have to change for that number to change materially in either direction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just thinking about the question, we've gone through all of our accounts that we think have exposure to Madoff and we've identified the ones that we think are likely to make claims but haven't. So I think for this really to change dramatically, we'd have to see accounts coming from, a high frequency of accounts that we haven't yet identified as having exposure.</p>
          <p>In terms of the amount we've put up, obviously we've analyzed the claims, we've looked at the policies and we've recorded the amounts that we think are likely to be paid...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the point there, Larry, is that it's not a 50% across the board assessment of limits. It's actually a policy by policy review based upon the claim data and information that we have so far. There are going to be policies that will be exposed. There are going to be policies where there will be significant defenses. There are going to be policies that may not even be exposed and so the number that's here is not a pro rata assessment of exposure but much more an account by account analysis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. And I think for there really to be a significant change from our expectation, we'd have to see claims from a large number of accounts that we're just not expecting claims from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Fair enough. A follow up. Jay, assuming that some of the positive pricing signs get some legs and the market were to continue to firm, there's always an elasticity of demand in the industry and as buyers see their prices rise they tend to reduce their buying habits. Do you think given the economy today that under that scenario there would be a materially greater, let's say elasticity, for demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exposure is certainly, I suspect going to continue to be negative. As we think &#x2013; by the way, exposure for us means risk units for existing customers. And so if payrolls decline and workers' comp premiums decline, that's a reduction in exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If previously there were five trucks in the fleet and now they sell three, obviously less exposure. New business is impacted by new accounts. And so you're going to have a few things here. We're going to have less &#x2013; obviously less business growth and arguably business shrinking. In that regard exposure will be either less than it would have been or perhaps even negative. And on the new business front you're really talking about churn, moving of accounts from one carrier to another. That to me is a more predictable dynamic, in that that's going to likely continue.</p>
          <p>There is a flight to quality, I think, going on. It would be not prudent to not anticipate declining exposure. I do think that as companies particularly on the commercial side and perhaps even on the consumer side, tighten their belts, you'll see rising deductibles. That's circumstances that we've seen before. I don't know that we've seen &#x2013; I have to go back and look, I don't know that we've seen declining limits.</p>
          <p>I think generally what we've seen is that people bought business in particular is willing to self insure more at the bottom than they are to buy less at the top. So you're trading more working layer oriented exposure in that case and its impact on profitability, less than if it was at the top of the profile so to speak. I would certainly anticipate declining exposure, and rate, we'll see. The last three or four months have been encouraging, and we'll have to wait to see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess, just in terms of relative to historical cycle hardening, would you expect it to &#x2013; these trends to be much more pronounced given the economic climate today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not &#x2013; I'm not, not answering, I candidly, I don't know. I'm not sure that we've seen the circumstance before of the combination of, as you describe it, your words now, not mine, a hardening market and a declining economic environment. The last couple of times we have faced changes in cycles, they've been in some relatively robust economic times.</p>
          <p>And so we are, at least from my experience, going back into the '90s, I think this is somewhat unchartered and I just don't know. I don't have an experience to look back to and point to. I've said before that I think that the cycle &#x2013; there are plenty of good reasons to believe that the cycle behavior has changed. We said that several years ago, I think the statistics continue to bear that out. If in fact rates beginning to change, you wouldn't have bet that that would have happened with retentions being at all time highs.</p>
          <p>Historically retention has been much lower. I remember in the middle market again in the high 60s before the market really began to turn, we have a middle market retention of 86. So I think that this cycle has been and continues to be different, behaviorally different, than cycles that we've experienced before and I just don't know how to answer your question because I don't have a basis to have a conclusion on it. I do believe that exposure will continue to go down, that's about as much as I see in a crystal ball.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question will come from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Just a numbers question. It looked like the &#x2013; there was unrealized gain in the quarter after tax of about $674 million. However, if you look at the AOCI line in your balance sheet presentation, it didn't change that much. It looks like there's some offset, I'm assuming it's currency, but could you discuss that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; this is Jay Benet. It's not currency. Without getting into the details of pension accounting, which as you know is very complex, the AOC is also going to be impacted by changes that take place in the pension plan which are for actuarial purposes not fully reflected on an immediate basis.</p>
          <p>So even though we funded the pension plan to get it up to the 93% funding level, think of that as a change in cash to investments, the way the pension accounting works. And then the unrealized loss that the pension assets experienced this quarter or &#x2013; in particular this quarter, but for the year gets reflected as a downward adjustment in the AOC to be recognized over time as an actuarial loss in this particular case through the pension expense. So that's what's causing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, it's probably too early to even have a comment on this, but some of the claims that you have seen related to the broader credit crisis, is there anything to read into yet some of the decisions that have &#x2013; the probably very few decisions that have come out on the trials or settlements related to these claims?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think it's a little early for that. A bit too early to draw conclusions from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's what I suspected. All right. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only comment perhaps and this is anecdotal and not just reacting to your question. I think there tends to be an emotional reaction to these things that eventually works their way through. I'm thinking back to the perception that option back-dating was somehow going to be a very significant event in the D&amp;O, Professional Liability area and so far it hasn't.</p>
          <p>I think you can look back over the last few years of several events where the reaction &#x2013; analytical reaction tends to be my goodness, there's significant exposure here. And yet when the cases come and the litigation begins circumstances often turn out differently. I think we're here way too early to come to any predictions. But I just think back at how many conversations we've had over the last few years of issues that people perceive to be confronting the Professional Liability business.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. With respect to your financial institutions D&amp;O I believe you have around $274 million worth of gross written premiums in 2008. I was wondering whether you could give us the gross exposure that you have out there and what level of reserves have you put on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 274 you're looking at is not just financial institutions, that is the total of the gross written premium that we've identified as having elevated exposure to financial market disruption more broadly. So I just want to clarify that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the gross limits you're looking for, that's not a number we've disclosed in the past and I think not something that's really I think meaningful in terms of perhaps trying to draw the conclusions that you may be looking for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of market share, what do you think your market share for financial institutions will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask &#x2013; Tom Kunkel can answer that question. But I think the thing you've got to think about, though, is you have to sub-segment the financial institution market because our market share among the large financial institutions isn't all that significant relative to our overall financial institution portfolio. Tom, do you have anything to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan, I think you hit the key point. So before estimating a figure, you would say we're in just various aspects and highly diversified across the whole financial marketplace, so to say a market share really does lump everything together.</p>
          <p>All that said and done, you could say that possibly there is an eight or nine percent market share. But lot of it is in community banks, smaller institutions, privately held, you see some mutual fund business. So it's really diversified across all aspects of that business and more so that is a part of a more highly diversified management liability business across the place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's, I think important, we &#x2013; it often gets I think confused, but a meaningful position for us is in community banks. And I'm going to go back and &#x2013; my recollection is it's 85% privately owned. Only 15% of which are public institutions. We're talking about &#x2013; my recollection was again total assets &#x2013; was it 5 billion or less, predominantly in the book?</p>
          <p>I mean, we're going back to an old webcast, where we gave the information on the community bank business. But it's been our experience at least so far that these are institutions that are generally not exposed to the kinds of issues that many of these questions are directed to.</p>
          <p>87% -- I've got the statistics here, 87% have assets less than $1 billion and 11% from 1 billion to 3 billion. And again, 85% of them are privately held. The average limit of D&amp;O coverage for that bank is $3.8 million. One of the comments that we've made is that we're not a severity book. We're not writing significant numbers of 50 or 75 or 100 million dollars of limits, where one account can become problematic to our results.</p>
          <p>Our exposure and we've said this before to the financial arena, would be &#x2013; it would change if in fact somehow the community banks broadly were dragged into the financial crisis, we don't see that happen. It is always possible it may, but we haven't seen that happen yet. We have some difficulty perceiving the circumstances that that could happen.</p>
          <p>These are typically not institutions that underwrite securities. These are typically local deposit-taking loan-making banks that operate again very locally. So I think to look just to the market share can produce an inappropriate analysis of what our exposure to these events might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. That is fair. Just one follow up. Claim notices appear to be same in '08 versus '07. Just curious given your exposure to mostly smaller accounts, would it be fair for a person to think that in the first instance the larger financial institutions would usually be sued but then later on you would have more of the smaller financial institutions being targeted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer to that would be typically not. The first half, correct, where suits tend to go is where assets exist and where there are deep pockets and where the ability to marshal class action suits can produce a significant outcome. And so I think you'll see obviously an attraction of these kind of litigation to larger financial institutions.</p>
          <p>Many people will often ask who insures them. The answer by the way sometimes is in fact no one or in fact no one in working layers. These are institutions that often self insure significant amounts of D&amp;O exposure and they buy either &#x2013; they buy relatively high up and this is not a universal statement, but it is true that larger financial institutions, the great big money centered banks or at least the ones that used to be great big money centered banks, often self insure working layers of exposure.</p>
          <p>And it is not been our experience, obviously it can be different any given time, but it's not been our experience that litigation starts at higher institutions and indeed inevitably filters down to smaller ones. That has not been a trend that we've seen before, it may be different this time, but again it is difficult to attach the community bank business, not impossible, but difficult to attach it to these circumstances.</p>
          <p>That is different from investment advisors. It's different from those institutions that Alan and Tom have spoken about, let's say specifically in reference to the Madoff matter, where we have a name and we have a policy and we've identified it and we've put in on the schedule. There it is different. But in the broader sense of the financial dislocation, we continue to feel pretty good that our exposure is diversified and tends to be at the lower, smaller institutions.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. A couple of questions here. First, Jay, the fact that you guys are looking to potentially buy back a billion dollars of stock. Does that at all indicate your appetite or view of some of the properties that are available out there in the market place? Just given the liquidity and excess capital you have, I figure you'd be in a pretty good position to maybe pick up some attractive assets?</p>

          <p>No, it doesn't. It's a number to be used for purposes of establishing guidance. We're looking -- we look at lots of things. We look at -- Bill Heyman looks at investment opportunities that come along in our asset portfolio and to the extent that business opportunities come along it would be imprudent of us to not to look at and evaluate and consider. It really is a number, a starting point, if you like, for the purposed of calculating guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then next question, Jay, if I look at your guidance for this year,</p>
          <p>it comes out to be call it a 10 to 11% return on equity. Would you view that as a trough ROE going through the market for Travelers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'd hope so. That would be a pretty good outcome. If you look at the bottom -- again, you are getting into questions about cyclicality and depths and all the rest. The last time the cycle turned, I think most people in the industry would have given their eye teeth to have produced a 10 or 11% return at the bottom.</p>
          <p>So I don't know. Again it is a crystal ball question. All I can do is tell you that the rate data for the last several months has been encouraging and it would certainly be a nice place to begin to make a bottom, again with retentions at all time highs and with projected returns in that 10 to 11%, it would feel pretty good to be making the bottom there if it happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then the last question quickly for Brian. You mentioned the hit ratios continue to decline here although your flow is moving up. I'm just curious, can you get into a little bit why you think that is happening? Is it that some of the struggling carriers out there perhaps are getting even more aggressive in trying to retain business? Do you see any kind of shift in the hit ratios during the course of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a function of two fundamental things. One is there are clearly some distressed carriers out there and without question more of their business is in the market than would be traditionally so. So a lot of business in play and they're doing the logical thing, which is competing very aggressively to keep it.</p>
          <p>But we're getting our shot at quoting on it and we're writing some of it when we feel we can get it at the right rates, terms, conditions. I think the other thing is we feel pretty confident about our capabilities in the market place and so really starting over two years ago we started to see more flow. We've been much more aggressive in pushing out more products and being more proactive with the agents and I think that's really made a difference. I think it's those things together that are driving the flow and the market conditions are kind of as we just talked about, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the hit list when you are losing a piece of business are you finding that the delta between your price and perhaps the incumbent carrier is getting greater, is it less? Are you barely missing it or is it --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in general it's not barely missing it. I would say we win the jump balls more often than not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a bit anecdotal. We actually do keep track of hit ratios very precisely. What we don't keep track of because we don't always know &#x2013; what we don't keep track of is the extent to which when we don't take business whether we lost by price or frankly we lost for something else. What we're answering here is anecdotal. In some cases, price may be the same, the coverage limits may be a lot higher.</p>
          <p>We don't know how to answer that question other than anecdotal observations from what we're hearing in the marketplace. Our sense is &#x2013; and by marketplace meaning our own folks. Reports from our own folks say when we are close, we are in there. When we are not close, we are not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And don't take our comments to imply that hit ratio is plummeting. Flow is going up a good bit and hit ratios are coming down a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again forgetting about the hit ratio for a second, what I find encouraging is that this has been, in this more challenging market over the last couple of years, the product development whether it is Quantum Auto, Quantum Home, Travelers Express, the new products in middle market, these things have made a difference. They have clearly &#x2013; and we have seen it, they have clearly made a difference in the amount of business that we have an opportunity in which to quote.</p>
          <p>The more challenged competitive environment, and by that I mean the position of certain other companies, has certainly augmented that. It is very difficult for us to sort out how much is the result of our product working development, and how much is in fact a flight to quality. It is pretty clear to us that they are both working.</p>
          <p>The notion that we could in fact see improving margins &#x2013; and Joe by the way made a very good point earlier, Brian said improving margins, yeah, improving from where they would have been if rates hadn't picked up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That doesn't mean...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is right. The rate is still negative. We're still not above that zero line. Nonetheless, as that rate line picks up, it is improving margins from where they otherwise would have been. A combination of an underwriter's willingness to be more aggressive in the market place because they feel better about the rate picture combined with that increased flow has the potential, no prediction here, has the potential of being pretty powerful.</p>
          <p>And that is exciting to us and we'll see, maybe it occurs, maybe it doesn't. We are &#x2013; my comment about being well positioned really speaks to that. We're seeing more flow. We've got the things we need to deliver on it and as price changes underwriters' attitudes will, also. That can be pretty powerful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two quick questions if I may. First on the FI or actually the way you term it the high risk professional lines book. Can you give us a sense of loss ratio? Why is it what you're booking it at in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've broken down loss ratio at that level. I don't have the data handy actually and I'm not sure we're inclined to disclose loss ratio at that granular of a level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just maybe provide some color? You made a big comment with respect to the whole book that you expect the book to be profitable, I think you said in '09 in one of the comments in the press release. I'd just be curious whether or not that comment would then hold for the at risk book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when we make that comment we're making a comment with respect to the portfolio overall and intentionally not breaking it out into any particular piece, and really the sense we're trying to give there, is there are no shocks coming to that book and that will continue to be a profitable book as a portfolio. We weren't intending to give more granular --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is insurance in the following sense. Once you begin to identify the accounts that are likely to have losses, it becomes unlikely that that book narrowly defined would be profitable. Ultimately insurance is a combination of those accounts that have losses and those accounts that don't. What you have actually just asked is if you identify those accounts that you think are going to have losses do you think that they will still be profitable? The answer I think is pretty obviously no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I get the law of large numbers. My question is the one thing we are all seeing from here, it is one thing to say losses in financial institution book even if thing guess bad may not really be that material from an earnings standpoint, and frankly I would agree with that. But I guess the only thing I'm trying to get at is -- trying to get a gauge of if I think there are going to be losses there whether or not -- how big the delta is for me and you, either side. That is just what I'm struggling with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand the direction of your question and I think we've come back to Alan's comments. You can take a look at the FPII business broadly and the detail that's been provided here with respect to '08. And I don't think it's terribly difficult to analytically make a projection into '09. There is an observation in here that '08 claim activity was about the same as '07. We made a comment about what the '07 &#x2013; how the '07 estimate had developed. Short of saying that accounts with losses have losses, I think we've really tried to give you &#x2013; not for the purpose of giving you information, but there's enough information here to have a view on how FPII would perform next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other, just with respect to the Lloyds business, is that a business -- and I know the capital is moving around a lot because of the currency. Is that a business where net-net as you think about allocating capital in '09 you are likely to increase your appetite?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're holding constant the capital requirement from the appetite in the business then I would say that you wouldn't expect a significant change in the appetite. Maybe it would pick up a little bit, but I don't think we would expect a wholesale change there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Lloyds business just like all of our business is subject to internal capital allocations and the returns we calculate based upon premiums and loss estimates going forward. We will factor into those processes whatever the costs are associated with it. And in the case of Lloyds, what we and other carriers use instead of hard capital are letters of credit that support the Lloyds business. So in our case, what you'll see is higher cost associated with those letters of credit. But again, it's all factored into the pricing models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think that is exactly the point which is we're not capital constrained in any way. If there are business opportunities to write more business in Lloyds at attractive prices, we can and we will. There is nothing that limits our ability to do more business, to write more profitable business there or frankly in any line of business that we have. We are in an unusual position as evidenced by the share repurchases, of actually being in a position where we are still generating excess capital, we'll &#x2013; if we can write more insurance business we're all for it. We love the business. And if we can do it profitably and thoughtfully we will.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Bill Heyman speaking by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bill Heyman. I'd start with two observations, and that is the first, we've always believed that we're an insurance company which invests its money rather than an investment organization funded by insurance premiums.</p>
          <p>Second, as we look at the landscape, we're looking to buy assets of the type we bought before at better prices, rather than to buy assets that we wouldn't have bought before, simply because they're now at lower prices. In terms of looking at risk, we think risk is a combination of price and reasonably expected scenarios. Simply because price is lower doesn't mean the combination has changed and paradoxically we could look at assets selling at much lower prices than they sold a year or two ago and conclude that they are even riskier now.</p>
          <p>That being said, we think there will be opportunities, believe it or not, in private equity although to capitalize on them one will likely have to have commitments to funds existing now, which we do. We think there will be opportunities in high grade corporate debt. We're worried about so called distressed assets notwithstanding the rush into them, because we think that corporate reorganizations may be very different. The lack of DIP financing may mean that recoveries are lower. More companies are liquidated as opposed to organized and the world that you enter when an obligation defaults may be different than the one you entered two years ago when it defaulted.</p>
          <p>Therefore we'd like not to experience that. We were certainly solicited by every opportunity fund in the last year or so and passed on them. They either performed poorly or blew up. I guess the short answer is we're going to do very much what we've been doing and just hope we get better prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the impact of the economy on both your business and strategically what it might do to your competitors. And I'm thinking in a couple of areas. One is just, if there's less exposure in the industry and therefore less growth, but you still have to spend the same amount of time servicing the account, that would seem to cause some expense pressures for yourselves, and so how are you dealing with that? And then competitively you obviously face a large number of very small competitors and could this be a crushing blow to them in that they can't -- the lack of scale they have already does this make the scale benefit you have even more compelling?</p>
          <p>And then operationally for you guys how might we see -- maybe as claiming behavior changes, maybe some of those truckers are facing bankruptcy and become more aggressive in their claims or maybe the automated underwriting box is not calibrated for a different economic environment, and doesn't perform as well as you like. Are there things you are doing, operational reviews, to make sure the people at the field level are aware your business might respond differently than it would in a more normal economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, I'll take a shot at it. Let me -- and just to give everybody notice, Jay -- after I finish the question, Jay Benet is going to, I hope provide some other insight into the Bond &amp; Financial Products loss ratio, some of the questions I think have been centering around this and there may be confusion and I think he can add some clarity to it. We'll get to that as soon as we've finished.</p>
          <p>First, in the context of our own business, I have enough trouble figuring out what is going on in our own shop, forget trying to figure out what is going on in other people's shops. I can tell you in our shop, volume is up, not volume being written, but flow is up. Underwriters are busy. It is not as if at the moment we have a lot of excess capacity sitting around in the field waiting for something to happen.</p>
          <p>Universally everyone I've talked to in the field and the people I interact with are folks reviewing accounts, they're out in the market, visiting with agents. It's not a quiet time at the instant. That is driven again by our own product development over the last several years and I think some of the competitive challenges that you've see which have caused agents to shop certain accounts more dynamically than perhaps they might have in the past. That is a pattern that we talked about in third quarter and it continued on into the fourth.</p>
          <p>The claim organization is in fact, I would say busy. They've got the remnants of Ike and Gustav and all the rest of the cat season that we dealt with this season. In terms of resources in our organization people are hopping and there's not a lot of idol time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are they getting paid less dollars for the amount of work they are doing just because the account that might have had 500 employees and now has 400 employees, so doing the same amount of work for it but there's less premium dollars associated with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not &#x2013; again, and this is an important thing to understand, as I said before, I would anticipate exposure continuing to decline. But remember that a dollar of exposure has lost cost associated with it. One of the great, and in fact anomalies of our business, if you lose $100 in premium with losses associated with it, you have business that is even on the margin at an 85 combined ratio you have got 85 cents in saved losses and 15 points in commission saved and premium taxes that aren't paid.</p>
          <p>So the bottom line impact of exposure, it is not zero, but it is not nearly as powerful as people think. And of course you see that on the way up. When we add exposure it doesn't change the bottom line as quickly or as dramatically as some people think it will. The marginal cost dynamic in our business is pretty high. Make a distinction between that and rate.</p>
          <p>Rate is extremely powerful from the bottom line perspective. You pay 15 points, round numbers of commission, and the rest falls to the pre-tax line. So a point of rate, quite, quite powerful in terms of profitability. A point of exposure, far less powerful in terms of profitability. As we look at the situation right now and again not forecasting, but what we've seen in the last several months is generally speaking improving rates and declining exposure. That remains pretty powerful from a margin perspective.</p>

          <p>And some of it, as Jay said, we're obviously speaking through our lens. So if you are a company that has a significantly different, as in lower, retention experience than we've got, that pressure is going to be a lot more intense. But we are keeping business that we want to keep and we've got lots of opportunities and so we feel pretty good about it.</p>

          <p>In the context of a recession certainly we talked about this before, our trucking business is already reflecting declining volumes and some higher losses and has for some time. That is not a new dynamic in Northland operation. If you speak very, very broadly about recessionary times, experience suggests that workers' comp losses tend to rise. That is a phenomena that we've seen before. And that may be, I'd say if I think about our book of business, the principal loss dynamic, again I'll put the surety business also to the side for a second because that has its own unique dynamics that can be somewhat more severity driven. You can have an individual name obviously get into financial distress. But if you're looking for a pattern, I would say workers' comp losses rising. We watch for that, we try to underwrite to it.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and consistent with Joe's comment on the loss trends of the -- specifically the UIM stuff, but more broadly, we're obviously watching very, very closely our claim experience. We see little but not dramatic impacts from the economy. We expect that they will become more dramatic, many of those are negative, some of them are actually positive. People drive less, et cetera. We're watching closely but there haven't been big spikes. Trucking is one where we've been seeing experience.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know we're out of time, but just quickly, is it easier or harder for you to identify those changes now that you do more automated underwriting? Basically, does the automation make it easier to spot or does the lack of underwriters going and scrubbing every account one by one and you don't get anecdotal information make it harder?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It probably makes it easier in the businesses where we're doing it because you can capture the data in a more consistent fashion, but it does make it different. I'm not arguing that one is necessarily better than the other, but it makes it very different in terms of what you have to do to see it and spot it.</p>
          <p>Anecdotal information by its nature is anecdotal and colored and harder to assimilate rapidly and have a consistency to it. When you are dealing with smaller accounts where the law of large numbers applies, that becomes very distorted. We feel better about it there. What you get in this and it is why we built significant product management organizations and significant investments in our management information infrastructure, is the ability to crunch all the data and look at it and there are different things, symptoms that push sometimes in different directions.</p>
          <p>As Brian points out, we may see less driving exposure in an auto environment. Over time we're less likely to see less maintenance investment as people can't quite afford the brake job or the new set of tires. So that may push up -- one pushes down frequency and one pushes up. They'll come at different periods of time along that economic downturn and we're watching for all of those different components very carefully.</p>

          <p>This is Jay Benet. The thing that I wanted to just add some color to, just to take some of Jay's comments about if you look at businesses that have losses, of course they have losses. If you look at other businesses within FPII in particular, as Alan and Tom had said, this is a very diversified portfolio.</p>
          <p>So we don't want to give people the impression that when you look at FPII's combined ratio of 87.2 that that's uniform amongst all the different businesses within FPII. We certainly don't close our eyes to the loss experience of any one of these individual businesses and what you are seeing in our numbers or potentially not seeing in our numbers is --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're seeing and you may not have access to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- is that when you look at things like the financial institutions book, the professional liability book, the public company liability book within, I mean there are some higher loss ratios, combined ratios associated with those businesses that are being offset by very favorable results because of the lack of loss activity that is taking place in areas like commercial surety and construction services. This is all blending, as Alan said, to 87.2. But we don't want to give anyone the impression we're not fully looking at the loss experience that is taking place in some of these businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The financial institution portion of Bond &amp; Financial Products, its combined ratio reflects the loss experience that we're speaking about here. So does the professional liability book within Bond &amp; Financial Products. And if you're asking if those were profitable, I said before, no in 2008, those individual books of business within Bond &amp; Financial Products were not. But the commercial surety business was, the construction services business was, the private and nonprofit Bond &amp; Financial Product business was.</p>
          <p>So it's a big book with lots of lines and those two lines, to Jay's point, do reflect the claims experience and the adverse development that we anticipate in those lines. I think that will be helpful in understanding how the numbers roll together.</p>
