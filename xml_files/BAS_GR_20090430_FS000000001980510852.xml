        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much and good morning ladies and gentlemen.  On behalf of BASF, I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2009 conference call.  The continued challenging economic environment had of course a significant negative impact on our businesses.  Nevertheless, BASF demonstrated strength and delivered a robust operational performance in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With me on the call today to explain the results in more detail are Dr. Kurt Bock, our Chief Financial Officer and Manfredo R&#xFC;bens, President of BASF Finance Division.  First, Dr. Bock will review the financial results of the first quarter and afterwards both gentlemen will be available to take your questions.  Now, the usual reminder, today's conference call is really limited to only one hour since our general, Annual General Meeting is starting right after this call.  I would therefore like to ask you to please limit your questions only to one at a time.  We have posted the numbers and charts which go along with this conference call on our website, and that is basf.com/share.  With this I would like to hand over to Dr. Bock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Magi and good morning also from my side.  Welcome to today's conference call on our first quarter results.  At BASF, we are facing the deepest recession of our recent history which simultaneously affects almost all businesses and all regions.  Today, I will explain how we performed in the first quarter and describe what we currently see ahead.</p>
          <p>The second chart is much more difficult because our visibility is still extremely limited.  We cannot detect any signs of improvement at the moment, and we expect that the next couple of quarters will continue to be extremely challenging.  You should also keep in mind that BASF first half year results are traditionally better than those of the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>However, let me start on a more positive note.  Last year we set out clear priorities for coping with the crisis.  To conserve cash and improve free cash flow by prioritizing expenditures, cutting back on costs and reducing working capital as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash generation, Q1 was quite successful.  Operating cash flow almost doubled to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, a major achievement in view of a 68% decline in net income. Since the beginning of the year, BASF has reduced its net working capital by almost &#x20AC;1 billion.  This figure only partially reflects lower raw material cost and is mainly the result of our decisive cutbacks in production globally.</p>
          <p>We also see that our comprehensive efforts to cut costs are paying off as expected.  Our entire team has a high sense of urgency to do whatever is necessary and possible in this regard.  Overall, global capacity utilization in Q1 was below 60%. That has to be compared with an average utilization operating rate of about 80% in normal time.  We have reduced all kinds of discretionary spending, i.g. (sic) [e.g.] travel and third party services.  More importantly, we have also adjusted personnel costs by cutting back overtime, introducing flexible work time arrangements and short time work at many sites.  The number of employees has started to come down, which also reflects structural measures to improve our business portfolio.</p>
          <p>Until the end of the year these measures will lead to a reduction of roughly 2000 positions.  This figure does not include any restructuring measures in the course of the Ciba integration.  Nevertheless, these efforts are almost not visible when you look at our bottom line, EBIT before special items declined by 58% to &#x20AC;985 million.  This result includes an excellent performance by the Agricultural Solutions segment where we had our best first quarter ever, achieving an EBIT of &#x20AC;344 million up 85 million year-over-year.  The Group's earnings decline was due to a sales slump of 23%, which mainly resulted from a 20% fall in volume; lower margins and very high cost of idle capacities also contributed to the drops in earnings, which also translated into lower net income and earnings per share.</p>
          <p>These numbers have improved compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.  This was mainly due to the seasonal upturn in our agricultural business and the recovery from the loss in our Plastics segment.</p>
          <p>Let me explain our financial situation before I go on to outline the business development in our six segments in more detail.  For 2009, we have set ourselves the target of generating a cash inflow of at least &#x20AC;1 billion by reducing net working capital.</p>
          <p>After three months, we have already achieved this goal.  Mainly due to the reduction in net working capital, free cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;1.5 billion.  I would certainly not recommend that you annualize this number for the entire year.  We will, however, continue to trim our production and inventories as far as possible.  The increase in investments is primarily due to projects in the Agricultural Solutions and Oil and Gas segments.</p>
          <p>As we have said before, we plan to reduce this year's capital spending by about 20% compared with 2008.  As previously announced, we did not buyback any shares in Q1, but rather used our cash flow to reduce our financial debt.  During the last three months, we reduced our net debt by &#x20AC;1.5 billion.  Over the last 12 months, our net debt increased only moderately by &#x20AC;750 million despite the prime payment of the 2007 dividend, our share repurchases, the acquisition of Revus, and the purchase of roughly 15% of Ciba shares in 2008.</p>
          <p>We have raised &#x20AC;3.4 billion over the course of the last couple of months, by issuing several medium and long-term bonds and have thereby reduced our short-term debt significantly.  In all transactions, we experienced tremendous demand for our bonds.  Our commercial payback program has been liquid throughout the financial crisis and continues to offer very attractive financing conditions.</p>
          <p>Let me also add, that we have not seen any noticeable impact on our financing costs, as a result of the change in our rating by one notch to A+.  Our balance sheet remains strong and our financial debt has a balanced maturity profile with 76% of total debt, being due more than one year from now.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the business development in more detail.  In addition to the decline in volumes in the first quarter, prices came down by an average of 5% year-over-year.  This mainly reflects lower prices in Chemicals, Plastics, and Functional Solutions.  Compared with the fourth quarter of last year, prices in our industrial business has come down on an average by more than 10%, putting additional pressure on our margins.  Volumes also declined by 4%, clearly indicating that things are not getting better for the time being.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly explain the business development in our individual segments.  For your convenience, we have depicted the comparative figures for both Q1 and Q4, 2008 on the charts.  In Chemicals, sales suffered from significantly lower prices and volumes, both with internal and external customers.  Margins for most major commodities remained under considerable pressure.  Prices for cracker products in Europe remained on monthly quotation and were roughly 40 to 50% lower than in Q4 of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cracker margins were unsatisfactory in all regions.  The weak fertilizer market also impacted our Inorganics business.  One of the rare bright spots in the segment was the record price level for caustic soda, a counter-cyclical commodity, as some of you may remember from our Chemicals Day last year.  Despite this tough environment, all divisions generated positive earnings demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and our Verbund structure.  In general, we expect continued margin pressure and no improvement in demand for chemicals for at least the next couple of months.</p>
          <p>Earnings in Plastics deteriorated year-on-year due to a dramatic decline in demand from major customer industries and a significant drop in prices for commodities such as polyamide, MDI and TDI.  Compared with Q4, 2008 earnings improved thanks to slightly better demand from Asia and significantly lower inventory write downs.  However, Performance Polymers still reported negative earnings.  We expect the overall weaker market conditions to persist for the immediate future.</p>
          <p>Volumes in Performance Products declined considerably, but Care Chemicals and Performance Chemicals increased their prices year-on-year.  Performance Chemicals especially but also Acrylics &amp; Dispersions were hit hard by a decline in demand from the automotive, construction, and packaging industries.  The cost of idle capacities negatively impacted earnings in this segment.</p>
          <p>Only Care Chemicals increased earnings year-on-year due to better margins and lower fixed costs.  The activities of Ciba will be integrated into this segment later in the year.  For Q2 we plan to report Ciba as a separate division within the Performance Products segment.  The new divisional structure following the reorganization of Ciba's business and its integration into BASF will start with Q3 and we will brief you on that before the next earnings call.</p>
          <p>Functional Solutions was severely impacted by the weak automotive industry.  The construction industry on the other hand showed a mixed picture with good demand coming from Asia and the Middle East, but Europe and North America continue to suffer.  In the Catalysts division precious metal prices decreased significantly.  Revenues from precious metal trading were down by two-third leading the overall decline in sales of the division.</p>
          <p>Coatings and Construction Chemicals increased their prices, but they still reported negative earnings.  Agricultural Solutions had an excellent start with the year.  Prices and volumes increased compared with Q1 of 2008.  Europe and North America posted higher sales mainly in fungicides and herbicides.  Sales in South America were flat due to weaker demand for sugarcane product as well as a prolonged drought in Argentina and Southern Brazil.  We continue to be optimistic for our Agricultural Solutions business, but Q1 should not be viewed in isolation.  As we have mentioned on numerous occasions, we think in half year periods rather than in quarters in the crop protection business.</p>
          <p>The significant oil price decline obviously led to lower earnings in the Oil &amp; Gas segment.  This was buffered by increasing earnings from Yuzhno Russkoye and a continuously positive time lag effect in Natural Gas Trading.</p>
          <p>Non-deductible oil taxes declined by &#x20AC;304 million to &#x20AC;154 million.  A 230 million net income after minority interest declined just 12% as a result of foreign currency losses and a hard currency loan of the Yuzhno Russkoye operation in which we have a 35% share of earnings and which we consolidate as equity.  This also explains the decline in the financial result when you look at our P&amp;L statement.</p>
          <p>Due to the sideways development of the oil price, the positive time lag effect in gas trading will decrease significantly in the second quarter.  Continuously low demand from industrial customer and power plant as well as a potential further reduction in OPEC quotas on the E&amp;P side could also negatively impact the business in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Let we now highlight a few topics in Other.  In Styrenics, sales decreased with volumes down 19% and prices down 24%.  However, earnings remained at the same level as in Q1 2008 mainly due to a better business with styrene monomer and polystyrene.  The increase in negative earnings in Other was mainly caused by the hedging of plant sales in foreign currencies, which have not been yet allocated to the division an effect of mark-to-market, which was as we all know difficult to forecast.</p>
          <p>Looking at sales by regions, you can clearly see that the crisis has hit all regions.  In local currencies, the sales decline in Asia and North America is even greater.  Earnings outside of Europe were higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting cost improvement, lower inventory adjustment, and the seasonal improvement of Agricultural Solutions.</p>
          <p>I'm now coming to the acquisition of Ciba.  On April 9, we closed the acquisition of Ciba.  Immediately after closing, we have started the discovery phase.  Joint teams are analyzing the acquired businesses in depth from inside to define the optimal positioning of the combined businesses in the market and to complete the detailed integration plan.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier at the beginning of July 2009, we will start with the actual integration of Ciba's business into BASF.  This will involve substantial restructuring measures in order to achieve profitable growth of the combined businesses in the future.  We have set ourselves an ambitious timeframe.  The integration shall be completed 12 months after the actual closing and we aim to achieve synergies of about 10% of Ciba's sales.</p>
          <p>Let me now conclude my presentation with some remarks on our outlook for 2009.  As we all know, BASF is facing major challenges in 2009.  The demand for chemical products has continued to decline since the start of the year.  An improvement in the overall economy is not in sight and temporary increases in demand in individual regions or industries should not be taken as a sign of a sustainable upturn from our point of view.  In 2009 despite the acquisitions of Ciba Holding AG and Revus Energy ASA, we expect a decline in sales compared with 2008 and an even greater decline in income from operations, which will be negatively impacted by integration costs. Our goal of earning our cost of capital is thus becoming increasingly difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention.  Manfredo and I are now happy to answer all of your questions.  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have already a list of questions, ladies and gentlemen who want to ask questions, so we start off with <mark type="inaudible" />  Fund Research GmBH.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everybody.  Howard Gruber from Fund Research.  I have a question on the capacities which have been shutdown recently, I just wanted to know how much of this in terms of percentage is associated with idled capacity, so meaning that you just, just -- will probably later on this year reactivate these capacities.  So, my question how much of these recent shutdowns is linked to idling capacities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mr. Gruber I think everything which we have shutdown is idle and also cost is idle cost, and those are pretty high.  A decision when and how and if to restart those capacities hasn't been made obviously and this will only happen on short-term notice when we really see that there is a recovery in the market which obviously is not the case for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can I, add just a little question to that.  How much is the cost for idling capacity related to the usual or the common costs running a capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah now but basically 25%, as I said we have a normal capacity utilization rate of something like 80% in good years, it's above 80 on average, it's probably something like 80.  Right now, we are below 60, well that makes it a 25% decline in terms of multiples of average idle capacity costs that is probably four times as much idle capacity costs than we have in normal time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the next question comes from Nobert Barth, WestLB.  Please go ahead Nobert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes,  hello, Nobert Barth, WestLB speaking.  One question on the volume side, what we have seen in the first quarter, can you value what is coming from the destocking effect and especially also looking forward how you see that developing in April or in Q2?  And some competitors already reported that they see some stabilization in business and also especially in regions like China, can you elaborate a little bit on that, how you see that, and if you compare your statement on the outlook compared to that what you have given in February, do you think that had improved or has worsened, give a little bit flavor on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes hello, Mr. Barth.  I think that wasn't one question, just but I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I tried my best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Try all.  So, with regard to destocking, it's very difficult for us to read what is really fundamental lack of demand and what is just the destocking effort.  We think that many of our customers have tried very hard to reduce their inventories, but when you look at the automotive industry I think it's fair to say that they are not yet where they should be and we expect further destocking in that industry, for instance.  That will trickle down through the entire value chain as you can imagine.</p>
          <p>What we have seen in Q1 is that in particular industries and regions there's little bit of a pop up of demand, give you an example, textile fibers in Asia showed a little bit of an improvement. But, that was temporarily happening and then it came down again.  So, we think that our customers, same as we, don't have a clear view of the future and that makes them very, very cautious in ordering.  And as we said before their order pattern is very volatile, short-term, small quantities. We cannot identify any clear trend and as I said in my little speech we are very hesitant, very careful to identify or explain that we now see any change of fundamental business situation.  I think it's simply not the case.</p>
          <p>I give you another example, looking at the toy industry, which is important for the Plastics business of BASF.  Toys are basically produced Asia.  We have no clue yet whether that industry will start producing in Q2 and Q3, which is normally the time when they produce for them the Christmas season.  And we have no indication what's going to happen there.  So, we have to be very, very careful, and we are not over-interpreting any small blips we see in our demand pattern.  We think that Q2 will show no improvement over what we have seen in Q1.</p>
          <p>I think that was the one answer to your few questions.  Outlook, as I said we think it's increasingly difficult to earn our cost of capital.  That's the basic message here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so we, before we move on, I would like to please ask you to remain disciplined and only ask one question, and the next one is Thomas Gilbert [UBS Warburg].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much.  Good morning.  The issue of low cost versus high cost capacity in the industry, do you think we are at the point of pain where you see some of your high cost competitors shutting down permanently?  Have you seen any area in petrochemicals, in acrylics, in coatings, anywhere where you believe you are lower cost and you need competitors to shut down at the high end of the cost curve for supply and demand to rebalance?  Thank you very much for taking my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi, Thomas, thanks for the question.  When you follow the industry very carefully, and we have seen a few shutdowns in the more petrochemical related areas.  Is there enough pain already?  I would think that some people are already suffering quite negative cash returns, so I would expect that there is still an additional need for reducing capacity.  We haven't seen yet enough in that respect, but it's very difficult for us to predict what's going to happen in that respect as well.  Because as you all know these are individual company decisions, which should be cash driven.  We are doing the same, by the way, when we make shutdown decisions, it's purely based on the NPV of cash returns which we foresee for the next couple of quarters.  Hard to say, but I think the pain is increasing, and many companies are now feeling it.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  On the Ciba synergies and your 10% target...</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us some clarity on when you expect those to come through and how much those will cost in additional restructuring charges?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a little bit too early to talk about the integration costs.  We are still in the, what we call discovery phase.  We are now sitting down with the new BASF employees and go through every individual business side, cost structure, all the personnel, and organizational changes are discussed right now.  It's fair to assume that there will be integration costs, because we need heavy restructuring, as we said before, but please I beg your understanding that we will talk about those specific numbers then in July when we come back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With a more detailed plan with regard, the other question was with regard to when, that we can basically base on our previous experience with the Engelhard and Degussa integration.  It's probably fair to say that at least 50% of the synergies should be realized within the first year and then it comes down a little bit, I think by the end of the second year we should basically -- be through that process.  In the case of Ciba, as we have said before, this needs to be a speedy and very decisive process, so we try everything to make this as fast as possible.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning.  Thanks for taking my question.  Back to your guidance, I know it's very early in the year to be talking about this, but I wonder if you can perhaps share any thoughts on your, on the Board's thought process with regard to using the cost of capital as a performance measure and as a tool for setting the dividend, i.e., is it there really to use it as a pro forma measure against which to measure your dividend payout?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Neil, Tell you the truth, Neil, I mean, what is really on our mind right now is not the dividend which we are paying in 2010 for 2009.  Right now on our mind is how to run the company, how to make it more cost efficient and more profitable again.  And as you all know, we just now pay the dividend for 2008, which we kept at last year's level and which I think is quite attractive to all of our shareholders.  The decision will be made by the Supervisory Board in February of 2010, obviously we will then take into account everything we know, everything we see in our business environment, our financial situation.  But, what we have said before that still holds true.  If we don't earn our cost of capital, it's highly unlikely that we will keep the dividend where it is today.  It's also highly unlikely that we will raise the dividend by the way.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  My question really focused on the additional restructuring measures that you've announced today.  And I wondered if you could give us an idea as to the kind of savings you are anticipating getting from moving an increased number of your workforce onto the flexible working hours and additional head count reduction?  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Paul for the question.  We have announced one fundamental restructuring program, which is called Next, where we try to reap benefits of about &#x20AC;1 billion within the next two to three years.  That program is well underway.  On top of that come additional restructuring measures, which also might lead to head count reductions.  It's very difficult to quantify this right now.  The 2000 people are certainly also related to savings not entirely, because it will happen over the course of the year.  It's not just a 12-month effect.  But all in all, I would say that for this year, we can at least expect something like 200 million of additional savings coming from these measures, if not significantly more.</p>
          <p>This is a process well underway, and actually, we are turning every single stone and try to get down cost as quickly as possible.  Give you one indication which is kind of interesting. It's anecdotal, travel has come down within BASF Group by about 50%.  So, we are still in business, obviously, we are still communicating very extensively, but we have been able to cut on those, what we call discretionary costs as quickly as possible and those efforts will have effects.  What you see in Q1 and that you will see continuously throughout the next couple of quarters, it's the cost of idle capacity. The cost of idle capacity to very high degrees, obviously capital costs and that will continue to hit our bottom line simply because we have capacities which we will shutdown.  Temporarily we are looking also at complete shutdown, but it's too early to talk about that at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much.  Question on working capital and free cash flow.  How do you see the working capital developing for the rest of the year, you made a very great improvement in Q1, do you see further improvement possible over the next quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question.  I mean, we were positively surprised in Q1 frankly.  We try to bring down our working capital as quickly as possible and the effect that you see in our balance sheet and cash flow statement is predominantly inventory improvement.  So, we're still trying to bring down working capital.  Our businesses have committed themselves to reduce their inventory levels further on and I would foresee that we see a further improvement in working capital and inventories over the course of the year given today's demand situation.  Yeah, I would foresee that.  But, as I said in my presentation, it would be kind of naive to now to take the Q1 number and multiply it by four and then come up with a free cash flow number for 2009.  That would be great if we achieved that, but that probably requires something more radical.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a target in mind in term of working capital absolute numbers or percentage of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have notified a new target.  We know what our businesses want to achieve. There is further improvement necessary and possible.  We are not yet satisfied this where we are, that's the clear message.  I mean, we have come down to make it little bit clearer, we have come down in absolute numbers, the way we measure our performance in working capital management is really by days outstanding.  And in that respect, we are still above the levels we have seen in 2008 and what we call the best possible days on inventory and there is further improvement necessary and we're working very hard on that.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jenny Barker [NOMURA International].  Good morning, Jen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning.  Yes, you &#x2013; I thought you made it pretty clear at the, after the Q4 results, but you thought that absent the seasonal improvement in agriculture, the EBIT in Q4 would be down on Q1.  And if you look at trends in competitors in the plastics related areas, that would be consistent with that, and yet your Plastics business went in the opposite direction.  Did we just misunderstand what your expectations were or were you also positive surprised by the Plastics performance, and if so, what was your explanation for that positive surprise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's good to know Jenny that you are positively surprised, we are actually not happy with our performance in Plastics.  As you can imagine, we don't think it's an improvement, just sufficient.  What happened really is that in Q4, we got hit very severely by inventory write downs as you can imagine, because the prices came down so quickly early in Q4, that we were still sitting on inventories especially in the polyamide value chain which is a very long and very heavy.  So, we got hit extremely heavily and we talked about that at our last earnings call.   And in Q1 there is an absence of any material inventory write downs, so that basically explains the improvement and finally the lower raw material cost worked also through the system.  But, more fundamentally the demand pattern and the margin situation in Plastics is not satisfactory, to make that very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question then comes from Andreas Heine [UniCredit MIB].  Good morning, Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  It's also referring to what Jenny said there was a basically negative impact in Q4 in the magnitude of 400 million on these inventory and raw material costs.  Are there any effects we have to take into &#x2013; in consideration which have been particular negative in Q1 and which will not be the case in Q2 or do we have to see it in a way that you see there was no improvement you see in the underlying conditions but pricing pressure is going on.  So, that Q2 in the industrial businesses might not see any change from today's point of view.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Mr. Heine, I think that's a pretty good description you just gave, it's very difficult to add to that.  We saw no material impact from inventory write downs in Q1, it's basically a two-digit number compared with Q4 that's negligible.  And as I've said before the underlying trading conditions haven't really improved and that is what gives concern to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically then as it is right now, you do not see any thing, which was in Q1, which is different than in Q2?  So, from idle capacity costs which have an impact at the beginning and not afterwards...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Q1 wasn't completely the same like Q4.  I mean, there is a small differences.  Volumes came up a little bit over Q4 just a little bit but prices came down, margins came down.  So, it's a completely opaque picture and it is very difficult for us to read and as you know we don't really forecast individual quarters.  We talk about current trading conditions and they are still very, very difficult in Plastics.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning all.  Thanks for taking the question.  It was on the Ag business, an incredibly strong performance in Q1, I just wonder what your comments were on -- you said Dr. Bock book about seeing the performance more in a context of the whole half rather than a quarter.  So, can you just maybe elaborate on that, it would be very helpful?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a couple of things here Andrew.  I mean, first of all, you have to keep in mind that we report quarterly and not all of our competitors do it in the Ag business.  So, it's somewhat difficult to get a full competitive picture here in terms of earnings.  The more important point, however, is that what really counts is how much product is on the ground, how much products will be applied by the farmers and will work its  way through the distribution chain.  So far, we have reason to be optimistic with respect to that but we have said before.  The final P&amp;L for Ag will be done after the first half of 2009.  So, we will talk about this then late in July when we talk about the Q2 numbers.  It's simply too early to say how the season will go and I don't even want to start talking about the weather as we all know that is also a factor in that business.  So, what I try to say is good result in Q1.  We are happy that we obviously made some competitive advances here, but we always take those numbers with a certain grain of salt and then wait, how Q2 will workout and then we see how the year 2009 will be for Ag in total.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, looking at Middle East capacity is obviously an issue when now all capacity utilization is down, how does low cost Middle East capacity impact European or US lack of currently in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There will be new capacity coming on stream in the Middle East, they had come already in the cracker area that will certainly affect the petrochemicals business to a certain degree.  However, you keep in mind not all capacities in the Middle East are running as expected.  There is a little bit of stuttering going on as well.  In terms of feedstock cost advantages. It's interesting what's happening right now because you have to look at not just oil but also at natural gas and when you for instance look at natural gas in the United States which is now at very low rates.  It's obviously more attractive to run the cracker based on ethane than on naphtha.  And you know that our situation in the States is that we have a naphtha cracker not an ethane cracker.  That is a competitive disadvantage.  So, it's not just a capacity issue it's also a feedstock issue we are discussing here.</p>

What you are mentioning is, I think is correct, we're working very hard to down the breakeven point and as I said before we're operating now at below 60% capacity utilization rate.  If somebody had told me a couple of years ago that we would still be at a positive in Chemicals operations running at those operating rates, I'd have said they're kind of difficult to achieve, but obviously we have been able to bring down cost and that cost reduction effort will continue in Q2.</p>

          <p>Okay, Sophie it's incredibly difficult.  I think &#x2013; we, our customers -- automotive customers are also tier two customers.  Don't know themselves what's going to happen within the next couple of months.  Production schedules are very, very short lived -- are revamped all the time.  We are very cautious with regard to global automotive build, give you a number in United States.  We are now looking at something like maybe nine million plus, that's it, not more.  Asia is up a little bit, South America, basically move sideways.  The way we see it.  We have no reason to be optimistic and you just have to look at our customer portfolio and we're all following what's happening in North America, where major customers are now in a major restructuring mode put it that way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Don't see it.  And I think I mentioned earlier on that, many automotive customers have to look at their -- at the number of cars in their backyard.  And those inventories are still large and they have to come down.  We have couple of special situations, for instance in Germany we have Abfrachpraemie.  You get &#x20AC;2500 if you basically scrap your old car and buy a new one.  That is kind of a blip for the automotive industry.  It creates demand, but the simple question then is, is it additional demand, or is it just the sale which now happens in 2009 and won't happen then in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  It was a question just on pricing for Q2.  In Q1, we obviously had quite a negative impact in the major Chemicals and Plastics businesses, but I think this is more of a market wide phenomenon.  In Q2, should we start to see prices go up and see this is as a positive factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard for me to imagine why and how prices should go up, given our trading environment.  I mean, capacity utilization rates are so low and there is still over-capacity in the market.  I don't see any reason why prices should go up frankly no, no.  I think the margin squeeze will simply continue, and that is what was asked before about the pain in the industry.  I don't see that the pain would evaporate in Q2 or Q3, it will probably increase on any competitors.</p>

I was surprised to see that EBIT for the Styrenics, fertilizers and other businesses up year-on-year, particularly given the progression we've seen from other fertilizer and other Styrenics manufacturers, can you talk us a little bit through which businesses were responsible for that increase in EBIT?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are right, Rhian.  Styrenics had a modest good first quarter. That is very much based on the styrene monomer business where there is a relative supply demand pattern was quite favorable in terms of bringing up prices.  Polystyrene was demand wise not too bad, what we see here is that prices have come down in certain plastic businesses to an extent that there is now a substitution of paper in packaging for instance, and that favors the Styrenics business to a certain degree.  In terms of fertilizer, we haven't really seen a big change in Q1. In fertilizers, the numbers were very much on the level of 2008 in terms of earnings.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then there is another follow-up from Neil Tyler and one from Ronald K&#xF6;hler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello again thanks again for taking the question.  Just back to the question of under-absorbed overheads with regard to capacity offline.  I wonder if you could &#x2013; perhaps if you're able to -- provide a little bit more detail on some sort of absolute numbers, in terms of where you see the additional cost to Q4, Q1, and then looking forward to Q2 given there's probably going to be an increased level of shutdowns in Q2 versus Q1?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you all know that certainly depends on the capacity utilization of our rating rates in Q2.  Since we don't expect any improvement, I simply expect that the numbers will be at the level of Q1, as where they are at historic high levels as you can imagine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But no worse, I was under the impression that the shutdowns taken place at the end of Q1 might make that an even bigger number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not &#x2013; it's not just related to shutdown as we talk about idle cost &#x2013; cost of idle capacities that relates to simply the under-utilization of our installed capacity and that is measured unit by unit.  So, every pound or kilo we don't &#x2013; or a ton we don't sell and don't produce leads to cost of unutilized capacity.  It's not just that we have a make a decision to shutdown a facility temporarily or permanently.  It just happens as you produce less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Ronald K&#xF6;hler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have question to gas trading and the volume development.  Obviously I see overall volumes down by 6% in Oil and Gas, I think it's over proportional gas trading, can you perhaps provide us with a number?  And is it that you are mainly influenced by the industrial need?  Because there was a cold winter and I would have expected with better results here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, volumes came down because we had E&amp;P, we had less production.  That is partly related to the attempt to control -- to control output to bring up the oil price which I found kind of interesting given the weak situation of the global economy that the oil price is still hovering at about $50.  You'd asked about the gas business, volumes are down as well; that is a result of simply very weak industrial activity throughout Europe.  Industrial production has come down.  Power production, utility sales have come down in Q1, so that is a volume effect.  Price wise, we had a positive time lag effect, you know this mechanism of delayed price and margin adjustments in that particular business, but I think it's fair to say that we simply lack demand in industrial gases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you provide a number for volume decrease for gas trading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a two-digit number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question came from Andrew Stott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Magi, it's fine, my question has just been asked.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wonderful.  Then we have a follow-up question from Nicholas Kaiser from Cazenove.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Karim Kimani from Cazenove not Nicholas Kaiser .</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question, I wanted to ask on your dividend.  You, last time you cut was in 1993, by about 20%.  Now it looks like you're going to miss your cost of capital quite materially this year if things continue the way they do.  How much would you be cutting this year?  Is there a range?  Would it be similar to 1993, more or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't answer that question, frankly.  I mean we have really other concerns right now than how much we cut our dividend, if we cut the -- cut it, I can only tell you we will take your concerns and expectation absolutely in consideration in making that proposal to our Supervisory Board.  But, again this will happen in February of next year.  I can't tell you. I can't tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think we have paid quite a nice dividend for 2008 which is quite effective.  I also think the dividend we paid in 2008 or 2007 was quite attractive frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, definitely.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, then a follow-up question from Jenny Barker [Nomura International] and Matthias Cornu following that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just I think Air Liquide talking about the merchant business, said that they expected demand conditions to be weaker in Germany in Q2 than they have been in Q1.  Would you agree with that and could you give any color on which of your businesses would be particularly affected, if so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jenny, I have to ask you quickly what business was Air Liquide talking about particularly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think in merchant gases across the spread of industrial activities really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see a lack demand throughout the entire industries.  I mean there are very few examples.  Where we see still kind of healthy demand is everything which is health related.  That is frankly the only industry and partly whenever people eat that seems to be okay as well.  Everything which is not related immediately to human well being is toughest right now.  That's the way we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, my specific question was, they say that Q2 will be worst than Q1 in terms of the activity level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Germany.  In Germany</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, we don't know we just saw that the German government reduced its forecast of economic growth or decline now to 6% for 2009.  We are very cautious.  We simply don't know.  And I'm sorry, Jenny for giving you these kinds of opaque answers to your very specific question.  It's extremely difficult for us to forecast individual quarters and months.  It is extremely difficult simply because the demand pattern, the order pattern of our customers is so volatile and so infrequent that it's almost impossible to identify any kind of trend.  I would be happy if I could offer you better a forecast, I almost apologize for not being able to.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you very much.  Can you maybe make some comments on the demand trends in China what you have seen in Q1 after the Chinese New Year and what do you see at the moment and maybe provide an idea of the capacity utilization rate in Nanjing at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In China, I think that's the only area in the world where we believe &#x2013; believe that the stimulus program seem to show some effect at least when you look at the established numbers and believe those numbers.  It looks like, it stabilizes to a certain degree. White wear, small cars.  We see small improvements.  That is the only glimmer of a better development which we see right now regionally but you have to keep in mind China is relatively small part of the world economy even if the perception is different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, true but are you positive year-on-year in term of growth there at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For this year, whether we will grow in China, yeah, we try to do that, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Nobert Barth [WestLB].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, despite you're not at the moment consolidating Ciba, but can you elaborate a little bit on the development there.  Is there something different to your business in that areas, and what happened by the way was the first quarter result of Ciba?  So is that, because they are included then in BASF's results?  Are there some write-downs, especially in that quarter then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I was surprised it took 55 minutes to ask that question about Ciba's development.  But more seriously, as Ciba didn't have a good first quarter as the sales declined not surprisingly.  Basically you're combining the entire industry in this respect and the operating result of Ciba in Q1 was negative.  Since we acquired on April 9, we closed on the deal, the numbers were not published anymore.  We still have to figure out how to report on the Ciba activities in Q2 as we said.  We will report Ciba still at the separate business in our one segment, and then, fully integrated over the course of Q3, but we will and we said this before we make sure that you get the level of transparency that you need in order to find out whether we make right moves in that business or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we come to our final two questions. There is one from Peter Clark and the other one from Ronald K&#xF6;hler and then we have to complete our call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  It was just a follow-up on Ciba actually again, you obviously doubled the synergy target, is that purely a reflection of what's going on in the world today or with your initial look at it, is there something in there that you certainly realized you could do better and double that target, I presume it's the former...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, no, I wouldn't put it that way.  I mean, we always said we at least &#x2013; at least want to achieve what is typical in the chemical industry and that is somewhat 5% plus in terms of synergies on sales at least.  We know that when we acquired Engelhard and we look at the product business of Engelhard not counting the precious metal trading operation which is not a production based business obviously we were much, much higher.  So, I think, we are very confident to tell you that we will strive for somewhat a number like 10% and that is not a reaction to the current trading environment, not at all.  I think it reflects what we have known before that there is simply a need for a heavy restructuring to make the combined businesses of BASF and Ciba in those particular business lines then really attractive to our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question from Ronald.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Thank you.  Regarding currency result in your EBIT before special item in the others line, you obviously show this 139 million losses currency result hedges, Point number one, could a little bit break-up, is it really mainly currency or are other valuation effects in and point number two, I think you are pretty well hedged for the full year, do you then expect that these current hedges will continue over the next quarter, these currency hedges losses actually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, to answer it, it's predominantly 90 plus percent currency related.  It's very much US dollar based. We have hedged against a weakening US dollar as you can imagine because we have dollar exposure.  That was one effect.  It's mark-to-market and therefore, it will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter unfortunately.  As these hedging contracts expire, it will also go to the operating results of the divisions ultimately.  So, from today's point of view, we are very much hedged throughout the year and then everything depends on the major currencies.  It's pretty much US dollar, it's also a little bit of the British pound.  And as I said before, we also got hit by the Russian ruble, which depreciated quite a bit over the last couple of months because you know have a little bit of ruble exposure due to our operations in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if currencies would say stable then this would be zero in Q2, no changes than any longer though that's the expectations then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If dollar stays where it stays, it is, right now there would be no change in Q2, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

BASF will be having its first Investor Day on sustainability on May 12, 2009 and this will be held in Ludwigshafen.  As you know sustainability is a cornerstone of BASF strategy and at this event you will have the opportunity to get information about BASF's sustainability strategy, the engagement in climate protection as well as our progress in the development of future technology and here in particular nano technology.</p>
          <p>We will next report on our second quarter 2009 results on July 30, 2009 and for this I would like to thank you for joining us on the call and the Investor Relations team is at the office and we'll be happy to help you with further questions, in case we couldn't answer everything here, but we definitely tried our best to help you with your questions.  So, with that have a good day and good bye.</p>
