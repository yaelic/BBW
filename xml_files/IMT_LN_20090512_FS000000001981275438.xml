        <plist>
          <p>Okay we are ready; we will make a start so. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for joining us today. I am here with the other members of the Imperial executive team and I am reading from here on script. As far as Imperial Tobacco began <mark type="inaudible" /> look I am 59 tomorrow I am due a bit a slack. Anyway, good morning again to those of you here in the room and of course everyone watching via our webcast, and welcome to our 2009 half yearly results presentation.</p>
          <p>I am joined here today by Alison Cooper, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Dyrbus, our Finance Director; as well as Iain Napier our Chairman and some other key Imperial executives some of whom have come from Spain like Louis Sagedo who runs our logistics business. So welcome everyone.</p>
          <p>As a result of changes in our management structure and the increased size of the group we have updated the format of the presentation. I will give a brief overview. Then, Alison will outline the operational trends in the first half of the year. Bob will, as usual, review the financial performance and I will round things off with a summary at the end of the presentation and a small dance.</p>
          <p>We've made a good start to the year, despite a backdrop of turbulent economic conditions and challenges in some regions. We have achieved share, volume and profit gains in a considerable number of markets and made great progress on the Altadis integration.</p>
          <p>In terms of headlines, we increased our global cigarette volumes by 25% to 152 billion sticks, driven by a combination of a full six months contribution from Altadis and many good brand and market performances. Our adjusted profit from operations increased by 49% to a little under &#xA3;1.4 billion, reflecting continued operational progress and foreign exchange benefits.</p>
          <p>Excluding foreign exchange, on a comparable basis, profit from operations grew by just over 6%. Our adjusted earnings per share were 71.8 pence, a 14% increase on 2008 after adjusting last year's EPS for the bonus element of the rights issue. The interim dividend is now defined as being a third of the prior year's total dividend. As a result, the board recommends an interim dividend of 21 pence per share.</p>
          <p>Our policy of progressive dividends based on underlying earnings growth is unchanged with a pay-out ratio of around 50%, whilst recognizing the cash impact of Altadis restructuring.</p>
          <p>Our achievements with the integration of Altadis have been considerable. We have successfully completed all consultations, enabling us to further progress implementation of our European integration projects. We merged the vast majority of sales and marketing teams early in the first half and recently completed the integration of our teams in Spain and France, providing a more comprehensive service to our customers.</p>
          <p>We also made good progress on manufacturing. As well as the closure of our Smolnik factory in November, we have reorganized our operations in Poland, Morocco and Russia. We've been working hard to align processes, systems and standards to ensure that we have the right foundations for continued manufacturing excellence.</p>
          <p>In addition to our European integration projects, we strengthened our competitive position in the United States with the closure of our Selma cigar factory in November. In the first half, we delivered &#x20AC;39 million of incremental synergies, bringing the total so far to &#x20AC;82 million, and we remain on track to meet the previously announced target of &#x20AC;180 million in the current financial year.</p>
          <p>We also made progress on the refinancing of our balance sheet and the success of our 2.3 billion pound bond issuance in February leaves us with no further refinancing requirements until July 2010. Our focus on leveraging our enhanced brand and product portfolio throughout the wider geographic footprint has continued. We've increased the availability of our brands in a number of markets and achieved particularly good results with Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes, Gitanes Blondes and Fine.</p>
          <p>I am very pleased with our achievements this half year and I'm confident that we will continue to make good progress in the coming months.</p>
          <p>So thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll now hand you over to Alison to take you through the operational highlights.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As this is the first reporting period that includes a full contribution from Altadis, I'd like to talk briefly about our enhanced geographic footprint and cigarette portfolio. In the first half of 2009, tobacco accounted for 95% of the group's profit from operations, with the remainder coming from our logistics division.</p>
          <p>In tobacco, the UK, Germany, Spain and the USA, combined with our Rest of EU region, delivered 72% of our profit providing a strong platform for future growth. This is balanced by Rest of the World region, which contains a broad spread of markets, each offering volume, share and profit growth potential, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Our Rest of the World region contributed 53% of our total cigarette volumes, with the vast majority coming from emerging markets. In terms of price segmentation, just under half of our cigarette portfolio are value brands and we grew many of these in the first half, taking advantage of ongoing downtrading.</p>
          <p>Our key mainstream brands are Gauloises Blondes, West and Fortuna. And although West has remained under pressure in Germany, Gauloises is maintaining its strong growth momentum, particularly in the Middle East with comparable volume gains of 11%. We also improved volumes of Fortuna despite market size declines in Spain, and we grew volumes of our main international premium brand Davidoff by 9%, accelerating its 2008 growth trend. Gitanes Blondes and Fine are now also making a significant contribution to the premium end of the portfolio, volumes of both were up 21% with strong performances in the Middle East and Africa respectively.</p>
          <p>Our good performance in the first half is attributable to a number of factors. Our brand and product portfolio provides many opportunities for growth and our strength in value cigarettes and fine cut tobacco means that we are well placed in the current climate. Our focus on building sales is underpinned by efficiently managing our cost base. This includes standardisation across our manufacturing portfolio, which has generated significant savings over many years and remains a key element of our ongoing efficiency program.</p>
          <p>Our market operations drive growth by taking action locally that reflects their individual environment within the group strategic framework. This includes aligning local portfolios with specific market dynamics and consumer preferences, as well as effectively managing regulation.</p>
          <p>Applying this approach has enabled us to make further progress in the first half. In mature markets, our focus is on balancing profit and share development, whilst in our emerging markets we've continued our growth momentum with volume, share and profit gains. Our highlights in mature markets included the successful launch of JPS Silver in the UK and further gains from JPS in Germany, capitalizing on the continuing downtrading in both markets. We delivered good performances in the key domestic blonde segments in Spain and France and maintained momentum in the USA, gaining share in cigarette and fine cut tobacco.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, our African and Middle East operations continued to deliver significant growth, with strong brand and share development in many markets. In Eastern Europe we achieved volume and profit gains, and we delivered an improved financial performance in Asia.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to move onto our regional performances, starting with the UK where we estimate that the duty paid cigarette market declined by around 2% in our first half. And, in the last few months, we have seen the market strengthen due to a reduction in the purchases of UK brands abroad as the impact of a weaker economy and currency reduced overseas travel. These trends also benefited the fine cut tobacco market, up 15% to 4,100 tonnes.</p>
          <p>Last month, the Chancellor raised tobacco duties by 2%, equating to an increase of 7 pence per pack of 20 cigarettes. As previously highlighted, the change in timing of the UK Budget has resulted in a partial shift in performance from the first to the second half of the year, explaining the temporary drop in UK profits, though our January price increase offset some of this impact.</p>
          <p>Our cigarette market share has stabilized following the launch of our new value brand JPS Silver in November. The brand has made excellent progress, reaching a spot share of 1.8% in March. We also grew share of Richmond which was complemented by the ongoing strength of Lambert &amp; Butler.</p>
          <p>In fine cut tobacco, we increased volumes of Golden Virginia and in March launched Golden Virginia Yellow, a more value focused extension to the brand family. This will further improve our position in the growing value sector and complement Gold Leaf, which is now up to 3.7% of the market.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Germany, where duty paid cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 3%. Downtrading remains a key dynamic with the low price sector representing around 27% of the cigarette market, up from 23% this time last year. We made further gains with JPS, now up to just under 8.5% of the market, and at the top end of the portfolio we performed well with Gauloises Blondes, Davidoff and R1 all maintaining share.</p>
          <p>Although West declined, taking our overall cigarette share down slightly, we have seen increasing stability in the brand in recent months following the successful introduction of new West Maxi packs last year, and the recent launch of West soft packs should further strengthen the brand. Market volumes of other tobacco products were stable with growth in Single tobacco offsetting the ongoing decline in eco-cigarillos. Against this backdrop our OTP share was broadly stable, with a particularly strong performance from Route 66 in the make your own sector.</p>
          <p>In the second half we will be increasing prices across our portfolio in June and the minimum pack size will increase from 17 to 19 cigarettes in July.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Spain, where economic conditions have been particularly difficult. Market volumes of duty paid cigarettes were down by 5% to 81 billion due to trade destocking, declining travel retail volumes and increased downtrading into fine cut tobacco. We estimate that the total white stick market declined by approximately 2%.</p>
          <p>Our domestic performance was good and we increased prices in January. In the blonde segment, Fortuna was broadly stable at around 12%, with Nobel and Ducados Rubio continuing to show strong share growth.</p>
          <p>Although our share of the dark segment increased, volume declines in this segment and lower travel retail sales had an impact on our total market share. Within fine cut tobacco, we gained volume but our share was down. However, Fortuna and Ducados Rolling, which we launched last year, have performed very well, strengthening our portfolio in the value segment.</p>
          <p>Economic conditions have impacted the cigar market with volume declines across all categories but the last few months have been slightly more positive in line with normal seasonal trends.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to look at our Rest of EU region, where cigarette market volumes were down by 7%, a much higher level than normal.</p>
          <p>Declining travel retail volumes had a small effect but by far the largest impact was the significant fall in duty paid cigarette volumes in Central Europe, particularly in Poland and Czech Republic, as a result of excise driven price increases. Excluding these factors we estimate that total regional cigarette volumes were broadly stable.</p>
          <p>We increased prices in the majority of markets including in The Netherlands, Greece and Italy.</p>
          <p>The most important market for us in this region is France, where the cigarette market was stable. We increased shares of our main blonde brands &#x2013; News, Gauloises, JPS and Fortuna, although our market share was impacted by the ongoing decline of the dark segment.</p>
          <p>In The Netherlands, we improved our cigarette share to 13.4% with a good performance from JPS. And elsewhere we grew cigarette share in Greece, Austria, Czech Republic, Finland and Portugal, as well as in Norway and Sweden where we also grew our snus share. Our regional fine cut tobacco portfolio remained under pressure from cheaper competitor offerings. We have lower price alternatives in a number of markets and are taking steps to further strengthen our position in the value segment.</p>
          <p>In addition, we gained fine cut tobacco volume and share in the growing markets of Central Europe which partly offset the impact of the brand divestments last year.</p>
          <p>Our main business in the Americas is in the USA, where we estimate that the cigarette market declined by 3% in the fist half. We are strong in the discount sector, which continues to account for around 27% of the market. We grew our cigarette share to 4.3% of the market and 14.8% of the discount sector, and in January and March, we increased prices of our key brands USA Gold and Sonoma. Trade cigarette destocking in advance of the April Federal Excise Tax, or FET, increase has resulted in a partial shift in our March volumes into the second half.</p>
          <p>In fine cut tobacco, we improved our share to an estimated 9%.This is more than double last year's first half, reflecting our investment in the Rave brand and further gains from Premier and McClintock. Although underlying cigarette industry volumes have been affected by the economic climate, we delivered a strong first half performance, achieving further volume growth in both our natural wrapper and premium portfolios. We also increased prices and benefited from advance sales of large mass market and premium cigars prior to the FET increase, although we elected to manage the level of our sales over this period.</p>
          <p>We have a strong presence in the discount cigarette sector and with our expertise in fine cut tobacco and the positioning of our cigar portfolio; we expect the effect of the FET increase on our USA results for the current financial year will be broadly neutral.</p>
          <p>I will round up our tobacco operations with our Rest of the World region, where we delivered another strong performance in our emerging markets. We were very pleased with our progress in Africa and the Middle East where we are driving the performance of our key brands Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes, Fine and Gitanes Blondes, and as a result we've achieved volume, profit and share gains in many markets across the region.</p>
          <p>In Morocco we had very strong growth from Gauloises Blondes, although our cigarette share has been impacted by the ongoing decline in the dark segment. Additionally, we have finalized a long-term agreement for the licensed manufacture, distribution and merchandising of Philip Morris brands.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, we grew volume and improved profitability. Although we are starting to see signs of uptrading slowing, Davidoff continued to grow in the majority of markets in the region. Downtrading is increasing and we have capitalized on this with strong growth in our main value brands Maxim, Prima, and Classic.</p>
          <p>We have taken steps to improve our competitive position in Australia, while making further cigarette and fine cut tobacco gains in New Zealand. In Asia, our new Taiwanese factory is now fully operational and our ability to manufacture in-market has contributed to an improved financial performance. Downtrading is now a key dynamic in Taiwan and to take advantage of this we launched Kane, a value offering, in December with positive early results. Davidoff's share has stabilized and we are continuing to implement initiatives to strengthen its position.</p>
          <p>Our Habanos cigar volumes have been impacted by increased public smoking restrictions and, like many luxury products, have suffered as a result of the current economic climate, although pricing has in part helped to mitigate these declines.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to Logistics: Whilst our other logistics operations have seen some deterioration in the first half as a result of its exposure to the current macro environment, our tobacco operations have been relatively resilient and there has been active management of the cost base throughout the logistics business.</p>
          <p>Within tobacco logistics, our performance in Italy has been good, reflecting pricing improvements, and in France we performed ahead of expectations. In Spain, where there has been some weakness in tobacco operations following the 5% cigarette market decline, Logista remains the leading provider of logistics services, and last month renewed its Spanish distribution contract with Philip Morris until 2014.</p>
          <p>In other logistics, our operations have been impacted by economic conditions, particularly in Spain. However, our performance against the industry as a whole has been good and our strong business model has enabled us to maintain our customer base and in some areas gain market share, including in the transport and wholesale operations.</p>
          <p>So what do we expect for the balance of the financial year? In addition to the normal seasonal uplift, which we typically see across our regions in the second half, we anticipate a stronger performance in the UK due to the Budget timing, while in Germany our business will benefit from price increases across our portfolio. In Spain, the cigarette market should experience its normal seasonal uplift and we are well placed to take advantage of the expected continued growth in fine cut tobacco.</p>
          <p>Additionally, both Spain and France will benefit from a full six months of operating with integrated sales forces. In the Rest of the EU the challenges in travel retail and Central Europe will continue but we expect to make further domestic progress in cigarette and will also focus on strengthening our fine cut tobacco shares. And in the USA, our well positioned brand and product portfolio should enable us to manage the impact of the FET increase.</p>
          <p>Our Rest of the World region presents us with considerable opportunities and we expect many of the same growth trends to continue in the coming months, while our logistics division should have a better second half as the cost saving benefits increase. So there are undoubtedly challenges ahead but given our portfolio strengths, in both brands and products, and our balanced international footprint, we remain confident about our operational performance over the coming months.</p>
          <p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I'd now like to hand you over to Bob to take you through the financial highlights.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Alison, and good morning ladies and gentlemen.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with an overview of the results. Our tobacco net revenues were up 53% to &#xA3;3.3 billion reflecting the full contribution from Altadis, operational progress and foreign exchange benefits. The increase in logistics distribution fees reflects the full six months results as opposed to two months in 2008.</p>
          <p>Tobacco adjusted profit from operations grew strongly, up 45% reflecting our new footprint. And the increase in logistics profit from operations also shows the full six months effect. The combined result is an increase in adjusted profit from operations of 49% to a little under &#xA3;1.4 billion. The Altadis acquisition, combined with the impact of foreign exchange movements, has resulted in an increase in the interest charge to &#xA3;371 million. And after tax being charged at an effective rate of 26.5%, adjusted earnings per share grew by 14 % to 71.8 pence.</p>
          <p>Results have been adjusted in line with our normal practice, and as the reported numbers are significantly below the adjusted numbers, I would like to highlight the two main reasons for this. Firstly, amortization of acquired intangibles grew to &#xA3;224 million reflecting a full six months' charge for Altadis. And secondly, we hedge interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.</p>
          <p>However, the strict requirements of IAS 39 mean that we are obliged to recognize movements in the fair value of some of these hedges in our income statement. Often these are offset by movements taken directly to reserves. Application of IAS 39 in the face of significant movements in foreign exchange and interest rates has led to an increase in fair value losses on derivative financial instruments of &#xA3;937 million being taken to the profit and loss account.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to go into more detail, starting with net revenue analysis.</p>
          <p>Our tobacco net revenue grew by 53% or 31 % at constant currency. In the UK revenues were only slightly down, despite the budget timing impact, reflecting pricing improvements and growth in fine cut tobacco. Our German net revenue growth was largely attributable to the additional four months from Altadis. In Spain, our revenue growth also reflects the full contribution from Altadis, increased prices and growth in fine cut tobacco volumes, which more than offset cigarette and cigar declines.</p>
          <p>In the Rest of EU we had a good performance in France and many other markets, but this was offset by the volume declines in Poland and Czech Republic. Our strong growth in the Americas was due to a good operational performance and pricing improvements in the USA, as well as a full contribution from the cigar business, and our Rest of the World division delivered a strong performance with improvements from the majority of markets.</p>
          <p>Moving on to profit, tobacco operating profit grew by 45%, or 26% at constant currency. In addition to the points I highlighted in respect of net revenue growth, profits also benefited from incremental synergies of &#x20AC;39 million or &#xA3;34 million which we delivered in the first half but this was partly offset by a bad debt write-off of &#xA3;17 million in The Netherlands.</p>
          <p>In the first half, our logistics operations contributed a little under half a billion of distribution fees and &#xA3;78 million to our adjusted profit from operations. This division has been impacted by economic conditions but the cost initiatives will help to mitigate this in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to cash flow and restructuring, we generated pre-tax operating cash flows of &#xA3;803 million against 295 million last year. Tax paid of &#xA3;228 million resulted in net cash flow from operating activities of &#xA3;575 million against 209 million last year. Net interest paid was &#xA3;315 million.</p>
          <p>There was an additional restructuring charge of &#xA3;6 million in the first half, mainly in respect of the European integration and we continue to expect the total cash costs to be in the region of &#x20AC;600 million. Cash outflows in respect of restructuring activities were &#x20AC;50 million or &#xA3;43 million in the period. Gross capital expenditure was 112 million and we continue to make disciplined investments in machinery and equipment across our expanded footprint.</p>
          <p>Proceeds from sales of fixed assets amounted to &#xA3;40 million and mainly related to surplus properties including the Lille factory.</p>
          <p>This chart shows the movement in adjusted net debt, which increased to &#xA3;14 billion in the first six months of our financial year. Our cash conversion was 53%, as a result of the temporary increase in working capital which we highlighted in our pre-close statement. The outflow predominantly relates to pre-production ahead of duty increases in a number of countries, particularly in Poland and Slovakia. Together these two countries represent just over &#xA3;450 million of the outflow.</p>
          <p>Working capital management remains a key priority for us and these temporary working capital outflows are expected to unwind in the coming months. By the year end we expect a working capital inflow which should mean our cash conversion is in excess of 100%. The strengthening of both the euro and U.S. dollar against the pound has resulted in a significant increase in our debt. The denomination of our closing adjusted net debt was 59% euro, 25% U.S. dollar and 16% sterling. And our average net debt level for the half year rose to &#xA3;13.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In February, we successfully raised &#xA3;2.3 billion through the debt capital markets which meant that on 31st of March we had total facilities in place of approximately &#xA3;16 billion and have refinanced all our near term debt maturities. The next portion of our bank acquisition facility matures in July 2010. And before that time we will need to refinance in the region of &#xA3;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Our average all in cost of debt was broadly stable at 5.5% for the first half, which resulted in a net interest charge of &#xA3;371 million. We continue to estimate an all-in cost of debt of around 5.5% for the balance of the year and around 6% for 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally to interest cover, which on an adjusted basis, was 3.7 times. Our interest cover as calculated for banking covenants is materially above this level after the permitted adjustments which we highlighted in our debt presentation last November. We are fully compliant with our banking covenants and remain committed to investment grade.</p>
          <p>So I'd now like to hand back to Gareth to take you through the outlook and to conclude the presentation.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bob. Well, all in all, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very pleasing start to the year and there is no doubt in my mind that tobacco is a great place to be in a recessionary environment. However, as I've said before, despite our resilience, we are not immune from the economic pressures. In markets where economic conditions are particularly tough, such as Spain, some of the downtrading from cigarette into fine cut tobacco has been driven by the current climate.</p>
          <p>Within our value portfolio, we continue to capitalize on the downtrading dynamic in mature markets and we've seen no significant change in this trend, although there are signs that uptrading is slowing and downtrading increasing in Eastern Europe. And at the premium end, we remain optimistic about the future growth potential of our cigarette brands, particularly given Davidoff's 9% growth in the first half. Fine cut tobacco volumes continue to increase and we will be doing more to strengthen our position to enable us to take advantage of this growth.</p>
          <p>Cigar is currently challenging but we will continue to focus on rationalizing our portfolio and cost reduction initiatives to ensure that our cigar business is well positioned for the future. We must also be diligent in managing the impact of the inflationary pressures on leaf costs. By utilizing surplus stocks and strategic buying, we have been able to mitigate the impact in 2009 but we expect next year to be tougher for us and of course the rest of the industry.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, it is a difficult economic environment out there, but our defensive qualities stand us in good stead. Our portfolio is well suited to the environment and our geographic footprint gives a good balance between developed and emerging markets. We are well known for our cost, working capital and cash focus, all of which remain extremely important in today's climate. However, it is also our management capability and depth which enables me to look to the future with great confidence.</p>
          <p>So thank you ladies and gentlemen, we will now take any questions you may have. The presentation is being recorded so I should be grateful if you would wait for a microphone before speaking and then give your name and organization.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Thanks. David Hayes from Nomura. Could you just speak up on the dividend and the restructuring, cash restructuring comment that you made? Can you just confirm the phasing of the restructuring cash going out I am assuming it's about 80, 90 million for the next four years, is that right phasing to assume?</p>
          <p>And then also you mentioned the Reemtsma precedent effectively, was that a much lumpier cash outflow was it, sort of, a much more upfront cash outflow and I guess in that context given the spread of the cash flow it seems prudent to think the board might decide to cut the dividend, is that something that the exec team would recommend to the board or is that something that the debt agencies are suggesting you to do for prudence; just trying to see where this is being led from.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just on the operations just in UK, am I right to assume the volumes would have been down about 3.5 in the UK without the budget timing they were down nine. Does that all bounce back, that five percentage points? Or were there other factors in there that we should think about in terms of the bounce-back on the budget timing? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well in terms of the dividend, as I said the policy is absolutely unchanged. We grow dividends in line with underlying earnings growth, around a 50% payout ratio. The profit growth is strong, the balance sheet's in good shape, the rating agencies have retained their rating, the covenant tests are very much passed. I think the reason for highlighting the cash-out costs of the re-org was really a reference to Reemtsma time when we went a little bit below the 50% payout ratio so we are just pointing that out.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, the issue on dividend really is a matter that is reserved for the board at the end of the year, and all things are taken into consideration but we had a strong cash position. Obviously, we have a pretty volatile currency situation that we haven't seen before in the past. But all these things will be taken into consideration, but just to reaffirm, our policy's exactly the same, it's unchanged.</p>
          <p>In terms of the phasing of the re-org charges, Bob, I think, David, you were pretty much spot on I think, it was around &#x2013; getting up towards about 100 million -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have thought about a 100 this year, 100 next year and then slightly spread out after that. But equally I think &#x2013; and we were and Reemtsma probably a slightly tighter timing in terms of Reemtsma just because of the scale of the reorganization, because it just did not have the breadth of- that we were covering with for example manufacturing ops, because we've got quite a lot of changes to do on this one. So -- but same sort of thing in terms of that</p>
          <p>And secondly as Gareth said we were just highlighting factors to be taken into account rather than that it's something that we wanted to highlight to the market of the factors taken into account, and what happened in the past rather than to surprise anybody at any point in time.</p>

          <p>It's absolute prudence. We've had recent meetings.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what we were highlighting with the UK was our view in terms of what was going on underlying-wise with the UK volume; the 2% decline that we saw in the first half. If anything at the moment it's getting a bit more robust in the UK I highlighted the point about travel retail, we're seeing a pretty strong market in the UK currently, and as you've seen fine cut growth as well. So I think it's going to be a very good second half for the UK market.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to be there or there abouts. And that's one of the significant impacts, but as I say, the 2% gives you more of an underlying feel.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Erik Bloomquist, JPMorgan. Could you discuss the dynamics in the Spanish cigarette market and specifically breaking apart the trade de-load, versus travel retail and the degree to which we might expect some of that trade de-load to recover in the second half? And then secondly if you could do the same kind of discussion for U.S. cigar in terms of the impact of loading prior to the U.S. FET and if we should expect most of that volume to dissipate in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Alison, will you take the Spanish one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; sure. In Spain, your 5% cigarette market declined in the first half as I mentioned but I think it's also important to pick up on the white stick decline which was 2% so there is definitely a consumer shift into fine cut in the Spanish market currently.</p>
          <p>The trade loading one I think it's difficult to assess I think clearly that's now out of the market, so hopefully you would see some pickup therefore into normal sorts of consumption declines rather than trade loading impacts into the second half, but if you assume any trade restocking I think that will be an error in the current environment and that's not going to reverse. But it may well be particularly with seasonality even though you haven't got a full smoking in public places ban in Spain, you've still got some restrictions, so we still tend to see a pickup in the summer months and there will be tourists in Spain in the summer months even though they are at a lower level than previously, we're still going to get the travel retail picking up a little bit there as well. So I'd say in the second half, it's going to be probably slightly better than that but I do think you are going to see continuing consumer shifts in Spain particularly into fine cut.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your second question, Erik, on U.S. cigar, yes we had a &#x2013; as we said a very good first half. I think it's fair to point out though; we did manage our sales up to the half-year. I think it's probably true to say some of our competitors supplied requirements in absolute full, we elected not to do that, we managed our sales through. So to dampen as it were the volatility of the year. So I think we will certainly see a downside particularly in the next couple of months, because of the very high trade stocks. But I would expect our comparative position to be actually quite good towards the end of our financial year. Because of the actions that we have taken, plus the fact we've got a number of ongoing cost reduction initiatives, which hopefully will rebuild on the profitability post the SCHIP effects. We are about to see though some down trading into smaller cigar sizes in the coming year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; it's Nico Lambrechts from Merrill Lynch. Bob, could you maybe elaborate what is the main change in the working capital from the half-year to the full-year? We are aware that capital and logistics business is higher for half year. And then could you maybe just reiterate the fiscal '010 interest number that you gave, I missed that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, certainly. I mean in terms of this year we've actually done an enormous amount of focus on working capital and cash generation throughout the group, we've actually changed some of our bonus schemes to bring it into metrics. We have a working capital group that's actually working on and we can see the activity that they are taking on, things like tax stamp levels and re-shedding of production impact, underlying working capital, it's somewhat dwarfed. We always get a working capital outflow historically we've had in the group in the first half course by generally the timing of the UK budget.</p>
          <p>This was exacerbated &#x2013; I have mentioned of the 600 million increase 450 million of that approximately 450 million of that was stock effectively preproduction of stock in Poland and Czech, that stock was produced in December and in Poland will be sold out by June, so that will be gone and in Czech by &#x2013; is out of the system by September. So those completely reverse. In addition as I said, we will then see the impact of the measures that we're taking on working capital come through, so for the full-year as I say, I would expect us to actually have a working capital outflow for the year as a whole, so I would expect to cash conversion as &#x2013; to working capital inflow; sorry; yes &#x2013; I'm sorry; working capital yes, it depends on &#x2013; yes, cash inflow, cash inflow by the end of the year, so basically cash conversion being more than 100% in the current year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of fiscal '10, were you talking about interest rate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a question -- just returning to the U.K, if I look at the pattern of it, you've got volumes of minus nine percent this half, got net revenue of minus three, indicating that you've had very good pricing. And yet your margins have come down slightly, and in previous halves &#x2013; in previous years you've had very, very good margin growth in the UK and therefore I'm wondering whether that incredible margin growth we've seen is basically at an end or we should expect flat margins going forwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really ,Bob should answer this question, because he always answers the question on UK margins and I think he usually says there or there about I think, or something like that. But this time round it is down a bit, I'd expect that to pick up a bit in the second half, because we've got the full impact of pricing coming through in the second half, but also this is part of the model we've seen in the UK historically for me, in that we've launch that does have an impact on mix in the market and that will have some impact on margins in the short-term, but with price increases that will build back through again. So I don't see this is a sudden significant reversal in trend but neither do I see us moving to a hugely growing margin trend either. I go back to Bob's there or thereabouts comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can I ask as well? You've obviously had really good results in rest of world. Are you able to say what it was on a like-for-like basis? Are you stripping &#x2013; either including your harvest in the full year, for the year earlier comparison or somehow making it to give a sense of the progress you're making there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't driven out an underlying growth number for the rest of the world region. I think if you pick it off, though, by the various geographies. We've talked about the progress on, if you want to strip it out the Imperial Core Commonwealth business which has been very good in the first half with the share growth we are seeing. And we see that continuing because our portfolio is well balanced for the current environment with the federal excise tax increase.</p>
          <p>If you look at Africa, Middle East, I mean the vast majority of that is clearly our historic Imperial business with the significant addition of Morocco and the core Imperial Africa, Middle East businesses performed exceptionally well in the first half, and in Eastern Europe, again, a large chunk of that for us is again at the core Imperial businesses as it was if you've got Balkan Star as we did in Russia and some other shares. But if you're looking at Ukraine and some of the other markets, again, good progress from the Imperial business.</p>
          <p>So without putting a number on it, there's good organic progress in those emerging markets added to by the Altadis portfolio that we've brought in there and, again as I mentioned, Asia's been- been picking up quite nicely now, with our local time on manufacture. Also, I was in Indo-China recently and our businesses in Vietnam, Laos, those are progressing well as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the other significant impact has- you see it from the constant currency charts that happens in the rest of the world, obviously, is Forex because in certain parts, you are looking at dollar-denominated sales, and so they hit revenues immediately and so if you take a look on my chart effectively, we were talking about a 79% if I take the rest of the world region in profits- a 79% increase actually and that's 45% at constant currency. Constant curry, I'm obviously feeling hungry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I may ask another question, ma'am, obviously down-trading as yourself and your peers highlighted, how big a problem is illicit trading becoming? Has illicit trade picked up significantly in the current environment? Then I've got two follow-up questions. FX, is it possible to give us an indication of the full year FX impact at current rates on sales and EBIT? And then your wording on the dividend, lastly just &#x2013; you said maintain a 50% pound (46;48) ratio while recognizing the cash impact of the Altadis restructuring. I read it that it will be recognized and could be reduced by 100 million. Your comments earlier, did you say it will just be considered and not necessarily reduced by that amount?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have to factor it in as we did with the Reemtsma deal. I am not saying- this is a board decision at the end of the day, and it is one of the factors to take into account. So I am not saying that's a slam dunk, I am saying that it just has to borne in mind. I'm really just trying to be helpful as it were on this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the illicit trade, I think it's fair to say; a bit patchy. I think if we've seen &#x2013; fair to say we've seen some tightening in some of the historically difficult areas with growing illicit trade like the UK I think we've seen some significant progress, particularly in the reduction of illicit trade and we've had quite a lot of success in- with various governments in reducing illicit trade and counterfeit, but particularly the UK and other areas of Western Europe have- we have seen an improvement.</p>
          <p>I think it's fair to say though in Germany we haven't seen much of an improvement. It's not just sort of smuggling and counterfeiting, we're also seeing the growth of what seems to be called cheap whites. This is a product produced in Kaliningrad which now has about 7% of German consumption, and certainly as was have pointed in Alison's presentation, a growth of illicit trade in Poland. I think it has been particularly serious brought on by these excessive short-term tax increases.</p>
          <p>So I think, fair to say patchy, but if we- if one looks at the world overall, still a problem, and if we have excessive tax rises in countries, it again kicks the illicit trade market into growth. Alison I don't know if you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I'd add to it is to say it's an area we spend a significant amount of time and effort on, on illicit trade with &#x2013; and cooperation with the rest of the industry and with customs bodies and everything else because, I mean, clearly, it's something we have to keep on top of, and I think, the point you raise is a &#x2013; is an important one, in terms of the current environment, and we're working even harder at it than we have been, because for governments who think about increasing excise taxes, this is the key element of our argumentation. You may think it's a quick win in the current environment, to fill a hole in your coffers, but it's a slam dunk own goal, in terms of just increasing cross border flows. So a lot of initiatives around, a lot of focus on it, and- we try to mitigate the impacts of that on the various markets quite actively.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Julian Hardwick with RBS. Just following on-on the issue of excise duties, are there any significant increases that are coming through the pipeline in any material markets for you that might have a hit on volume, as we look ahead, that you are aware of? And on the subject of pricing which you've pretty highlighted as being a big positive for you, we've got Germany coming through, any other important price movements and any likelihood that we will see anything in France?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think in terms of major excise movements, I think we've seen in Western Europe a degree of recognition of the difficultly that Alison talked about, that you can just throw the market into complete disorder by too volatile treatment of excise taxes. I think the biggest one I've seen in terms of noise, I'm not entirely sure whether it's actually gone through yet, or whether the due date hasn't been struck, but was I think Brazil where there was about a 30% excise tax increase mooted. And that's about the biggest I've seen, but of course the whole thing is dwarfed really in the course of this year, by the FET. The FET increases, from an American perspective, are obviously very considerable, you know, we're looking at a sort of 150% increase in Federal Excise Tax and then state taxes to come on top. I don't know if there are any more that I've missed, but those are the main ones to me.</p>

          <p>I can't think of one lurking, but yes Taiwan's got one coming, but the very big one also has been in Ireland. And there, I think, contrary maybe to the point you see on illicit trade in Poland, there has been a significant reduction in the Irish market but that's all just gone to Northern Ireland, you just get the cross border flows through there. Some of that will be legal, some of it clearly will be illegal as well.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two things, first of all Gareth, your comments about Leaf, is there any help you can give us with quantifying that, is that something that you would expect to make a material impact on the cost savings sort of getting through next year, or the profit numbers the market's expecting? Or is it something that's more manageable than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think it's manageable in that sense, I think it's just fair to point out, though, that there was Leaf inflation during, obviously in 2008, but &#x2013; in virtually all of the growths, but if one looks at the events of 2008, to some degree understandable, also given exchange rate movements. But we were able to mitigate the worst effects, I think, of that. We were fortunate in some respect where we inherited the Altadis business which had around about 18 months stock.</p>
          <p>Imperial had bought judiciously in 2006, so we had a &#x2013; when obviously it was a great bargain time to buy tobacco. So we had some stock as well. So the existence of that stock plus some strategic purchasing, shifts into new growths and different growths, helped to mitigate that situation. I think all I'm saying is I think it gets a little tougher next year in terms of our ability to mitigate, because we won't have that stock buffer that we had. But what we are seeing is the inflation now behaving in the normal cyclical way and starting to track down again, in the leaf growths that we will be seeing over the coming months. So no. A bit of a long winded answer, but not a material effect and I think we're able to manage that quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just secondly on Germany, I think this is the first time in a while anyway when the growth you have seen in JPS hasn't offset the loss in share of others and your overall German factory-made share has declined a bit. Is that something that's going to be a more permanent shift or do you think the price increases coming this &#x2013; this summer are going to kick start share growth for you again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Allison, you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. JPS has slowed down a little bit I suppose. I mean 8.5% from when we started on JPS is still a fantastic performance, I think. So I will start with the plus points on that. I think for us as well the West declines are mitigating which I think is also good in the mix here. So before we were seeing West having more of a soaking up effect on the JPS growth rate. I think now those West declines are mitigating. We talked about maxi-packs, we talked about the recent launch of the soft West pack as well which is a slight discount for the normal West price.</p>
          <p>So I think that combination, it may be that JPS has slowed a little bit, but West is probably not the drag that it was, so I can't sit here and give you a prediction on market share necessarily, but I wouldn't see this being a sort of a tip down on an ongoing basis in Germany. And don't forget we get Gold West blond back as well next year. And I think a bit more focus behind that from our sales force --excuse me -- could also be quite helpful to our share in Germany as well.</p>

          <p>And of course, the move from 17 to 19 will help considerably. As you know we have been banging on about that for some years. Okay, at the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could you give us your &#x2013; the organic volume and the organic net sales growth in the first half? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's extremely difficult to give you what I would call an accurate organic volume figure. When you actually sit down and t try and calculate it, it's an absolute nightmare. That's because of the number variables that are involved in the equation. If we take the, sort of, macro variable from the time we acquired Altadis, we started running it as one business. So for instance, we took decisions to adjust the price of JPS in certain territories. So we're not cannibalizing against our combined brand portfolio. The withdrawal of Montecristo cigarettes would be another example of that sort of thing. If we then get into the timing differences, the de-stocking differences, and a whole host of underlying things that &#x2013; it's an absolute nightmare to calculate; it's very difficult to give you an exact number.</p>
          <p>So the best I think we can do is to just to look at the key brands. And we've seen, bar West, all of our key brands have grown well and we have done quite a bit of repositioning of this combined portfolio. So we got very good overall volume growth rate and I think our brands are, as you have seen from the numbers today, very well set to keep on growing and at all &#x2013; across the whole of the price spectrum. So it's very difficult to give you an overall number it's very complex because of the timing differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think what we attempted to do is effectively, if you take a look at year-on-year, and just say if we take a look at last year &#x2013; at last year's results and pro-rata up the Altadis contribution to a six-month contribution, adjust for currency and the impact of about &#xA3;50 million which is the Netherlands' bad debt, the movement of the UK budget and the divestment of the fine cut brands. So you just make those few adjustments, effectively underlying profit growth is about 6%, a little over 6%.</p>
          <p>And that &#x2013; I think that's the only way that you can actually look at it because as Gareth said there are a significant number of moving parts otherwise, and you could create an industry and prove absolutely nothing.</p>

          <p>David Hayes from Nomura again. Just in terms of logistics, clearly the non-tobacco bit is struggling a little bit in this environment, which may suggest that other players that are focused on that as a core part of their business would look to drive scale. I don't know if you can answer that question; do you see that business as core, the non-tobacco part?</p>
          <p>And secondly maybe you can answer this bit; is it very separate to the tobacco logistics operation? Is it fairly standalone, could be cut off were you to think &#x2013; go down that route. I mentioned &#x2013; I'm not sure if I missed this, but just in Africa, Middle East, BAT had a pretty strong first quarter because they talked about some stocking up ahead of price increases. Did that impact you guys in that region? Is that going to unwind slightly in the second half? Just wonder if you can quantify if there is any one-off in that region that was very strong. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, on the logistics business as we said, the core tobacco logistics business we did well in Italy, well in France, Spain of course we're affected by the overall volume decline in the Spanish market, but a lot of active cost management to obviously stimulate volume, sorry margin in the second half there. I think on the other logistics activities, I think you can &#x2013; some of them you can group into, sort of, are almost simpatico or supportive to tobacco distribution, i.e. they go through the same outlets, there is a lot of synergy benefit between them. And some of those businesses have done pretty well, others not so well.</p>
          <p>I think fair to say it's a good business model that Logista have got in other logistics and in many areas I think because of the distress out there amongst competitors we've been gaining market share and gaining new contracts. But there are a couple of others businesses that really had a difficult time and Louis and his team are taking serious cost reduction approaches to those business. And are they massively core to us? No; the answer is they are not. Tobacco and that related tobacco logistics activity very much core.</p>
          <p>Sorry, there was another one on Africa, Middle East pre-price increase. I don't think we would say there is a significant <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Sorry. One more from me, Jon Fell, Deutsche. The renewal of the PM distribution contract in Spain, am I right in thinking that's the first time you've had one of those contracts renewed since you've owned Altadis?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>I think those tests are mainly, you know we said at the offset that we &#x2013; Logista, the logistics division would be run very much on an arms length basis and our genuine objective in that business is to delight our customers. And I hope we do, and we strived very hard to do that. David? It's like tennis, this.</p>

          <p>A bit boring now, sorry. Just on the derivatives accounting loss, I mean that was at the end of March, obviously I think you've had nearly two months. Can you just outline whether anything's changed, I mean in exchange rates move all over the place every day. If we you were to close the things as they are today, is there another loss to come in the second half? Or has it now come the other way; they're going to be volatile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Its very volatile. And yes, you could &#x2013; and it does move quite a lot on any one small move in exchange rate. I mean today I'd say, and Nick you'll correct me if I'm wrong, probably 2 to 300 million more favorable. So it's come back the other way.</p>
