        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Express Scripts' second quarter 2012 earnings call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations David Myers. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me today are George Paz, our CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filing with the SEC.</p>
          <p>For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. The earnings release is posted on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will discuss our second quarter financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we've had a few busy months here, including closing the Medco acquisition, executing our integration plan, migrating the first tier of lives, focusing on the selling season, and signing a new contract with Walgreens. In addition, we're also reporting strong second quarter earnings and increasing guidance for the year.</p>
          <p>Adjusted claims for the quarter were $404.3 million, up 118% from last year. Our generic fill rate was 77.8%, up from 74% a year ago. In keeping with our model of alignment, as our clinical programs deliver savings to our clients, we also improve our gross profit.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A was up $80 million versus Q1, pro forma for the acquisition, as a result of an increase in management incentive compensation to reflect the increase in our expectations for the year and the reclassification of several Medco expenses from cost of goods sold to SG&amp;A to conform with Express Scripts' accounting methodology.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the quarter was $1.5 billion and EBITDA per Rx was up 14% versus prior year, again, pro forma for the acquisition.</p>
          <p>Interest expense in the quarter was $169.5 million as a result of the repayment of $1.5 billion of bonds at an average rate of 5.9% and continued low floating rates. Interest expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $530 million.</p>
          <p>This quarter's effective tax rate, excluding non-recurring items related to purchase accounting, was 42.1%. The higher rate for the quarter was the result of several factors related to the closing of the transaction and the necessary year-to-date true-ups. We still expect our effective tax rate to be 39%, which means the tax rate for the second half is expected to be approximately 38%.</p>
          <p>EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, a 24% increase over last year. Cash from operations was $726 million, a 58% increase from last year. Including Medco's first quarter performance, year-to-date cash from operations is approximately $2 billion.</p>
          <p>As a result of strong performance in the first half of the year and the accelerated realization of synergies, we are increasing our guidance range for 2012. We now expect EPS for the year, excluding transactions, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.60 to $3.75, representing growth of 24% over 2011 at the midpoint. As we have said before, this range assumes that shares outstanding for the year will be 750 million and the tax rate will be 39%. If the share count or tax rate changes from these assumptions, our EPS forecast could change.</p>
          <p>We are in the process of reviewing the strategic alternatives for several of our adjacent businesses which are not core to our PBM offering. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of these businesses to have a material impact on our financial results.</p>
          <p>In summary, integration is proceeding well and we continue to expect to complete the integration and achieve $1 billion of net synergies in 2014.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call over to George.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Four months post-closing, we are more confident that the combination with Medco provides significant opportunities to innovate, drive out waste, and improve how healthcare is delivered. As part of our integration, we are combining Medco's clinical approach through its Therapeutic Resource Centers and the use of specialized pharmacists with Consumerology, the application of the behavioral sciences to healthcare. By blending the combined clinical skills with the behavioral sciences, we will be able to accelerate clinical offerings, promote greater efficiencies in the healthcare system, and better protect American families from the rising costs of prescription medications.</p>
          <p>Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence where appropriate, lower costs, and drive to better health outcomes. Our previous acquisitions have succeeded through a disciplined approach to integrations, including clinical programs, rationalization of our footprint, and systems migration. We believe operating on one platform is imperative in offering best-in-class service and meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by healthcare reform, Medicare and Medicaid expansion.</p>
          <p>Just last week, we successfully moved our first tier business to our destination operating platform. Our track record of successful integrations has allowed us to spend much more time this selling season discussing our innovative clinical offerings and cost savings opportunities, including narrow networks. As such, we are enjoying a successful selling season. Retention rates for both Express Scripts and Medco's legacy book of business exceed 95%, which is consistent with historical norms. We have won over 125 clients to date, which is consistent with prior years. None of our wins or renewals for the year required specific pharmacies to be included in their retail network. And we have begun a successful selling season in presenting narrow networks and believe this offering will continue to gain traction.</p>
          <p>We recently entered into a multiyear pharmacy network agreement with Walgreens to participate in our broadest retail pharmacy network. We will continue to design benefit programs that meet our clients' needs, including narrow networks, formulary management, and other clinical tools.</p>
          <p>Our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the year reflects the strength of our value proposition, confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our business, and our unprecedented opportunity to make the use of medicines safer and more affordable, which is exactly what our plan sponsors need now.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> We'll go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. I have two questions. The first is just on the synergy side. You mentioned in the release an acceleration of the capture there. Can you talk about maybe some of the specific areas where you're seeing progress at this point earlier than maybe you anticipated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't like to go into lots of detail, obviously, but certainly the primary area where we're seeing synergy come in faster than we had previously thought is in the SG&amp;A lines, and we'll see that move through the balance of the year. I would say in the second quarter, not meaningful amounts of synergy were realized, and we expect to start to realize some of those SG&amp;A gains through the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, George, in your remarks there you were just talking a little bit about narrow networks or preferred networks from a benefit design standpoint. Can you maybe go into a little bit more color on what you're seeing? There's been a lot of talk about at least customers considering it. To what extent are you actually seeing customers decide to implement it if they're looking toward 2013 benefit design?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we ought to just keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all in anything we do. We have a very broad array of products and solutions for our customers, so it really depends on what a customer is looking for and, quite frankly, the economic conditions in which they find themselves. To the extent that a client needs significant savings on a relatively quick basis, we have everything from mandatory mail programs, mandatory generic programs, very, very limited networks that compete the pharmacies against each other in order to become the preferred pharmacy and drive down costs for those members, to a very open offering for those clients that have a different viewpoint with respect to the pharmacy offering. But you should also keep in mind that we've had a very successful retention season, similar to historical levels. And basically, when we went out and had to re-sign these clients, none of them was offered Walgreens as an alternative, and yet we were still maintaining 95% of our book of business.</p>
          <p>So when you think about narrow networks, clearly without Walgreens in initially, that was our modus operandi at that point. So I think going forward, now we have the benefit of including them. They are a part of our larger network. So quite frankly, it's up to a client. If a client wants to see savings beyond, they can choose a more limited network. For those clients that want the broader networks, they have that option. It's our job to provide a wide array of products and offerings that meet those clients' needs, and that's our focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How narrow do you have to narrow a network to drive some material savings? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on geographic locations. Again, these aren't just simple answers. In a market where you have very high competition between the retail pharmacies, excluding one means that all those members can be now diverted to the other pharmacy, and they're willing to drop rates for that. In other markets where the competition may not be as strong and the client sees that they want that bigger pharmacy chain in, then it doesn't do you a lot of good to exclude them. So I think it's really on a regional-by-regional basis.</p>
          <p>But keep in mind, some people have talked about maybe you can only save a dollar. Saving a dollar per prescription is a tremendous amount of money. We're talking with Express Scripts processing 1.4 billion prescriptions a year, a dollar is $1.4 billion. You tell me a company today that's running a million prescriptions through their SG&amp;A line that if they could save $1 million doing something that doesn't cause a lot of disruption that they wouldn't do it. Fifty cents is worth doing.</p>
          <p>As an ex-CFO, when I go through our budgets and I go through our forecasts with my CFO, Jeff, we're constantly looking for pennies. You got to start with pennies to get dollars. And so everything is important if it really doesn't involve anything that has a material negative effect on your employees. What we've been able to prove is that limiting networks, limiting formularies, changing access, putting in clinical programs, all those things can reach tremendous desired results without employee disruption. So we're pretty excited about what we can bring to the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question will come from Larry Marsh with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning, George and Jeff. So just following up on Tom's question about overall synergy expectations, you guys are communicating pretty clearly today that you're able to accelerate the timing of some of these savings, or the SG&amp;A saves, but you haven't changed the ultimate target of $1 billion. I know your wording when you first announced Medco last July was estimated synergies of $1 billion. Back in May, you described that as net synergies of $1 billion and are confirming that today. So just remind us what you mean by net synergies. And from a timing standpoint, when might you be in a position to revisit those ultimate synergy assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take a first stab at that, but Jeff can give it the proper classifications and color. From my perspective, net synergy means what we're bringing to you as our shareholders. So there's going to be numbers that we're going to gain and that we're going to pass on to our clients. And synergy takes a lot of different forms. To the extent that our product people develop new clinical programs that help lower costs and drive down waste, that can be considered a synergy, and we're constantly looking to do that. Obviously, the clients are going to gain the market share or the lion's share of those numbers. Our view today is that our operations people have worked very hard in order to make sure that as we came into this acquisition, we had a good idea of where our staffing levels needed to be.</p>
          <p>As you know, last year Medco had a bit of a tough year with CalPERS and the FTC and some of the other situations. And so our first drive was in order to right-size the ship and get the right level of people to meet the service levels which our clients needed in order to meet their needs and, at the same time, make sure that we have the right people in place to drive the company into the future, so that was where our focus was. Because we were given an extended period of time by the government as they reviewed the acquisition, we had more time to plan and get things in place. So once we closed the deal, we were able to go in and quickly, prudently focus on getting the boat right-sized. And we did that. So that accelerated SG&amp;A savings and some VPC [variable product cost] savings into the current quarter, which helped us.</p>
          <p>There's an awful lot that still needs to be done, whether it's contracting networks, whether it's getting the formularies put together, working with all the pharmaceutical manufacturers, on and on. I mean, there's a whole lot of things that need to be done in order to put these two companies together, one of which, which is very large, of course, is getting to one platform. We are very proud and feel great about our employees' focus that we're able to get the first tier of our membership moved. We're ready to move the next tier in just a couple of weeks. And so we're well on our path to continuing those efforts. The sooner we can get that done, the sooner we can eliminate all the significant costs associated with multiple platforms and development and regulatory costs, and we're on that path.</p>
          <p>Now, to revise the number, it gets kind of complicated, Larry, just because we are &#x2013; we're all in the same business. So when we start putting things together, our people are very focused on continuing to drive value for our clients, and the numbers start to get a little more blended together, if you will. So what's a synergy versus what is truly just a pure operating gain because our operations people figured out a better way to present our prescriptions through our automated systems or our systems people have a better methodology for processing claims? As we gain those opportunities on top of the combinations, the blurriness between the synergies gets a little bit confusing, if you will.</p>
          <p>So our view is, and I think we feel very good about the $1 billion; we'll continue to focus on that. But at the end of the day, the next quarter, 30 &#x2013; 90 days or so from now, we'll be in a position to give guidance into 2013, and that will be our indication. And we'll give you some more &#x2013; a better view on where we think numbers are coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, okay, very good, and just a quick clarification following with Jeff maybe on interest expense. $530 million is a bit lower than I was thinking, so it must be a pretty good step down to third quarter of maybe $115 million or so. Can you remind us what's driving that, and is that a good run rate for next year?</p>
          <p>And then the other quick clarification, in the Q you talk about Medco's network participation with Walgreens remaining in place under existing terms. I know you don't want to talk too specifically about that. But can you make any comments about whether that's existing terms, or is that all under one new agreement, as you disclosed? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so interest expense, I think it's real simple. We prepaid or paid off $1.5 billion of bonds that were outstanding. Those bonds had an average rate of 5.9%. and we're continuing to see low floating interest rate, so we've got low rates on a large chunk of our floating-rate bonds. That's what's driving our interest rate down from what it was in Q1 and Q2. $530 million for the year, we expect it to be pretty flat from Q3 to Q4. So if you follow that and have the two quarters be about the same in Q3 and Q4, you should get pretty close to the right numbers. I'll let George take the second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as the Walgreens contract, keep in mind that we just entered into a new contract with them. And it covers the entire book of business, both Medco legacy and Express Scripts, but it doesn't take effect until September. The contract is in force but our current membership don't access Walgreens until September. So for those legacy members, we still have the Medco contract that's operational and working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Thanks for the clarifications, appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to the line of Greg Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks and good morning, just a couple of quick clarifications. George and Jeff, I was curious to ask about the gross margins. The gross margins looked particularly strong. I guess I'm trying to figure out. How much of that was driven organically I guess by incremental contribution from generics this quarter, or how much of that was synergy driven? Because I noticed the generic dispensing rate was a little higher than we thought and the mail order rate &#x2013; mail order claims were a little bit higher than what we would have thought, so any clarity around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll put a couple things in, then Jeff can give you some of the numbers stuff. Clearly, the generic is a strong driver, as you know, through our model of alignment, hitting when we can pull through additional opportunities both through clinical programs and through generic fill rates, drugs losing their patent protection, all add to value for our clients and to us for our shareholders, so those are all very positive things.</p>
          <p>The other thing which we already talked about was our operations people are very diligent. Pat McNamee brought his team together and made sure that we were focused on day one of getting the right people and the right jobs and the right head count, and we've been working very diligently at that. So as we bring out &#x2013; as we right-sized the boat again, it took a lot of costs out of equation and allowed us to bring down our DTC costs again, which I guess clearly is synergistic, but it's also things that we do constantly to make sure that we're on the right track here. So that's going to continue to be our focus as we continue to look forward and drive numbers. I don't know, Jeff, do you have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right. Obviously, the model of alignment, we talk about it a lot, it has worked really well for us over the years. When generic fill rates go up, when mail penetration goes up, when clinical programs start to execute, we're saving our clients money on the drug spend. We're now starting to save them money on the medical spend as well. And in keeping with that model, that helps our gross profit, so that's the primary driver. As I said earlier, we didn't see much synergy in the second quarter coming through gross profit. We do expect to see some in the third and the fourth quarters especially coming through to gross profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff, maybe if I can ask one follow-up question on generics. And I understand you guys don't want to comment at all on fiscal 2013 at this point. But what I'm trying to gauge is, obviously, we saw a bunch of big generics lose their exclusivity in the first half of this year. As we look to the back half of calendar 2012, there's a fair amount of generic introductions that are coming. And so I'm just trying to think, from a very high level perspective, how I should think about generics in 2013 versus 2012. Is it fair to say that you're obviously going to get the full 12-month contribution from all of these big generics next year in 2013, so it could actually be bigger than 2012? Is that a fair way to characterize it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to answer that question without providing 2013 guidance, which I'm not prepared to do today. We're at this point focused on executing on the year. We're happy with where the year is going. We're seeing positive uptake in the year. We're happy with the execution of integration and synergy and that's our focus. You're going to have to wait a little while longer to get us to comment specifically on 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about the underlying mail trends that you're seeing. Obviously, they were stronger in the quarter. As we go through the Q, you talked about mail conversion. So, George or Jeff, can you comment on what you saw around mail conversion perhaps related to the dispute with Walgreens or any other programs that you have in place that are going to continue to drive mail? And then secondly, can you give us an idea of what your underlying mail growth was in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can both take on parts of that, Lisa. First of all, the dispute with Walgreens clearly helped mail. Those members who &#x2013; as you know from our whole discussion around behavioral sciences, getting people to move off of the status quo is not easy. And when an event occurs such as losing Walgreens out of the network, that was a real motivator and driver for people to take action. And so as they were looking at their possibilities, obviously, we informed them of the benefits of mail order. There's no question our service is undeniably the best in the industry. And as we could lever that to provide the value back to the membership, they've taken advantage of that and that has driven mail.</p>
          <p>The other thing we shouldn't lose sight of is joining me on my senior staff as part of the acquisition were two very, very sharp individuals from Medco who grew up in a business that was very, very good at driving mail. And so both Glen [Stettin] and Tim [Wentworth] have that focus. They know the value. They bring a fresh new look into how we can promote mail in front of our clients, and so both through the account management and sales side as well as the product development side. These two individuals have been able to really take us to a new level, and we'll continue to focus on that. So we're excited about how our staff has come together, some new ideas, some new focuses. Using the Therapeutic Resource Centers in combination with our Consumerology has added a lot of value to our clients and will continue to drive mail.</p>

          <p>Do you have any numbers on the underlying mail growth?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not going to break it out. I think I'd just mirror what George says. The couple things we know, adherence goes up at mail; price to the member and to the client goes down. We've got a lot of great ideas. We're going to keep driving it, and we're confident that we can continue to improve outcomes and lower cost by getting more people into our mail program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously much stickier. And then just secondly, no one has asked thus far about the selling season. George, can you comment on how the selling season has gone thus far, how receptive clients are to the new offering? You have potentially the 95%, but can you maybe talk about have you been able to win any new customers as well in the selling season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In our prepared comments, I mentioned we had 125 new wins to date this year. I think we feel very good about where we stand. We historically &#x2013; new wins are very important to us. But quite frankly, retaining the business and growing what we do and adding value is the most important thing we can do. I think it's always a little dangerous if you just focus purely on sales, especially when you get to a fairly large size because keep in mind, winning new business, there are lower margins. There's a lot of startup cost. There's a lot of effort that goes in that. That doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. But clearly, the focus has to be on maintaining what we have and growing it and bringing value to those clients. That's going to be the biggest drivers of value enhancement.</p>
          <p>And when we look out to the future, obviously, we always want to have new wins because new wins validate our business principles and who we are. But it's also &#x2013; we're not willing &#x2013; as you know, Lisa, we've always walked a very fine line between making sure that the value we add to our customers and the price we're going to deliver so that we can add value to our shareholders has to be balanced. And we're going to maintain that discipline and we're going to maintain that balance in everything we do. And our job is to make sure we grow at the best in class for our shareholders on our share value, and that's where our focus is. It's to make sure we perform for our shareholders and, at the same time, perform for our clients.</p>
          <p>So we feel good about our selling season and we feel good where we stand. And obviously, this has been an interesting year. Without Walgreens through the early part of the year, that really wasn't a big negative, though, at the end of the day. As I said in the past, in certain areas such as managed care, it's a little bit harder because often they have a different type of offering that they're reselling our services out to the public, so that's a little tougher. But clearly on the commercial side, the commercial clients are really looking for savings and what's good for their membership. So again, I think we feel very good about where we sit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do, but I'm not going to mention it. I don't think &#x2013; because they're a public company, I don't think we should be the one driving them. I think that from my perspective, I am incredibly appreciative of what all of our other retail pharmacies did to help us through that period. I'm also very appreciative of what Walgreens has done to come back into our network. So our clients are working with our account teams and they're deciding where they want to go. We obviously track that, but I'd prefer not to get into that level of detail.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe, George, just to be difficult, when Express Scripts isn't buying stock, it has historically been a signal that there's an elephant deal coming. Why are we wrong this time around?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much, just a quick follow-up on the selling season, George. On a net basis, do you expect at this point to be up or down as you move into January of 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net-net, it should be up, but it's still kind of early, because we haven't gotten through all of the renewal season, and we still haven't gotten through all of the new sales opportunities. You also got to be careful because some of my competitors would count things like utilization and inflation in net new wins, and we've never done that. So you really have to parse apart what's driving it. If one of my clients &#x2013; the reason we lose a lot of the business that we lose is because companies combine. And we'll find ourselves having half the business, somebody else having the other half, and then they make the decision. More times than not, the company that's the buying company goes with their &#x2013; they had chosen who they had wanted to work with, and so the survivors choose the winner. And that typically is what happens here.</p>
          <p>Now, if you gain a whole bunch of scripts through that method, is that net new business? A lot of people would count it that way. It just really depends. So what we really try to do is look at script growth over periods of time and, again, balance that between new business wins, again, to validate our model versus enhancing shareholder value to our shareholders. So it's really too early to get too deep into this conversation. Hopefully, we'll be in a position on the next quarterly call to give you a little better color as we project out next year's script count.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful, thanks. That's a good segue. The follow-up was if you look at your legacy business, are you seeing any changes in per capita utilization given all the headlines about the economy at present?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That still is a very troubling factor. When I have a chance to talk to our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Miller, and we look at what's taking place on the underlying numbers, it's very scary, John. It's troubling when you see people with diabetes and heart conditions and some pretty severe situations that aren't taking their medications to the level that they should be.</p>
          <p>I assume it's the economy driving it. We've faced it now for three years. It kind of caught us a bit by surprise last year, as you know. We thought we saw early in the year that trends were starting to warm up and things were starting to take off a little bit, and then they fell back flat again. We're seeing it again this year. Utilization trends are remaining relatively flat. At the same time, the manufacturers, because they're not getting the pull-through with all of the utilization we've historically seen, have been raising prices on an unprecedented basis.</p>
          <p>And so both in oral solids and in specialty products, we're seeing inflation rates that are quite, quite large. And so we're doing everything we can to work with our clients to give them alternatives through clinical programs, prior authorizations, step therapies, formulary management, and other programs to try to help them combat the ever-increasing costs of those drug therapies. So it's good and it's bad. Obviously, our tools are needed more than ever to help clients control their costs. At the same time, it's a bit frustrating when we see costs rising at four and five times the cost of inflation, so it's a difficult situation.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last quarter, George, I think you highlighted Medicare &#x2013; the Medicaid business as a driver to performance in the quarter and as an important growth driver for your clients, obviously. Have you seen any impact this quarter, and how do you think about this business segment going forward? And then on the Walgreens side, to your point, Walgreens wasn't a big negative to you throughout the year. So what is the client reaction to the announcement that Walgreens is back in the network, if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Medicaid will continue to be a very important component of our business. It's mostly managed through our &#x2013; or it is managed through our health plan side, our managed care division. And many, many of our clients have a focus on both Medicare and Medicaid. Our job is to produce the tools and the reporting and the information that they need to meet those to meet the needs the different states as they roll out their programs. So clearly into this year, Medicaid has been a big driver for us, and I suspect it's going to stay that way as we go into 2013 and 2014. It's an area of growth, of significant growth. So it's something we're very, very, very focused on.</p>
          <p>As far as Walgreens is concerned, again, this is like anything else. Whether it's formulary or whatever, it's really a client-by-client decision. Our goal isn't to go in and suggest &#x2013; or force clients to choose mail or choose formularies or do anything. Our job is to lay out choices. Our job is to just come in and lay down here's &#x2013; what is the need of the client? Some companies like if you're in a professional services business and you're hotly contesting for employment, chances are you're going to have a pretty open, flexible plan design. If you're in a very difficult business facing tremendous competition and your margins are declining, then you're going to be much more focused on costs. So our job is to roll out and give clients the options to make the decisions they need to meet their cost account objectives. So again, the answer is different for every client. Some clients are excited to have the opportunity to go back into Walgreens. And other clients are, quite frankly, because they were in our broadest network, are more willing to sacrifice that access in order to keep the cost savings that they can enjoy. So it's really a client-by-client decision.</p>
          <p>Why don't we do two more questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking the questions here, actually maybe just some housekeeping questions. Jeff, you mentioned that you're evaluating some of the businesses that you have that aren't core to it. When we look at the segment breakout, obviously, it looks like the other revenue in the core PBM is probably a little bit lower. It looks like you moved some things around. Can you just talk about what has moved and maybe what you're looking at as non-core?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, so you're absolutely right. We did change our segments around. It made a lot of sense to recalibrate the segments based on what we have now. So essentially, we're in two segments, the PBM and the PBM businesses, which for the most part is the U.S. and the Canadian PBM, and the specialty businesses are in the PBM segment. And then everything else is in the other businesses segment. And so that is detailed in the Q. But it is our international businesses, both the historic Express Scripts international as well as the Medco international. It's Liberty. It's UBC. It's the other subsidiaries that the legacy Medco organization had as well as the distribution business that we have and other businesses.</p>
          <p>So we're looking at strategic alternatives. We think it's too early to really go into details and name names, but a lot of these businesses aren't core and don't have the return on invested capital metrics that we'd like to see. And therefore, we're going to sell them or just exit them over the next several quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to be clear, we don't expect these sales or these exits to have a material impact on the overall results of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And also maybe on the share count here, you're still guiding to about 750 million. We actually had 824 million in the quarter. Can you talk about how we should expect that to ramp up in the back half? Are we going to have a step function here in the third quarter and flatten out, or is it a ramp as you expect people to exercise options and as part of maybe severance packages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The truth is I don't know. We're using 750 million. That's our best estimate. The big swing factor here is how legacy Medco employees exercise their stock options, and there's no easy way for us to predict that, 750 million is our best example. I would expect it probably to ramp slightly over time. That's how I'm modeling it internally. But I think just for modeling purposes, we're forcing the model of 750 million for the year. If it comes in different than that, then the EPS could change. But quite frankly, it's hard to predict how that's going to come through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then one last follow-up question. On the tax rate, obviously you're saying more 37% to 38% for the back half of the year &#x2013; or I guess, I'm sorry, 38% to 39%, which implies the back half is that 37% to 38%. Should we think of that back half rate as really the more normalized tax rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. As I said in my prepared remarks, the effective tax rate for the company is 39%. It's our goal over time to get that as low as possible, although I don't expect that rate to change significantly over the next year or two. So I think 39% is the rate. We've got a lot of integration and other things to do to get that rate down a little bit. And of course, it's always dangerous to talk about tax rates given all the legislative potential on that. But our current view is 39% is the rate for the year and going forward. And that as a result, the second quarter had some year-to-date catch-ups and other purchase accounting related items in it, which forced the rate up, which means to get to 39% for the year, we end up with 37.5% to 38% in the back half. That's what gives us 39% for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>And your final question this morning comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, George and Jeff. I just have a question just on the synergies for 2012 and for 2013. You talked about that for calendar 2012, SG&amp;A will be the bigger synergy opportunity. And obviously what has been visible to the investment community is the new drug wholesaling contract starting in October. You obviously have a new retail pharmacy reimbursement contract with a large chain starting mid-September. So I guess my question is, as we think about going into 2013, should we see more synergy from COGS versus SG&amp;A? And also just overall when we think about retail pharmacy network pricing, again without getting too granular, is that a meaningful part of the overall synergy opportunity tied into the merger? I just want to get more color on that as well. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're not prepared to talk about 2013 today. The numbers that we hope to gain or we'll gain through the course of the third and fourth quarter are embedded in the guidance range that Jeff gave you. So that's where we're at for those numbers. As we look out to 2013, there are a lot of things that drive synergy, and that's why it starts getting clouded when we look out into the next year because, again, clients are going to &#x2013; a lot of it is going to depend on where the economy is as well. If the economy doesn't improve and things remain relatively tough, more and more clients are going to be looking at more and more options to drive out cost. As those realizations or those things, events become real, then they're going to be coming to us to look for those opportunities, and clearly narrower networks are going to be an option. So the question is it's very important for us to go and look for the best pricing between the two different. So if we each have a contract with retail pharmacy A, we look at who's got the best deal and try to get all the business into the better deals. We're going to do that over time.</p>
          <p>But in addition to that, it's also the new products that Glen and his team are going to be rolling out and that we're going to be offering to our clients that are going to help us to help drive value for our clients and drive value for our shareholders. So it does get a bit blurry as you move into this, but we are, very, very focused on continuing to drive value. And we look forward to next quarter when we can give you guidance into 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, maybe just one real quick clarification question. That 95% retention rate, there are always nuances on the definition of that. So I'm wondering for your 95% that you're disclosing, is that just number of customers or is that percentage of revenue? I just want to make sure that we understand that percentage properly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've always done it the same way here, and it's 95% of all claims that we look at. I think when you start getting into small clients, some of them decide to carve in; some carve out. If you just count clients, it can be pretty misleading. We look at claim counts and we've always done it the same way since we've been in business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's second quarter earnings call. We're really excited about where we sit. We believe that as pharmaceutical manufacturers have continued to raise prices, as clients continue to look for opportunities, what has really been fun, I think, the over the last 14 &#x2013; 15 years that I've been there is to watch the clients as they grow and they get a better understanding of value that comes through the PBM, and our tools have only gotten sharper and better, and the clients have become more receptive. Years ago, trying to roll out and go from two-tier formularies to three-tier formularies was a huge undertaking. Now most plans have them. And when you look at narrower networks or you look at mail programs or you look at other savings opportunities, the receptivity of our team to roll out new and exciting and engaging programs that help take down costs while improving health outcomes is just growing with momentum. And we're excited about the position we sit in. We're excited about our future. We look forward to continually updating you on our synergy quest as well as our integration progress. So until next quarter, we'll talk to you again soon. Take care, thank you.</p>
