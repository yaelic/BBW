          <p>Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us to discuss our 2010 fourth quarter and year end results. As before, with me today, are CEO, Asim Ghosh; CFO, Alister Cowan; COO, Rob Peabody; our Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products, Terrance Kutryk and our Vice President of Downstream, Bob Baird.</p>
          <p>In today's call, we will provide an overview of Husky's business strategy and results. Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. The actual results may differ materially from our expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings. These are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us. This is my third quarterly conference call with you and in that short time we've had a significant amount of news to share. Basically, our position is a period of transition and of heightened activity for Husky. And I'd say at the company we are quietly pleased that we have accomplished a number of the financial operational goals we set out to achieve.</p>
          <p>Just to recap on some of these. On our first conference call with you I've said we needed to take immediate action to stabilize production and accelerate value from our near-term opportunities. And on that front since that time we've executed $1.2 billion of acquisitions that add immediate to flowing barrels and deliver immediate value to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Refresh your memory on those, in September we announced the purchase of natural gas properties in west central Alberta near Ram River Gas Plant. That purchase was completed and began contribution of production in December. We followed that deal with an announcement that we've reached agreement to purchase for $860 million oil and gas properties from ExxonMobil. And that deal closed earlier this month.</p>
          <p>Together, on a full run rate basis, these acquisitions add about 33,000 barrels of oil equipment per day. And most importantly, given the oil component in particular they add &#x2013; we have an attractive rate of return even at today's prices. So much for the inorganic side.</p>
          <p>On the organic side, we increased our capital spending during the year last year by about $500 million to bring forward some of the most attractive and immediately accretive production opportunities to our base in Western Canada. And the end result of that is we have succeeded in stabilizing production, which was our near-term goal. A proof point of this would be our December production which was 292,500 barrels, to be specific, per day in December. And as we go into an analysis of the quarter, I do flag to you that the quarter was affected by a number of scheduled turnarounds and a couple of factors outside our control in terms of third-party processing plants and the like. But December would be good representative figure of where our run rate is today. And we expect as the acquisitions close and the organic investments, capital investments kick in, to show growth from here on into the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>We also had an Investor Day conference in early December where we outlined our five year plan with you which sets out very clear financial and operational metrics. Just to refresh your memory, it calls for steady production growth coming from a base of stabilization and major investments in our three growth pillars of the Oil Sands, the Atlantic Region and South East Asia. It calls for the continuation of our &#x2013; of an attractive dividend yield. And as part of that strategy, we brought forward a comprehensive financing plan which ensures that we have the capital to require us to fund these growth initiatives, while maintaining our investment grade rating.</p>
          <p>So in addition to the $860 million Exxon acquisition and the Talisman acquisition was of course last year, so that was baked for last year. It calls for a $4 billion capital program in 2011 and which will allow us to build on the momentum that we have achieved so far and accelerate our near-term production.</p>
          <p>Other developments in the quarter include the sanction of the Sunrise Energy Project, the successful conclusion of negotiations with our partners in the Terra Nova Project which will see us increasing our ownership from 12.5% to 13%, advancement of the Liwan deep water natural gas project in offshore China and the sale of a small non-core oil sands lease in line with our overall strategy of looking at non-core assets, which will allow us to redeploy capital into high-return opportunities with our upstream portfolio.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I think we've achieved a lot in the last eight months but I do want to assure you we are not finished. I mean we see this as work in progress and we are at a stage where the work has just begun. Alister in a moment after me will get into the details of our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the year, but I just want to highlight a couple of headline metrics.</p>
          <p>For the year, our cash flow increased by 42% to $3.5 billion and in the quarter it grew by 58% versus the same period last year. Net earnings in the quarter were $305 million, 19% improvement over the previous quarter. Production for the year was 287,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was in line with our guidance &#x2013; it's within our guidance. But more importantly, as I said, this was not a representative quarter, if you look at the quarter production, because we did have some significant turnarounds. And perhaps we believe December would have been the one month not affected by turnaround that was 292,500 barrel per day. So the picture you see is a one of steady improvements on key financial and operational parts.</p>
          <p>Now that I have worked with the team for eight months I think I'm in a position to express confidence in our ability to execute on our strategic plan and &#x2013; a corollary of guidance to deliver on shareholder value. Over the last eight months to summarize, we have set out a clearly defined course and successfully completed the first key steps. So I would basically say that everything we said to you that we would achieve in the first eight months, we have achieved. The projected increase in production &#x2013; we believe that that projected increase in production and the return on capital employed, combined with our attractive dividend yield represents a compelling, relatively uniquely positioned balanced growth story for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And on that note, let me hand over to Alister to take you through the quarter's financial results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Asim. I want to comment first on the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and then I'll make a couple of comments on the annual results. Overall, the fourth quarter results were strong considering that there were number of offsetting external factors. On crude oil and gas pricing, higher average realized light crude oil prices were offset by continued weakness in natural gas pricing and a stronger Canadian dollar. We do continue to benefit from our product mix, which is approximately 70% weighted to oil production.</p>
          <p>We did have lingering effects of the Enbridge pipeline disruptions, which continue to have an impact, mainly in respect of higher heavy oil differentials. And as a result in the quarter, medium, heavy, and bitumen realized prices were actually lower than Q4 2009 and the impact to net earnings is estimated at $70 million in the quarter, $53 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Our midstream team was able to mitigate the adverse effects to a large degree by moving volumes to different pipelines, thereby avoiding shut-in production in upstream and upgrade our production slowdowns. However, as a result of crude oil inventory in transit increase by 3 million barrels in the quarter, that was about $268 million worth, we will realize that as we sell that inventory down over the next few quarters. The downstream business benefited from a number of positive factors during the quarter including higher market crack spreads in both Canada and the U.S. and strong actual pricing and higher sales volumes and an improved upgrading differential. The settlement of the Terra Nova re-determination resulted in an after-tax gain of $32 million, which was recorded in the upstream segment.</p>
          <p>Looking at production, during the quarter, our production averaged 280,500 boe per day, which was in line with our forecast, and for the year, production averaged 287,100 boe per day. The production in the quarter was impacted, as Asim said, by a scheduled turnaround at White Rose and North Amethyst and our production is now back up and running in December. We did have some unexpected outages at the Caroline gas processing plant and some pipeline restrictions in the Federal area, which reduced our gas production during the quarter. And with the addition of the Ram River properties at the beginning of December and increased production and return of White Rose, we exited the year at 292,500 boe per day.</p>
          <p>The financial highlights for the quarter were our cash flow from operations increased 41% to $1 billion, $1.21 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $657 million or $0.77 per share a year ago and $811 million in the third quarter and this is partly due to the normalization of cash taxes in 2010. Our net earnings of $305 million or $0.35 per share compared to $334 million or $0.38 per share in earnings in Q4 2009. And the fourth quarter earnings showed an improvement on the $257 million and net income which we reported in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the year as a whole, our financial results benefited from stronger oil prices. These were offset by weak natural gas prices, the stronger Canadian dollar, weaker refining margins and the Enbridge pipeline disruptions. Production was lower than in 2009, but as I said, we did exit the year with production stabilized at 292,500 boe per day and is now on an increasing trend. Our net earnings for the year were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 2009. Total sales and operating revenues, net of royalties, were $80.2 billion, up from $15.1 billion a year earlier.</p>
          <p>From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to operate with a strong financial position and are well-positioned to support the growth strategy that Asim has outlined. Our total debt at the end of 2010, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $3.93 billion, but more importantly, our debt to cash flow and debt to capital employed ratios at December 31, 2010 were 1.2 times and 20.3% respectively.</p>
          <p>As part of the comprehensive financing plan that Asim mentioned earlier, a special meeting of shareholders will be held on Monday, February 28th. Now at that time, shareholder approval will be sought to modify the terms of the company's common shares to allow shareholders to receive dividends in cash or in shares at their option. Now this proposal will free up additional cash during a period of substantial growth and has the support of the company's principal shareholders. The dividend for the fourth quarter is expected to be declared by the Board following the February 28th shareholding meeting.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn it over to Rob to comment on our upstream operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alister. We continue to put a major focus on process safety at Husky. As part of this effort, we track a number of process safety metrics across the company. Something we watch closely is the status of all the required inspections on pressure equipment. In 2010, almost 5,000 separate pressure equipment inspections were identified and completed in order to assure us we were in compliance or even beyond compliance with regulatory requirements and good operating practices across our facilities. In terms of occupational safety, we ended 2010 with a recordable injury rate of 1.1, just slightly above our target of 1. During the year, we also completed large turnarounds at the Upgrader, the Lima Refinery and on the SeaRose without any significant incidents.</p>
          <p>Turning to production, 2010 marked a year of heightened activity. In addition to starting production from our North Amethyst field, we took definitive action to increase near-term production in Western Canada through acquisitions and organic growth as Asim described earlier. At the same time, we achieved significant milestones on the road to delivering our mid and long-term growth plans.</p>
          <p>Looking first at the foundation in Western Canada, in the first quarter, we drilled 357 exploration and development wells, more than double 170 wells we drilled in the same period of 2009. In our gas resource play activity and just reminding a big focus on our gas resource play activity is to focus on our liquids-rich gas resource plays in order to focus on improving netbacks going forward. We continue to accelerate the development of the Ansell/Galloway play which is liquids-rich.</p>
          <p>Six drilling wells were active in the fourth quarter and 12 Cardium formation wells were drilled and a further six exploration wells drilled to test the deeper multi-zone potential in the area. At Kakwa, another liquids-rich resource play, the first well in a three-well program was started at the end of the year. This program is aiming to test the same formations as our exploration and development program at Ansell. We also continue to selectively add to our land base to support our gas resource strategy and we also initiated 3-D seismic programs at Ansell, Komie in the Horn River and in the Sierra area.</p>
          <p>Just want to move on now to our activity in terms of going after oil resource play areas on our existing land base. This is an exciting area for us given that we've identified a number of these plays on our existing land base. We've also established a dedicated team to drive this work within the company. Among our activities in the fourth quarter, three Viking wells were placed on production in the Dodsland/Elrose area of southwest Saskatchewan bringing the total number of producing wells to 14. Seven Viking wells were also drilled at Redwater, Alberta in the quarter bringing the total number of wells drilled in 2010 to 23. The company also continues to be an active operator in the Lower Shaunavon and Bakken zones of southern Saskatchewan. Three horizontal wells were brought on production in the Lower Shaunavon, with three additional wells planned for the first quarter. In the Bakken zone, four successful horizontal wells were drilled with two brought on production and two more expected to be producing in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to our heavy oil activities in the Lloyd area, we continue to expand the use of horizontal drillings. This technology greatly increases our ability to exploit thinner horizons. 47 horizontal wells were drilled in the first &#x2013; in the fourth quarter bringing our total in 2010 to 101, a little over 100. This is triple the number of horizontals drilled in 2009 and we have plans to drill up to about 140 in 2011.</p>
          <p>While I'm talking about our business in Lloydminster, let me update you on the status of our operations at the Lloydminster Upgrader. As reported, we experienced a small fire on February 2nd in a unit which supplies product to the coker. The incident was immediately and effectively managed and there were no injuries or environmental impacts. Following an investigation, the cause of the fire was determined. A fuel pipeline froze and burst and fuel was sprayed on to some hot equipment. The damage is not extensive, generally instrumentation and valves and orders have been placed for the replacement equipment. The Upgrader is currently operating at between 40% and 50% of capacity and based on our current schedule for this repair, we expect the Upgrader to return to full capacity in early March.</p>
          <p>Moving on to oil sands, the first of our growth pillars, the Sunrise Energy Project was formally sanctioned in the fourth quarter. And approximately $1.5 billion worth of contracts were awarded. These contracts cover the central facilities, the field facilities and the drilling and completion of wells. Both the central facilities and the field facilities contracts include a large proportion of lump sum and unit rate elements.</p>
          <p>We continued to make progress in addressing production challenges at the Tucker Oil Sands projects. We drilled 16-well pairs in 2010 and three new design well pairs were brought on production. Five additional well pairs commenced steaming in 2011. Tucker exited the year at 6,100 barrels per day. Just to put this in perspective again, when we originally sanctioned Tucker, we were looking at bitumen prices that were half of what they are today and gas prices that were forecast to go to double what they are today or beyond. So we needed about 30,000 barrels a day of production in order to make a reasonable rate of return.</p>
          <p>Looking at the project today, a production rate less than half of that would give us the same return that we were originally looking for. So we are on the road to moving this project forward and hopefully to the point where we can achieve the returns we originally set out to achieve.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the Atlantic region, production continues to ramp up at our North Amethyst field, our first White Rose satellite project. Production averaged 18,160 barrels per day gross in the fourth quarter and since that time production has increased to more than 30,000 barrels per day gross and with the addition of our second injection well, early &#x2013; that came on production early this year.</p>
          <p>At Terra Nova, we successfully concluded the negotiation to increase our interest from 12.5% to 13.5% as we noted earlier; 13%. Okay.</p>
          <p>In South East Asia, we signed an agreement during the quarter with CNOOC specifying key principles of cooperation for funding and operating the Liwan 3-1 deep water gas development and shallow water facilities. First gas is anticipated in late 2013 and ramping up to 2014.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also received approval from the Government of Indonesia for a 20-year extension to the existing Madura Strait's Production Sharing Contract. Husky and its partners are moving forward with plans to develop the Madura BD gas fields with the engineering tendering process expected to begin in early 2011.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we made substantial progress on the production front in 2010, and we continue to advance the medium and long-term projects that underpin our 3% to 5% growth target.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn you back to Rob McInnis who will ask for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning. Just a couple of questions. With respect to Western Canada, Rob, you mentioned a number of different plays you're involved with. Which ones do you see as really being key in terms of moving the needle production-wise and what do you think the timeline looks like? That'd be question one.</p>
          <p>Then secondly, just with respect to Liwan, there's still a number of, I guess, details outstanding, what kind of gas prices you're getting, what are the fiscal terms. Will the development plan that you'll be filing in the first quarter really address those missing pieces? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me just tackle the first one on Western Canada. A number of key plays clearly. I think the first one I would really point out that we're &#x2013; we think can move the needle is the Ansell play. This is a liquids rich multi-zone play. We see a lot of potential there moving forward. So that one has definitely the potential to move the needle on gas production and liquids production, in fact.</p>
          <p>In the oil resource area, there's a number of plays and some that I'm not going to discuss today. But, clearly, you can see our activity in the Viking, the Lower Shaunavon, the Bakken. And I think, in total, these all have the potential and certainly in aggregate, to move the needle on our oil production in Western Canada. And as I say, we're getting &#x2013; as we've kind of gone down this road, we're seeing more potential. We've assembled the team to really focus on this and I think we'll be able to drive this activity forward strongly over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, when you say move the needle, I mean, is that 5,000 barrels, 10,000 barrels a day, 15,000 barrels a day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then what about timelines? I mean, you guys have &#x2013; it looks as though you've got a fairly conservative guidance outlook, just given that the acquisition from Exxon did include some liquids production. So I guess we're struggling with those numbers as to whether or not you're sandbagging us just based upon some of the other plays that you've got going. So I just want to get a better handle as to what &#x2013; what would we expect to see out of Canada maybe from the standpoint even of an exit rate in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be fair, Greg, you have to keep in mind that there is an underlying decline rate in Western Canada. I've heard all kind of numbers floated around in the industry amongst industry experts, but certainly that underlying decline rate is something in excess of 20%. You can pick a figure but it's in excess of 20%. So our objective frankly is to give you realistic guidance. It is not to either overstate or sandbag and those are two factors you've got to keep in regard. So, yes, there are new projects coming on board that would give an upside. There are some defining acquisitions but it's offsetted by a declined rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks, Asim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you had a question on Liwan. So you said there are a number of factors. But Rob, why don't you take that one as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just Greg, just on Liwan, I mean, clearly there's a number of outstanding issues there, there's the gas sales agreement, there's the development plan to be filed, and then the formal sanction by both partners. Now meanwhile, quite a lot of activity, of course, is moving ahead, including the drilling of some of the development wells, which our partner is also helping to fund.</p>
          <p>So all those things are going to come together this year or early &#x2013; hopefully in the first quarter and that's all being kind of worked towards completion, but you can imagine in the final throes here, whether it's one week or one month or the other, there is a number of moving pieces that have to be brought together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to point out one thing, Greg, in the particular Asian context, compared to what you're used to, I mean, here there are sequential, there are sanctions and work progresses, but out there, there's a more informal relationship and some of the work is progressing even though we have not announced formal sanctions. So it's not as sequential as we are used to seeing it in our environment. It's something to keep in mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just to add to that, the work is still on track for first gas, so nothing is impeding that so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mark Polak of Scotia Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just actually a couple follow-ups on that. I was wondering specifically on the Liwan sales contract negotiations if you could just give us any kind of update or color on that in terms of timing there or are you thinking that's going to be oil-linked prices or a basket of different contracts for those sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I'll answer that one.  I mean, clearly, we're progressing with those decisions. It will be oil-linked pricing, and we would expect to be hoping to close those in the next few months, couple of months as we progress. As we get the details of those, we'll clearly be telling you, Mark, what they are. But sensitive time for negotiations, should be oil-linked and we're not....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful, thank you.  And then just in terms of the &#x2013; now that you've got a number of wells into the Viking, I was wondering if, Rob, you can provide any update on what kind of production rates you're seeing out of those, both at Dodsland and at Redwater?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in general terms, I mean, I won't get too specific, but in general terms, these wells tend to come on. Now they're quite variable, one of the things, and I say they're quite variable and they're very dependent on the completion technology &#x2013; and one of the things &#x2013; one of the steep learning curves in this area is actually the completion technology for the individual formations. But what we've seen is where we bring these on is they tend to come on between 150, 300 barrels a day, even higher. They do decline rapidly in the first month and by the end of the first month, you're often down 40%, 50% of your production and then they stabilize. So...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great and like you said you're still fine tuning I guess the completion there a number of fracs and so on and is that fair assessment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, and we find there's &#x2013; as I said, there's a good learning curve there, and we're seeing better and better results as we go along.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hey, gentlemen. A couple of quick questions. Can you guys share with us that what is the current preliminary CapEx outlook for Liwan and the Indonesian gas project?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're &#x2013; that's something, Paul, that when we announce the formal sanction we'll be bringing together the gas prices, the CapEx <mark type="inaudible" /> so at this point we're still finalizing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe we have given guidance on that or in a position to give guidance on that at this point in terms of disclosure at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I think earlier that you mentioned in some of the legacy field without CapEx the underlying decline curve may be in excess of 20%. So, what is the base decline curve you currently use in your model after the sustainable capital, but before new projects? Are we talking about 5%, 10%, or 7%? Is there any kind of run rate that you can share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paul, I mean it's clearly a difficult question because I think you are putting a number of things together. The 20% to 25% decline rate curve that Asim referenced earlier was a typical Western Canada decline rate curve. And now, I mean there's a sustaining amount of cap level you spend and there is well optimizations we do which do cost capital which allow us to get lower decline rates out of individual curves and a good example is in Lloydminster where we do lots of optimization to mitigate the underlying decline rate of a typical heavy oil well, which is again between 20% and 25%, but by going in, doing optimizations and re-completions we can keep those decline rates at lower level. So, it's a bit of a combination across the portfolio of optimization, et cetera. So, it's hard for me to give you sort of a blanket number or something on some sort of mitigated declining rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can &#x2013; if that's the case, can you give us a number, say, what is the conventional oil and gas in Western Canada and what is in the East Coast and what is in the heavy oil?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have just started the detailed engineering work that started over the Christmas period, like the FEED engineering is complete. So, this is the E in the EPC. So this is the main detailed engineering and that started over the holidays, and so it will be at a relatively low end at the moment. I don't have the precise number, but <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're saying that you already have contracted out $1.5 billion of the contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And that's the contracts for the central plant, which was &#x2013; which went to Sanford Jeddy and that was in that $1 billion range and that's for the complete engineering, procurement, and construction of the central plant and a similar contract for the field facilities and then finally the contracts for the drilling and completion, and we have started drilling the wells at Sunrise now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Is that any risk given the detail engineering is only at the beginning start and we already sort of spend out $1.5 billion of the contract and also that, there seems now in the oil sand industry we started seeing some emergence of the cost inflation pressure, wondering if you guys can share with us what are the initiatives that you are taking there to control the cost in this case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just very briefly, and we pointed this out before, is the contract includes a very high &#x2013; these contracts, the central facilities and field facilities include high elements of fixed price and unit rate components, and unit rate just means that the productivity issue is left with the contractor not with Husky. So, we'll pay for a certain numbers of wells. It's all based on quantities, and again I'll just point out that we did a very thorough job on the front end engineering design so that we had a very good fix on quantities in this plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Two final question, one, Enbridge Pipeline problem, is the impact &#x2013; do you guys continue in February or that this is pretty much back to normal?</p>
          <p>Second one, is there a guidance that you can share with us in terms of the corporate expense per quarter going forward what maybe a normal run rate that we can use? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you answer the Enbridge question, Terrance, and I'll request on that note that we move on because we've got a number of other callers in line. So to be fair to them, if you don't mind, why don't you answer this one first Terrance then we move on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Enbridge has got a remediation program that's in place right now. It's over a period of several weeks, and so those will be relatively minor in nature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from George Toriola of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions. The first is this sort of follows up on the decline question that has been asked before, but I'll ask this differently. So essentially the question is the combination of the acquisition from ExxonMobil and the activity that you are going to take on this year, are you confident that that more than offsets declines on your Western Canadian production base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let &#x2013; well one, the answer to that is, yes, and the second one is, I just &#x2013; we did give out guidance for this year and we feel we're tracking guidance very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Thank you. And then the second one is, just again, it's a bit of an expansion of the earlier comment. Now, just in terms of the ramp up of activity just in the heavy oil business in general, clearly there's inflation on the horizon here. So broadly speaking, what's the strategy here? Are you going to look to contract early? Are you going to look to fix the price contracts? What's the strategy that you are going to deploy in continuing inflation here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good question. I think CapEx efficiency is something we are very focused on. And obviously, I can't really conduct my negotiations on an open line, but the short answer is, we are looking at every one of the items you mentioned. There are different strategies for different projects, but broadly speaking, we are interested in pursuing CapEx spend efficiency aggressively. We've got our senior level of works team, that in fact I've got a meeting with my senior management planned tomorrow as part of an ongoing process on this very subject.</p>
          <p>And broadly, I think if you look at CapEx, I think there are few standard principles that go across industries. There are some basic principles of purchasing; it's &#x2013; there are principles of aggregation, there are principles of competition, there are principles of risk management through combination of fixed price and unit price, and we are deploying all of them, okay. So in a nutshell, this is a high priority project for us, a high priority area of focus for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I've got a two-part question on Mizzen, off the East Coast. I understand that Statoil hasn't released anything on the discovery, but can you talk us through the appraisal program for the next couple of years and if there is any regulatory issues that we need to concern ourselves with?</p>
          <p>And the second part of that relates to geography. Given that it's 500 kilometers offshore, would have any thoughts on how that ultimately gets developed assuming it's even big enough? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and now just quickly on Mizzen I mean the appraisal program is that we're going to drill a well or the plan is to drill a well in later this year for Mizzen.  And this will be delineation well for Mizzen after the original discovery of course.  We are awarded the discovery license last year it's, it was the largest SDL ever awarded in Newfoundland.  I mean clearly we wouldn't be moving forward if we weren't &#x2013; both Statoil and ourselves, if we weren't feeling that this project would be commercial if we get the results we're expecting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking the question.  My question regards your guidance around CapEx, looking for just under $4.5 billion in the Upstream; can you give any update on the Downstream with respect to Toledo and whatever guidance you have around the Midstream for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Toledo repositioning project is currently well advanced and well underway.  And it's basically progressing in accordance with what we're expecting that to be this year.  With respect to other elements, the majority of the work that's going on in our Midstream and Downstream areas is associated with ongoing maintenance and sustainable activities and that forms the fundamental basis for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to refresh your memory on what I said at the Investor Day to position the various parts of our business in context.  And the first point I'd like to make is that we do not see ourselves as an integrated company in the conventional sense of the term but our midstream and downstream assets exist to support those specialized areas of the upstream which requires specialized support namely the fact that we are in heavy oil and the fact that we are in, are going to be in Oil Sands require certain specialized capabilities.</p>
          <p>The second point I'd like to make is in terms of that the investments that were made we are basically in the near term concentrating on high return projects to keep the optionality of the upgrading alive at the right timing.  And in the context of this immediate five year timeframe, we do not &#x2013; we have enough capacity actually to handle Phase &#x2013; a material part of Phase I of Sunrise.  So, those are two factors I'd like you to keep in mind to understand the picture going forward in the five year timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  So, just to be more specific then in between the Downstream and the Midstream what's your expected CapEx for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The expected CapEx for Mid and Downstream is just under $500 million for 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then so that takes you to a total around $5 billion.  Can you just bridge that between...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, sorry, over $5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About $4.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$4.8 million including the acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, so the $4.8 million, can you just bridge how you're going to get to that between where you expect the cash flow from operations to be in any kind of asset sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as we laid out in our Investor Conference in December, we've developed fairly comprehensive financial plan and that's going to be a combination of cash flow from operations and some hybrid type of financier type issues, some asset sales as we announced in the first quarter, we did some asset sales, some potential value acceleration projects and joint ventures on some of our project.  And as you know we did the $1 billion equity offering in December and where we, subject to shareholder approval at the end of this month, allowing the shareholders to take stock instead of cash as a dividend, so as to reduce our cash outflow from a dividend perspective and we do have the support of our principal shareholders in respect of just over 70% of that, of the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think in, when you take all of this various initiatives in some combination or the other, we have &#x2013; we're in a comfortable position in terms of funding the capital and staying well within our debt servicing covenants.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen.  Two questions. First, just wondering if you can talk to what you might expect for current taxes in 2011, is it &#x2013; should we still be thinking about this in terms of sort of one year lag with your operating results?  And secondly on McMullen, you just maybe provide an update on what you're thinking is there in terms of a thermal project and I noticed you mentioned an air injection pilot there, can you just talk to what that might look like?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The tax one, yes, Mike, we still have that one year lag for cash taxes.  So if you look to 2010, that will tell you what our 2011 cash taxes are going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>On McMullen, Rob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On McMullen, this is an interesting lease, where we think &#x2013; which we believe has a lot of potential and we're doing a number of different things on it.  Since we acquired the lease we actually have been building up cold production from the lease because in this lease the bitumen is just about able to flow.  And we're looking to get production up into the 4,000 barrel a day range in this year on the cold production front.</p>
          <p>We've also got approval and are going to do a, as you noted, a gas over bitumen sort of ignite the gas pilot, that's a fairly small pilot, a couple of wells and we're looking for that to commence in the field sort of in the middle of this year.  There's also the potential for a conventional SAGD thermal project on the lease.  Now the reason for the different development schemes on different parts of the lease is the geology is a little different as you move across the lease.  But so again we see a lot of potential from that lease.  We think it can be very material and the work we're doing right now is just to understand the best production mechanism from each type of geology we see on the lease.</p>

          <p>Hi guys, just looking for a little more color on the balance sheet, can you give us a sense now, following the close of the acquisition, where your bank facility borrowings stand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Harry, it's Alister here, we're currently sitting on, the total debt after the close of the acquisitions is about $4.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I know you ran through some of your funding options in response to an earlier question but what are your current thoughts on tapping the capital markets for some senior unsecured debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've laid out the options we have, I'm not going to sort of indicate to the markets when I may or may not be coming but, if you look at the options I laid out you can just figure at some point over the next 80 months, we'll be tapping the markets.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question from Carrie Tait of The Globe and Mail.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my call.  I just sort of wondering if you can explain a little bit more on how Enbridge's pipeline is affecting you and when you expect to have that cleared up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carrie, it's Terrance here.  The Enbridge situation is complicated by the fact that it's a multi-stage remediation process.  In terms of actual details of what Enbridge is going to be doing for 6B it's probably best that you addressed that with them, but I think it's fair to say that we believe that they have it well in hand at this juncture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; sorry.  Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carrie, after that, very briefly, you have to remember that we have probably one of the more comprehensive pipeline &#x2013; access on more comprehensive pipeline networks of any oil company in Canada.  It's one of our core strengths and the fact that we have access to Keystone is helping us remediate some of these issues.  So in Alister's spiel earlier today, he spoke about the fact that we had an inventory build on the Keystone pipeline fill and that was part of our remediation activity. So because of Enbridge, our production is not being shut-in and upstream results are not being affected as a result &#x2013; because of that optionality that we have, as we are going to put that in perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you still have capacity? It's not as though you're going to get to a point where you're maxed out because of Keystone, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all I have, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a simple answer to a complex question. You have to lay out what could happen to Enbridge. But in the context of what we know today, we are not maxed out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you didn't had Keystone, would you hit up a storage capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Carrie, I think that you are picking up a point, which is actually quite material and that is that Keystone did have an impact, a beneficial impact for the entire industry in the timing of Keystone line fill and Keystone operation, because for two it is given what happen on Enbridge.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Justin Amoah of Argus Media. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just going back to your last comment, does that mean that Husky is a committed shipper on the Keystone pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Justin, thanks for the question. One of the things we do have to be mindful of is we have indicated Husky has been shipping barrels on Keystone, but the actual contractual arrangements on that pipe aren't publicly released.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I had a question about Lima, you mentioned earlier a stage repositioning approach pending light-heavy differentials. Can you just elaborate about what that means exactly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Lima reconfiguration is something that has been evaluated on a continuous or ongoing basis. Given what we see right now, those evaluations have not suggested that we proceed expeditiously without reconfiguration at this time. But it is absolutely dependent upon what we see on the differentials going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Rob Peabody. I'll just add one point and that's that clearly we have a little bit of time here from a Husky point of view, because Sunrise Phase I is really essentially handled by Toledo as it's currently configured. So as we look at sort of the timing of these investment, it's really again driven by upstream and production volumes and potential places we can get this stuff from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we summarized earlier, that is envisioned as a 25-year project. So I don't think you can take the linkages in our downstream versus our upstream on a quarter-by-quarter or for that matter, even a three-year by three-year basis. This is the grand strategic plan looking at a 25-year timeframe in terms of its integration, just putting that in perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the repositioning would entail processing more heavy crude if you were to do that, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question was besides the ISO cracker work at Toledo, is there any other plant turnaround work at that facility this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to put in perspective, there will be some minor turnaround activity that will be going on at that plant, but Husky is not the operator. And those will probably be best....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking Toledo or Lima?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Toledo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that would be probably best addressed through BP.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I'll just summarize. Basically, we've given you a big picture look at the actions we've taken over the past year. We outlined our strategy in December. We've outlined the immediate steps we have achieved, and I think that would have provided you with an early examples of our ability to execute. As we go forward going into 2011, what we see is we are reasonably confident about executing further steps on those plans and build on the momentum, the early momentum we've achieved so far. Thank you for joining us.</p>
