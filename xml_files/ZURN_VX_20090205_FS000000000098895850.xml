          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Zurich's 2008 Full Year Results Reporting. First the normal housekeeping. Could I ask you, if you have telephones to switch them off. And secondly, I would refer you, draw your attention to slide two, which is a disclaimer cautionary statement.</p>
          <p>The agenda for today includes presentations by CEO, Jim Schiro and the CFO, Dieter Wemmer. But we also have short presentations where members of the Group Executive will give short 2009 outlooks. Jim will introduce each of these people later.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I would hand you over to Jim. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Good morning, and thank you for joining us Zurich's full year results announcement. 2008 was clearly an historic year and it should be no surprise that Zurich's financial results were impacted by the ongoing financial crisis. But I am pleased by our performance during this period of adversity and proud of the 60,000 people worldwide that made it happen.</p>
          <p>Our net income topped $3 billion, our business operating profit after tax, return on equity exceeded our mid range target of 16%, and our return on shareholders' equity stood at more than respectable 12%. In other words, when you look at these results in the context of today's environment our strategy is working.</p>
          <p>Six years ago, amidst our own financial crisis, we established a very clear and simple direction. Through financial discipline and operational excellence, we would reestablish our credibility, and reset our course as a leading global insurer.</p>
          <p>As those objectives have becoming engrained in our culture, we expanded their application to profitable growth. Systematically pursuing customer, product and distribution strategies that built on our strengths and gave us focus to our market efforts.</p>
          <p>To support these capabilities we committed to attracting, developing and motivating the most dynamic workforce in this sector and then launched a successful global brand strategy that now delivers some of the highest consideration and visibility results Zurich has ever enjoyed.</p>
          <p>Throughout this evolution, we paid risk the respect it deserves and developed a robust enterprise-wide approach to risk management that serves as the foundation of all our decision making processes.</p>
          <p>Today, more than ever, that strategy is constantly being tested. With the result being a significantly enhanced competitive position for Zurich in the global marketplace.</p>
          <p>Our roughly $185 billion investment portfolio generated a positive 1% total return in 2008 demonstrating the value of our investment philosophy. Each of our three segments posted impressive profitable growth, with General Insurance showing encouraging signs of sustainable growth, Global Life overcoming the unsettled customer base to meets its double-digit APE targets and Farmers outpacing its peers with strong profitable growth.</p>
          <p>The Zurich Way exceeded its $800 million target for 2008, setting the stage for an increase in expansion of the targets over the next three years, as well as an even deeper transformation program in the years to come, and furthermore, our ability to generate and integrate acquisitions and to these efficient operating platforms is creating significant value. As the 15 transactions announced over the past two years, serve as both sources of new knowledge that we infuse into the rest of the group and as platforms on which to extend our Zurich Way proven processes.</p>
          <p>Thanks to these accomplishments, we're able to maintain our capital management strategy. With the Board recommending an CHF11 dividend at our Annual General Meeting in April representing a strong 47% payout rate.</p>
          <p>Underpinning all of these achievements though is a solid balance sheet as reflected in our Solvency 1 ratio of 153%. That is why we've instituted such a deep rooted cultural obsession with execution capability and financial discipline.</p>
          <p>And is why in these uncertain in volatile times, we will leverage those capabilities even further to double our previously announced expense reductions for 2009 to $400 million.</p>
          <p>We must react to the times we're in and we will continue to do so throughout the year as the economy continues to disintegrate or as the economy continues to produce. We cannot predict the future, but we must be prepared for it. And for us that means controlling those elements of our destiny that we influence and control, and most importantly it's our cost base.</p>
          <p>By taking such responsible actions, we will use all the tools available to us to maintain the balance sheet strength, which is so critical in these turbulent times. This is not the time for us to retrench, nor is it the time to limit your options or to make premature decisions. It is a time of opportunity. And we plan to maintain the capabilities, financial and otherwise that will allow us to make the most of these opportunities from our position of strength.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2009, we see the global recession continuing to put severe pressures on the global economic environment. Remember, when you look at this recession unlike others, it has been led by the financial sector, and now is being followed by the manufacturing and industrial sectors.</p>
          <p>We expect that declining assets prices, low interest levels, and ongoing strains on financial assets and investment returns to continue through 2009, with conditions only starting to really improve markedly in mid 2010.</p>
          <p>That is what we are planning for. If conditions get better, we will be able to react to it. But we are in a position to deal with these conditions and continue to drive the results of this organization.</p>
          <p>The direct impact of the recession on insurance markets is likely to me mixed. With our life insurance customers shifting product preferences and constrained economic activity affecting General Insurance purchasing on the margins.</p>
          <p>The real impact of the recession on insurers though will likely be a deeper appreciation of the cost of risk, leading to a more consistent rate adequacy across our businesses. Our priority then will be to stay focused on taking the actions necessary to best position us for these dynamic markets and capitalize them.</p>
          <p>In General Insurance that means driving down our cost base and capturing the appropriate price for the risks we take. If we cannot get the appropriate price for the risk in the marketplace, we will not write the business. I have said that in good times, and it is extremely important in times like this.</p>
          <p>In Life that means delivering the right product mix through the right distribution channels to anticipate customer needs, and at Farmers that means maintaining a steady growth trajectory while keeping cost down and achieving adequate rates.</p>
          <p>All that said, let me assure you we're not na&#xEF;ve. These are not easy markets to navigate, nor are we immune for uncontrollable market forces. But we entered 2009 from a position of strength. Our capital base is solid. Our global portfolio of businesses are benefiting from years of operational strengthening. Our approach to risk remains disciplined and acutely aware and our competitive position stand significantly enhanced, thanks to a growing brand presence and a talented workforce.</p>
          <p>That is why I am pleased by these results. And I'm proud of our people as they demonstrate our ability to stay focused through arguably the most destructive financial market we have ever faced in any of our careers.</p>
          <p>It is also why I remain confident in our ability to turn adversity into opportunity. To keep our powder dry, to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves to us and to emerge from this period of market disruption as a true global leader.</p>
          <p>With that, let me take this opportunity to walk you through this morning's structure. As it is traditional, Dieter will start with a deep dive into the financial details of our 2008 results. However, recognizing that our 2009 plans to you and to us are as important as our 2008 achievements I will then ask Martin Senn [Chief Investment Officer] to comment on our approach to risks. Followed by John Amore, who leads our General Insurance investment -- General Insurance business. Mario Greco who leads our Life business and Paul Hopkins who leads our Farmers business, to provide brief comments on their outlooks, the priorities we've agreed that they will face in the markets going forward to help us deliver what you expect from us.</p>
          <p>Thank you again for joining us this morning. I am sure there are a lot of questions on your minds. We'll attempt to answer them in the presentations and then we'll have ample time to take your question following. Thank you. Dieter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you, Jim and good morning ladies and gentleman. First, let me start with a thank you to my colleagues in Finance in particular who made it possible that we can present today a fully audited statement and all disclosures a week earlier than last year.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to announce a business operating profit of $1 billion for the fourth quarter in a difficult market, contributing to a total business operating profit of 5.2 billion for the year and a 16.8% BOP after tax RoE.</p>
          <p>In our core operations where our actions over the last few years have been to build resilient business models capable of performing well in all environments, so the results remain strong. But this has clearly been another quarter affected by the turbulence in capital markets in which we have less ability to influence the effect on us in the short term.</p>
          <p>In particular, the General asset revaluation has materially affected the quarter's business operating profit, net income and closing shareholder equity. As a result, net income after tax amounted to positive $205 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, profit was contributed to by all operating segments, which can be seen on the business operating profit summary slide, page seven. The overall core business show an 8% reduction in business operating profit. As you can see, most of the overall decline of the 23% was in Other business, which suffered from a number of charges in both, in the third and fourth quarters, generated by the weakness of the capital markets. I would like to show how the market volatility has affected the individual business operating profits in a bit more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Although, most investment movements do not affect business operating profit, the fall in capital markets has affected the operating results in a number of ways. First, the slide shows that although there is a significant effect in the fourth quarter these losses have been developing through the year.</p>
          <p>Mark-to-market revaluations of 333 million on hedge funds created a performance shortfall compared to the previous periods and have affected the results in General Insurance, Global Life and other business.</p>
          <p>In addition, in Global Life, there has been a full year effect from acceleration of deferred acquisition costs and other amortization of about 111 million, provisions for guarantees of $65 million and a reduction in fee income of 90 million arising from lower managed asset base.</p>
          <p>In other business, the operating result has been particularly affected by performance shortfalls on hedge funds and private equities of 181 million, losses on bonds held in Centre of $230 million. These are designated as fair value through profit and loss where cash flows match corresponding Life Insurance reserves. And on an increase of 440 million in one-off of life reserves which are sensitive to equity markets and interest rates.</p>
          <p>I will now go through the details by segment of the operating results starting with the top line on slide nine.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter added to the consistent and continued growth development quarter-by-quarter over the last years. We are pleased not only with the level of growth, but also that we achieved it in the areas we laid out in our strategic targets.</p>
          <p>Gross written premium increased for General Insurance by 2% in local currency. This growth is in line with our strategic direction and mainly comes out of our European General Insurance business and international businesses, which grew by seven and 10% respectively, always expressed in local currency.</p>
          <p>In Europe, more than half of the growth came through recent acquisitions in Russia, Turkey, Germany and Spain. Also Italy contributed with 12% growth in local currency driven by new business through our successful expansion of our tied agent network. Germany also outgrew the market delivering growth just under 5%, while UK and Switzerland grew modestly.</p>
          <p>Global Corporate increased its volume in Europe by 7% through a higher flow of new business, demonstrating our brand quality in this segment. Volumes for North America Commercial and Global Corporate in North America decreased by three, and 10% respectively. This was largely driven by the price pressures seen in the market, both through rate reductions and loss of business where customers chose not to renew when we held firm on our required technical rates.</p>
          <p>In addition our North American units were also impacted by the difficult US markets where premium growth was inhibited by the economic downturn, examples include lower demand from segments like car dealership or construction industry both reducing the demand for insurance.</p>
          <p>However, through its market basket approach, North America Commercial has achieved growth in profitable baskets, gross written premium in these targeted growth baskets increased by 5% while all other baskets decreased 7%.</p>
          <p>Outside Europe and North America we saw significant growth in international businesses, which grew by over 10% in local currency and Global Corporate in Asia and Pacific nearly doubled volume in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Global Life new business, new business grew by 10% in local currency a good result in challenging financial markets. The newly acquired business in Spain and Italy added 236 million APE to the gross.</p>
          <p>Farmers Management Services remained on track, with growth in fees of 8%. This is in line with the still good levels of premium growth at the exchanges of 6%. Gross written premium in other business has increased, as the All Lines Quota Share Reinsurance Treaty with the exchanges has already reported at the nine months was increased from five to 25%.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to look at the General Insurance segment in more detail on slide 10, with the rate change monitor.</p>
          <p>I am happy to report that on average our General Insurance renewal rates have increased by plus 1% in the fourth quarter, compared to an average of minus two in the preceding three quarters. This still leaves us with a year-on-year rate reduction of 1%, but with good news coming out of the January renewals.</p>
          <p>Encouraging are the improvements seen in those units most under pressure, North America Commercial and Global Corporate. Global Corporate rates even show a small increase of plus 0.4% for the last three months of the year. North America Commercial is still not experiencing positive rate changes on a quarterly basis, rate reductions have, however, slowed to below 1% in fourth quarter standalone. The remaining two business divisions, Europe General Insurance and International Business, both support positive discrete fourth quarter and full year rate changes. And at 12 months these were one and 5% respectively.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have seen significant improvement in the rate environment in the fourth quarter and indications that this will continue.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to page 11 to dive into our General Insurance key performance indicators. As mentioned earlier, General Insurance business operating profit has been negatively affected by hedge fund shortfalls. The deterioration in the underwriting result is partially offset by higher investment income, due to higher asset base and lower non-technical expenses.</p>
          <p>The underwriting losses are driven out of the US, with both North America Commercial and Global Corporate in the US experiencing higher catastrophic and large losses compared to 2007, which is apparent if looking at the graph of the combined ratios, the overall General Insurance combined ratio deteriorated by 2.5 percentage points to 98.1 driven by both claims and expenses.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we can explore the expense ratios in more detail on slide 12. Total net technical expenses for General Insurance increased by 6% or 3% in local currency, compared to the year before. This drove up the expense ratio by 0.4 percentage points to 25.5% for the full year. The impact from increases is in commission ratio, mentioned earlier in the year is still there.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to drive changes in business mix, as we focus on writing more profitable business. These efforts lead to an increase of the commission ratio of 0.6 percentage points.</p>
          <p>On the internal expenses, we have absorbed 0.2 percentage points of incremental investments in Zurich Way and operational transformation initiatives in our expense ratio compared to last year.</p>
          <p>In spite of this, we have a 0.4 percentage point improvement, the improvement is driven by benefits of earlier operational transformation activities and the exercise of cost discipline, as well as some technical movements such as premium rate reductions. For example, we have reduced employees by over 600 in the US, more than 900 in the UK, and over 200 in each Germany and Russia. This means that year-on-year, we have lowered the number of full time employees by over 2%, while at the same time we are writing 2% more business.</p>
          <p>Thus the ratio of premium to employees has increased by close to 5% expressed in local currency, which supports the statement that our drive for operational excellence is paying off. A further 0.2 percentage points can be attributed to our acquisitions in Russia and Turkey, with these units running at a significantly higher than average expense ratios.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a more detailed look at the loss ratio, slide 13. The reported loss ratio for General Insurance is up by 2.1 percentage points year-on-year. This is driven by a number of items. Deteriorating rates in some markets and claims inflation impacting the underlying loss ratio, as well as an increase in large and catastrophic losses compared to 2007. This is partially offset by Zurich Way initiatives and higher prior year reserve one-off gains.</p>
          <p>Catastrophic losses although there has been a lot of attention drawn to the 2008 US hurricanes, are lower compared to last year when Europe was hit by wind storms and floods. On the other hand large losses of which many are weather related are significantly higher compared to 2007. Combined catastrophic and large losses increases resulted in a deterioration of 0.4 percentage points on the loss ratio year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Looking at prior year development, the first point I would like make is that the level of preserving conservatism remains unchanged. The net release consists of a large number of individual movements, identified in our quarterly actuarial review process. Individually these are normally not significant from a group level, but a couple of reserve adjustments are worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>Firstly the term premiums relating to loss sensitive business in Global Corporate North America. These prior year premium refunds result in a worsening of 0.6 percentage point on the 2008 General Insurance loss ratio, the same as in 2007.</p>
          <p>Secondly we have made a detailed actuarial review of US worker's compensation business in North America Commercial and Global Corporate in North America. This has resulted in a reserve strengthening for Global Corporate and the release of reserves for North America Commercial.</p>
          <p>On a group level this had almost zero, or has limited impact, but affected the prior year development for Global Corporate in the fourth quarter along with the premium adjustment just explained, it gives an 8 percentage point impact on the Global Corporate combined ratio.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we regularly review asbestosis reserves in the UK, increased reserves through the year by &#xA3;159 million. The underlying loss ratio thus has deteriorated by 2.3 percentage points year-on-year. The main drivers of this are claims inflation and rate decreases earning through. However, holding the loss ratio over from 2007 into 2008, we would expect an impact of three to four percentage points due to these factors. The difference between this figure and actual outcomes is a direct result of our Zurich Way initiatives.</p>
          <p>With that, it's time to look at our Global Life results. As I mentioned before, the annual premium equivalent growth improvement to 10% reflects the diversity of the Global Life business with a number of European and emerging markets offsetting the challenges in our Hong Kong and US Life business.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the growth was also supported by local currency growth in Germany of 13%, Switzerland at seven and the UK growing 2% in a very difficult market.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the progress to integrate our acquisitions in Spain with a full fourth quarter of production exceeding our internal forecasts in both operations contributing $226 million of new business to the year end results.</p>
          <p>With the continued growth in our Protection business we saw Corporate Life protection sales increasing 134% and Individual Life protection sales increasing 10% in local currency. This growth was primarily driven by our Zurich International Solutions and Latin American businesses.</p>
          <p>The new business margin overall remained well in our target range and improving since Q3 from 22.4 to 23.1% at year ends. New business value increased to $752 million, up from 729 million in the same period last year, which translates into a 3% growth in local currency.</p>
          <p>This was driven by the pension growth in Germany and growth in Spain partially offset by lower values in the US and reduced margins in the UK, Honk Kong, Spain and Ireland.</p>
          <p>Business operating profits of $1.5 million increased by 3% in dollar terms and 1% in local currency.</p>
          <p>In Q4 the result was adversely affected by the ongoing weakness in the investment markets and the appreciation of the US dollar against sterling and the euro. Over the full year the operating result benefited from a number of one-off items. These include improvement in the UK from transactions to reduce exposure to non-core annuities, unlocking of deferred acquisition costs in the US.  In total, one-off effects largely netted out over the year including those related to the investment markets.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to the next page, we see more details on the Global Life new business.</p>
          <p>During 2008, a global approach to the management of new business was implemented through the introduction of three global distribution pillars, Bancassurance, IFA/ Brokers and Tied agents, and three global proposition pillars, Corporate Life, International / Expats and Private Banking Clients.</p>
          <p>Further distribution was driven by direct and central initiatives which include sales of new business outside of the three global distribution pillars and include initiatives related to our focus on enforce management such as re-investments of maturing business.</p>
          <p>This resulted in sales of 335 million during the year mainly in the UK. Bancassurance distribution was the main growth driver principally from the acquisitions in Spain. In addition, in Spain further growth was fueled by new a product launch in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And in Germany, we saw higher sales of Unit Link Pensions during the year. The Corporate Life pillar also increased driven by growth in the International Group protection business of Zurich International Solutions and in Ireland through further increase in market share and the Group Pension business.</p>
          <p>The IFA/Broker pillar decreased with sales in the UK reduced as a result of legislative changes, impacting Unit-Linked bonds and of course, the financial crisis. These effects were partially offset by growth in Unit-Linked sales in Germany, whereas the broker channel increased its overall new business by 42% in local currency, now representing 25% of the new business distribution in Germany.</p>
          <p>In both our Tied agents and International / Expats pillars, we saw reductions.  While sales in many territories proved resilient to the developing financial crisis during 2008, our Hong Kong business both domestic and the International/Expat business were impacted by the market conditions which reduced consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>In the US the Farmers Protection new business sales declined impacted by lower consumer discretionary spending in our targeted middle markets.</p>
          <p>Now turning to page 16, to analyze our embedded value results. We continue to calculate our embedded value on a market consistent base. Because of market disruption, we have used volatilities based on an average over the last 12 months, which we feel better reflect a coherent market. We have made no other methodology changes.  This year for the first time the embedded value statement has been audited.</p>
          <p>Embedded value operating profits grew by 5% to 2 billion representing a return on embedded value of 12.5%. This was driven by the continued growth in new business value and supported by a resilient operating performance that created 283 million of additional value for shareholders. The economic variance of $3.6 billion was driven by three main factors.</p>
          <p>45% could be attributed to the impact of reduced asset values. 40% was due to the impact of reduction in yield curves and equity levels on certainty equivalent liability cash flows. And the remaining 50% arose from the impact of increases in volatility.</p>
          <p>In addition, foreign currency translation effects further reduced embedded value by 1.6 billion mainly because of the decline of the sterling against the dollar.</p>
          <p>Now turning to page 17 and to Farmers Management Services results. The gross management result has increased by 8%, reflecting the continued good levels of underlying premium growth at the exchanges, to which I will come in the moment.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight that the margin on gross earned premiums remained resilient at 6.9% showing even an increase of 10 basis points over last year. Looking at the business operating profit, at the bottom of the slide, it decreased by 5% to $1.2 billion driven by two factors as already discussed in previous presentations.</p>
          <p>Firstly, investment income decreased by $83 million, largely as a result of higher dividends and cash transfers to the Group. Secondly, last year included $47 million more gains on the sale of operating properties than 2008.</p>
          <p>With that let's move to the performance of the Farmers Exchanges, page number 18. The Farmers Exchanges, which we manage but do not own, have maintained their strong track record from 2006 and 2007. They continued the transfer small business portfolio from North America Commercial, started in June 2008 which added 377 million in premium or 2.3%.</p>
          <p>The exchanges delivered overall 5.7% of premium growth in 2008. Three percentage points of this growth came from owning Bristol West for full year, versus 6 months in 2007. The exchanges withstood the challenging and declining market conditions and outperformed the industry once more.</p>
          <p>Excluding acquisitions, organic growth was positive at 0.3%, which was favorable compared with the market. This growth was driven by rate increases and renewed activity and the east coast independent agent channel. Here premiums grew 8% as a result of agency appointments and the introduction of new auto products.</p>
          <p>As already reported, the integration of Bristol West has been completed successfully and their premiums continue to grow. Bristol West's top line grew by 157 million or 25% for the 12 months 2008 versus 2007, strongly ahead of non-standard competitors.</p>
          <p>The adjusted combined ratio is at 98.4%, up 6.1 percentage points. 5.1 points of that increase are due to higher cat charges year-over-year, with hurricanes Ike and Gustav in the third quarter contributing most. The remainder of the combined ratio increase was driven by increasing loss trends in home owners and auto.</p>
          <p>The Exchanges have continued to file rate increases since the beginning of 2007. I would also like to highlight that the quarterly adjusted combined ratio in the fourth quarter standalone amounted to 89.9%. In 2008, the Exchanges led the market, taking rate increases of 8.1% in auto and 6.1 in home owners.</p>
          <p>Net surplus decreased as a result of the higher cat losses and the statutory treatment of equity and debt investments and the transfer of the small business book from Zurich North America.</p>
          <p>Taking account of the increased quota share to which I referred earlier, the surplus ratio was 36.1%; a level we still consider to be solid and well within the historical range.</p>
          <p>Turning now to look at the performance of other business and corporate functions, slide 19. The Farmers Re result remained strong but was affected by changes in the proportion of the quota share but also by the higher combined ratio in the Farmers' portfolio I have just mentioned.</p>
          <p>In 2007 both, Centre and Other benefited from a strong economic environment, generating good investment returns, and high commutation gains. However, this trend was reversed in 2008.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, Centre and Other were affected by financial market driven adjustments of approximately $500 million being charged through P&amp;L to operating profit. In addition, they have experienced much less commutation activity in 2008 compared with last year.  Finally, we strengthened Life reserves which are sensitive to equities and to interest rates in the Other category. The fourth quarter for the Other business segment ended slightly worse than my forecast made at the last result presentation. Improvement in corporate function includes lower headquarter expenses, another good example of our focus on expense control.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the performance of Group investments, slide 20. Net investment income increased by 2% in dollar terms, but it is down 1% in local currency. This decrease was largely driven by lower average invested assets, mostly as a result of the transfer of the UK annuities and payment block of about $7 billion to Swiss Re in summer 2007.</p>
          <p>Net capital losses through P&amp;L were $2.9 billion of which 2 billion were for shareholders, a reduction I will give more detail around in just a minute. In the twelve months 2008, total net investment return, which includes changes in unrealized losses of $3.9 billion, was a positive 1% an excellent result in the worst financial markets for decades.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you of some key points of Zurich's disciplined investment approach. You can find further details in the appendix as usual. As emphasized, we continue to be very comfortable with the quality of our investments and asset allocation. Our equity exposure is well controlled and amounts to 3.3% at the end of December, taking into account our hedging programs which protect about 10% of our equity exposure. We did not renew those hedges expiring in December and reduced gross exposure accordingly.</p>
          <p>Looking at the ageing of our unrealized equity losses in the light of our impairment policy, in the very hypothetical case that all equity prices were frozen at December 31 2008 position, we would expect further impacts on equities to reduce net income by less than $100 million in each the first and second quarter 2009 understood after policyholder-shareholder split and taxes. The credit quality of our debt portfolio remains strong.</p>
          <p>With that, let me comment on the capital losses in Profit and Loss on slide 21. Given that capital losses continue to be such an important driver we have updated the slides added in the last quarter which analyzed capital losses and impairments by quarter and asset class.</p>
          <p>Net capital losses through profit and loss were a negative $2.9 billion for the 12 months, including losses of 1.1 billion in the last quarter from the turbulent financial markets. Within this amount, impairments, growth of policyholder allocation and hedging added about 800 million in the fourth quarter, bonds added about 100 million. The gross $700 million impact on equities are translate to roughly the 350 million forecast net of tax and policyholder allocation and hedges I gave you at the nine months reported for Q4.</p>
          <p>Mark-to-mark adjustments on trading assets and fair values through profit and loss assets also contributed to the total, particularly on hedge funds. These reductions were partially offset by gains on equity hedges. In total for the 12 months, the gross $2.9 billion capital losses impacted shareholders after policyholder allocation and tax by 2 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the slide on unrealized losses in the shareholders' equity. Unrealized losses included in shareholders' equity for the 12 months increased by 3.9 billion, although as we will see, only 3.2 billion were for shareholders. Unrealized losses decreased in the fourth quarter by 1.6 billion overall, while unrealized losses on available for sale equities increased by less than 100 million as a result of the stressed markets.</p>
          <p>Losses in value on debt securities decreased strongly by 1.6 billion. This was driven by lower yields on government bonds, which increased their market value. I would also like to mention here that the fair value of our held to maturity bonds and loans is about 1 billion higher than their book value.</p>
          <p>With that, let me comment on the movements on shareholders' equity on page 23. Shareholders equity at $22.1 billion is down 24% on the restated 2007 yearend closing number. Net income attributed to shareholders of just over $3 billion was net of an effective tax rate of 19%, which benefited from various tax settlements and recognition of operating losses.</p>
          <p>In addition to paying the dividend, we bought back a total of 3.8 million shares at a cost of $1.45 billion. The $3.2 billion of adverse movement in unrealized investment losses represents the $3.9, which I mentioned in the previous investment slides but here net of tax, policyholder and other allocations.</p>
          <p>Translation adjustments, primarily as a result of European currencies weakening against the US dollar since the half year reduced equity by another 2.7 billion. The actuarial loss on pension plans increased largely from the fall in equities within the funds.</p>
          <p>With that, let's have a look at our capital position on slide 24. Our statutory solvency level before dividends at 164% is at a similar level to that estimated at the end of October. However, the weakening of equities and the reduction in interest rates in particular in the fourth quarter had a stronger effect on our internal economic solvency model.</p>
          <p>The solvency levels shown here includes the proposed dividends. You can see that on a statutory level, shown along the bottom of the slide, the position remains strong at 153% after dividend and all investments market-at-market value.</p>
          <p>On the main graph, you can see that our internal AA risk-base capital number for 2009 is below 100% after accounting for dividends and our expected 2009 further capital consumption. And I emphasize that it does not take into account of any expected 2009 earnings.</p>
          <p>Why did, or what did produce our RBC ratio? The risk-base capital and the available financial resources were updated for all assumptions to reflect our 2009 expectations, i.e. dividend paid in 2009 and growth in risk taking in insurance and financial risks.</p>
          <p>The available financial resources to support risk reduced firstly as a result of the reduction in our IFRS equity of 6 billion, additionally it was affected because of lower interest rates at yearend. This affected the value in force of the life book by three billion, and the discounting effect of four billion on the General Insurance reserves which shrunk in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>With some positive other movements, this resulted in a $12 billion reduction. The risk-based capital reduced by two billion, are the results of lower interest rates and exchange rates, partially offset by an increase due to portfolio growth including acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Let me make two principal statements around risk-based capital models. First of all, risk-based capital models are not a GPS system. It is an important component of the framework for risk taking, but it is not a substitute for sound management decisions. Many mistakes have been made recently in the financial sector, by using such models on autopilot.</p>
          <p>Secondly, by nature these models support post cyclical behavior, i.e. they tend to underestimate risk in a positive environment and overestimate risk in times like this. We are confident that our balance sheet supports the risk taking of our business and our growth ambitions.</p>
          <p>Further, we feel comfortable to continue our disciplined investment management, as Martin will explain to you later. However, we will continue to look at sensible ways we can be more efficient in the use of our capital. As further indication of our confidence, the proposed dividend, which I'll come to on the next slide, slide 25.</p>
          <p>We have proposed a dividend of CHF11. We do not set dividend on a payout ratio or yield. But in either measure we believe this is a highly competitive dividend. Our balance sheet has been built on prudent capital management. And prudence has to some extent to be measured relative to the economic environment and outlook.</p>
          <p>Our intention is to pay a dividend, which is sustainable over the medium-term and which therefore reflects our confidence in sustainable earnings and our expectation for future growth opportunities. We will continue to run our capital management on these principles and look forward to being in a strong position to be able to take advantage of any economic upturns as they arise.</p>
          <p>Now, let me summarize. 2008 continued the track record of strong operating performance, despite being affected by the financial markets we still exceeded our 16% BOP after tax RoE target. We have preserved our balance sheet strength to enable us to continue the journey of profitable growth and operational excellence.</p>
          <p>We have achieved growth in those areas where we wanted to grow, and integrating our acquisition well. The increased Zurich rate targets and our focus on additional expense reductions of at least $400 million for 2009 will support delivery of our targets.</p>
          <p>For the market outlook, I'm now handing over to Martin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Dieter. Good morning, ladies and gentleman. It's a great pleasure to meet you here today in London. As you all know, last year was an exceptional year, characterized by massive and unprecedented turbulence across global markets. And despite these most difficult conditions Zurich and investment management managed to generate a total investment return of 1%. I must tell you that we are very proud of this.</p>
          <p>It is the result of our clear investment philosophy, our structured and disciplined investment process, and we see this result as well as proof that our investment approach works.</p>
          <p>Our mission is to achieve superior risk adjusted returns relative to liabilities, and we will not change this approach going forward. We continue to be disciplined on the risks we take and manage our assets relative to liabilities.</p>
          <p>An example is the fact that we have maintained long bond portfolio during last summer, you remember this was a time when inflation was hitting headline news. And we needed to maintain long bond portfolios as some of our business do write very long duration.</p>
          <p>Another example is that we have hedged equity exposure in the life with profit business through the cycle and we have greatly benefited from this in 2008 as we have taken care of these exposures in the year before. And keep in mind that when markets become turbulent and highly volatile as we have seen last year and still see this year it is usually too late to act after the volatility has increased, and that is one of the key reasons why discipline is so important in investment management.</p>
          <p>The goal of our investment strategy is to create long-term value at times when markets are strong and not to endanger the company when markets are weak. After all we are an insurance company and we are in the business of writing insurance policies.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the future is unclear. Challenges ahead are low interest rates and high volatility in the financial markets. This illustrates as well the current uncertainty in financial markets and acting in these environments requires both boldness and prudence to steer the investment portfolio through the current turmoil.</p>
          <p>In these uncertain times we have to take care of things we generate from our investment portfolio and evaluate each investment decision in a disciplined manner, and we have to understand thoroughly all risks we take.</p>
          <p>There are no miracles in these times, so we must continue our proven approach carefully evaluating every risk we take and staying away from what we don't understand. And I think we have done that rather well in the past.</p>
          <p>In these markets with very low valuations the temptation for an investment manager is very often to increase risks, to basically engage in a strategy of averaging down your exposures and making some spectacular bets on future developments of markets. We at Zurich will not follow this kind of strategy. We will keep the risks in the portfolio constant, recognizing that the valuations are lower but also recognizing that the risks are higher and actually substantially higher. Our investment strategy remains what it always has been disciplined, constant, consistent and careful in the details. The key to success is to keep the overall course of the business constant along our proven approach and optimizing risk adjusted returns relative to liabilities.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. And it's now a great pleasure to introduce you John Amore, the Head of our General Insurance Business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Martin. And good morning to all of you, and thanks for joining us today. I know there has been a lot of competition for your attention today, so it's a good to see you here.</p>
          <p>Today, even more than last year, it's very difficult to predict the markets and in fact we can't do that. But what we can do and what I will do today is reinforce to you what we see as the developing trends and how Zurich's General Insurance Business will react to that, and I'll be reiterating &#x2013; you've heard some of this already in both Jim and Dieter's presentations, so some of this will be a reinforcement of that, and some of it will give you a little bit more insight into these.</p>
          <p>I do want to point out though that we, the General Insurance Business did end the year with a pre-tax BOP RoE of 26%, and that's a strong base to proceed from and it's a strong -- and the diversity of our markets, it's a very strong way to proceed.</p>
          <p>And I think, perhaps the point that hardest to make in an analytical way but I don't think we should underestimate at all is the first point that we have up here is that I need to assure you that Zurich's market facing position in 2009 is very strong, and it's exceptional.</p>
          <p>When we meet with customers, agents, brokers, reinsurers, they all tell us how much they value the strategic positioning that we've put in place, and in addition to that, the consistency that of our strategy and our balance sheet.  It gives them  all great comfort and have a lot on faith in working with us. And this has been increasing from year-to-year.</p>
          <p>This sentiment also reinforces the flight to quality that we've seen in a lot of our markets where competitors have been having some significant troubles. And this has also been a big benefit to us. And then in addition of course we are seeing first hand the benefits of increased brand visibility across all of our markets.</p>
          <p>Consideration and total brand awareness are at an all time high. Just as our customers and our brokers are seeking these strong re-insurances from us and from people who help them manage risk.</p>
          <p>So, this of course helps us attract more customers to come to us, looking for their risk partner to be Zurich, and it helps us retain our customers in a stronger way than we would be able to in this very difficult marketplace.</p>
          <p>But of course, the second key factor here that really needs to be focused on, and I know is of great interest, is the role that price adequacy and technical price play in the profitability of our business. And it is particularly true as underwriting results typically take a few quarters to fully earn into results.</p>
          <p>Premiums have softened for a number of years in some of our markets, but in the last few quarters  we've seen a significant shift in this development beginning with a reduction in the speed of deterioration back in the second quarter of '08 and followed by an upturn in rates in the fourth quarter. That is a very significant change and one of which, is really being helped by the current economic conditions that are around us.</p>
          <p>I want to assure you we have been leaders in driving this change in the marketplace and we will continue to do so in 2009 to achieve an adequate pricing for risk. And as our submissions continue to grow and pricing continues to improve in the marketplace, our ability to convert that into profitable growth will be growing during the 2009 year.</p>
          <p>Now, Dieter has already talked about this, but I want to mention this again that the recovery has been most pronounced in the areas where our declining rate pressure has been highest. For Global Corporate that means slightly positive rate increases we saw in the fourth quarter have been followed by an acceleration of that trend in January, for our January one renewals where we saw accounts renewing for January one around the 5% level. Price increases of 5% in the US and over 1% in Europe.</p>
          <p>In North American Commercial, the change was slower through the fourth quarter, but for our January one renewals we've now seen that go positive by 1%. So it's very, very positive signs as we start the 2009 year. I'd point out to you that our business in EGI and our business in IB are already rate positive, were rate positive in 2008 already.</p>
          <p>The third point I want to bring out here is that the economic crisis does play an important factor on claims inflation in varying ways, but right now what we see is that claims inflation, which has rested steadily at around 3%, we are now expecting to moderate further. Combination with this claim frequency is likely to come down in areas like motor insurance as the global economy slows down.</p>
          <p>Of course at the same time, we are closely monitoring other trends. We typically see in an economic downturn like increases in arson, increases in fraud. And as the -- and we're also seeing changes in the regulatory and economic environment that we have to pay keen attention to during this change in the economic conditions.</p>
          <p>We are confident that we can incorporate these trends, whether they be positive or negative ones into our technical price, and introduce that very quickly into the pricing we have in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The fourth point. Our proven capability to rigorously manage our expenses in response to market conditions is very significant. As we did in 2008 in the US and in the UK, we are willing to take quick action to reduce our expenses as revenue shortfalls develop.</p>
          <p>We will continue maintaining our high ambitions for operational excellence and continuing to invest in the Zurich Way. Especially the Zurich Ways of underwriting and claims. And we will also continue to invest in our operational transformation initiatives. We expect these improvements to manifest themselves both in lower underwriting expenses, lower loss cost and through favorable prior year developments.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are continuing to pursue targeted customer product and distribution initiatives so we can grow our business profitability, even under these difficult market conditions. Our growth in '08 was selective and in-line with our stated strategic focus on personal and small commercial business in Europe and in the emerging markets. 2009, we are planning to continue to invest in profitable growth and we expect to continue to see the market respond well to our targeted customer centric initiatives.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are starting from a strong baseline with robust operating profitability and return on equity, as well as strong growth in difficult market conditions. 2008 we'll continue to carefully monitor our business volumes and if needed adjust our expense base. The combination of our customer focus, market positioning, underwriting discipline, and continuous operational improvements, all things we've been doing for a number of years now means that we are confident to deliver market leading results.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to introduce my colleague, fellow segment leader, Mario Greco, who of course leads the Global Life segment for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. I am very pleased to be here today to present the market vision we have for 2009. For Global Life we are focused on continuing the delivery of the strategy we presented to all of you in May 2008. A lot has happened, no doubt, in the last few months, but I am convinced that we have the right strategy and that the strategy has worked already very well in 2008 as Dieter showed with our results.</p>
          <p>During 2008, we have started embedding our strategy and as you see in the slide some of the actions that we launched will benefit us into 2009. Although growth rates for life, pensions and investments have slowed across the world and are likely to continue being slower during 2009, the outlook for our business is positive as we start collecting the benefits from a number of ongoing growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>First and foremost the Spanish acquisitions contribute in 2008 as Dieter said before $226 million of APE in a little over three months. And we will benefit in 2009 from the full production of the Spanish companies. Also we will have the full year impact from our entry into new markets, particularly in the Middle East and in Singapore where we saw significant growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we will also enter into new markets and lines of businesses. Across our group we are strengthening our corporate life and pensions propositions and we're leveraging with our Global Corporate colleagues. And finally this is the year in which we will launch our new private banking propositions. The pillar that you saw, with Dieter, that just started last year. We're fully aware that given the recent market trend, we need to have a clear focus on customers, combined with a flexible approach to identifying new opportunities.</p>
          <p>Now, Zurich Financial strengths. As much as our strong brand value position us well to respond to the cautious sentiment of investors, we will continue to launch innovative propositions in both pensions and life assurance wrappers. To meet the changing need of our customers, we are increasing our focus on protections, propositions, with the appointment of a new chief underwriting officer. The creation of a global underwriting team and the development of several new lines of businesses in 2009.</p>
          <p>We continue to improve our value management capabilities. And in light of the market outlook, we're now focusing on more sophisticated monitoring of inflows and outflows of funds under management, coupled with the implementation of initiatives that provide our customers with a greater flexibility around reinvestment choices.</p>
          <p>Design and the mix of our products means that although market volatility has an impact, our operating profit is not directly geared to lower stock market levels, and therefore, demonstrates some resilience in these conditions.</p>
          <p>We have recruited some outstanding talents in the recent months, as high potential professionals recognized Zurich strengths and buy into our strategy. As a consequence, notwithstanding the current climate, we remained determined to deliver on our strategy.</p>
          <p>Now coming to priorities for 2009. Our priorities are first of all, we will remain focused on the execution of our strategy. We will be flexible on our investments in product development to react to market needs and customer sentiments.</p>
          <p>Operational efficiency remained vital, so that we can maintain our competitive edge. And we will continue to rollout our regional hub strategy over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, we will devote more energy and resources than ever before to the measurement of fund inflows and outflows, and the development of more sophisticated processes for managing the in-force book.</p>
          <p>We are building a strong team, a team which is excited to meet the challenges, so I am confident in the future of the business and remain committed to delivering and driving towards our 2010 new business value targets of 1.2 billion of new business. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now I'll hand this over to my colleague Paul Hopkins, Chairman of the Farmers Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mario and to you and I'll pass on the same appreciative comments my colleagues have of your attendance here today. And I'll try to move quickly into our Farmers presentation so we can get to Q&amp;A, which I am sure you are all keenly interested in.</p>
          <p>In order for me to give you an outlook regarding 2009, first of all, we need to take a look at exactly where we are at now. On the left side of your screen you can see conning information that is probably not new to you, that indicates that the US market, in the personal line space, is indeed challenging.</p>
          <p>You can see that the growth rates for both '08 final and '09 projected are basically flat. You can also see from a profitability standpoint that the combines for '08 forecast and '09 are above 100, which is also undesirable.</p>
          <p>However, while we've been facing this headwind in the market for some time, Farmers has had a clear record of being able to outperform the leading competition in the marketplace during this period.</p>
          <p>So I'll draw your attention quickly to what we refer to as our performance grid, which is on the right side of your page. Very basically it looks at our top-line and bottom-line performance compared to the very top in the industry of really the best of the top ten in this period of time.</p>
          <p>Now you will notice that this is September of '08 information, as some of our publicly traded competitors haven't declared their year end results yet. But if you look across the grid, you'll see that on the horizontal axis we've got, we plot our growth, excuse me, on the vertical we plot our growth, on the horizontal the combined ratio.</p>
          <p>You can see that Farmers is outperforming the marketplace in growth from some very formidable competition in there, as well as sustaining a strong position as it relates to combined ratio in comparison to the competition.</p>
          <p>Moving these numbers forward which you've seen into the fourth quarter the Farmers combined ratio has improved as well. But it's really important to take a look at this and recognize that this performance grid has looked like this for the last 2.5 years and we plan on making sure it looks like that in 2009 as well.</p>
          <p>So, let's talk a little bit about how we have this optimism and confidence towards 2009. These are a few of the primary areas that we are focused on that  I think a really critical to delivering these results. First of all, they continue to drive operational excellence. Our baseline operating expense flat from 2007 through 2009. We've been able to drive about 100 million of operational run rate expense through operational transformation and good expense management control out of our total numbers -- total expenses.</p>
          <p>Maintaining our core underwriting discipline is critical. We have as shown on one of the earlier slides, taken an aggressive position on rates, and we are performing very well in this area. We have also been able to continue to outgrow the competition through this period.</p>
          <p>[Stops to drink water.] Excuse me a moment. Thank you. So many good results I get choked up.</p>
          <p>Meet or exceed the target of 21 billion of gross written premium at the Exchanges. This is a target that we've had out there a while and because of our organic growth as well as our good loss ratio position, surplus position and growth rate, we feel we're also in a very good position for inorganic growth in terms of acquisition.</p>
          <p>Establishing our Direct Channel capability, we've been working on this for some time. We see the shopping behavior changes in the US marketplace, and we are fully prepared to embrace this as aggressively as needed. Accelerate our geographic expansion. Our Eastern operations area, which is a unique opportunity for Farmers is growing very well for us. I believe, Dieter mentioned an 8% growth rate; very, very mature market in the Eastern states which we're very proud of.</p>
          <p>And then finally, sustaining the emerging market growth from the Asian and Latino community, excuse me, where we have become the most well known brand in those markets and one of the fastest growing brand in those markets which are the fastest growing segments in the US marketplace.</p>
          <p>So, while I still have a little bit of wind left, let me just tell you that I -- these strategies or these approaches are stress tested. We have had them in place for a few years. They are performing very well against our competition and they sustained themselves very well through the competitive challenges, through the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. So we are very optimistic about the future of Farmers to be able to outperform in '09.</p>
          <p>With that, let me get on to the Q&amp;A and bring forward my colleague Malcolm Gilbert to facilitate that. Thank you very much. Malcolm?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Ben Cohen at Collins Stewart. There were two things I wanted to ask about.</p>
          <p>Firstly, with regards to this sort of risk based capital and how you view that? How comfortable are you if that were to go below your sort of AFR over the course of the year? I know you've sort of committed presumably to the AA rating. And where do you think the rating agencies stand on that?</p>
          <p>The second thing I wanted to ask was about the valuation of the MBS in the ABS portfolio outside of the sub prime and the CDO tranches where I think if you've quantified some impairments in the -- for the year. I was just wondering, whether there had been any material impairments on that portfolio? And maybe as a follow-up there -- excuse me, Swiss Re this morning said they incurred an additional 600, 700 million cost in the fourth quarter from moving to I think best price to average price in the valuation part of their structure product portfolio. I appreciate it's a different way maybe that you look at things but maybe you could just talk us through the basis that you use for getting to the value of those assets. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ben, so what I suggest is that Dieter deal with the rating agency and the risk-based capital, and then we ask Martin to deal with the valuations and investments side.  And we won't comment on Swiss Re, but we are encouraged. Our reinsurance receivable is in a much better position now that we've had the capital infused in Swiss Re.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, the page I showed on the RBC capital development. Our 2009 assumption based on the plans and risk-taking and based on the current position is already that our -- the risk-taking is slightly above the available capital. But as I tried to explain, I think that these models are really acting too procyclical and if you would take it literally, in particular in these times where you have high volatilities and this depressed value in force of the life business, which actually when you look at this market consistent embedded value calculation, these stochastic models are assuming in 25% of all cases a prolonged Japanese situation of zero rates.</p>
          <p>That means much beyond the duration of our life bonds going on for many years. If you take this grim view on the world then we should get nervous about our risk-taking in the long run. Maybe not the next years but in 10, 15 year from now; but actually we are more optimistic on this and therefore we stand to our risk taking and continue our plans as has been explained by all of my colleagues.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe before we take the next question, just answering Ben on your question regarding our mortgage backed and asset backed security exposures. You by the way find the very specific breakdown in your attachment I think on page 26, 65 sorry. What we have to stress and I think Dieter has made that remark already that overall, we believe we've high quality portfolio. The average credit quality across our credit and bond exposures is AA around AA I should say. And with regards mortgage backed and asset backed we have to stress that all is 100% investment grade investments. 95% are AAA, and I see at this point no reason to be concerned beyond the volatility we see in the market in general.</p>
          <p>What also I need to stress is that due to the fact that we outsource most of our investments to third party asset managers, all the valuations are basically done and initiated by third party pricing agents. So we do not face the problems of many other financial institutions which sort of have the valuation challenge on assets which potentially are not as liquid as they could be. Our valuations are initiated by independent agents and that gives some additional comfort in terms of making a fair judgment on the exposures we have, the risks we manage and the returns we can't expect.</p>

          <p>Paul (1.24.20)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Couple of questions. I think the key question on the solvency or capital position is the change versus September and December. You gave a figure of 121% of AFR versus RBC at September. I think it was 116 at the end of October. And obviously it dropped quite lot to below 100. So, I think the interesting question is what are the moving parts over the last two or three months basically?</p>
          <p>I am guessing maybe that the pension fund wasn't fully marked-to-market perhaps at September and the MCB may not have been either, and obviously there was spread widening in the last three months of the year, so, maybe that's the explanation, but if you could reconcile that, that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And on claims cost on non-life, I think, John you were saying 3% increase. Was that frequency or was that total claims cost inflation including severity? And does that include &#x2013; you were saying that should drop given slower economic activity. Does that include your view of large losses, because it's quite hard to see what's going on there? You published a figure which includes weather within large, so there's cat and there's a weather component of large.  If you look &#x2013; if you take out the whether component of large, have underlying large losses actually been increasing over the last few years, and do you see a trend in that underlying large loss development? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I start with RBC and try to explain it. So if, for the full details you have probably to go back and contact our IR department as we add all the figures correctly up, but give me just the main big points.</p>
          <p>You are fully correct Paul (1.26.01), the movement in the pension funds was not so much included in the third quarter. And actually, the drop in the equities also happened in the fourth quarter. So that added $1 billion or 800 something million, to be precise. Then the big drop in the discounting effect on our General Insurance reserves also took place in the fourth quarter, because you had in the last eight weeks of the year this sharp decline in swap curves and interest free rates.</p>
          <p>And that impacted as I said the general reserve discounting we do for making it market consistent by 4 billion and it had a similar negative effect on the value in force calculation, because where you have long dated guarantees, and I mentioned this already, when you now assume that the whole world goes to zero interest rate in this market consistent calculation, and your bond portfolio covers you only for the next to eight to 10 years, then you see a sharp increase in these option values.  Whether this is something which ever will materialize or whether this is more the calculation method, I leave this up to you to judge this. And then one point, I think we had a billion increase in intangibles in the fourth quarter which have to be taken out from the calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Paul (1.27.47) on the loss frequency and severity issue. If we looked at our attritional losses and took out the cat losses and the weather losses, we would look at 2008 and we started to see some slight decline in frequency taking place and really no change in severity in those losses. The increase in the weather losses outside of the catastrophic area, was quite significant, especially in the first half of the year. And of course, we don't -- we look at those separately, because of the nature of those losses and don't average them in, with the &#x2013; the way in which we look at out attritional loss ratios.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We take one more from the room before we go to the telephone. Spencer (1.28.40) would you like to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things please. Firstly, the targets which you kept in place in both Farmers and the life business are the new business profit of 1.2 billion and the 21 billion of growth from premium. They do seem quite a leap from where we are today, so I am kind of wondering what's your sort of confidence level in how achievable both of those things are?</p>
          <p>And then the second one, coming back to this RBC ratio. Is there any sense you can give us Dieter maybe of what the sensitivities are? So for example, so far year to date volumes have recovered a bit, volatility is down. Do you think it's kicked back above 100% so far this month? Anything you could give us on sensitivities there would be useful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we let Dieter, why don't we have Paul and Mario give you a -- I'm always anxious to hear their commitment to these targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll lead if off if I could. As I stated the 21 billion GWP target for 2010 at Farmers has been an objective that we set out back when our premiums were actually about 14.5 billion, and we put the leadership team in place that is still in place today. It's really focused on making sure that our core disciplines of underwriting, taking the appropriate rates and being able to facilitate growth organically and inorganically are in place.</p>
          <p>So we've been able to show approximately $1 billion per year of premium growth through this period of time. But most importantly, we've been able to do that without deviating from the discipline of taking the appropriate rate, primarily because we have tremendous growth in our distribution, both in our independent channel and in our exclusive channel. And then finally, we've been able to, with the same leadership team, very effectively, integrate, Bristol West into our organization which has provided a good top-line growth of 25% year-over-year. And now the commercial operations from Zurich Small Business are integrating very nicely, and those are growing across both our independent and our exclusive channel as well.</p>
          <p>So, I think we've proven our ability thus far, and we have a great deal of confidence to grow both organically and also simultaneously take on acquisitions, and be able to integrate those into the operation and execute upon them very, very well. And that's where our enthusiasm and our confidence most importantly, sit in our ability to obtain the 21 billion of gross written premium by the end of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Life, I certainly understand your question. However, let me point out a couple of different points. First of all we delivered in 2008, which was not granted, and not easy at all, it was a very tough year. We launched the strategy, in year end we got the results that we expected.</p>
          <p>Second, I think our strategy is just the right one. We said a year ago that we did not focus on products, that we focus on customers and distributors, and that we would be flexible in adjusting the organization towards the customers and distributors needs from us. That worked out well in the difficult market conditions of the past months, and I think it will continue to work well in 2009.</p>
          <p>Then as I said, we had a number of initiatives. You have seen already the growth of Corporate and Pensions in 2008 and more will come because some of the sales were already made in 2008, but were not reported yet in the growth of premiums and APE in 2008, they will come in 2009.  And we are acquiring more customers already in 2009.</p>
          <p>I am confident, that the private banking pillar could give us contribution, I am confident that we could do well still on Bancassurance, the integration of Spain is progressing very well and I am very pleased with that, and I am confident that we can do well also in IFAs and tied-agents, where a number of initiatives started in the second half of 2008 and pushed us towards the good results year-end.</p>
          <p>So, it is stretchy, it is a difficult market environment. But let me just repeat what Jim said at the beginning. This is a time of opportunity also for us. We are growing. We have a number of initiatives there. We have a lot of people who are excited to join this strategy in this team, and so far we have been successful. So I think, bottom up, we can get there. And we can keep talking, keep watching what we will do. But is it -- but it has been a successful team so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spencer (1.33.42), I have no firm number for you for the RBC sensitivities. But if you go to our website and go to the risk report and embedded value disclosures, there are quite long lists of sensitivities for both. Also I have to make some caution about the underlying assumptions in it, and it is probably more an art than a science how to see where the RBCs stands compared to the available capital. We will certainly take some actions which are not affecting growth or investment portfolio where we can still reduce risk-taking quite easily and without a lot of cost so that we are close to the 100% number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just comment on this. If you were to look at the agenda of our executive committee meetings and our weekly agendas, we are very performance oriented. We're very focused on the risks that are out there. And we are constantly looking at these areas and the actions that we have to take both near term and long term to make sure we're in a position to capitalize on the opportunities and maintain the prudence and strength of our balance sheet going forward.</p>
          <p>I think that's critical at this point in time. We challenge &#x2013; I challenge consistently the plans both for growth because I've learned over the years in this business is very easy to grow, but it's not as easy to grow profitably, including when we look at the price increase numbers that you're hearing from John. We're very encouraged, but we just can't sit back and say we're going to get rate increase that's going to fall to the bottom-line. Because at the same time as we're getting rate increases, yields on investments because of the caution we play in terms of how we're investing the free cash flow that's coming in, are not giving us the same kind of returns, which is why we're so focused on the cost program, to maintain our margins.</p>
          <p>So, we're very operationally focused, and we are looking at this constantly in business division reviews, executive committee meetings, and getting the message out that we've got to continue to drive bottom-line performance in this organization.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also like to stress one point we have not included in this 2009 forward model, any dollar of earnings, and we still hope to make a few quarter by quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question on the phone comes from Mr. Stefan Sch&#xFC;rmann of Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My first question is on the investment return. Can you give us some guidance, what to expect on a normalized level from your investment portfolio yielding in 2009, and maybe some guidances then on potential further impairments on different assets?</p>
          <p>And the second one would be the general M&amp;A environment, you talked about opportunities around, just maybe giving us a feel about what you could do in terms of financing capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me deal with the M&amp;A environment. I think there are a lot of opportunities out there. I think sellers are getting more realistic about valuations, probably not as realistic as I am as a buyer. And I think that we will be cautious during this period of time. I think there is opportunity to finance acquisitions if you have the right acquisition.</p>
          <p>So we are not rushing around the sales store looking to make transactions. Our focus is as it's always been to create shareholder value. I think there will be, continue to be opportunities in this market for the stronger players and our job is to stay strong so we can capitalize on these opportunities as they emerge during the coming year and in the years ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With regards to your question on forecast on the earnings and the impairments, unfortunately we will not be in a position to make any forecast on the investment returns. I think in my introduction I have stated that there are no miracles, but what I can definitely guarantee is that we keep the approach we have been &#x2013; we had in place, that we focus on managing our investments relative to liabilities on a risk adjusted basis. And I think the fact that we have generated total return of 1% positive in one of the most stressful years speaks for itself.</p>
          <p>With regards to the impairments for next year everything frozen at price levels as of the end of 2008 our impairments for Q1 and Q2 would be less than $100 million.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic, thank you very much. I had two questions please. The first one, I was trying to reconcile notes five and note 18.  Now you're going to say, ooh this sounds very geeky. Probably the only thing I looked at this morning. Note five is the deals and the deal total is 1928 million that's page 170. And note 18 details the increase in intangibles. It gives amounts relating to deals, these are the amounts which increased intangibles and it says 339 million, 640 million and 3069 million which when it added up gives you for 4048. So I'm kind of puzzled. How can deals which are worth 1.9 billion increase intangibles by 4 billion? I'm sure there's a simple answer.</p>
          <p>Relating to that, can you say what you did relative to your initial assessment of embedded value for the Spanish deals?  Munich Re yesterday was quite clear and said that any company which in the past two years was brave enough to do a bank assurance deal should seriously look at their assumptions, and they themselves did so.</p>
          <p>And then the final question, you say that the benefit of Zurich Way in terms of reserve development should continue. Now, I have no doubt that they will continue. I looked at your triangulation table, it looks really very impressive. I am just wondering whether you can maintain quite the same pace of development particularly if one enters into a recession period. And I know you might say, well, ooh we haven't seen any new recession claims. Just wonder sometimes whether Ike might have been that expensive if we hadn't been in a recession environment at the same time. Those are my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael can we -- I am sorry, but there is a lot of questions in there. And unfortunately I will blame it on the technology, it's hard for us to -- difficult to understand. So if you could repeat it one piece at a time so we can address one piece at a time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lovely, well I thank you for that. The first question was a comparison of a deal total, which on note five on page 170 is 1928 million. And that if you compare to note 18 where you detailed the increase in intangibles, in the text is says the increase in intangibles relating to deals were three amounts, 339, 640 and 3069, which adds up to 4048. And my question was well how can deals worth 1.9 billion add four billion to intangibles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is I hope not a difficult answer because that has always something to do with specialties of IFRS accounting metric. One number is the economic view of what we invested in the deals and the other one is the gross up for minorities. And as we did two -- three joint ventures actually 50-50 that is the main driver of this that you have in the IFRS balance sheet. Everything goes up and then the minorities are taken out at the end as from the equity positions. But I would also suggest that you maybe get in contact with IR afterwards and they will be able to guide you through the details fully.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, the second question, which I guess relates to those because these are mainly the Spanish life deals. Yesterday Munich Re on their conference call said that any company which had done bank assurance deals in the past two years will probably have to review the assumptions they use for the calculation of embedded value. And they cited for them the case of the acquisition last year, where the further the deal consideration was written-off, after I guess just four months after the actual deal went through. I just wondered in terms of your Spanish deals whether you did check again the embedded value and what impact that had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I can state to this two things. First of all, that with certainly with all the movements a review we have done very recently. And also as I indicated in my summary, the fourth quarter new business volume and new business value delivered by the acquired businesses were above our expectations, which means were above also our assumptions for the first year in the business plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we will certainly review this very carefully in the next quarters and we usually revisit this in September for all the cases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, and my last question, and I really thank you for this opportunity. In terms of the reserve development, the figure of 1308 million in General Insurance on the claims, and you say somewhere in the text that you expect the Zurich Way to continue giving positive reserve development. I just wondered whether you can give a feel for whether we will remain roughly at the same level, or whether this is kind of a relatively high level, which could decline.</p>
          <p>The reason I ask this question is there are some very good stats given by the Insurance Institute, Information Institute, which shows that there is actually a cycle in the U.S. of reserve development. They actually go negative at some stage and they go positive and they go negative again. And we've actually seen that in your history as well. So I'm not saying I doubt you but the evidence of history suggests that there is a cycle in these things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I think, Michael that is a traditional question, so therefore, you will get a traditional answer, that we complete the annual ceremony. We have replaced the U.S. reserving, which I think it's not really benefit in the past by our Zurich way of reserving. And so &#x2013; and keep our prudent approach and we are not making any specific forecasts about the positive run-off, but we feel that we also don't see any changes in the reserve quality to previous years. And I think there was also a hidden indication by John actually that we &#x2013; that probably reserves are assuming a higher inflation ratio for 2009 than we would now all estimate what will really happen in 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just add one point on this because it's an interesting aspect in the recessionary piece, because two of the more recent initiatives within the Zurich Way of claims have to do with a global approach to fraud and a global approach to procurement, which I think for us really will help us stay ahead of the issue of what types of claims might be coming and emerging out of the recessionary environment.</p>

          <p>Okay. Now to give everybody a fair chance we're down to one part questions. So if you give us three parts, we'll answer the first one. Brian (1.47.03), would you like to start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll try to squeeze everything into one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[laughter] That's what Michael did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes back to one of Jim's opening remarks. From a position of strength you're willing to look at opportunities now. And the question is what kind of opportunities?  In the past you've answered this question by giving two or three different geographies. I could ask you maybe do you have a general preference or philosophical preference for non-life or life? And in terms of the health of the target would you buy a less cheap good company, or do you have an interest in the real bargain basement fixer-uppers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to give you the same answer I always give you, that I don't comment on acquisition rumors and the like &#x2013; but I don't mean that negatively.  Look, I think there are a lot of opportunities and we have to go through, and my own criteria is most acquisitions and particularly most mergers are not successful. That's my starting off point. And I said earlier, that when I look at these transactions most important thing for me is, can we maintain our culture in doing and add value in the transaction.</p>
          <p>And by that I mean it's extremely important, if you look at the resiliency and the way we operate some people will not be able to come in to an organization and operate this way. Some companies will not be able to transform and bring value in her. So as we go through, everybody, existing businesses and potential acquisitions are competing for the same capital. And we have to make up our bets in those areas where we feel we can create the greatest amount of shareholder value, obviously evaluate the risk relative to that, and drive the greatest return.</p>
          <p>What might appear as a great deal, as you describe a fixer-upper, may not be executable at the end of the day and expose us to lot more risk where on the other hand what may not appear to you to be from that standpoint as much value as a fixer-upper may create much more value for us over the near-term and the long-term given. So it's hard to say, we are looking for &#x2013; we are a bottom feeder and we are only looking for these kinds of transactions.</p>
          <p>And let me also say in this period, our focus is on maintaining and preserving our capital base for our existing customers and shareholders. We have got to be prudent from that standpoint and if we do look at acquisitions, we're mindful of the fact that we will have to justify those acquisitions to people that we will ask to help us finance them. So there are a lot of hurdles to overcome.</p>
          <p>I think the other thing that I feel very good about over this last period of time is we've demonstrated a track record that we know how to integrate companies. We have a team of people that focus on the Zurich Way, bring it in to the organization and allow us to extract value in a very meaningful way. Whether it's Bristol West which you can see, and the speed which we were able to close and begin the integration of Banco Sabadell.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are in the same house, so I'm going to take one in the middle here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's William Hawkins at KBW. I had a few follow-on questions. But the core thing I wanted to ask really, on your dividend, if you could just elaborate again on your thought process behind the cut, and just factually, do you consider that you have re-based the dividend to 11? Would you consider that what you've done is a one-time cut from the original base of 15 based on the exceptional circumstances of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't -- I don't look at the dividend as a cut. I look at the dividend in terms of our total capital management policy, and I look at it in terms of the confidence, as we've said in the sustainability of the earnings. And we will set the dividend based upon the capital needs of the organization, the economic environment that we are in. And we feel very confident with the return that you look at the yield from this dividend and also the payout ratio.</p>
          <p>And we think that's good for this particular circumstance, of where we are. We don't designate if you read our dividend policy, we don't specifically state here is a payout ratio, here is a yield that we want to maintain. And we don't take these decisions lightly, as you can imagine, but I think you've gotten to know me over the last several years. I don't take any decisions lightly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Christian (1.52.18).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. It's a very simple question, it's the financial debt issued by Zurich, please discuss and in answering that question maybe you'd like to consider your current maturing profile, your needs, the state of the market, and whether you think that Deutsche Bank has given a free option to every house or every issuer with a callable bond, in terms of whether you think you can stay close to the debt market or whether you cannot call bonds and still meet your financing needs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since that's a German institution, I'm going to ask Dieter to reply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have shown over the last years that we call maturing papers at their right call date. I think we have a maturity profile in our financial statement, but we will always look also at optimization of this overall debt portfolio. And when the market is at the right point and the financing conditions are good, then certainly we will make use of it, throughout this year. That would be really wrong not to do it. I think we had the last issue in September, I think that was a very good window of opportunity, we paid a spread of 60 / 70 base points, and certainly we are looking further for these opportunities.</p>
          <p>Actually in the fourth quarter we bought some of our outstanding debt back, where the seller was looking for liquidity and it was a bargain, so it would have been stupid not to do it, and the other way we would also issue, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we just have &#x2013; Rob Haim please in the middle her, and then we'll take one more after that, which I will take...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob Haim JPMorgan Assets Management. Couple of questions. First one, is can you comment on your succession planning, following your announcement to step down or retire?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you actually &#x2013; you're always quoted as a main beneficiary of the AIG demise in the US? Can you actually give us an indication what type of premiums you might be expecting to achieve there from their demise, and what are the costs that you've borne so far from the number of hirings you've done from AIG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I am not sure if you want me to hand out my resume at this point in time. When I renewed my contract in 2006, we set for me the definitive date, the end of 2009. I have been working, and I think it's the job of every CEO, to put in place and provide to the Board candidates &#x2013; succession candidates both internally and externally. I've been working with the Board over the last several years, to provide them with choices that they can evaluate.</p>
          <p>I am a firm believer in the sense that you should &#x2013; there is never a good time to leave. There is also a reason to stay on, and I think some people stay on longer than they should. I had in my own mind that I would not fall victim to that in terms of saying I'm indispensable. So that's why I've stuck to this timetable. The Board understands that. We've discussed it several times over the last several years, and I feel good about where we are.</p>
          <p>No company is dependent upon any one individual. We've built a very strong organization with a sustainable strategy and sustainable operating plans that should take us through the future. And I'm sure my successor will do much better than I've done. I'm betting on it, I'm a shareholder. And I think that's the legacy I would like to leave here and I'll talk more about that as the date gets closer.</p>
          <p>What I plan to do? I plan to run this company until the end of the year. That's what I agreed with the Board. I'm the CEO until the end of the year. I will wrap up and my focus and dedication will be on running the company. And I will look at other opportunities as they arise and when there is something to announce I'll say it.</p>
          <p>As it relates to AIG, I think we've been very successful in recruiting talent from AIG. John can &#x2013; John and Mario and the others can elaborate on that talent. We've been successful in integrating that talent into Zurich. I think that when we look at new business submissions they're up. I'm encouraged by that. We are winning business. I am concerned at times in terms of the overall industry. We will not chase pricing down in this market and I think that everyone knows both in the organization and outside of the organization, I think you destroy value by trying to buy business, particularly in this economic time and I'm concerned about some of what I see, but overall I think the market has been fairly disciplined. I don't know if John, do you want to --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And I think this is spread out actually amongst the three segments, where talent has been brought in from AIG, from fairly senior talent in the organization to subject matter experts, technical people with strong technical expertise in various areas of the business. We've gotten I'd say about a third of the people we've gotten have been outside of the United States, bringing in a lot of the international expertise that has come in &#x2013; that AIG has had.</p>
          <p>Should we, can we talk about the numbers or is that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>People.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes. I think we're about as of January 1, we had about 60 &#x2013; or just short of 60 people joining us. And they have &#x2013; we think it's been a great transition including, most recently, one of their government affairs people in Washington but most of them are in the operational and technical side of the insurance businesses in Life and in General insurance as it's played out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just add one little piece to that. It's true as John said there's been a  migration of talent from AIG to Zurich but I would also say that from where we started, if you will, with this leadership team in 2002 to where we've been able to bring the organization today, it's been a tremendous run and we think it's going to continue to be. So we've been able to on-board talent from other really top brand companies beyond AIG as well whether that be Hanover, whether that be USAA, whether that be Travelers, these are all top brand companies and very, very good people. And I think it just speaks to their confidence of joining an organization that already has a good proven track record and a very exiting future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if I can just make a quick comments on Life. We certainly widened the Life team around the world in 2008. And part of the people we recruited came from AIG. The competencies we were looking for in 2008 were technical competencies because we wanted to have underwriters because of the protection growth that we saw in the world, and also we looked carefully at people with the distribution in customer contacts in areas of the world where we wanted to grow, primarily Middle-East and Asia. And I think we have a remarkable successes in making these people interested to us and buying to our strategy and joining us.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the cost, I mean the cost is simply to recruit these people and frankly it doesn't really change our numbers. On the other side, it give us really the opportunity now to develop customers on product lines or in regions where we did not have before the possibility to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We just &#x2013; we are running over time but one very quick question from Tony (2.01.54).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering if you could remind us a bit of what's in the Other businesses segment, and why it's sensitive, what is there that is sensitive to equity market falls outside of obviously Farmers Re?</p>
          <p>And if I can just tag one other thing on to that. The operating variances in the EV reporting include mortality persistency expenses, and then on page 249 you will see there is a plus 422 million under Other. And I was wondering what that might be please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for this is question on the EV under Other, hopefully we have to follow up on those details...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While Dieter is &#x2013; let me come back to the creation of this Other which came out of the turnaround, where we -- and the design was to run that business to zero over time, and a lot of that was the old Centre businesses, Zurich Capital Market businesses, which we put in there, and we had reserved, and some of that I think we've mentioned is because of the way we've done the funding and the mark-to-market write downs against assets and liabilities, and while we've earmarked assets to match to the run off timetable of some of those contracts, because of the accounting convention you are taking write downs now although they are perfectly matched against the liability and you are not writing the liability down. So you're getting some sensitivity against that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Jim just said, this basis mismatch we have in Centre's visibility book has both sides going through fair value, so that will swing back when the bonds are maturing. So that is -- I think if -- as we have no indication that we have to impair any of the bonds that is in the end a temporary event. On Zurich Capital Markets, we are holding still one-third of our ongoing hedge fund investments. They were historically, they are part of our active investments portfolio so they are actually not in runoff, and we have left it in the balance sheet for historical reasons, but has actually nothing to do with the original Zurich Capital Markets' business, or with the run-off portfolio. So, therefore, the hedge fund losses have to a large extent crystallized under Zurich Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>And then we have the one-off businesses from KILICO, which we did not sell back in 2003. This life book is in run-off since October, November 2001. And some of these policies have interest guarantees or are linked to equity levels and there we increased the reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much everyone for participating. I think someone mentioned earlier, we know there is a demand on your time; sometimes there are surprise events, which surprise all of us, which take some of you away. We appreciate that and really appreciate the fact that you joined us.</p>
          <p>One thing I want to say, I hope we've made evident to you that I feel personally very confident in this management team. I am very confident that Zurich is well positioned to navigate through these turbulent times. Like a good athlete I sometimes think we trained to be prepared for this kind of time. I know at times people thought perhaps we were too cautious, perhaps we were a bit more on the conservative side, but if I go back and look at this industry in my entire career, this is an industry where there are more variables than I've seen in any other industry.</p>
          <p>This is an industry where there are more outside influences that you find it difficult to control and I think it's extremely important as we set out on our journey in 2002, that we put in place the operational capabilities embodied in the Zurich Way to enable us to control the things that we can control.</p>
          <p>We demonstrate a profound appreciation for risk. I think that that's something if you look inside the crisis we find ourselves in today, which was led into by the financial community was an under appreciation of enterprise wide risk and an under pricing of risk. We have a great appreciation for risk and we look at it in our investment portfolio, in how we approach our underwriting and in our capital management strategies as we operate this organization.</p>
          <p>And as I said earlier, we possess one of the best management teams in this industry, a growing talent pool of young and upcoming individuals. And this pool of people can control what we can control because we have not only the people but the processes and procedures and the checks and balances to ensure that we do.</p>
          <p>That does not in any way mean that we don't continue to feel the strains of this crisis and the global recession. But it does mean that we have the tools and the mindset, and that we are aware and that we are on top of the issues and that we need to be sure that we influence our own destiny and turn this period of adversity into an era of opportunity for the Zurich.</p>
          <p>Thank you all very, very much. I really again appreciate the time and patience that you've taken and for those of you who we didn't have a chance to answer your questions, please call the Investor Relations office and we'll get you an answer. Thank you.</p>
