          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Half Year 2012 Results Presentation of the Linde Group. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to hand over to the Head of Investor Relations of the Linde Group, Dr. Dominik Heger. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I will be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining our call for our results on the first half of 2012. Georg Denoke, CFO and Member of the Executive Board will be hosting the call, and Professor Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board will also be available for your questions.</p>
          <p>Most of you would have followed our proposal to acquire the US-based company, Lincare. All relevant filings have been submitted and the process is on its way as scheduled. You have seen from our press release from 23rd of July that we have already received the anti-trust approval ahead of schedule. Therefore, we have no further news on this subject. For that reason and for legal reasons, I trust that you understand that this call is limited to our performance in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Georg Denoke, and after his presentation, he will have the opportunity to address your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. From my side also, a warm welcome, and I open my presentation with a quick summary. In the reporting period, we have experienced a softer development of the macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, overall, our profitable growth trend is intact. With EUR7.2 billion, our group sales increased by 5.9%, while the operating profit grew by 6.2% to EUR1.655 billion. This equals the Group margin of 23.1%, which is 10 basis points higher than the same period of 2011.</p>
          <p>As a result of this performance, earnings per share increased by 3.9% to EUR3.45. Adjusted for the allocation of the purchase price of the BOC transaction, the earnings per share increased by 3.2% to EUR3.91. From operational perspective, I would like to highlight that our confirmed project pipeline in the Gases Division, which already stood at a high level at the beginning of this year, has further increased by an additional EUR660 million. From the year 2012 to 2015, we now have projects with an investment volume of around EUR2.6 billion under execution. This is the strongest base we ever had.</p>
          <p>In the first six months, we have been able to further improve the margin in the Gases business by 10 basis points to 27.4%. Based on the performance in the first six months, we reinforce our outlook of growth in sales and operating profits compared to the record year of 2011. We also reconfirm our full commitment to our HPO, which results in or will result in EUR650 million to EUR800 million gross cost savings by the end of the year. This is our expectation.</p>
          <p>I'll start the detailed look at the performance with Group sales on slide four. Gases sales increased by 7.2% to EUR5.8 billion. On a comparable basis, sales grew by 3.4%. The comparable growth was negatively impacted in the second quarter by plant shutdowns in the product area tonnage. Later I will come back to this topic. The growth in the Gases division was led by the product area Healthcare, which includes a newly acquired Continental European homecare business of Air Products.</p>
          <p>With EUR1.2 billion sales, the Engineering division stayed on a stable level. The order intake was dominated by orders from the Middle East as well as from Asia. Compared with the first quarter of this year, the order backlog has further increased by around EUR100 billion to EUR3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>You will see now on slide five the growth of the operating profits. As already mentioned, the Group operating profit grew by 6.2%, both divisions contributed to this positive development. The Gases division achieved a further increase in operating profit of 7.8% to EUR1.6 billion. In parallel, the operating margin also improved by 10 basis points to 27.4%. As well, the Engineering division increased operating profit by 7.1%. The operating margins took in the reporting period at 12.3%. This is again the result of a very successful execution of individual projects. Please let me remind you that the 2011 figure of others and consolidation includes a positive one-time effect of EUR60 million. As you know already, this effect resulted from changes made to the UK pension plan.</p>
          <p>I'll give you more detailed picture of our Gases division and move on to page six, which shows our sales bridge. As outlined before, the underlying price volume effect for the reporting period was 3.4%. On the one hand, the acquisition of the Continental European Homecare business of Air Products contributed in the second quarter with EUR37 million of additional sales. On the other hand, we had a negative impact of around EUR40 million in the second quarter from plant shutdowns and maintenance work.</p>
          <p>Please let me remind you that this price volume growth does not include the contribution of our joint venture activities. With the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar, and the British pound, the currencies in which we had a stronger sales exposure strengthened in the reporting period. Therefore, the contribution from currency effects is positive with 3.6%. The same impact from the pass-through of higher natural gas prices was 0.2%, also slightly positive. The major positive impact was in the reporting segment here in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, you can see the comparable growth by product area, which includes &#x2013; which excludes, excuse me, currency effect and the natural gas price impact. In the product area healthcare, we have seen 10.3% growth. You will be aware that this growth is supported by the consolidation of the acquired Continental European Homecare business from AP, as already mentioned. Due to the closing on 30th of April, we have been able to include two months of sales in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>The product area, tonnage, increased by 1.4%. As indicated earlier, we had a negative impact, in particular, in the second quarter from plant shutdowns and maintenance work. With this negative impact on sales, the tonnage growth would have been at 4.8%. Tonnage joint venture activities included, the growth rate would increase to 6.4%. As already mentioned in our full year results call, the start-ups are rather in the second half than in the first half of 2012. We achieved with 4.3%, a very solid growth rate in bulk. From a sector perspective, photovoltaic was rather weak, whereas food and beverage as well as manufacturing supported the growth. We also increased revenue by 2% in the product area, cylinder. Here we have seen strong growth in South Pacific and Eastern Europe, while Southern Europe continues to be weak.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I will go deeper in the details of our operating segment and start with EMEA. The economic development in Europe, Middle East-Africa in the first 6 months of 2012 was, as expected, lower than last year. However, we achieved revenue growth of 4.2%, which was 3.4% on a comparable basis. In Eastern Europe and the Middle East, on the other hand, we were able to benefit from a good economic environment. We succeeded in winning major orders and acquired the Continental European homecare business of AP. The most prominent example of on-site project wins in the last half year was the agreement to supply on-site gases to Sadara Petrochemical Company in Al Jubail in Saudi Arabia. We will invest US$380 million to supply products to the joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical.</p>
          <p>The second operating segment is Asia Pacific. Here we realized an revenue growth of 13.6% in the first six months. On a comparable basis, the increase was 4.2%. Revenue in this region was also affected by plant shutdowns. Within the Asia Pacific segment, we achieved the fastest business expansion in greater China, and we also achieved revenue growth in all other regions of this operating segment.</p>
          <p>In the on-site business, we won new contracts which will further strengthen our business in this region in the future. For example, we built two large air separation units for Tata Steel at its site in Kalinganagar in India. Around EUR80 million will be invested in this project. Each of the two new air separation units will have an production capacity of 1200 tons of air gases per day. We intend to establish a pipeline network in this industrial complex.</p>
          <p>In addition, we signed a major long-term supply agreement with Samsung Electronics in the second quarter of 2012. Our Taiwanese subsidiary will supply electronic gases for Samsung's newest TFT-LCD factory in the Suzhou Industrial Park in China. We will invest around EUR50 million in this project, which involves the construction of a turnkey liquefied gas supply system.</p>
          <p>I move on to the operating segment, Americas. Here we achieved revenue growth of 7.5%, which is on a comparable basis an increase of 3.3%. The solid business performance in North America was in particular characterized by the good development of our bulk business, which was supported by growth also in the manufacturing segment. A further contributor for the cylinder business was the Canadian market. As a result of relatively robust economic trends, we achieved double-digit growth in South America, and then solid growth in North America. As in the first quarter of 2012, the Healthcare and liquefied gases continued to achieve an above-average performance in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>On page nine, the profitability of our operating segment is outlined. I also start here with EMEA. The operating profit increased by 3.3%. This resulted in an operating margin of 28.3%. A weak Southern Europe and the already mentioned plant shutdown of the plant in Southern Europe for maintenance reason had a negative impact on the earnings trend. Asia Pacific was up 11.6%. This resulted in an operating margin of 27.1%. Compared to last year, it has to be taken into account that the pass-through of increased natural gas prices had an adverse effect.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we continue to invest in future structure growth in this region. You might know that we have currently a high number of projects under execution in that region. Therefore, we employ new staff in the rapidly expanding Asian markets in order to ensure an accelerated ramp-up of the new capacities once they come on stream.</p>
          <p>I will move on now to Americas. Here the operating profit rose by 15.6%, supported by higher capacity utilization in all product areas. At 24.7%, the operating margin exceeded the figure for the first half year of 2011 by additional 170 basis points, supported by our HPO initiatives. In general, I would like to point out that the standardization and productivity improvement within our HPO program supports margins in all operating segments.</p>
          <p>Please see the project pipeline now on page 10. As from today, we still see a 12 months forward basis of EUR4.3 billion amount of project opportunities in the market, with a large portion in growth markets and also project in the area of the megatrend, energy and environment. You see on this slide that the total amount of projects above EUR10 million, which will, or will go on stream in the respective &#x2013; which went or will go on stream in the respective year. Due to our very promising opportunities pipeline, we were able to sign projects, which increased the figures for 2013 to 2015 by around EUR650 million. With EUR750 million, the amount for 2013 is already on the same level as for 2012. And we showed you the first time here the year 2015, which is already well filled. Today, we already have EUR500 million and we expect the pipeline to grow further.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have currently around EUR2.6 billion of investments under construction. The total investment amount of all our project pipelines for the years 2009 to 2015 is around EUR4.7 billion, of which around 70% are allocated through the growth emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 11 now to see the latest figures of our Engineering Division. With an increase of 0.2% sales in the Engineering Division, the sales was favored in the first six months. In the same timeframe, the operating profit increased by 7.1% and the operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 12.3%. As already outlined, this outstanding margin is due to the almost perfect execution of individual projects. The order intake in the first half of the year increased by 24.6% to EUR1.4 billion, and as you know, it's always difficult here to compare quarter-by-quarter comparisons because of the nature of this business.</p>
          <p>The positive trend was supported by the already mentioned US$380 million contract in Saudi Arabia, and the air separation plant in India for Tata Steel up around EUR80 million. Based on the signed tonnage long-term on-site supply contract in our Gases Division, these plants have been ordered at our Engineering Division.</p>
          <p>In addition, Linde has won orders during the reporting period totaling around US$250 million in the market for the efficient exploitation of shale gas reserve in North America. Since the beginning of 2010, Linde has already received orders in this market segment of around US$800 million. With this, we continue to improve our position in this promising business.</p>
          <p>These orders have increased the internal order intake to a level of EUR800 million within this year. This is a clear confirmation of Linde's integrated business model, and an example of the way in which the group's Engineering Division supports the targets of expansion of the on-site business in the Gases Division in these markets like Saudi Arabia and the Asian markets mainly as it is today. Given the positive trends in orders, the order backlog grew EUR3.8 billion &#x2013; to EUR3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to our outlook, which is always based on the current economic predictions and prevailing exchange rates. Please turn to page 12. First of all, I'd like to reconfirm our outlook for the year 2012. Based on the current economic forecast, our objective is to achieve increases in group sales and operating profit. I have outlined in the beginning that we furthermore reconfirm the range of EUR650 million to EUR800 million gross cost savings of our HPO initiatives until the end of this year, for the four years period.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division, we expect for the financial year 2012 a slower growth rate than the last year. We have seen over the last year our productivity improvement track record, and we continue with this focus. We assume growth in bulk and cylinder business to be in line with the macroeconomic trend. On top of this, growth will be driven by the strong footprint in our &#x2013; and in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Please let me remind you that we gave for 2012 the CapEx guidance for the Gases Division of around EUR1.8 million. With this, we will be above our historic average of the last year's of 13% CapEx-sales ratio. As you know, we anticipate for the Engineering Division to achieve the same level of sales as in 2011, and an operating margin of at least 10%. As already communicated, the acquisition of Lincare would alter our mid-term targets. Based on the expected closing of the transaction in the third quarter of this year, our target of adjusted return on capital employed is expected to be achieved in 2015. And on the other hand, we plan to achieve our EBITDA target one year earlier in the year 2013, with an operating profit of at least EUR4 billion. I emphasize that the growth will also be supported by continuous ramp-up out of our very strong confirmed project pipeline.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division, the average CapEx-sales ratio probably will be 13% with a plus added for potential large-scale projects in the megatrend, energy and environmental. Besides the megatrend Healthcare, the megatrend growth markets, energy, environment has offered and will offer structured growth potential in the years to come. With our synergetic Gases and Engineering Division, we have the right set up regarding technology, local market shares and customer contact.</p>
          <p>As you know, our ambition is to outperform the market with our revenue increase and to remain fully focused on our journey to become an high-performance organization.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, we will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Rakesh Patel. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. It's Rakesh from Goldman. Just a couple of questions, if I may. I wondered if you could give us some color on what the impact of the plant shutdowns were in the quarter, and whether this had any phasing from the plant shutdowns that you usually do in Q4? That is to say then, should we expect an acceleration in revenue growth going forward just as a function of that cycling in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if you could you give us some idea of the contribution that the Air Products acquisition made both to the revenue and profitability that would be quite appreciated?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just wanted to go back to the guidance that you gave on the CapEx to sales ratio being 13% plus, and if we should think of that feeding through into revenue growth in year two or year three? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for your questions, Rakesh. I think with the on-site effect I mentioned what happened in quarter two, the impact was EUR40 million. And when we look now into the second half of the year, and when you argue that normally we have that plant shut downs in the fourth quarter more than in the first half year, then from today's perspective, there is no further shutdown scheduled from an maintenance perspective for the second half. I think that is something we can confirm. Nevertheless, we do not want to forget to mention that there is one customer shutdown in the Asian markets, where we don't foresee yet how the flow of this scheme will be in the second half for that customer. There is some uncertainty here related to the customer.</p>
          <p>The second question was the key contribution. As I mentioned, this was around EUR37 million for the second quarter, for the two-month period. We do not disclose here the profit contribution. But you can assume that we do have here included one-time cost for the integration. And the indication from my side is clearly that this is below the average gas margin at that point in time, if you include the cost from the integration perspective.</p>
          <p>And your third question, the CapEx-sales ratio, the contribution has not changed from the pattern, which we always explain to you. So these are still on a CapEx perspective, which is roughly factored to from an &#x2013; from &#x2013; in comparison to the revenue number which we expect. The caveats are always the contribution from the joint ventures, which are not included here from the perspective of revenue visibility. But this number is also becoming smaller compared to the number in 2011, for example.</p>
          <p>So when you go back to page 10 of the presentation, you will see for 2011, EUR800 million, and here the big scheme in Abu Dhabi was included with EUR400 million. And for the years to come, the joint venture activities, it's much smaller. I believe for 2012, it's around EUR70 million plus, around that number, and then 2013 is even smaller. And for 2014 and 2015, it's all mainly from today's perspective fully consolidated schemes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Markus Mayer. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Markus Mayer from Kepler. Few questions, if I may. First of all, can you give us an update on the split of internal versus external projects in Engineering? Then secondly, on the guidance you said that you want to continue to improve productivity of gases. Does that mean that you expect margins to increase sequentially in the second half, despite the high ramp-up in start-ups, which normally depress the margin at the beginning? And thirdly, could you give us an indication on the purchase price accounting for the Air Product acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Markus, thanks for the questions. So from a perspective of HPO, I'll start with this one. I think it's a commitment for the future. As you know, we do not expect a significant impact for 2012 from a margin perspective based on our significant ramp-up of schemes in the second half, and the pre-investment in a way for the staff I was referring to for the rollout of our Merchant business especially. So from this perspective, it's more a future commitment and this is not ending here. But from the perspective when we compare this last year where we said you will see in the fourth quarter the rebound compared to the ramp up of costs in the first half, we said always this year that this will not be happen on an Asian perspective for the Asian markets.</p>
          <p>The Linde Engineering impact, as I mentioned in my call, was EUR800 million, which is significant and which is, of course, fully in line with our strategy, as we want to have it. We want to sign new on-site contracts with customers for 15 and 20 years periods. And therefore, it's in confirmation of our strategy in the integrated model of Gas and Engineering. And can you repeat your third one, the purchase price allocation you mean, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. And another question on this Engineering, could you give us the split between internally and externally currently? So what &#x2013; in Q2 what was it internally and externally? As I understand it, currently they're more internal than external projects at Engineering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we don't have the detailed split now between the quarters. You mean now what is quarter one effect, what is quarter two effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I mean, the total number is EUR800 million, and the second half was &#x2013; when you take this in context, more slightly above the half of that. And you take &#x2013; the EUR380 million as a total investment for Sadara. I would say roughly EUR270 million is the scope for the Engineering division here. You have also civil construction, and then we have the other EUR80 million for Tata. So I would say it's quite similar, probably the impact of quarter one and quarter two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a purchase price allocation, I think you have that in the &#x2013; in a way &#x2013; in the whole backup. I would assume that the goodwill is around EUR250 million and the other impact is around &#x2013; for the other assets, it's around EUR30 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Stephan Kippe, [Commerzbank]. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Also, three questions from me. Coming back to the plant turnarounds on the customer side, could you indicate which customer sectors had the largest part in these turnarounds?</p>
          <p>Second question, coming back to the healthcare acquisition in Europe, you talked about integration &#x2013; some integration startup costs that limited profitability. Can you give us a timeframe, will these costs, will they be a factor in the second half?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, coming back to Europe on especially the cylinder gases business; I mean we have seen a demand weakness in general in Europe, maybe not as much in your areas than in Southern Europe. But do you have currently &#x2013; does that affect your pricing power in an environment when you see increasing natural gases prices maybe, does the weakness affect your pricing power in cylinder gases in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think to the first part of your question, Stephan, that's around steel and chemical. I think that, that is the sector in which we see that. From an startup perspective for the Continental European homecare business, I think we are not prepared to give you the details here, but you have to understand the structure of the integration. And I was referring to that already in discussion earlier. I think it's on a country basis. So these are really five countries. So, it's a very detailed integration in the local markets, which is taking place, and that is what we expected to happen.</p>
          <p>And the only point I want to make here really that you do not see the contribution of the sales in line with an above average EBITDA margin, which is from an run rate perspective the case, as we indicated at the time of transaction, which is of course at that moment in time dilutive because of the cost integration and the setup into different marketplaces.</p>
          <p>Cylinder, this is very important. I think we have seen, as I mentioned, two different trends, one positives in the North, and in the east of Europe, I think where we haven't seen any weaker demand at that moment in time, and then we have seen the south. So from that perspective, steel manufacturing industry is on a very okay level. And as you know, also cylinder is the top of the business, which would react as a later-cycle business in the system from the perspective of the of the gases.</p>

          <p>We are not yet in &#x2013; let's say, in a situation as you have seen it in 2008 and then 2009. We haven't any indication of such a momentum at that moment in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...I think and the combination of segmentations also about the perspective of the value of that product to customers. We always saw very high holding levels from a rental perspective even in the crisis, right?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen an &#x2013; a reduction in the velocity of that business that people were turning then less. But from the holding perspective normally, that is a business where you normally see that the customers are keeping the holdings because it's about their products, service offering, it's about their speed to repay for their customers, and do not lose any time in comparing it to the total value of that product for their cost perspective. So I wouldn't say that we see it at that moment in time.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Norbert Barth, [Baader Bank]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Also three questions from my side. Just relating to the former question, you mentioned that especially in Eastern Europe, still relative good basis business. But what we hear from the macroeconomic side is more and more that also weakness &#x2013; macroeconomic weakness, what we see in Central Europe spreading out also more and more in Eastern. So do you believe going forward for the next, I would say, next two quarters that good situation will also deteriorate in that &#x2013; especially in cylinder business and so on? And perhaps a question relating to Asian and gaining projects, what you said this is quite good pipeline. Do you realize or you notice already some advantage compared to your US peers of the US dollar trend, or you see more the euro weakness? Is that the criteria for gaining projects and you're already a little bit benefit from that?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, sorry, once again a little bit on the acquisition of the homecare Air Products business. If I go in the Interim Report, I see, you said you just don't want to disclose, but I think it's already in the Interim Report that the earnings contribution is around about EUR5 million from that point of view. What I expected is, already a big part of cost, but also of the inventory step up. Can you elaborate on that, so that we already have for the second quarter, I would say, yes, a closer, bigger benefit to the usual run rate business will contribute in future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes. Thank you, Norbert. And I go through your questions as I remind it, on the dollar-euro perspective for the Asian market, if I start with this one. I would say, as you know, we have built hubs for our Engineering business to produce with very strong position from a local content perspective. I think this is very important to understand. But of course, it is not a disadvantage when you see this from an overall perspective. But I also want to point out that we have two halves in the Indian market, we have two halves in the Chinese market. For the projects, we want to win from a gas perspective. And we built that in the local market as much as we can because we are very competitive here. And that is also the reason why we have won a lot of projects in these markets, because of the strong standardization of our products and the second is the local content.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it's definitely not a disadvantage from an overall perspective, but from win projects perspective, it has not influenced, yet the differences between the players, I would say, at least from our perspective.</p>
          <p>And then what you see in the back half of our report is a net income number, right? That's not an EBITDA number. Therefore, I want to leave it with that disclosure here because I think it's too much from a perspective of integration. But as I said, there are integration costs from a systems perspective, on people's perspective, and from the five different local market perspective as expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm looking or I think we're all looking is a little bit, if already in the &#x2013; perhaps in the second half, we would be closer to the usual or typical margin benefit from that business on what--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think I don't give a guidance for that past year. Overall, I would say, in the next year, this business will be fully integrated, so let's talk about that next year in fact. And here I definitely agree to your comment that, that will have an over-proportionate impact compared to the gases margin there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then your first question on the cylinder business and the volume development and demand from an Eastern European perspective. I think, of course, we see different communication of macroeconomic indicators at that point of time. But the average at that moment in time is more positive for 2013 than for 2012, even if we discuss everyday more of that scenarios, the main indicators are seeing 2013 better than 2012. Of course, it could be different. But we don't see it yet in our numbers. This is something I really want to reconfirm here. Eastern Europe looks very strong if we see this, and we don't see a dilutional impact yet because of the macroeconomic development or moods you were referring to. That's not the case at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. First question is on North &#x2013; well, on America. Obviously, the underlying growth slowed from 6% in the first quarter to 1% in the second quarter on a comparable basis. And I'm just trying to square it with the comments you made because you were indicating that certainly the bulk business was still okay in North America. Latin America is strong. Just wondering &#x2013; I know it's a very tough comparable year-on-year. Just wondering why that happened. What was behind the slowdown in growth?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on sort of price-on-price effect that you're seeing in the industrial merchant in Europe. I know you are up against a stronger comparable on price as well, because you have the template which meant you got pricing in earlier than the peers. I mean, the US major are pointing at European pricing and those sort of businesses still up 2%. Just wondering if there's an effect that means that your year-on-year pricing inevitably is slowing against a tough comparable when I look in the sort of packaged gas, bulk business in Europe. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for your questions. So when we look into North America, I think, you see really that there is an performance &#x2013; as I was referring to that in my presentation, there's an performance based on the Healthcare business, on the cylinder business, especially in the Canadian market and the bulk business overall in the US market supported by the manufacturing industry. So, these are the main characteristics. Then when we put Americas in context to South America, we have seen an softening in some of the South American markets, for example, the Brazilian market. And overall, South America was, of course, strong from an performance perspective, hence we see this. But these are the major contributors to the development in our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But for the slowdown Q2 on Q1 in terms of year-on-year growth, what was the drag factor then? Was it selling some carbon dioxide or--?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think one was &#x2013; if I mention the Brazilian market, I think the Brazilian market was much softer from an overall American perspective. And then, of course &#x2013; but I think that is something which is clear from an comparable perspective, you also have seen that the gas price was also again negatively influencing the North American sales number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the European price situation, perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The European prices perspective, I think of course you could argue it will become tougher because we have one price initiative already in the last year and then we now move into the second half quarter, that this will be tougher. This is what you meant, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From current perspective, I think we are working and we explained that to many of you in all dimensions, and that is driven by products, it's driven by industries, and it is driven by the position in the related areas. And of course, I think the biggest influence at that moment in time comes out of the South European footprint, which is from all perspective, of course, the smaller footprint. This is most negative development if you compare that. And I wouldn't argue now that the second-half will become more difficult because we did a price imitative &#x2013; price initiative in the second half of 2011. I wouldn't argue at that moment in time when I see the development in the other strong markets, and I was referring to them in Eastern Europe and in Scandinavia. At that moment in time, I wouldn't see that, but of course if volumes are softer, that's a logical trend, then pricing power is more difficult. And that moment in time, the order backlog from a customer perspective are still well filled. This was also my point when I referred to Norbert's question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I was to assume the European industrial merchant price inflation was still around 2% U.S gases, would that be a number that was a reasonable estimate or is that, just to clarify?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think a 2%, for example, for the Eastern European market, at that movement in time, it's definitely something I would work with. I would be a little bit more soft in Continental and Northern Europe because of the mix here, Southern Europe included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre, [Merrill Lynch International]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my two questions. The first one is on the take-or-pay on the Tonnage business in Europe. I was wondering if you could tell us what proportion of your business is at or close to take-or-pay levels. And in particular, I'm thinking about the steel industry where &#x2013; and we see the utilization rates going down and it looks like they will go further down into Q3?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on all the startups in the second half. Could you tell us more or less how many &#x2013; well, how many startups or can you give us some color on what's going to be consolidated versus what's going to be in JVs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from an take-or-pay perspective, from today's viewpoint, I think we have I think an very favorable footprint from an steel perspective in Europe. And therefore we cannot report a major take-or-pay levels from an customer perspective at that moment in time. Nevertheless, I agree with your conclusion that second half can be tougher. But you know that our footprint is more Continental East, very special in the North always from an perspective of product offering from our steel customers. So, we are not totally negative. If you read newspapers on steel trends, then you now move further to Western Europe.</p>
          <p>And on the second question, I think the startup situation is something which we don't disclose, but it is mainly driven by really consolidated new trends. When we talk about new trends, it's consolidated. But also of course the Abu Dhabi scheme, which is ramping up from an perspective of nitrogen support for the gas field, which is a joint venture activity. Here we are still ramping up a little bit. But that is the biggest joint venture activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can ask the third question, on the Air Products acquisition, did you include it in the comparable growth, because it was only part of your business or part of the quarter, i.e., will it be outside of the comparable growth from Q3, or will you still include it in comparable growth for Q3 and Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we always disclosed the number, which is in our comparison included. I think this is very important point, we want to be transparent for that. Nevertheless, this is really also something where we see that this is a bolt-on acquisition, where we accelerate and ramp-up in homecare through that acquisition. But we always will disclose that to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so it will be the same for Lincare?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lincare is not a bolt-on acquisition any more where you would say you will include that in comparable growth, right, and that's a different story here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from Evgenia Molotova. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes, Evgenia Molotova from Citigroup, and I have three questions, if I may. The first one is actually to clarify about the pricing because as far as I remember, in Q4 when you had very strong growth, approximately half of it came from pricing. So if you could look at 2.7% organic growth rate in Q2, can you somehow guide us about the split between pricing and volumes?</p>
          <p>The second question is about &#x2013; it's actually a follow-up on the last questions. Do you see your clients, for example, in chemical industry managing their inventories more carefully in July? And now, do you see utilization rates of your plants coming down, and what utilization rates do you have at the moment?</p>
          <p>And the last one is on the return on capital employed on the target for 2014. With all the acquisitions that you're making, which are dilutive in a short-term for the return on capital employed, do you still &#x2013; how do you intend to achieve this goal of 14%? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Evgenia for your questions. I think what I can allude to is that price is, I think, from the overall perspective rather two-thirds and volume is one-third from an overall perspective. That is how we see it from today's perspective. Related to stock level of specific customer segments like chemicals, there is no pattern there. I can say that there is a tougher management from a stock level perspective at that moment in time. You also know that the gases perspective is also very different when you have backlog &#x2013; backlog in the system. So here I wouldn't say that this is something where we have an understanding now that is turning into a more negative situation.</p>
          <p>I have the experience that they were managing any way, their working capital since 2008, much tighter than it was ramping up until 2008. And from a return on capital employed perspective, your third question, as we shared with you, and I don't know if we were clear enough. But we said that, of course, we cannot achieve the 2014 target, this 14% ROCE on an adjusted basis. That is now for rather 2015 the number, which we do have in our plans, then we include the acquisitions and investments.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Thomas Gilbert, [UBS]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Couple of number crunching questions, please. You had a guidance for Lincare of &#x2013; the net financial results of EUR330 million, and in the light of that the second quarter came in a bit lower. Just wondering whether there were any sort of &#x2013; whether the financial &#x2013; income from finance leases was higher, or whether there was non-cash currency results, if you could allude to that and give a guidance ex-Lincare or including Lincare, if you can, for the financial results for the year? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, just so we can model the cash flow for the order backlog excluding the captive portion, what is sort of a typical level of prepayment customers pay? Do you think the same is true for the shale gas business, so do you apply the same sort of strategy? And I remember the numbers being 10% and 20% of the contract value.</p>
          <p>And then the third question is coming back to Laurent's question on on-site growth. So, if I listen to this call and put it all together, you had a EUR40 million hit in the second quarter to on-site growth. A large &#x2013; some of the startups is consolidated and you're not worried about operating rates of your customers going down. That means we should see a significant triple-digit euro million increase sequentially in the on-site volume, is that what you're seeing and what you're thinking and what your budget is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we move into the budget discussion, Thomas. I think that's very difficult. But first to the financing question, I think I want to exclude here the Lincare part as Dominik mentioned in the opening for the call. So the number is somewhere between EUR330 million and EUR350 million, I would argue. From a perspective of prepayments infrastructure of the shale gas business, I think this is the same pattern. And if you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So 10% to 20% is a good number, anyway as a value of &#x2013; as a prepayments for the value of the contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. I think you were mentioning 10% to 20%, so I would take the average of 10% to 20% recommendation. And then the ramp-up related to the tonnage business is, as I said in my opening, I think depending on only one customer situation, the number is around this EUR100 million you're referring to, but it's exclusive and customer supply scheme, which is more volatile at that moment in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I just come back on the financial results? It was EUR71 million in the quarter, which points to a much lower annual outcome. So the EUR330 million to EUR350 million ex-Lincare implies there was something in the second quarter to the financial income, which was other than borrowing costs, which was beneficial. Can you say what that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do have some smaller contributions from dividend payments of participations, but that's a very small number. Your model is really great. I can confirm that with you, but that's a number, which is below EUR10 million, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Jean de Watteville from Nomura. Most of my questions have been answered. Can I just have some clarifications, if I can? First of all, coming back on Peter's question that referred to America, but thinking more broadly for the Cylinders and Bulk divisions. Your comments allude to the positive markets, positive development in North America, positive development in North and Eastern Europe. But what we saw is quite a material slowdown of growth for both Cylinders and Bulk in the second quarter. So why is that? Is that because &#x2013; and we know your exposure to Brazil and South Europe is pretty small. So, is that, that South Europe and Brazil has been extremely poor in that quarter, or there is a general trend of worsening month-by-month in all regions? If you can bring a little more color to reconcile those numbers, it would be very helpful.</p>
          <p>The second clarification is on Asia Pacific. Your margins are actually up in the first half of this year, correct me if I'm wrong. But I think in the past you said that the &#x2013; you expect margins to be down in 2012 versus last year, because of the step-up of investments. Can you please clarify how we should look at the way you're looking at the margin progression in Asia Pacific? And is the investment you're doing for growth initiative in Asia Pacific, is that a one-off effect this year, or it's more the kind of regular year-by-year increase of fixed cost to backup people's initiative?</p>
          <p>And the last question is going back on the mix of growth in Tonnage between on-site and subsidiary. Of course, if we compare Linde with some other companies, you have more projects in joint ventures. But it seems to me that you're doing some progress and signing more contracts at a 100% basis. Can you confirm that, that the split that you gave, EUR600 million on the EUR4.7 billion is actually a smaller share of joint venture than what you had on the last five years? And how do you see that progressing step-by-step? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll start with your last question, Jean. I can confirm that this is becoming a much smaller number based on the Abu Dhabi scheme. I mean, the Abu Dhabi scheme is EUR400 million ex-share investment. If you see that graph, and the future as I said is &#x2013; in 2012 it's a number around EUR70 million, 2013 is similar number or smaller number; 2014 and 2015, I think are is zero at that point in time. So, definitely that trend is as you outlined it.</p>
          <p>From an Americas perspective, I think you really have to &#x2013; and I think this is the biggest points, so the order of my answer was not the order by magnitude, the order of my answer was not referring. So, I should start with the feedstock effect from a perspective of Gases. And the biggest impact in North America for us is EUR37 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry to interrupt you. My question is cylinder and bulk organic growth globally and North America, organic growth for cylinder. So taking apart the natural gas pass-through and globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I missed that because I heard you asking about Brazil and therefore I was referring to Americas. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I was not clear, and.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the cylinder business, the growth trends in the cylinder business. So first of all, the North American market for us is mainly an Canadian market for packaged gases offering, which is positive at that moment in prime. And then specialty gas market mainly in the US. As you know that this is not our typical packaged gases market as we have it in the other markets.</p>
          <p>When we then do the world trip, then we can include positively the South Pacific market especially and also some of the Asian market, because here we are ramping up new activities compared to previous years. I think this is also something you have to understand, because in many of these markets, you start with on-site. You do then the wholesale bulk business, you move into direct customer relationships on the bulk side, and then you move into cylinder businesses. And this is our strategy and therefore that is supported out of that.</p>
          <p>And then we do have the European markets and the split here. And probably one support also in our volume perspective is, of course, an impact from a seasonality perspective of cylinders for the LPG business, which is also the Africa, where you have the southern hemisphere at that point in time where you have winter and therefore you have that. This is not different from the previous year let's say it that way. But there's a seasonal impact which we have through the LPG business. So, this is something which I can give to you as an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I guess &#x2013; sorry if my question is not clear, my question is the year-on-year growth in cylinders in Q2 is much lower than in Q1. Now, you are pointing out for the markets that are in good shape. I would like to understand what is driving that number down, is it just South Europe and Brazil that is driving the slowdown, or there is also a slowdown across the board? We want an understanding of the reason for that slowdown. In other words, the markets that are not in good shape at the moment that explains the figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's all relative to compare what is good shape in this space and what is bad shape, let's say that way. But you are right from the perspective. On an year-to-date perspective, this market is down by 2 percentage points when you compare that. So, 3% in quarter one, roughly 1% in quarter two, if you have the year-to-date comparison, it's 3% and then now 2%. So this has to do, as you said, with the effect of the previous quarters a little bit. And then you have the negative effect of the Southern Europe as I said, which is nevertheless in bulk and &#x2013; sorry, and cylinder business for us. And it is also a volume effect, which you see in South America from some markets. And that is Brazil for example, and it also is, for example, Argentina which was not so strong. So some of these end markets, but it's not in total deteriorating trend from the perspective you were now alluding to.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and then your third question about the CapEx and &#x2013; and sorry, about the ramp-up of additional cost in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is really something which is related to the CapEx number, which we do have under execution. So it's not a normal year-on-year ramp-up, but of course you can say it's kind of normal because we always have a very strong pipeline in the Asian markets from a Tonnage perspective and from additional bulk business. But it's really related to our capacity, which is in the market available and where you have a ramp-up of application engineering, but where you also have a ramp-up of some other SG&amp;A cost, because you have a broader footprint. We have more entities. So it's really the ramp-up of our footprint, which gives you the basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you expect full year margins to be down in Asia versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is what we said at the beginning of the year and which we want to confirm again, because this is related to the CapEx under execution. This is significant.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:57). Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>So, if there are no further questions on the line, then I really want to thank you for the lively discussion we had. And I wish you if possible a nice summer break, looking forward to talk to you. Bye-bye and have a good day.</p>
