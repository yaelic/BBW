        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you and most welcome to the Volvo Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Conference Call. I am here in Gothenburg where we also had our press conference up in Stockholm. We have our different business area leaders and our CFO in the room and they will talk about their different business areas, responsibilities as we proceed through the conference call and then we will open up for any questions or comments you may have.</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying that we have handed out a pack of slides. They should be &#x2013; have been made available to you over the &#x2013; our site and we will talk about the headlines there and also as we go through the numbers on there.</p>
          <p>We have had a press conference up in Stockholm and a well-attended one. Let me tell you that one of the things that came out of that press conference is a headline here that is very much misrepresenting what I said when it came to acquisitions. I think we have told all of you before that we are satisfied where we are with acquisitions. We don't see any big acquisitions coming, and that is still our position. We have not changed our position vis a vis that.</p>
          <p>The reporter who is saying that I think that acquisitions are good is really saying that I think acquisition has been good, and that they are a natural way to grow in our type of industry, but I've also said that I don't think that's a situation that we are in right now and that we don't see any big acquisitions coming. So we have not changed our stand with that. It's a clear misrepresentation of what I actually said. And by the way, what I said is on tape, so we can substantiate that.</p>
          <p>Let me go to point, slide two and Group highlights on the fourth quarter of 2009. And you see there an operating loss of 2.3 billion, and we have 1.4 there are one-offs included in that number. We had a very strong cash flow, and with that, net debt reduced by 9 billion, driven by a very good reduction in inventories and then also the leverage of payables coming back as we are beginning now in light of the much improved order intake to turn on production slightly more than what we have done in Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>It is fair to say that we think in Europe that the market is improving. Different business areas, and I can say it's got a picture across Europe. Obviously, continental Europe and the northern part of Europe doing better there. Countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy clearly doing less good. But all in all, as you will see on the order intake rate for trucks, we see a market in Europe improving.</p>
          <p>It's fair to say that in Asia and South America, when we say they are strong recovery, we did have a dip in the beginning, but we are at even very high levels from an absolute level in Asia and South America and doing very well there. While in North America, we have not seen an improvement. A slight blip in order intake or uptrend in order intake in quarter three in North America, we think was more of a little of the pre-buy effect, very little. And then we have not seen North America come along. I'll show you the size of North America now in relation to order intake to show you how low North America, how small the North American market has become in view of history and in view of what's happening around the world. Therefore, we do expect the North America to come back up but that's yet to happen.</p>
          <p>And on the year of 2009, where we made losses, operating losses and substantial losses here, we &#x2013; the Board has declared that their recommendation to the general assembly is to have no dividend paid out for 2009 in 2010.</p>
          <p>We go to the next slide, you see, which is slide number three, headlines of Volvo Group. You'll see that this quarter was actually the first quarter in quite many now where sales started to turn up. Now there is normally a seasonal effect between Q3 and Q4, but this time around, it is higher than the normal seasonal effects. We think we are beginning to see actually a little of the strength there, but it's not to be seen as a major improvement. But still stabilization or a slight improvement here compared to the gradient that we have watched sales fall before in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>And operating income down with the 1.4 of one-offs, you see improving there with the terrible quarter four in vivid memory &#x2013; quarter two in vivid memory of '09. You look at the fourth quarter there and you see sales. You see that North America now has actually come down to 70% of turnover. Western Europe, which is usually way above 40, is down to 38. And we now have more than 45% of our sales in Asia, in other markets, South America and Eastern Europe. And that we think is a reflection of how the financial crisis has hit the different markets, that the greatest hit then in North America and Western Europe, much less so in Asia. And it's also a reflection of the very considerable investments we have made geographically over the past many years now taking very good positions in Eastern Europe, South America, but also in Asia and other markets.</p>
          <p>And obviously the operating income in itself, significantly lower sales volumes then on q-on-q comparison. If you take Q4 '08 compared to Q4 '09, we have had considerable downsizing costs including some closures of factories, we have given you the details of in Q4. But we're also happy to note that cost reductions and good work with cash flow has worked, and have been quite effective over the past many quarters now even though &#x2013; and now we see sales coming perhaps slightly in the rebound here.</p>
          <p>With that we have slide five and we have, no, slide four, we should have somewhere. And I'll hand over &#x2013; and that slide says Annual Cost Level and I'll hand over to Mikael with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The first point I would like to tackle with you here is to report back on the costs reductions that we have announced during 2009 here and where we had a very clear ambition here to bring down the annual cost level with 21 billion. And I'm very pleased to report to you here now that the implementation of these activities has been fulfilled. We'll see now the hitting the P&amp;L with full force so to speak from the second quarter of 2010 since we have all the delay there. We have gone through all cost items in the P&amp;L segment here so you will find it both in the operational expenses and up in the gross income line when we move forward here.</p>
          <p>With that said, it doesn't mean that our cost focus will stop here. We will certainly continue to reduce cost as we need going forward here depending on the weakness levels. But what is important here is that very important milestone has been passed when it comes to cost reduction.</p>
          <p>Let's move on down to page five and the really good news in this quarter, where we for the third quarter in a row have seen a trend improvement when it comes to cash flow and Q4 shows not only a positive cash flow but also with some historic measurements really strong cash flow. I will say considering the business environment we are currently in, the 8.6 it's one of the strongest quarter for a very long time in the book.</p>
          <p>One very important part &#x2013; the important part in the cash flow here is, of course, the working capital which you can see on page six. And the working capital in the quarter here was a positive, close to 12 billion. The important ingredient there is of course inventory. That came down with 5.6 in the quarter. With that it also means that we reach the target which we communicated to you early in 2009 which was that we should release 15 billion of inventory throughout 2009 and that has now been achieved.</p>
          <p>Also, payables had a positive effect in the fourth quarter here. Payables have been the challenge throughout 2009 where we, from peak to trough, so to speak, saw impact in the magnitude of 20 billion plus in the negative and year to date now we have a negative impact of 14, which means that we had good contribution towards the end of year here, which is expected as production volumes are coming back up. And of course payables will be important when we gradually improve productions here moving forward. So payables will be an important contributor.</p>
          <p>On the inventory side, we could say there that in the interim we have reached a level when we talked about new equipment and that is normalized. We have also used inventory where I think we can find some opportunities going forward here. Q1 is always a seasonal tough quarter from a cash flow perspective as we build some inventory for the spring season here in some parts of the Group here. But so far I would say we are very pleased with the performance in working capital.</p>
          <p>Another area, which is important from a cash flow perspective is also the CapEx investment where we had an ambition to bring that down with 10 to 15% in 2009 and I can also there say that we met that requirement.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to page seven, our net financial position, which as the consequence of the improved cash flow situation, has been strengthened. Our net debt to equity ratio has come down now to 70.9% and we saw the stabilization already in Q2 and we have now moved in the right direction in a strong way, I would say.</p>
          <p>Liquidity wise we are also in a good position there. We have 71 billion available, so to speak. Out of the 71, 38 billion is cash equivalent. And also when we look forward here into 2010 and 2011, we have very limited maturities in the debt portfolio here. So here we have a good and strong position, and we have maintained a conservative approach here.</p>
          <p>And let me also comment here as you see the pension has come down from previous year here. We have moved the VEBA fund obligation. As you know, we negotiated with UAW earlier on in 2009 where we have done a liability into the VEBA fund of US$525 million, and about SEK 3.7 billion. That has been reclassified now in the fourth quarter here to become financial debt instead of a pension liability.</p>
          <p>So in summary, cost program implemented. Strong cash flow in the quarter coming from positive working capital, and a strong and stable financial position.</p>
          <p>That's all there. Thank you, Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Now we are at slide eight. Then in the back-end we are with the headline Trucks there and as you can see here, and I'll show you later on, we had an improving demand. Sales were up by 24% versus Q3, but still down an amazing 30% versus Q4 '08, which really wasn't the best quarter we have had either. So clearly we are now looking at low markets and performing at low markets even if the trend is upwards.</p>
          <p>We see an operating loss reduced there and lower sales there, you can say clearly offset by cost reductions but not so much so that we were able to yet break even there. Inventories of new Trucks is interesting because basically we feel that with this quarter we have cleared inventories of new products all over the Group but it's true also on Trucks. And we are now looking at running at this level of inventory or even in some business areas likely to see building inventory for Q1 for sales in Q2. We would probably make a note also to say that we still have slightly high inventories on used Trucks in particular places in Europe; say for example in Eastern Europe. But all in all, inventory's in very good shape after this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now important, of course, as we go focus here now, if and when we are slowly turning on production make sure that we can do that with good cost control and with good leverage as we turn up. In the next couple of quarters there also importantly we have this introduction of a US10 engines and we have also noted today that we have an approved engine for the Japanese market and that that product is meeting the requirement that we put upon ourselves when we bought Nissan Diesel to get Group Engines into this year and get the synergies with that.</p>
          <p>And we ticked off at the press conference the message that we are well in line to meet with our 200 million euro target five years into the introduction of all the acquisition of Nissan Diesel, so that's good. A little more problematic there on the U.S. side because there we are looking at engines that should not have been stockpiled in the first quarter. Our impression is that even though we don't know the numbers that somehow our competitors have more US07 engines lined up for manufacturing in &#x2013; manufacturing of trucks in Q1 and Q2 than and what regulatory authorities allowed and what we felt was allowed from a regulatory point of view.</p>
          <p>So I think I've used the term before here that we have a couple of messy quarters, quarter one and quarter two ahead of us here with the introduction of US10. The good news is that the engines have now been fully certified at the levels where they need to be to be fully US10 certified and on top of that we are showing very good fuel efficiency on those engines so much so the customers can count on about 5% improvement compared to the US07 engine. So good news from the technology and the product point of view and a little unclear situation on the stockpiling of engines and the impact that might have short term quarter one and quarter two in the North American market.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Heavy-duty Truck market for Europe and we said last quarter that we think that that market is going up. I think this quarter confirms that. We are now calling the market to be up by about 10% in 2010 and we think the order intakes support that. So, you can see that we are now very far from the historic trend line in Europe and we think perhaps one way to look at this is that we've been through a financial liquidity crisis worldwide that has dropped markets much, much more than they would normally do in a normal business cycle and perhaps you can say that we are coming into a more normal business cycle now but from below instead.</p>
          <p>And we will see how that runs out over the next couple of quarters here. But confirming the upward trend that we spoke about in Q3, you could say that about North America too, but with less strength. If you look at what we are actually now saying for North America, we think that the market will be up &#x2013; this is slide ten now &#x2013; the market will be up by between 20 and 30%.</p>
          <p>Unless, yes, if you do the arithmetic, and you say the market will be up by 25% off of the low point of 115 there in '09, then you actually arrive at the second worst or the third worst year ever for the history of 20 years almost. So you can say even though percentage-wise it sounds aggressive, in absolute numbers it is certainly not that.</p>
          <p>Unlike in Europe, we are also in North America. As you know, we have an old population running there and we have that also across construction equipment, for example. But yet to see a real strong order intake trend there.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide 11, then you see the actual numbers and we thought we would give you the actual numbers rather than trying to discuss this in different terms. You see Europe actually there Q4 on Q3 is up 78%. North America is slightly down and we think that that 5,000 number was more perhaps the only very limited pre-buy that there was in North America, but you can say North America is stable there.</p>
          <p>South America is up yet again. And off, as you can see there, on very high levels. Asia, also up and on quite high levels. And then we have other markets, very stable. Just as a reflection there you can see that South America now is bigger in order intakes than North America is and that's not something that over the long-term we would expect to be true. And we think there is probably nothing wrong with South America there, but if with any historic measurements, North America is still at very, very low levels there.</p>
          <p>If you do the arithmetic between Q4 '08 and Q4 '09, you arrive at a whopping 179% I think, perhaps more relevant to see quarter-on-quarter progression there where you see 13 going up to 38 over the last five quarters. And you see the downturn really then on the &#x2013; at the trough being in Q4 '08. Some of that, of course, was cancellations.</p>
          <p>With that let me hand over to Olof Persson and construction equipment. Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Leif. The total world market condition for the construction equipment industry is still weak with a drop of 12% in the quarter and 39% for the full year. In the quarter, Europe was down 12%. Both North America and international decreased by as much as 40 quarter-over-quarter. Asia however, we saw a growth of 24%, strongly driven by China that increased by the full 82%. Our sales declined by 6%, adjusted for exchange rates and our operating losses came down quarter-over-quarter in 2009 and the loss in Q4 was reduced by 55% compared to the year ago.</p>
          <p>In addition, to the Asheville restructuring charge, we also took a write-down of around SEK 100 million related to obsolete production material in China and Korea. This quarter was another quarter with substantial inventory reduction creating good cash flow but low production utilization. Our inventories were reduced by another 17% in the quarter and a full 47% for the full year. Thereby our inventories are now in good balance with the present customer demands and we now basically produce direct to customer order.</p>
          <p>Main focus in Volvo C is now to leverage on the cost cutting program we introduced in connection to the reorganization. I expect this will have a positive impact on our result in 2010 &#x2013; for the full year 2010 with an amount of around SEK 1 billion. Our new strategy for the period 2010 to '12 will also help us to improve our performance. Key words in this strategy are cost reductions, world-class machine upside and a focus on profitable segments.</p>
          <p>When it comes to our production effort, I think flexibility is now the key word in those still rather uncertain markets. We have the flexibility with activities we have done during 2009 to be able to reduce and increase our volumes to meet the market demands.</p>
          <p>As you can see in our quarterly report, we expect a modest growth of demand in Europe and North America for 2010. Asia and other markets are expected to grow by 10 to 20%. China is expected to grow with around 20% and we have presented a range of four new SDLG branded 13 to 29 ton excavators that will be introduced to the Chinese markets during 2010, which is of course the biggest in the world when it comes to excavators. I think that concludes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>That takes us from Construction Equipment into slide 13, Buses and H&#xE5;kan Karlsson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The bus markets stabilized on a low level, with we'll say clear recovery in South America and in Asia. 2009 has been a challenging year for us in the Bus industry because the Coach market more or less collapsed during this year. That means that the market &#x2013; Coach market in Mexico was down 60%, in U.S., 35, in South America, 50 and in Europe, 35.</p>
          <p>That has been compensate with a fairly stable City Bus market and for us that means that we lost approximately 1,500 Coaches, which has then been compensated by City Buses in China and India. And that naturally has hampered our profitability.</p>
          <p>We have, during the year, strengthened our market shares both in North, South America and International. So we are not so much down as the general market.</p>
          <p>We had a strong order intake in the fourth quarter, plus 30%. And that is representing orders in all regions and that has then resulted in an order bank that is much better compared to last year when we now enter into 2010.</p>
          <p>We had an operating loss in the quarter, mainly driven by the product and market mix change then but also that we had some one-time cost items. And that especially regarding the problems we have had in Nova Bus to deliver our vehicles because we got some key suppliers in Chapter 11 there and we had a sharp deadline to the Vancouver with 300 vehicles so we were pushed then to add a lot more capacity. So that has cost a fair amount of money during the fourth quarter but we managed to deliver the buses and we have now reduced that extra capacity.</p>
          <p>We have also reduced the inventories in a good way. Almost SEK 1 billion reduction in the fourth quarter. We have pushed out the old inventories because we are heading to the emission upgrade there. So we are in a good balance regarding the inventories. And also there our cost programs shows result in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In Focus going forward, we continue to reduce our break-even levels in all region to really be profitable on the current volumes and product market mix. In our factories, we are driving a huge program there to reduce the product cost and efficiency and we are now in the introduction of the Euro 5 new products, which are doing well and we are preparing for the US10 and we also prepare our introduction of the Hybrids in the second quarter. And there we can see the order intake is picking up now for Hybrids in Europe. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then we have slide 14. We have Volvo Penta and G&#xF6;ran Gummeson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Leif. The total delivery of Submarine and Industrial Engines were quite low during the fourth quarter and demand during the end of the period actually picked up and improved then gradually both actually in the U.S. and also in Europe.</p>
          <p>Then by the end of December actually our order book was 15% higher than the corresponding month of previous year and the positive trend has continued, I can tell you as a result of the international boat shows now in the beginning of January both in London and D&#xFC;sseldorf.</p>
          <p>Well, we had a positive operating income during the quarter despite the fact that sales dropped actually 18% compared to last year. And there's an effect then from all the downsizing activities that we have carried through and also the lower break-even level that we have, of course, as we are operating right now.</p>
          <p>We have also managed to reduce our global inventory successfully and by created a good and strong cash flow throughout the year. In Focus for us now moving forward, we must secure production and deliveries from our global supply chain. We have already increased the production rate in our plants in Valla in Sweden and also in Lexington in the U.S. in order to meet the gradually stronger demand from &#x2013; for Marine Engines.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Industrial Engines, we have some important emission legislation steps that will come into force during 2011 and 2014 and for us this is a windows of opportunities toward new Industrial Engine customers actually.  And we expect to see a growth in this segment over the coming years as we have a competitive range of emission compliant engines based on the group's diesel program, of course.</p>
          <p>And finally, we will continue to build on the successful IPS system that we launched some years back. And at the London boat show we actually introduced the third and largest type drive unit,  together with the Group's 13-liter engine. This powerful package can deliver power outputs corresponding to up to more than 1,200 horsepowers. And with the total, the range now of IPS systems we can offer powers for boat all the way up to 100, plus 100 feet up to 100, roughly 120 feet actually.</p>
          <p>And the IPS is by far the world's most efficient and environmentally friendly system for these type of boats. So we received today also what is for various type of commercial vessels actually, such as patrol boats, supply boats, et cetera. So we expect here to move further on with this and grow the IPS business even during the years ahead. So that's all for Volvo Penta.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay that takes us to Volvo Aero, Staffan Zackrisson, and slide 15.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Start with some general comments about the market. Air traffic has gradually recovered during the later part of 2009 and turned positive in November. Also, the air cargo traffic improved sharply during the fall, which is a good indicator of world economy as such. Our customers' airlines are still facing difficulties and had a bad cash flow and balance sheet, but we are expecting them to improve during 2010.</p>
          <p>Our sales were down 18% during the quarter and what is especially difficult is that our spares sales has gone down nearly 26%, which, of course, are high margin parts of our sales. So the profitability beyond fourth quarter went down sharply and we have no more activities in after market had impacts of the airline situation and also on our distribution services side we have had extra costs during the fourth quarter. What was a good sign for the industry is that the Boeing 787 had its maiden flight and we are in both engines that can be chosen for that aircraft.</p>
          <p>If we look into the In Focus items, of course, our cost management and the decisions in the cost package that we are driving will have its impact during 2010. And also the after-market business is under review to get a better margin on both parts of the business as well. The 787 for us means that we're starting to ramp up production during 2010, and it's our most vital importance of the Company since we have large investments and costs tied to that program, in the GEnx program, but we are executing on those new contracts. And that completes the Volvo Aero.</p>

          <p>And if technology works well, now we shall have Sal Mauro with us from New Jersey. Sal, could we introduce you and do Financial Services on slide 16?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Leif. Thank you. Looking at the new retail financing, our volume is somewhat flat quarter over quarter. Slight increase in the fourth quarter and much lower than last year. The credit portfolio has decreased by about 16% over the last 12 months. And this is directly related to the retail volume decreases we've seen at our sister business areas and also a decrease in our penetration levels.</p>
          <p>Looking at operating income for the quarter, basically break even, about SEK 15 million in profitability, which is a good sign and a good start. And this level of profitability is basically driven by higher credit provisions than last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the highlights, the economic environment continues to be challenging especially in Eastern Europe. But it must to be noted that many of our markets are profitable, most notably the Americas where we have Brazil and Canada leading the way. However, loss incurred in Spain and Eastern Europe resulted in a consolidated loss for the year. We see some stabilization of the credit portfolio. This is a good sign. Delinquencies are starting to come down even with a decreasing portfolio. So we're starting to see our 30-day and 90-day delinquencies stabilizing and in many areas are actually coming down, which is a good first sign.</p>
          <p>Inventory levels are beginning to stabilize. In many markets we're selling more than we're actually repossessing so obviously inventory levels are coming down. And it's good to note that used equipment values, while at a relatively low level are stabilizing and in some markets we're seeing some slight improvements, which is good news. In focus, we're continuing to support our customers as we've said many times before we're not fair weather friends. While we've learned some very valuable lessons from this severe downturn especially in Eastern Europe, we continue to support our customers and dealers while diligently looking at our credit standards.</p>
          <p>More specifically, looking at our risk mitigation in Eastern Europe we've had our challenges and these challenges, I believe, will continue in the near future but we've worked with our customers in, I think, a very good way addressing their needs. And where they weren't able to meet their commitments obviously we've repossessed the units and we're in process of mitigating those losses as best as we can. We've learned many lessons. We're now applying them and creating what we consider good integrated offers with our sister DAs.</p>
          <p>With the decrease in the portfolio and a decrease in our volume, obviously we're continuing to work on reducing our costs and expenses further and we'll be doing that for some time to become as efficient as possible and continue to decrease our expenses going forward. With that, that concludes my comments for Volvo Financial Services.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Sal. Let's go to Group Summary then on slide 17. There we had a fourth quarter which was much lower than Q4 '08 in sales but actually 23% higher than Q3. An operating loss of 2.3 with some one-offs there and an improving curve when it comes to the level of losses that we have sustained over the year really with a black quarter of Q2 as the turning point. Operating cash flow very positive news, and really based on this successful reduction of inventories, and then gradually the leverage that we have with, normally have with payables as we increase production rates.</p>
          <p>With that, we also took the opportunity to decrease our net debt by almost 9 million, and we are right in the process then of introducing the cleanest ever, heavy-duty diesel engines in U.S. and Japan. Technology-wise ready to start that, and then we have the opportunity to also offer our customers a 5% better fuel efficiency than they had in previous generations of engines, on top of from a Group point of view, actually making them Group engines, and with that take off the synergy list that we had especially when we're focused on Diesel in Japan. It seems to be that is working well.</p>
          <p>But as we come into the next couple of quarters then, clearly with demand recovering with the inventories in line, we are going to increase production. We are cautious there, because we obviously see a &#x2013; some risk at least, even though we don't say it, but potentially there's the risk of a plateauing with exit strategies in different countries are being executed. So we are doing that with a real view of keeping flexibility high, and also to do it with good control. And with that, gain productivity, and we also expect in a normal year, more normal year like 2010 to be able to throw off cash flow again, even though in the first quarter as you know, we typically build a little inventory as for &#x2013; as we get prepared for deliveries in Q2 with the seasonal factor we normally have.</p>
          <p>With that, let me conclude the presentation from our side. And operator, start any Q&amp;A questions that may be here.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Mr. Nico Dil from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three questions, please. First of all on LatAm, we saw a very good order rate here in the quarter. I was wondering, you know you provide fantastic guidance for the other areas, it lacks in LatAm. I was wondering whether you can give a bit of color here, how long you think it can extend it? Perhaps a bit of quantification like you provide for North America and Europe. The second question is you said it lagged a little bit in Spain and Italy. Could you quantify what the exposure is for yourself in Trucks to Italy and Spain? And lastly, a question for Mikael, last year I saw in the balance sheet items, I saw an unrecognized actuarial loss of about 9 billion, and I was wondering whether that has been reduced at all or whether that is still at the same level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think on the outlook for the other geographies than North America and Europe. Obviously, they are &#x2013; come together from many different bits and pieces, as you realize when we have, for example, other markets in Asia there. We do see continued strength in India and China and they are the big markets in Asia. We don't see a very strong up-turn in Japan even though speculation is that it might come up slightly. But Japan is still at historically very low levels and not coming up very quickly, while India and China are at historically fairly high levels and continuing to grow.</p>
          <p>South America, Brazil looks very strong and no reason to really doubt that they survived the crisis very well as a country and as a continent. And if we now have a broader recovery, we think they will continue to do well. On the whole of the other markets there, we see a slight reduction. Those are very mixed, everything all the way from Africa to the Middle East and individual countries that from our point of view, perhaps, are more representative of, for example, getting reasonable financing in the Middle East more than economic recovery there. I think refrain from giving a forecast. It's very much tendering or financing business there.</p>
          <p>Then on the exposure in Italy and Spain, our exposure &#x2013; my intention was not to say that there was an exposure other than the fact that we have a very slow markets there. Construction, for example, in Spain has not come back yet and I could say, almost at all. Italy is clearly slow in industrial development and we are concerned both with Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece that exit strategies of different kinds might put a &#x2013; troubles on their markets as such. But where we are, our intention was not to point to any special exposure that we have. And aside from the fact that we are &#x2013; we don't have a good market there.</p>
          <p>And let's see, on the third question there, Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the pension side, if I understand you right, your question was the unrecognized sector and a loss compared to last year. Last year, it was 9.8 billion. And this year, it's 9.4. So, slightly better or at the same level, I would say.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Patrik Sjoblom from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Patrik Sjoblom from Cheuvreux. Two questions, if I may. First of all, when it comes to you mentioning about 2 billion of under-absorption in the quarter. Now when you look at your order book, your production plans, and you're also saying that inventory seems to have somehow normalized. Would you say that you are not going to have or experience this kind of under-absorption now in the beginning of the year? Or how should we think about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mikael, you want to speak to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think &#x2013; I don't want to give you a forecast of it, so but what I could say is that, of course, that when we go forward here, and if production rates starts to crank up here as we're expecting, it will go away. But I think to some extent you always have at this level, some level of under-absorption, so you should not take away the full amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first half is still going to feel some pain from this but come later part of the year, provided that we can keep some kind of this type of level of production, then we should not expect anything more, is that sort of a reasonable way to interpret this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You could interpret it like that, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just a question on Financial Services. I'm just looking at credit provisions and also the write-offs. It seems, at least on a quarterly basis, that credit provisions sort of peaked in Q1 last year. And, obviously, now we've got, in terms of write-offs, the peak seems to have been roughly in the third quarter. Is it fair to say that we now have sort of passed the peak of credit risks, and we are sort of heading towards much more stable or &#x2013; stable sort of areas? Or is it too early to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sal. It's difficult to obviously predict the future but, as I said before, in many of our markets we've been quite stable and we're seeing some good improvements. We believe we have further challenges everyday in Eastern Europe. And while we're mitigating those challenges as they come up, I would see that as an area that we need to continue to do some very good work on. I also can say that we're ending the year 2009 with reserve levels actually higher than we had in 2008, while taking a significant amount of write-offs during 2009. So to say the worst is behind us, I don't know if I could make that statement. But what we're seeing now in the portfolio, and we're seeing the reaction to some of the modifications that we're making with our customers. I'd say that it's stabilizing and starting to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A few questions on regional Used Truck pricing trends, and then a clarification on the Construction Equipment business. On the Used Truck pricing questions. First, North America, have you seen any sequential Used Truck demand and price increase in advance of the US10 transition? And then, second, Eastern Europe related to the used equipment inventory comment you made, have you seen any Used Truck price stabilization, or is it mainly supply still pressuring price? And then lastly, on the construction side, after the 47% reduction in field inventories that you talked about during 2009, could you please clarify what your production growth would be if retail demand is flat in 2010, excluding any new product introduction benefit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the first question here, on Used Truck pricing. We &#x2013; I think we can say that we have seen the demand increase. I don't think it's fair to say that we've seen any price increase. And prices as we have said before have come down fairly much there. In Eastern Europe I think it would be correct to say price stabilization, but certainly not price increases. But probably stabilization is the better word to use there. Olof, do you want to speak to production rates there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean looking at what we have done in 2009, you can say that looking at the sales versus the production we have in rough terms, looking at the system I was saying that we have under produced around 25% in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello this is Jan Bedemo from Exane. I have three questions please. First, do you have any idea of what will be the evolution of commercial prices for you this year? The second question, you had a big chunk of over-hedging in '09. What do you think about the impact from ForEx in '010? And finally could you give us the same number for Trucks for sales versus production in 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What was the first question? Was it -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what do you expect in terms of commercial impact for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not &#x2013; do we have a &#x2013; I'm looking at my colleagues here, whether we have a catch-all number for raw material prices. We are working in very different geographies and different types of constituencies. We are debating with ourselves here. We are &#x2013; we don't see big changes. Slight upward trend, I think, is the best way if I look around the table here in turns. But we don't have a catch-all number for that at a Group level. On the hedging side here, Mikael, do you want to pick that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Q4, as previously announced, we have left the hedging accounting, and we have also changed our hedging policy, which means that you will not see us coming into the situation we had in the beginning of this year. So currency impact will have a more direct impact into our results going forward here. We will not be having the disturbance with hedging contracts and so forth. And from that respect this quarter was a clean quarter. We have no historical problems left, and I think you can find in also the quarterly report here that the re-evaluation of the hedge contracts we actually have here was 27 million. So very limited impact there.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Mr. Christer Fredriksson from ABG Sundal Collier. Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, two short questions. Firstly, on the inventory levels you talked about higher inventories in the first quarter. Historically you've had roughly 4 billion higher inventories in Q1 versus Q4, is that something that we should look for Q1 2010? Or should it be lower than that, given the weak volumes we see? And secondly, on the trucks you have sold from the inventories in the fourth quarter, I guess there was quite big discounts on those trucks. How big negative impact was it from these discounts on earnings compared to if you would have sold the same trucks with a new price, new truck price, I should say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, I think on the first I can't confirm the 4 billion number, but I think you at least you would have to scale it down to what you would call to be a normal level and compare that to where the order intake is right now. I see no reason why we should be, as a percentage of sales or as a percentage of order take, much different compared to where, what we normally are, but go back a couple of years then because we have some very extraordinary years right close to us now in '08 and '09.</p>
          <p>I can't confirm the number, but I think the way you do that is probably about right. I think on the discounts of earnings, I don't have a catchall number. I think I can confirm that we certainly made an effort to make sure that we did get inventories down to good levels and that the products that came out were not &#x2013; was not going to be any more value the longer we kept them. But I don't have a catchall number on discount of earnings.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, then I would like to say thank you. Let me correct one number that I gave. We actually have an updated number in our report on, which was on the Japanese market there. I did say that the market was very low, and it certainly is that. It was only 18,000 units in 2009. But the latest data suggests that it would actually go up more than what I said and as even we have suggested here that it might go up by as much as 40%. That was because percentage points, impressive as they may be, we have a very low base there. But that's a number that we are giving you in &#x2013; on slide, on page 11 in the report.</p>
          <p>Very well, then. Then I would like to thank you for being with us at this conference call and wish you all a good weekend. And then we have our Investor Relations people lined up for you to answer whatever questions or queries you might have on our performance. Have a good weekend. Thank you.</p>
