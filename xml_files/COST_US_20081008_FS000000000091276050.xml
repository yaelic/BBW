        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the fiscal fourth quarter and year-end results and September sale release for Costco conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tina, and good morning to everyone. As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements, and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 16-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, our operating results for the quarter. We came in at a reported $0.90 a share compared to last year's fourth quarter of $0.83 a share. Both fiscal fourth quarters included a couple of items that were pointed out in this morning's press release. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $56.2 million pre-tax or $0.08 a share related to refining our accounting for deferred membership revenues. Excluding this charge, our company's reported $0.83 fourth quarter, last year in the fourth quarter, would have been $0.91.</p>
          <p>Also mentioned in this morning's release, this year's Q4 included two items: a $0.05 per share LIFO charge &#x2013; our first significant LIFO charge in years &#x2013; and a $0.02 per share charge related to a litigation settlement. Together these two items impacted the $0.90 reported fourth quarter number this year by $0.07. So excluding these items, this year's fourth quarter results would have been $0.97, and on apples-to-apples basis the 97 would compare to a more normalized last year of 91, so a 6% year-over-year increase on an apples-to-apples basis.</p>
          <p>For the fiscal year, we came in at a reported $1.28 billion or 2.89 a share, compared to 1.08 billion or 2.37 a share in last year's fiscal 2007. As you know, and as I will outline for you in a few minutes, there were a few other items in last fiscal year, both in Q2 and Q3 of '07. Again, I will go through all the detail in a few minutes, but for an apples-to-apples comparison, we would look at a more normalized fiscal 2000 (sic) [2007] earnings amount of 2.63 a share and a more normalized fiscal 2008, excluding the two items that we mentioned in the press release this morning, at 2.96 a share. So on an apples-to-apples basis up 13%.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the quarter, as we reported on September 4, our 16-week comparable sales figure showed an increase of 9%, and that 9 was comprised of a 9 in the U.S. &#x2013; actually about an 8.5, just a little stronger than that &#x2013; and an 11% internationally. We also reported this morning our September sales &#x2013; I'm sorry, it was a 9. We also reported this morning our September sales results for the five weeks of September. These were, with the U.S. coming in at a reported 8 &#x2013; actually very close to an 8.5 &#x2013; international coming in at a 2, and therefore the total company coming in at 7.</p>
          <p>For the five-week September period, the strong 8 comp would be a 6 without the roughly 2.5% impact from gas inflation, and given the real turnaround in the U.S. dollar's relative strength to foreign currencies in the past month, the exact opposite what occurred most of last year. Whereas most of last year we benefited when we converted foreign sales into U.S. dollars, in the first month here, that 2% international comp would be an 8 if expressed in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Other topics I'll review with you this morning is our opening activities. We opened a total of 24 net new locations during fiscal 2008, which ended this past August 31, plus one in Mexico. Of those 24, 15 were in the U.S.; four in Canada; one each in the UK, Taiwan, and Korea; and two in Japan. We also relocated a record 10 units in fiscal 2008 to bigger, better-located facilities, compared to no relocations in all of 2007. For fiscal 2009, our current plan is 25 new locations, about three-quarters of which are in the U.S., plus two in Mexico, as well as possibly two to three relocations.</p>
          <p>Lastly I'll review with you our ancillary business results, our online results, membership trends, update on recent stock purchases, a few comments about inflation, our balance sheet for fiscal year-end, and lastly I'll just provide you some guidance and direction for Q1 and for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>
          <p>As I review with you our fourth quarter and fiscal-year results I will discuss not only the reported figures, but also the year-over-year comparison on an adjusted basis &#x2013; that is, without the various notable items that impacted our fiscal 2007 second, third, and fourth quarters, and the impact of the items that we mentioned in the press release today on the fourth quarter for 2008. We believe that these more normalized results are important, as they provide a meaningful comparison of prior period to current period earnings, exclusive of these items. These normalized results are also expected to be more representative of the future, recognizing full well that things like LIFO are pretty unpredictable, and litigation tends to be the name of the game these years.</p>
          <p>So with that said, reported sales for the fourth quarter, the 16 weeks ended August 31, were $22.6 billion, up 13% from last year's $20.1 billion. On a comp basis, Q4 comps were up 9%. For the quarter, our 9% reported comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction of a little bit better than 6 for the quarter and a continuing strong average frequency increase of about 3% for the quarter. Keep in mind that the 9% U.S. comp and the slightly greater than 6 average transaction both include about 300 basis points from gasoline inflation year-over-year in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, for the five weeks of September, again, the U.S. comps came in at a reported 8, darn near 8.5, with about 2.5% of that coming from gas inflation. So again, a 6 without gas. So both for the quarter and for the first month of this year, the non-gasoline U.S. comp would have been a 6.</p>
          <p>Our international results in the fourth quarter, an 11 comp again for all of last year, and it's continued &#x2013; while it was trending towards the other way in the fourth quarter, still the U.S. dollar was relatively weak year-over-year. So in our international results, our 11% international comp was actually an 8 in local currencies. And again, with that big, 180-degree swing in just the last several weeks, the 2% international comp for September was really an 8 in local currency.</p>
          <p>Our average building continues to enjoy great sales productivity. In '07 companywide, our average warehouse generated 130 million in annual sales, and for the U.S., 132 million. For fiscal '08 the average companywide has gone from 130 to 137, and the U.S. has gone from 132 to $138 million. So very strong average sales productivity per location.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; to give you just a little flavor geographically what's going on with comps. Certainly the Midwest and the Southeast &#x2013; they're the strongest regions of course. The Midwest is relatively young, relative to the Southeast, so both pretty good showings, both in the quarter and in September. Internationally, our Asia operations are the strongest, seeing some great growth in the three countries we're in over there in terms of sales strength.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise color on the comps, certainly the last several months has become a story of almost bimodal comps. The nondiscretionary &#x2013; food, sundries, health and beauty aids, fresh foods &#x2013; tends to range anywhere from the high single-digits to the mid-teens, whereas the bigger-ticket discretionary items &#x2013; like furniture, jewelry, electronics, even some of the lesser-ticket non-food items like housewares and domestics &#x2013; tend to be in the zero to minus 10 or 12 range. So all over the board there, certainly benefiting from the food strength and getting people into our buildings.</p>
          <p>Within food and sundries, notwithstanding the fact that food and sundries is a strong high single-digit comp, that includes a negative comp in tobacco, which is about 11% of food and sundries, so reflecting even a little stronger if you take that out. While food has shown strength in the economy, as I mentioned, non-foods has not. Within our slightly positive hardlines comp, office and majors were slightly negative &#x2013; actually, a shade better than they had been on the majors side. And most of the other categories were mid-single digit positive, so not terrible.</p>
          <p>Within the slightly negative softline comps, the unusual outlier on the high side was small electrics, up low double digits, with both men's and women's apparel being just slightly below flat. I think that's an indication that, notwithstanding the fact that general retail apparel sales are quite weak, our ability to access many brand names in that area has helped us in that area.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods, as I &#x2013; came in in the high singles, with bakery, deli, and produce being in the low doubles and meat being in the mid-singles. In ancillaries, again, taking out gas &#x2013; which is off the charts high with gas inflation and a little bit of gallonage comp. Excluding gas, ancillaries tend to be in the mid-singles. In terms of September sales results, the 7% total company comp, again, included an 8 in the U.S., a 6 without gas inflation, and a 2 internationally. An 8 without foreign currency &#x2013; on a local basis.</p>
          <p>FX for September. Again, last year it was generally 50 to 200 basis points of a positive to our company comp. In September it was a hit of 130 basis points to the whole company. As I mentioned, gas inflation is a little over 2.5%. In terms of looking at the 7% number &#x2013; or the 8% number for the U.S., it's pretty evenly split between the average ticket and the average traffic, about 3.5% each.</p>
          <p>Moving down the line items in the income statement, membership fees. Again, last year we reported a membership fee with a $56 million non-cash charge to it. So last year's reported membership fees were $388.2 million or 1.93% compared to this year of 473 or 2.09%. Excluding this one-time hit to membership fees last year, I think again on an apples-to-apples basis our membership fees last year would have been 444 or 2.21%, compared to 473 or 2.09. So an increase of $29 million exclusive of that one-time charge last year. About a 7% increase in reported dollars, about an 8% on a cash basis, and about 12 basis points lower.</p>
          <p>Again, that negative basis point is skewed somewhat by the fact that you have disproportionate increases in sales in gasoline, which distorts many of our percentages, which I'll go over in a minute, as it relates to merchandise, gross margin, and to SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>In terms of number of members at year-end. Gold Star, 20.2 million, up about .5 million from Q3 end. Business primary, 5.6 million, up about 50,000. Business add-on, about 3.4 million. So all told, 29.2 million total members or about 57,000 per warehouse average, a shade better than the 56,800 that we had at Q3 end. Including spouse cards, we ended fiscal '08 with 53.5 million cards out there, versus 52.6 million just a quarter ago and 50.4 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>At fiscal year-end on August 31, our Executive membership continued to grow. 7.63 million members. That's an increase of 344,000 just in the 16-week fourth quarter, or about 21,000 a week increase during the quarter. For the year, paid Executive membership increased by 1.3 million members or just over 20% of the base, an increase. And the 1.3 million increase in Executive membership is actually slightly greater than the 1.1 million increase we had in fiscal '07, benefiting in part from rolling out in Canada a little over a year ago, and certainly continuing to promote it on our own end.</p>
          <p>I should point out that this 26% of our membership base, up from 23% a year ago, generated about 57% of our total U.S. and Canadian sales. And this percentage continues to increase at a rate faster than the remaining part of our membership. In terms of renewal rates, they continue strong and are at an all-time high renewal rate, 92% on the Business side, 86 on the Gold Star side, and 87 something overall.</p>
          <p>Going down to the gross margin line. Please bear with me as I go through our year-over-year Q4 margin comparisons. There are a lot of moving parts: LIFO, inflated gasoline sales, gasoline margins, sales mix changes such as weaker higher-margin softline sales, and of course the lag in passing on some of the inflationary product and freight costs, which I spent a bit of time discussing on our July 23 guidance conference call.</p>
          <p>So starting with our reported gross margin. It was lower year-over-year by 45 basis points, coming in at 10.29 this year versus at 10.74 last year. I'll try to limit all the numbers I ask you to put in our little matrix, but let's do three columns: Q3 '08 year-over-year, Q4 '08 year-over-year, and then for the fiscal year '08 year-over-year. And the line items would be merchandising, core merchandise. Second line item would be ancillary businesses. The third line item would be 2% reward. The fourth line item would be LIFO. The fifth line item would be the federal excise tax claim, which will go away soon. And the next line item would be the returns, gross margin adjustment. And the next and last item would be the returns, sales adjustment. Keep in mind, those last two relate to the changes we made in fiscal '07 to our sales returns, how we accounted for sales returns and the reserve, not only for sales but associated gross margin, where we had some big variations in our percentages there. And then a total line.</p>
          <p>So going across, merchandising, year-over-year in Q3, we had picked up 27 basis points, plus 27. In Q4 minus 19, and in all of '08, plus 17. Ancillary businesses, minus 9 in Q3, minus 6 in Q4, and minus 13 for all of '08. 2% reward, minus 1, minus 2, and for the year minus 3. LIFO, zero in Q3, minus 14 basis points in Q4, and minus 5 for the whole year. This federal excise tax claim, zero, zero, and minus 1. And then the returns gross margin adjustment, plus 32, minus 4 in Q4, and plus 14 in '08, for the whole year. Returns sales adjustment, minus 16, zero, and minus 8. And totaling all those numbers, for the total for Q3 year-over-year, we had plus 33 basis points, Q4 minus 45, and for all of '08, plus 1.</p>
          <p>Now, let's start with the core merchandise gross margin being lower year-over-year by 19. As I will discuss in a minute, three of the four departmental gross margins were up year-over-year, and that's despite some of the lags in passing on some of the freight and merchandise costs that I spoke to you about on July 23, as well as our decision to hold prices on a few items, like the rotisserie chicken example I gave on July 23. That simple example, I estimate, was about a $3 million hit to margin in the quarter.</p>
          <p>At core merchandise sales &#x2013; which is food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods &#x2013; represents between 75 and 80% of our total sales. During the fourth quarter, three of these departments &#x2013; all but fresh foods &#x2013; showed year-over-year gross margin gains ranging from 10 to 90 basis points. And one showed a gross margin reduction of about 50. Altogether, these four core departments, divided by their respective sales &#x2013; and again, representing over three-quarters of our total company sales &#x2013; actually showed a year-over-year gross margin increase of 19 basis points. And that's on top of last year's fourth quarter year-over increase in core gross margin of 34, which of course is when we initiated some of the margin initiatives, and we had a big quarter starting last year.</p>
          <p>So despite the fact that we anniversaried that, despite all the things I just talked about, the core business is doing just fine in terms of margin strength, and still having pretty decent sales results relative to industry. Where we get hit, of course, is in the reduced sales penetration of these areas, as our low-margin gasoline business saw Q4 year-over-year sales penetration increase from 8% of total sales last year in Q4 to 12% of total sales in this year's fourth quarter. And I'll speak to that in a moment.</p>
          <p>In terms of our major ancillary businesses &#x2013; pharmacy, optical, one-hour photo, food courts, hearing aids &#x2013; which was a minus 6 basis points to the total company gross margin variance. Pharmacy and hearing aids actually showed good improvement year-over-year in Q4. However, one-hour photo, food court, optical, and gas were lower year-over-year. One-hour photo, of course, is a challenged business right now given the nature of people printing some of their own things and the whole transition over the last few years. So again, we still are quite profitable in that area, but in terms of year-over-year, there's a negative there.</p>
          <p>Our food court, while margins are down year-over-year in the fourth quarter, they'd actually showed some significant improvement trend. In the first three quarters of this year, compared to the first three quarters of last year, our profitability in our food courts showed a detriment of 200 basis points in margin. Whereas in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, it was about a half a percentage point, 55 basis points. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that we've maintained prices on things like pizza and hot dogs. If you recall, it was probably a year ago when raw material costs like cheese was up I think about 80%. Some of those things have subsided, and we've gotten a little better in that area as well, so, but nonetheless a little bit of a drag.</p>
          <p>But gasoline sales are the big factor here. While I will show you in a moment how it helped our SG&amp;A percentage, the tremendous increase in gas prices, 36% year-over-year in Q4, this big increase in gas sales penetration. Now remember, gas on average runs 7 to 800 basis points lower margins than the rest of our business overall. That less gross margin on 400 basis points of higher sales significantly negatively impacted our total margin. And you see that in the core margin explanation I just described.</p>
          <p>Before I continue on with other items impacting Q4 gross margin, a quick comment on gasoline profitability in the quarter. As you recall, Q4 began back in mid-May with significant jumps in the price of gasoline and the expectation at that time that price increases would continue throughout the fiscal fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As you recall, we make less or even lose a little money during those times of rising gas prices, and during times of falling gas prices the converse happens. We said as much on the May 29 Q3 earnings conference call. Then on our July 23 conference call, where we were revising downward our overall earnings expectations, we mentioned that one of the factors is, is that gas, while it'd still probably be negative, it wouldn't be as impactful as we had anticipated back in May. And in the end, the impact year-over-year was not an impact &#x2013; not a negative impact.</p>
          <p>Next on the gross margin explanation list is LIFO. As outlined in our press release, LIFO represented a $32.3 million, or 14 basis point, charge to gross margin in the quarter. As I discussed on July 23, the rate of merchandise cost increases, as well as freight cost increases, in the then-prior eight or so weeks had begun to expand and accelerate. With more cost inflation showing up in our U.S. merchandise inventories, which &#x2013; LIFO is a U.S. merchandise accounting concept &#x2013; a potentially large LIFO charge was likely. Ultimately the charge was the $32.3 million that we took, or $0.05 a share. The LIFO charge of course is a non-cash book charge to our cost of sales, resulting in, actually, from a timing standpoint, a positive cash flow.</p>
          <p>Now, why a charge now when there were not LIFO charges in the first, second, and third quarters of last year? There was certainly a little inflation then. Well, we began fiscal '08 with a $57 million LIFO credit, reflecting slight deflationary merchandise cost trends prior to fiscal '08. While you can't book a LIFO credit to income, you can use it to offset future LIFO charges. So in fiscal quarters 1, 2 and 3, any merchandise cost inflation, and therefore some LIFO charges, were offset by our $57 million LIFO credit built up from previous years.</p>
          <p>I stand corrected. It's $52 million LIFO credit, not 57.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date through the third quarter, our beginning of fiscal '08 LIFO credit went from a little over 50 million to a little under 10 million. So we began fiscal fourth quarter with expectation that any Q4 inflation would be offset, at least in good part, by the remaining LIFO credit. And of course that wasn't the case.</p>
          <p>Okay, back to our gross margin for Q4. The final item outlined in our little matrix of factors is the margin impact of quarterly changes in our sales returns reserve and the related impact to gross margins reserve. In the fourth quarter it was a minus 4 basis point hit to margin. Basically a line item to our matrix that I added a year ago when we started seeing the benefit to this item, resulting from our change in our electronics returns policy a year and a half ago in March. The minus 4 figure is still actually an improvement, but a much smaller improvement as compared to last year's fourth quarter figure. Essentially it's zeroing out now, and this is a line item in the matrix that I'll probably take off in the future and just be part of core business.</p>
          <p>So all told, a minus 45 basis point year-over-year decline in reported gross margin includes continued margin improvement in our core merchandise sales &#x2013; fresh foods, food and sundries, hardlines, and softlines &#x2013; greatly offset by a significant sales mix change from 10 to 12% margin core merchandise sales to 2 to 5% gross margin gasoline sales. Add to that the some weakness in our ancillary business margins and a 14 basis point LIFO charge, and you end up with the 45 basis points.</p>
          <p>Hopefully that's giving you a little bit of explanation &#x2013; and more importantly, a little comfort that our core business is just fine, and one day we'll get off of this seesaw with the craziness in gasoline and inflation.</p>
          <p>In terms of our gross margin outlook going forward, as you just witnessed with my long-winded explanation of Q4 year-over-year gross margins, there are a lot of moving parts. The impact from increasing Executive member business should continue to be a small hit to reported gross margin, but low single-digits, it looks like. LIFO, who knows? Some of the inflation pressures that we were starting to be concerned that were going to continue have subsided a little bit, certainly as it relates to commodity pricing and gas pricing.</p>
          <p>It's hard to know how much and for how long. In our budget for this year, we've simply assumed an $8 million LIFO charge each quarter, but that's only a estimate and a guess. If the economy stays weak, LIFO may be less. And if there's a lot of money pumped into the system, it may be more. So your guess is as good as ours on that. But we expect that our core merchandise groups should continue to be okay, slightly positive. At least so far, in the first month of this year, that has occurred.</p>
          <p>Moving on to SG&amp;A. On a reported basis, SG&amp;A was lower year-over-year or better by 15 basis points, coming in at a 9.66 versus a 9.81. Again, I'll just ask you to jot down a little matrix. In this case, we'll go back to Q2, so four columns: Q2 '08 year-over-year, Q3 '08 year-over-year, Q4 '08 year-over-year, and the whole year fiscal '08 year-over-year. The line items are core operations. Second line item is central. Third is stock compensation, both a combination of options historically and RSUs. Fourth line item is 409A &#x2013; that's a small item, but I'll just put it in there. Fifth item is sales returns. And lastly, quarterly adjustments, for a total, which would be the last line item.</p>
          <p>So going across, core operations year-over-year in Q2 '08 was a minus 11 basis points, meaning that it was &#x2013; I use minuses as bad here. So higher &#x2013; minus means higher SG&amp;A year-over-year. Minus 11 in Q2, plus 8 or better in Q3, plus 21 or better in Q4, and plus 5 for the whole year. Central, plus 2, plus 4, plus 3, and plus 3 for the year. Stock compensation, minus 3, minus 1, minus 3 and minus 2. 409A, plus 30, minus 1, plus 1, and plus 5. Sales returns reserve, plus 15, plus 16, zero, and plus 7. Quarterly adjustments, zero, zero, minus 7, and minus 4. So all told, Q2 year-over-year was lower or plus 33. Q3, lower or plus 26. Q4, lower or plus 15. And for the whole year, lower or plus 14 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at this &#x2013; first of all let me talk about &#x2013; 409A, recall that Q2 '08 is simply the fact that in Q2 '07 we took a huge charge related to the stock option protection that we gave to many of our employees and some of the charges we took related to stock option dating over a 10-year prior period. So that's just the offset that in Q2 '08 it was comparing favorably against that. The minus 1 was just a small update to that number. And the plus 5 of course is for the whole year-over-year comparison.</p>
          <p>The sales returns reserve &#x2013; again, back at Q3 &#x2013; Q2 and Q3 of '07, we reduced our reported sales by greatly increasing the sales return. So while that was a &#x2013; by reducing sales in '07, in '08 we're comparing against that. So that's the reversal of that. So that shows a plus here. A little confusing, but basically take it out to look at a normalized number.</p>
          <p>Going back up to the top of this chart, our operations was lower by 21, primarily payroll and benefits, but certainly helped by &#x2013; some of that was helped by a increase in gasoline sales, which is of course a very low SG&amp;A business, to go with its low margin side. But overall from our perspective, payroll and benefits, we did a pretty good job during the quarter of controlling them.</p>
          <p>Our central expense improved year-over-year by 3. Again, a little bit of a benefit, no big surprises there. Stock compensation expense, higher year over year. And that's simply a fact that I think when the grants were made a year ago, the stock price was unusually strong, so it was a little higher. This annual grant will be a little lower, as you might expect, because it's all based what the stock is on the date of the grant.</p>
          <p>Certainly SG&amp;A has benefit, again, from gasoline sales. In terms of SG&amp;A outlook going to '09, a lot depends on sales levels &#x2013; total company sales levels as well as gasoline. Remember, huge increases in sales hurts our gross margin but helps our expense percentage. And that notwithstanding, it's fairly unpredictable given what's going on out there with the various moving parts.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Higher this year by about 1.85 million, coming in at 17.8 million vs. 15.9. Quite a few more openings in Q4. Recognizing, there's always some lag or &#x2013; actually some expenses that hit earlier than the actual opening, sometimes in previous quarters. But last year fourth quarter we opened eight openings. This year we opened 13, including six relos. So eight new openings in Q4 '07, 13 including six relos in Q4 '08. No real surprises in those numbers.</p>
          <p>In the terms of the provision for impaired assets closing costs, Q4 '07, we had a $4.9 million charge. Q4 '08 we had a net benefit of about $6 million. A combination of some closing costs and more than offset by some gains in the sale of assets where we had moved some locations and sold the underlying assets.</p>
          <p>So all told, reported operating income in Q4 was up year-over-year from 555 to 604, or 9%. Again, excluding the charge last year in Q4 to membership of 56 million and excluding the two items mentioned in this year's press release, that 9% number would have been up 7%. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was essentially the same year-over-year, coming in at 32.1 million this year versus 32.3 million last year. Interest income of course was quite a bit lower, down by 24 million, coming in at 35 million in the quarter versus 59 million a year ago, primarily a reflection of much lower interest rates, as our cash balances have been relatively robust.</p>
          <p>I would like to spend a minute speaking about our cash and investment balances, which I spent a little time on the Q3 conference call and I think even on the Q2 conference call. Recall that early last December, we had about $1.1 billion of cash spread among several what was referred to as enhanced money market funds. In early December last year, we received a call from one of the funds that the fund was stopping redemptions and that the net asset value of the funds would be &#x2013; would break &#x2013; that they would allow it to float and break the buck.</p>
          <p>This had not happened, I understood, since the early '90s at that time. We immediately requested redemption of all the funds, and fortunately, as of last week, we have redeemed 960 million of the little over $1.1 billion, and have since reinvested it in a variety of government funds. So we have about 190 million remaining. The underlying liquidation &#x2013; as the underlying securities within these funds mature, they are being paid off. And a few of the maturities go out as far as early 2010, but pretty much on pro rata basis, so we're seeing nice chunks of it come off. And that has been in line all through this turmoil.</p>
          <p>To date we have taken impairment charges of about $5 million and anticipate taking an additional charge in Q1 of 2 to 3 million. Again, a shoe drops occasionally in this area, but it seems like there's still a lot of good credits in there. And the good news is more than 80% of it has been redeemed and with very little hit. So it's been significantly more a liquidity issue than a risk of principal issue. We're fortunate of course that we've got much more liquidity than the funds that were invested here.</p>
          <p>Now, when we switched from enhanced money market funds and we went beyond 2a-7 funds, normal corporate money market funds, to government money market funds, one of those &#x2013; the reserves U.S. government fund, which we had about 300 million in &#x2013; if you recall, about three weeks ago another reserve fund called &#x2013; I believe the Pilgrim fund, which is a 2a-7 fund, a corporate fund &#x2013; announced it was halting redemptions and allowing to break the buck, another first as I understand out there in a number of years. With that, anything with the name "reserve" in it is what I understand had a run on the bank, if you will. All the assets, all the underlying securities in these funds, are government securities, some of which are now being backed by the big government, the federal government. But that, too, has halted redemptions two weeks ago, and they're developing a plan for orderly liquidation. The maturities of those spread generally over the course of one year, and the average maturity is a little less than that.</p>
          <p>So the &#x2013; again, we're not terribly concerned about any impairment in that at this point, but it just shows you what's going on out there with liquidity. And again, we're very fortunate that we're among several of them and there have been no issues with any of the other ones. And even with this one, I think it was a little unfair. It had to do more with the name, and there was a run on all funds given the fact that the other one broke the buck.  This one has been perfectly fine to date, and again fortunately, we don't have a liquidity need here. So that's what's going on out there. And just to fill you in on that.</p>
          <p>So overall, reported pre-tax income was up about 4% year-over-year and up about 3% if you take out the items that I've talked about ad nauseam here.</p>
          <p>On to our tax rate. We had a couple of discrete items in Q4 that were to our benefit, including us winning an appeal on a tax previously paid and accrued for, such that our tax rate was about a point and a half lower than it had been last year.</p>
          <p>Quick rundown on the balance sheet. This is our August 31, balance sheet and of course we'll have the Q&amp;A available with some other information in terms &#x2013; on our website shortly, midday today. Cash and equivalents, 3.275 billion. Inventories, 5.039 billion. Other current assets, 1.148 billion. For total current assets of 9.462 billion. Net fixed assets, 10.355 billion. Other assets, 865. Total assets, 20.682 billion.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side, short-term debt, 140. Accounts payable, 5.225. Other current, 3.509 billion. Total current 8.874 billion. Long-term debt, 2.206 billion. Deferred and other, 328. For total liabilities of 11.408 billion. Minority interest, 82. And stockholders' equity, 9.192 billion. For a total, again, of 20.682 billion.</p>
          <p>A very strong balance sheet, debt to cap of about 20%, plenty of financial strength. As you'll see here, in terms of recorded accounts payable as a percent of inventories was over 100%, 105% last year at fourth quarter end and 104% this year. That includes of course a lot of payables related to construction since we've got 1.7 billion of annual capital expenditures, such that if you took that out and really looked merchandise AP to merchandise inventories, an 87% a year ago and an 86%. Nonetheless, nearly 90% of our inventories are being funded with trade payables.</p>
          <p>Our average inventory per warehouse is actually down about 157,000 year-over-year. It's really our best showing in years in terms of reductions per warehouse. Last year in the fourth quarter end it was right at 9,999,000. Sounds like a retail price point. And this year's fourth quarter, 9,843,000. So 150,000 less year-over-year. Additionally, these figures also include a little extra buy-ins that we're doing right now as prices go up and we're able to buy an additional weeks of supply, thereby allowing us to hold down the sell price a little longer for our members.</p>
          <p>Really, no inventory concerns. Our model &#x2013; initially &#x2013; our model itself is blessed with what we sell. Certainly our volume and our inventory turns within our industry are blessed from the standpoint that we are generally not at big risk for things, and to date we haven't seen any concerns there. The reduction in average inventory per warehouse is consistent with a goal I mentioned last year in a couple conference calls, reduce the inventory per warehouse by half a million or a little more over a two-year period. And we're working on that, and so far so good.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, fiscal '08, for the year we spent 1.65 billion. I estimate that our fiscal '09 CapEx will be in the &#x2013; I'll give you a range of 1.7 to 1.9. My guess is more in the 1.7, 1.8 range. Not only about 25 new units and three relos, but also a little over $100 million per plan to depot expansion, our cross-talks, and a big increase in our remodel activities.</p>
          <p>I also want to mention our dividend. Every April for the last four or five years we've announced an increase, as we did this past April. So now on a quarterly basis it's $0.16 a share. This $0.64 a share analyzed dividend represents a cost to the company of a little under $300 million per year.</p>
          <p>Costco.com. It did well in the fourth quarter, although its growth just came in a little bit less than the whole year. Its sales growth in Q4 was 26%, versus 34% for the whole fiscal year, with sales for the whole year coming in just shy of 1.7 billion, certainly beating our own budget. However, we have seen in recent weeks a slight reduction in the average ticket &#x2013; not in frequency in transactions, but in average ticket. Recall that our average ticket in here is over $400. So again, indicative of the fact that big-ticket items have certainly slowed, and when you turn on the TV every day and see the news.</p>
          <p>Next discussion list is expansion. For all of '08, we opened as I mentioned 25 units, one in Mexico. We actually opened 35, 10 relos, and one in Mexico. For '09 we'd expect, again, 26 to 30 new, two to three &#x2013; or maybe four, but my guess is two to three &#x2013; relos, so 24 to 26 total. And in addition to that Mexico, which we don't consolidate, a couple there. If you're looking at '08, the 24 net new units &#x2013; again, I don't include Mexico because we don't consolidate it &#x2013; based on last year's ending base of 488, was 4.9% unit growth. So a little over 5% square footage growth, probably 5 to 5.5.</p>
          <p>We ended the fiscal year with 72.6 million square feet. And fiscal '09, if we assume we add 25 net new units on a base of 512, again that would be about 5% unit growth, or maybe 5.5 to 6% square footage growth.</p>
          <p>Stock repurchases. Since June of '05 and through the end of fiscal '08, we purchased 87.8 million shares at an aggregate price of 53.99. So we still have repurchase authorization in our programs of a little over $2 billion. We have a total of 6.8 billion of authorizations in the last four years, which authorization expires at various times between now and mid-2011. For all of '08 we repurchased 13.8 million shares for $887 million, or $64.22 a share. And we're going to see what happens now. With liquidity issues, we're going to wait and see, recognizing offsetting data is what's going on with not only our stock price but everybody's stock price out there. So we'll see how the next year goes. But we certainly have a very strong balance sheet to do what we want to do.</p>
          <p>Before I provide some guidance for the upcoming year, as we all know things are tough out there. Thankfully our comps have remained relatively strong. We believe we are continuing to build market share in our business. And I think we've been in a good position to take advantage of available merchandise from manufacturers who wouldn't sell us in the past; to continue to be opportunistic on real estate possibilities; and given the fact that our food business has been so strong and our gas business has been strong, bringing people into the parking lot. We've been fortunate in that regard.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet with good cash and investments. Our cash flow from operations both in '08 and I hope in '09, are approaching or slightly exceeding $2 billion. And strong membership fee income and strong renewal rates as well. So we are certainly cognizant of what's going out there with the economy but have appreciated the fact that we benefit from a few things like selling food, like being the extreme value proposition, like having availability of some of those high-end brands that historically wouldn't sell us. Some of them are currently not selling us, but at least it's more available out there. So we are hopeful that we can continue to build and grow our business each year and certainly feel that we'll gain market share during the course of it.</p>
          <p>Finally, before I turn it back to Tina for Q&amp;A, some direction for the quarter and the year. I believe current First Call for the first quarter is $0.64. We're comfortable with that. Probably have a range which throws a few cents below it and a penny above it, but somewhere in the low 60s, 61 to 65, we feel that that's an appropriate range.</p>
          <p>For the year I believe First Call went down from 6 to 3.25 yesterday. We, like you, read the news every day, and we are approaching fiscal '09 very conservatively. I'm going to give you a very wide range of $3 to 3.25, which is the top end of the range. Hopefully, we can do more towards the top, but there are no guarantees out there. We're starting off with a decent first month, which we've closed, but that's one of 13 four-week months that we have here, and so we'll have to see. Again, we think whatever happens out there we're well positioned to do better than the average, and we'll see what happens.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in terms of looking ahead at '09, as I mentioned, we'll post to the Costco Investor Relations site the balance sheet, the EPS calculations, a few other tidbits of information.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Tina for Q&amp;A. Tina?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. I was just wondering if we could spend a little more time on the core merchandise margin. If I understand it correct &#x2013; well, perhaps to understand the classification, could you help us understand what gas impacted Q1 of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that handy. Gas last year &#x2013; it was a lot less of an impact just because of sales. I mean, you could take your own numbers, anybody can take some numbers, and just assume, to get to a weighted average, when it was 92.8 a year ago in the fourth quarter, and now it's 88.12 in terms of the sales penetration of gas versus not gas. Pick a number in the 11 or 12 range for the company. And actually if we're reporting something in the high 10s, it's got to be 12ish, and then gas is in the low single digits. And you can get a sense of how it's impacted. So the impact was a lot less last year because I it was only two-thirds the penetration, 8 instead of a 12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because I'm trying to understand in terms of classification of the core margins, because it sounds like the plus 19 basis points &#x2013; encouraging, but it seems like the swing is all due to the greater penetration of gas. I'm just wondering if we think about on a go-forward basis if gas maintains at these levels, what is the mix impact to margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, right now it's going the other way. But now is now, and tomorrow is tomorrow. It's so unpredictable. If gas were going to go up 30% a year, the price of gas, then you would see that continuation of what we saw in Q4.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind in Qs 1 and 2 and 3, while the core was up, which includes gas, one, we had more margin initiatives. We hadn't anniversaried them yet. We were still in our first year of honeymoon there. And the year-over-year gas was 8 going to 9 going to 10 going to 11.</p>
          <p>Now, again, I look at it as the core itself was up, notwithstanding the fact that we've anniversaried &#x2013; we're now into our second year of showing some  margin-raise initiatives &#x2013; but you got hammered by this giant increase in gas penetration. Similarly, -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; if a year from now in Q4 of '09, gas sales penetration is 10, because gas had come down another $0.50 a gallon, that'll be just the opposite. You'll see a huge benefit to reported gross margin and core merchandise margin. That's why I've tried to at least share with you the underlying components.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That's my, I guess, my point, is that the core is &#x2013; you're see encouraging, but it's more of a penetration impact, and so -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, while all of us &#x2013; none of us want to be optimistic in a naive way, right now you can be conservative on the economy and feel pretty comfortable that gas prices are going to go down, not up, with the changes in world demand and what's going on out there. But again, it's entirely unpredictable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And then just looking at the SG&amp;A, good improvement on the payroll benefits. Kind of help us understand how we can think about that on a go-forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it's tough. It's tough for us, and we have all the detail. What we find is, is that we're pretty good at predicting &#x2013; sometimes &#x2013; bottom line. And you know that the sum of all the big three things &#x2013; membership, gross margin, and SG&amp;A &#x2013; and then you just pick which one you want to change a little bit. I'm not trying to be flip about it, but it's tough.</p>
          <p>Again, given that there's some expectation of still some moderate year-over-year gas inflation, not gas deflation year-over-year, that would give you a little bit of a tailwind in benefit to SG&amp;A. So if you were modeling out there, I would assume &#x2013; and given that gas right now at least is &#x2013; it's only right now, it's not four weeks ago and it's not four weeks from now &#x2013; but if the trend continued so that even if there is a modest amount of gas inflation and not 36% year over year, you'll see that impact to margin mitigate to show not as big a detriment and hopefully at some point a positive. And you'll see the SG&amp;A benefit be a little bit less too.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to have you elaborate a little bit more on the merchandise mix and how much of the margin impact is coming from the faster growth of the lower-margin consumables versus the nonconsumables. So if you take gas out, what would that impact be, Richard?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, you add up the 75 to 80% of the business, year-over-year it was up 19. Within that, your higher &#x2013; actually, what I'll call food and sundries tends to be close to the company average if not a shade higher, like in fresh foods. Where you get hit a little bit is having essentially flat or slightly down comps in softlines. Softlines is typically a higher than average &#x2013; it is a higher than average gross margin business. So it's not only the gas but it's certainly food and &#x2013; softlines. Weakness in softlines has hurt you a little bit on margin. Hardlines tends to be a little bit more in line, even a shade &#x2013; not a lot, but a shade less than the company average.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In your range for fiscal '09 EPS, roughly what would the comp range be, excluding gas and excluding currency? And what in that range would the mix assumptions be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in the mid-singles. But it's &#x2013; again, I could give you a three-dimensional matrix, which I'm not, of assumptions here. Our assumptions is, is the underlying comp is going to be a little less than it was in September, our original budget. But again, it's hard to predict.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of the mix, would you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, in terms of &#x2013; if you just think about on a base sales of &#x2013; what'd we do for the year, 71 billion? Every percentage point in comp is $710 million. Arguably at, let's say, 4.5% pre-tax, is &#x2013; 0.045 times 71 billion. Hold on a second. Oh, times 0.01, that's where I was going wrong. Is like $32 million pre-tax, is $0.045 a share. So, I mean, a good kind of &#x2013; a base metric to help you would be somewhere between 4 and 5% pre-tax on an incremental percentage point, so an extra 2 percentage point helps you by 0.08 to $0.10, and a 2 percentage points lower hurts you by that amount.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My other question is on the gas impact in the business. The margin comparisons are very confusing. I was hoping you could help us on an EPS basis. You said it was not a negative, but was it actually a positive in the quarter? Because as wholesale gas prices have fallen, most convenience stores are showing a lot higher profit margins year-to-year. So I was wondering if there was some anomaly in your business, or -</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard, good morning. I was hoping you could talk about the four major categories. You've experienced some very good core merchandise margin expansion in those. I mean, as you look to 2009, kind of how do you feel in terms of continuing that trend, and where do you think &#x2013; which inning do you think we might be in on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of &#x2013; I mean, clearly the sales strength, which gives me more confidence with margin strength, is in food and sundries, which is what, 40-plus percent of our business, David? Food and sundries is over 40% of our business? And fresh foods, which is another 13 or so percent of our business. So that's where I have the most comfort.</p>
          <p>The biggest challenge, of course, is &#x2013; we, like many retailers out there, have approached Christmas, as an example, with toys and trim-a-home and trim-a-tree &#x2013; with the exception of things like the Wii &#x2013; conservatively. Because &#x2013; and particularly we don't want to end up with any Christmas ornaments the day after Christmas, since we don't like a lot of markdowns. So we're not being conservative, but we're being I'd say less aggressive. If we're wrong, you could always get hit a little bit there. But again, our merchandise is spread across so many categories, there might be a weakness in that stuff, but there's strength in apparel because of the availability of goods. And we got some great names coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your optimism on food and sundries and fresh food, is that based on the underlying input costs, or better purchasing leverage, or how should we categorize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the above. Part of my confidence is that the people in charge of those two areas exude confidence in our budget meetings, as recently as yesterday. Recognizing that &#x2013; we feel comfortable that it's very competitive out there, and nobody's more competitive than we are. And notwithstanding that, we've shown that we can show some improvements there. So we don't see anything changing that model right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's more cost rather than taking pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly more cost than taking pricing. The example, we talk about buy-ins. We think that, again, we've benefited &#x2013; buy-ins are offered to everybody, from supermarket chains to Wal-Mart to Target. We have a, we think, unique ability with our depot and our cross-talk operations, that if we can bring in an extra six- or eight-week supply, or two weeks or whatever the vendor will allow, at a lower price, we'll keep it low for as long as we can, but still make a little at the tail end of it. Those things help you a little bit.</p>
          <p>But the big, underlying thing is just the stuff we sell every day. And certainly, within &#x2013; again, the risk more is going to be on the weaker sales results, like the big-ticket items. With the exception of apparel, principally, because we can almost sale them a piece much of the stuff that we can divert or buy directly on brands that you never saw before.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Richard. When you look at the gross profit margin outlook embedded in your 3 to 3.25 view, can you give us a range, if you assume gas is neutral? You have a lot of things you're cycling in the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Would down 10 to 20 basis points seem about right? Because every 10 basis points is usually about 0.10, $0.11 of earnings, so just kind of back-of-the-envelope.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, if you look at a range of 3 to 3.25 that's $0.25. Which before tax is 39 &#x2013; no, sorry. $0.25 times $7.4 million a penny, divided by 0.63 or point &#x2013; whatever, that's 37%, is $2.93? No.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll get back to you off the line. Okay. And then to switch gears, MFI [membership fee income] growth in the quarter was a little bit slower, not much slower on a two-year basis, but a little bit slower. And I know you gave the statistics on the renewal rates. I was just wondering if we could dive into the churn rate a little bit, and if there's been any change in the churn rate in renewals for people in year two. Just wondering if you've seen any change on that front. Because Sam's has spoken a couple times about having that as an issue. So I was wondering if you could comment on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not seen that. Again, our renewal rates have been frighteningly consistent over the last several quarters &#x2013; frightening in a good way &#x2013; given what's going on with the economy. And so the answer is no, we have not seen that.</p>
          <p>It's interesting. In a given week, all the sudden we'll see a slowdown or a pickup in Business membership sign-ups, or a slowdown or a speed-up in Executive member. And inevitably what it is, it's what the marketing department here at central is pushing out to the warehouse in terms of activities to focus on this four-week period. And what we have done &#x2013; but nothing new this year &#x2013; is when we see a little weakness out there, we put a little bit more effort into it. And generally it works.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Richard. Two questions that I have. When you look at the quarter that you just ended and you look into the holiday quarter, what happens in terms of the sales mix or merchandise mix of discretion/nondiscretionary? How does it change as you head into the holiday season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, it's funny. You pick up on the food side because there's a lot more family dinners and holiday dinners and weekend activities. You clearly &#x2013; you have a big pickup in the toys area, and certainly you have a whole new area like all the trim-a-home and trim-a-tree and gift baskets. So -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In looking at the sales penetration, there's about a couple hundred basis point switch towards nonfood during the last couple months of the year, as people are buying more gifts for people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Got it. And -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, I want to respond a little bit to that question, the previous question, about the FX headwind this year. If you just &#x2013; again, when it comes out next week, you take our own segment and that stuff and adjust it based on assuming &#x2013; you have to make some assumptions on currency, because we've proven not to be a good predictor what's going to happen next week with the currency exchange rates. But if you take what's happened even in the last month with currencies, you're talking &#x2013; we adjusted our own budget down by about $20 million on a pre-tax line. So it's not a big deal, it's $0.03. But we have incorporated what has happened so far. Sorry, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all right. And the other question I have, Richard, is, have you seen in terms of your private label initiatives and the consumer at all sort of trending more towards your private label and sort of how &#x2013; in the environment that you've seen in inflationary versus branded -how has that developed for you over the last few months and into the next couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's been a small tick up &#x2013; I just asked this question to our two key merchants last week, and particularly our food and sundries merchant. And they've seen a small tick up. But it's not like it's "Oh my God, look at this big change in private label." So small pickup, but nothing that you could look from 100 feet away and say, "Wow, look at that difference."</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the last question I have, Richard. As you look into the holiday quarter, any new vendors or new product that you guys are excited about, or things that you can talk about that you've seen that you hadn't seen before? Any specific product names or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. But I want to make sure &#x2013; I don't have the merchants here to let me know which ones I can tell you about yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Richard, just to follow up on the MFI, can you talk a little bit about the growth outlook that you're assuming in dollars to get to that 3 to 3.25? I mean, you said that the cash MFI grew about 8% in the fourth quarter. How about on kind of an income statement basis? What do you think we should be thinking about MFI growth for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hate to ask you this, but could you repeat that? There's a little bit of noise on this side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the MFI growth for 2009. I think you said the cash MFI was up about 8% in the fourth quarter. What do you think on an income statement basis we should be thinking about for MFI growth in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would assume roughly the same if not a shade lower. Generally speaking, there's no current anticipation of changing the prices of our membership fees this coming year. And so all things being equal if you have a little bit positive comp you probably have a slight detriment to the &#x2013; 2 to 3 basis points of detriment there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to confirm, it sounded to me like you're expecting gas prices to be above year-ago levels throughout 2009. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we really don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you don't know. But in terms of &#x2013; when you're saying 3 to 3.25, you're not expecting gas prices to be significantly below last year or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason we put a large range on it for the year is that &#x2013; I jokingly said to Jim a couple of months ago &#x2013; every four weeks we have a budget meeting. We close our period on a Sunday. We close our books two days later on Tuesday. By Thursday, all the input on a grounds-up basis from every merchant, every warehouse manager, inputs new numbers to update the month that they're in, four or five days into. So we already know how the month has started. We know how last month ended. And when we look at the year &#x2013; now, if you're thinking about a company whose pre-tax is in the high 1.1, whatever &#x2013; 1.7 or 8, divided by 13 four-week periods, you're talking about 120, $135 million a period on average.</p>
          <p>Despite such wonderful input from so many people on a grounds-up we can miss our update for the month by $20 million right now. I mean, I jokingly said to Jim, we could take our variance public &#x2013; I mean, it's so profitable. A couple times it's gone the other way, but not as much. The fact of the matter is there's a lot of moving parts, gas being the biggest variable. There have been fiscal months when we budget we're going to break even and we make 10 million. There have been fiscal months when we budget 5 and we break even. It's all over the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. That's fair enough. And just lastly, you commented a little bit about this in your prepared remarks, but just the discussions you're having with vendors now how, how they've evolved over the last couple of months with respect to the vendors trying to push through some cost increases. You've got oil now down to 90, it's not 140. How quickly are you kind of returning, or pushing back, for lack of a better term, on prior increases that they've asked for, under the old kind of oil price environment? Can you just talk a little bit about that, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, all the commodity stuff &#x2013; whether it's beef and poultry or all the raw materials that go into the baked goods, things like that &#x2013; those change daily and weekly. And they change downward, as well. When you're talking about basic goods like soap, detergent, and paper towels, our collective view has been while it's important for us to understand what caused the price increase, our view also is that some of it was pent-up demand, if you will, for the retailers having incredible strength to hold off on pricing, to hold back price increases from the manufacturers, because all the power was with us. Again, we saw that window of opportunity last quarter, when, again, we were &#x2013; when we saw the floodgates opening and everybody coming to us.</p>
          <p>On the freight side of it, I believe that we started fiscal '07, fiscal '08, a year and a month ago, with a freight rate based on a base of 100 a year or so, before that, something in the 120, 125 range. I think it peaked above 150, and now it's back at 130. So I mean that, again, those freight surcharge rates change daily or weekly. So I think on some of the items &#x2013; you see the slowdown of late &#x2013; is that the floodgates have closed a little bit. Everybody's worried about sales &#x2013; the manufacturers. Everybody's worried about getting their product out there. And pricing has come down, so I would guess that there's a little less increases &#x2013; the inflationary trends that we were concerned might continue for a while &#x2013; as of today, and it's only today &#x2013; they've subsided a little.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I was curious what kind of consumer reaction you were getting to the areas where you have been putting through the inflation. Have you seen any scaling back on volumes at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see our comps. And again, our view is we hold off as long as possible, but inevitably it has to be passed open. And I think we're comforted by the fact that we've always been the extreme competitor. And so we haven't seen any issue there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there any way you could walk us through some of the regional differences on how the comp is trending out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a qualitative basis? Sure. Hold on a minute. Hold on. Probably a big strength, if I look back all the way to '07, when the U.S. was a 5 for all of '07, and then all of '08, U.S. is an 8 &#x2013; I'm sorry, U.S. was a &#x2013; for the whole year was a 6.5. Now the 5 was probably darn near close to a 5, maybe a 4, 4.5 without gas. And the 6.5 is probably about a 4 for the year, ex gas inflation.</p>
          <p>Now, within those numbers, the two strong regions from '07 to more recently is in the Northwest and the Southeast. The Northwest is one of our most mature regions and highest-volume regions, save Southern California. California, again, has always been weaker than the rest, but that's where we've done a lot of cannibalization, and we start with the highest-volume units.</p>
          <p>I think the best way I described it was, several months ago, maybe even eight or nine months ago, when I was describing sales, and if you look back over the previous couple of years, if you split the U.S. into California and the rest of the U.S. &#x2013; and it was roughly a one-thirds two-thirds, or little over one-third and a little less than two-thirds split of the country, California versus the rest of the country &#x2013; that whatever our weighted average comp was for all of U.S., if you looked at just the gap between California and the rest of the U.S., going back a year and two years, that gap used to be in the 2, 250 basis point range. At its widest gap, call it six months ago, it was at 3.5 to 4%. It has come back &#x2013; it's not quite back at 2, but it's not 3.5 to 4 anymore. So there's probably been a slight improvement in California relative to the rest of the country. A nice improvement in the Northwest and the Southeast. But still being hit by the lower-comp California areas.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Dan Binder. Couple questions for you. As you look around, recognizing that your prices are anywhere from 20 to 30% lower than local grocers, but if you look around, you've seen folks like Safeway cut prices. And I'm just curious, as you think about next year, if we see the gap shrink between, let's say, grocers and Costco on price, are you inclined to open that gap up again to keep the top line going? How much are you willing to let the gap shrink if you don't feel a need to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the answer is yes, we're always going to drive sales. But I'm less concerned &#x2013; notwithstanding what all the others do. We have a little bit of a unique ability because it's not &#x2013; first of all, there's not a whole lot they can do on so many high-volume commodity items where we're both working on low margins to start with. And it's all those specialty items. When we can bring in cheeses and homeo replacement items and unique co-branded items, whether it's Pepperridge Farm cookies or &#x2013; I don't even know if that's co-brand anymore, I'm just trying to think of examples.</p>
          <p>But so many of our items &#x2013; part of our goal is to upscale and to be more gourmet, and so we're competing &#x2013; even within the supermarket business, clearly we're competing with them on all the commodity items, soda pop and detergents and analgesics and health and beauty aids and paper towels. But it's those specialty items, those upscale items, which if you haven't tried it there was that big can, that 40-ounce can of those crispy peanuts, the Virginia-type peanuts, nobody can compare. We're $6.99 for 40 ounces, and the local supermarket where my family shops is another dollar for 18 ounces. So there's so much room there, I really don't lose a lot of sleep about that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I think you &#x2013; on the last call you talked about having a wage agreement in place with your workers. Can you just remind us, when does that come up for renewal? Is it next year? And how would you anticipate that impacting the SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have 540 some-odd warehouses. Sixty locations are affiliated with Teamsters. The same 60, roughly 60, that were here the day of the merger, the merger of two roughly hundred-unit companies, Price and Costco, back in late 1993. It's a good relation. Wages and benefits similar to what we pay the employees in the other 480 warehouses. Although, it's all U.S., where that is.</p>
          <p>And we basically have in place for our unaffiliated employees, which is the vast majority, an employee agreement which is republished every third March. Right now, we're about a year and a half between it, so we're right in the middle of that three years. So nothing will happen between now and a year and a half ago. Recall that about two years ago, I believe, maybe two and a half years ago, we raised the bottom of the scale from 10 to 11 and 10.5 to 11.5.</p>
          <p>If there's &#x2013; we'll have to see. I think the pressures on us are a little less than the pressures on other retailers that pay less. Our average wage right now, average hourly wage in the U.S., is roughly $19, which is several dollars if not more than most big boxes out there, per hour. And so &#x2013; now, that being said, we always want to be the one that has that big gap. So we'll see. Could something happen in March of 2010? It's possible, but we'll have to wait and see. There's no expectation at this point that &#x2013; we'll always, by the way, raise top of scale. So every year, even people that have been at top of scale for 10 years know there's going to be some nominal amount of increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just two final things. If you can give us a little color on what's happening with TV sales right now and the inventory in the channel, how you think that may impact pricing and margins for the holidays? And then lastly, I think prior to today we were factoring in about a billion dollars of buyback for the coming year. Based on your comments earlier it sounds like it may not quite reach that. Any thoughts in terms of what kind of buyback assumptions you have in that guidance you provided today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, electronics changes month to month. On average &#x2013; I know back in August &#x2013; I haven't seen the detail on September yet. Back in August, in what we call majors, which is all electronics which was down, I think, mid-single digits in comps &#x2013; within that, TVs were actually closer to flat. Still had a negative in front of it, but closer to flat. Our challenge, actually, this Christmas has been to get availability, particularly of LCD screens. So to the extent that others are cutting back, that'll help us a little bit. We're not being aggressive on it, but we don't &#x2013; so far, we don't see any big issue there. Recognizing, for us, we don't have 75 SKUs of televisions and a three-month supply of each one. We've got 15 or 20 SKUs, if that, probably 15 or 20, five which are pending delete because we're down to the last two sell units on a pallet. And if we overbuy, maybe it takes an extra week or two to sell through the anticipated eight- or 10-week supply that we brought in on a given SKU.</p>
          <p>Was there another part to the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the last question had to do with the buyback assumptions, given your comments earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The buyback assumption is simply &#x2013; let's face it, it was a week ago that the stock was in the mid- to high 60s. Certainly expectations change a little bit. What I wanted to share &#x2013; the comment I made in the call was simply, with the concerns about liquidity out there &#x2013; and again, when we were shocked with enhanced money market funds back in December of last year, we did what was, we thought, prudent: earn even less of a return but be just in government funds, not outright direct treasuries, but government funds. And then one of those locks up. So it's more from the comment that let's see what shoe drops tomorrow. And hopefully, while shoes are dropping daily and who knows what's going to happen each day, that two or three months from now things change quite a bit.</p>
          <p>So on the one hand, as the stock comes down, we want to be a little more aggressive. But given the liquidity issue right now &#x2013; I mean, today and &#x2013; well, today we can't buy anyway because we're in blackout. But after tomorrow we'll see what we &#x2013; there's no commitment yet other than that we'll let you know at the end of each quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my call. Real quick, I'm trying to get myself wrapped around the range of the earnings per share. What percent of that range, the quarter range, would you consider due to volatility of gas prices?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Four or five weeks ago, we were going, "Woe is me."</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>So it's a nutty business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, can you, ramping up on your name, sticking to coverage, what percent of the footprint do you share with, say, Sam's and Wal-Mart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's predominantly a U.S. &#x2013; well, in Mexico too, but we don't consolidate that. In the U.S., you &#x2013; depending on how you define it &#x2013; as an example, in the Pacific Northwest and in Western Washington we have upwards of 20 units, and I believe they have two or three. And some would say that's 20 versus three in that competitive footprint. And we would argue at the other extreme it's as little as four or five versus their two or three. So maybe if you made the four or five seven or eight, everybody would be happy in this analysis. But something over half are competitive in the U.S. The U.S. being about 80% of our company. I believe Sam's in Canada has four to six units in and around Toronto, I believe, mostly, and we of course have 75 or so throughout the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so if I understand, you share about 50% of the same close location as Sam's or Wal-Mart?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam's, not Wal-Mart.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Sam's.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wal-Mart is everywhere, mostly everywhere. But whether it's Wal-Mart or Target or Home Depot or Kohl's, those are all everywhere. Really the biggest issue is the direct competition with Sam's and BJ's. We're certainly doing comp shops with others, from supermarkets chains to Home Depot on different categories, to Office Depot and Staples. But the real competitive issue has to be with other clubs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. You had mentioned earlier in the call that the nondiscretionary items had been comping in the high single digits to mid-teens and some of the furniture, jewelry, electronics, and housewares had been zero to minus 10 to 12%. Would you mind commenting on what the mix is on the dot-com channel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the mix with dot-com is very little food if anything. There's some gift baskets and some steaks and some wine and cheese. It's almost nonexistent. I mean, electronics -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Furniture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; furniture, sporting goods, jewelry exercise equipment. By far the biggest category is electronics. I mean, it's not half; it's probably not even 25%, but it's not 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the comps numbers &#x2013; if the overall channel has been growing at mid-20s -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Still all the way positive. Like this past month, we still have a positive dollar comp of 20-plus in the last month. But we've seen a change, even within that number. Traffic has been good, number of transactions has been fine. It's all been in average ticket. But our average ticket has been historically over 400 bucks in the last couple years. So again, no matter how good the savings is on that $2,800 furniture set or sofa or gadget, on a macro basis, some people are saying, we'll hold off a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you look at the combined sales in these more bigger-ticket items across stores and dot-com, how much of that slower growth you're potentially seeing is really coming from the macro environment or potentially that your consumer base is starting to get saturated with those items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Who knows? I mean, defensively I argued when asked the question that hey, the Wal-Marts and Target &#x2013; six months ago &#x2013; are showing decent electronics gains and your majors sales have slowed down a little bit. Well, we also for two years prior to that running we had 20 plus percent comps in a deflationary business, so &#x2013; units-wise, even more than that. So yes, you're right, our customer bought faster and bigger earlier. So there's probably a little bit about that. But we just worry about what today looks like, and so far, relatively speaking, we're holding our own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question, Richard. When you think about how consumers pay currently, has there been any change in terms of how much has been charged on credit cards versus other methods of payment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind, our relationship with Amex was started about eight years ago now. And if you go back 15 years ago, it was all cash and check, there were no debit. Today &#x2013; and there's a private label credit card as well, which is small percentage. But credit card is probably in the mid-30s, debit a little less than that. And the rest, cash and check. There's been no drop-off in credit card purchases in the last couple of months. But there's been a constant increase of penetration. But that has more, I think, to do with the fact that our partnership with American Express is a very good and strong one, and we work well together in our warehouse tabling activities and their marketing efforts to channel people into Costco. So it's worked well for both of us in that regard. And we have not seen any giant drop-off or anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my final question is, could you comment a little bit on cannibalization over the last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I forgot to mention that. Cannibalization in the fourth quarter was minus 70 basis points, trending less towards the end. In May, it was minus 80, and in August it was minus 50. Generally speaking, I mean, at its peak a couple of years ago, when it was almost 200, and when we're doing very little cannibalization, it's like 30 to 50. My guess it stays in the high double percentage numbers here. Maybe it goes a little over 100, but then down to 50 again. It just fluctuates in that range.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chuck Ceranokosky. Richard, when you're looking at the new members, as you rotate some out and get the new ones coming in, how are they shopping the club? And I'm looking for is there a balance between both sides of the club, or are they mainly joining for the nondiscretionary and the staples items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the one thing &#x2013; this is more anecdotal, but one thing that I've heard some of the operators talk about is when gas spiked a few months ago, there was another run, if you will, to sign up. When there's that spike, it always becomes the topic du jour on the news stations of where's the cheapest place in town to buy gas. And 95% of the time it's us. So that helps. And with that exception, I haven't heard a whole lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you look at what these people are buying, the newer members, or do you sort of train them, coax them, to shop the entire club?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. You know, it's kind of funny. We're probably a little simpler than that. And as Jim would say, we spend most of our time making sure we're not out of stock in toilet paper and coming up with some really cool treasure hunt items and always being the great value proposition. So again, looking at sales penetration, the fact that you're seeing bigger comps in those other areas by definition, but we haven't really segmented. I certainly haven't segmented it, looking at it that way, between new members and old members.</p>

          <p>Well, percentage-wise, it's clearly Asia, because we've only got four to eight locations in each of those countries. In UK, the opportunity is great, the speed at which approvals come in that country are greater &#x2013; or the lack of speed. And so we're thrilled if we can get two units a year open there on the base of 20-ish, 21.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, obviously all the discussion on the call on private label. Can you give us your current penetration levels? And can you also &#x2013; if we think down the road three to five years, what do you think that those could possibly reach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's right now right around 17.5, 18. The feeling is over the next five to eight years it could get into the mid-20s. If you've followed us for 20 years, we're always doing a little better than what we think. But it's not like we've got this great effort all of a sudden because the economy's going to be weak for a year, that we're going to put a renewed effort on it. We've got a pretty strong effort to develop new products, both private label and co-brand private label.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last question. Obviously a lot of questions and concerns on the inflationary pressures in this business. Can you give us any additional details in terms of what you're doing to mitigate those pressures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest is in terms of mitigating inflation is buying in as much as you can when there's a price increase announced or happening. We are not bringing down price points. We're not lowering the quality or the price point of the goods, so look at it that way. Other than that, I don't see a lot that we can do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking the question. I wondered &#x2013; you said earlier you saw membership spike up as gas prices peaked. If gas prices come down, do you think there will be a traffic impact on the negative side, or do you think basically as people have taken out the memberships, gotten used to coming to Costco if they weren't coming before, do you think traffic levels are pretty robust here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly haven't seen that yet, and probably in terms of my most arrogant response of the day, I think once we get you into the place we generally do a pretty good job of keeping you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Another question about the economy, maybe in a different way, is obviously, your sales and Wal-Mart's and BJ's are doing a fantastic job of taking market share, as people clearly see you as a place to save money. Maybe the one thing that differentiates you from Wal-Mart is that you have to spend quite a bit in terms of cash flow to get the savings because you're buying bulk. Do you think that if the economy continues to worsen, that the credit squeeze continues for consumers, that there might be a risk that these sort of &#x2013; the cash flow challenge of shopping at Costco could become an issue for a certain proportion of your shoppers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like the &#x2013; I remember, even a couple years ago, when people were saying, "Hey, the economy, it may slow down here, and that should help you because you guys are the value proposition." And I would retort back every time, there's also the other side of that is that people say "Hey, I spend 3, $400 every &#x2013; I can't get out of there for less than 300 bucks." Actually, you can get out of there for about 140, because that's our average &#x2013; 138 or whatever.</p>
          <p>But the fact of the matter is that we have not seen that. And I think what you're seeing is that our member's coming in and they are maybe being a little bit more disciplined, that they are holding off on buying those big-ticket items. But if our rough gross margin is 11 or 12% and regular supermarket chains are in the low to mid 20s, and the Home Depots and the Lowes are in the low to mid-30s, and mall stores are in the 35 to 50s, our savings are so extreme that you can't not come, there. I'm biased, mind you, but that argument has not played out. Certainly it is an argument -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you ever seen it play out historically or has it always remained very robust like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's kind of hard to tell you, Neil. Because &#x2013; someone asked me just yesterday about how does this economy compare &#x2013; how do we think our performance has gone just on sales that we've already reported over the last several months, compared to previous recessions, or weaknesses in the economy? And I said frankly, one of them was, what, in the early 2000s, and the previous one was in the early 1990s. Well, in the early 1990s, we were seven or eight years old and still growing and didn't know that anything was going on outside our world. And even in the early 2000s, relatively speaking, we had just come off of the enjoying the late '90s where earnings were compounding at 24% a year. So this is really kind of the first time we've been like this, and we're so far pretty pleased with our ability to drive business in this environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just a final question, if I may. At the tax rate, you got a useful benefit in the fourth quarter compared to maybe what we expected. How about for '09? What are your expectations on the tax rate there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably 36.5, maybe 37, to be conservative. And kind of &#x2013; I think generally speaking, we have had the benefit of more positive discrete things. In other words, something helping our tax rate in the quarter rather than negative and part because I think we've done a pretty good job of being conservative in how we accrue for things there. And occasionally actually winning on appeal on a disputed item. But I think you always have to assume something in the mid-36s to 37 as a base rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker with Montag &amp; Caldwell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. When you talked about delaying the pass-through of inflationary price increases, how far along are you in that? I mean, how much &#x2013; or you still sort of have to catch up on things that you really still need to absorb? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That one, a lot further along than we were when we chatted on July 23. And given that there's been a little subsiding of some of the price increases coming through &#x2013; recognizing, some of the things that are coming through right now were done four and six weeks ago when we were able to buy in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so they're just hitting right now. But I would say it's slowed a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think it would &#x2013; just what you're already still absorbing would affect the next quarter, but then you'll sort of be on a more normal footing, or &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it impacts the first quarter a little bit, but not nearly as it did Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, are you noticing any difference in trends if you compare sort of the Gold Star customer versus the Business customer or maybe looking at Executive members or the American Express cardholder? I mean, is there a lot of difference or is everybody pretty much shopping similarly, in terms of what they buy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, I would go with the latter. Clearly, our Executive members, when they first become an Executive member, spend a bunch more over the next year and then start comping back at the general public's average. But then at that higher base. And so we still see that with new Executive members. Beyond that, there's not a lot that we've discerned from it.  Don't see any difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also, two other quick things. One, when you talked about these extraordinary items, treasure-hunt type things that you haven't normally been able to get, are you still getting good sell-through of all those things, or are you running against buyer resistance on those things too? Or is it just those things are still such a great unexpected item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those things have been no-brainers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We get our hands on 5,000 units of X, it's a no-brainer, 10,000 units or 1,000 units, because the value is so much there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, just to spell out a little bit more about your attitude about your margin initiatives. I know there are a lot of other things going on, but are you still trying to improve that, given everything else that's going on, or what's your attitude about how much progress you can make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we're being prudent about it. Jim reminds us each month, the merchants, that let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Again, we were comforted by how we did in the first four weeks of this fiscal year. And Jim's out there reminding us that let's make sure that we don't get too ahead of the game here.</p>
          <p>So I think that &#x2013; again, I think the gap between us and everybody has been so great for so long. And mind you, even within our direct competition, where the opportunities are to make a fair margin a little fairer, if you will, is on those items that they're not directly competitive. We have different brands, different items, different custom packs, whatever it is. And so, clearly, as we all know &#x2013; as we know, as BJ's knows, as well as Sam's knows &#x2013; we're not going to let them get away with anything, and they're not going to let us get away with anything, if they can. So when we have unique items, that helps you a little bit.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Just one more &#x2013; just to follow up on the pricing a little bit. As you think about the LIFO charges going forward, and I know it's fairly difficult to project, but should we think about it in the same kind of magnitude that you saw in the fourth quarter? And I know the fourth quarter is a 16-week quarter. But is it going to be a few pennies for at least the first half of the year as you kind of &#x2013; until we get into a more normalized operating environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We analyze each quarter. If I extrapolated out the first four weeks of this 12-week quarter the answer would be no, it would be less. But who knows what tomorrow brings?</p>
