          <p>Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Quarterly Financial Statements to 2012 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Christian Becker-Hussong. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. Thanks for joining us for our call on the first half 2012 financial results and July renew.</p>
          <p>Today's speakers are Nikolaus von Bomhard, CEO, J&#xF6;rg Schneider, CFO, and Torsten Jeworrek, CEO, Reinsurance. Nikolaus will kick it off with a short overview on Munich Re Group's current status. J&#xF6;rg will then provide more details in capital investment and segmental financials before Torsten is going to elaborate on the Reinsurance business.</p>
          <p>Following Nikolaus' brief outlook, we will enter into the usual Q&amp;A. So far, so good, Nikolaus the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you, Christian. Good morning, good afternoon, wherever you hear us. And I would like to start it off going right into slide three, but saying that I think what we have in front of us is a quite satisfying set of numbers for the first half year 2012.</p>
          <p>What seems to be proving itself is a robust approach is our conservative business model. As I see it, it proves robust in quite uncertain times, and thanks to the first half year results, we are quite well on track to slightly surpass the originally envisage profit for the year.</p>
          <p>By taking out only three items on slide three, I would like to refer you to the investment result briefly. Here on this I think you all do know, we tried to be prepared for all thinkable scenarios, which of course comes at a cost as regards to the ROI.</p>
          <p>Reinsurance looks very different from the first half year last year, for obvious reasons much less on the natural catastrophe side. On the hand however, we already did reserve US$200 million for the drought in the U.S., an event that Torsten will refer to later on.</p>
          <p>Primary Insurance, very important is the what we call the quality in efficiency program in sales, a project that has been brought to the public only some 10 days ago, which will do and shall do two things. On the one hand streamline our advisory approach in the tight agent sales force and at the same time making us more efficient in sales, which shall lead to a cost saving of around &#x20AC;160 million towards the end of 2014. Along with that of course comes the question whether or not, we will have to set up a restructuring sort of provision by the end of the year. We don't have concrete numbers yet. Because we still have to discuss and negotiate with the Workers Council on that project, but I guess that by quarter four, we'll have the numbers ready and we'll put them up with relevance still for the current year.</p>
          <p>Coming to the next slide, four. This is an overview over the different quarters, the last eight quarters in fact and you see that the three of those eight do deviate a little bit from what I would call an average quarter. And the once ticking out of course is the first quarter last year. Overall the results swing I think is quite convincing &#x20AC;1.8 billion what we are somehow proud of is that the volatility of the capital markets over the last years of the crisis did not really get us off track. What did get us off track in fact was the volatility of the reinsurance business and that we always said is fine as long as we stay within our budgets and our assumptions.</p>
          <p>The last remark maybe here is on the result of Primary Insurance. The segment result is at close to &#x20AC;300 million, the result for the ERGO Group on its own is &#x20AC;255 million. Both numbers up compared to last year, but please don't double them already, because this is was a little better than it should have been.</p>
          <p>Slide five, is referring to the global economic development. We think that compared to our last presentation it's a little gloomier. The Eurozone is in the recession mode. There's no doubt about that even though Germany does a little better. What is little bit unknown is the U.S., because we don't see strong growth in policies yet. The housing and labor market did calm down a little bit, yes. But we all anxiously wait for the &#x2013; what one calls the fiscal cliff and the question the new administration will handle that, that may have major repercussions on the economy in U.S. of course.</p>
          <p>The developing countries and emerging markets did develop quite nicely, but of course at a lesser pace, all of them. What is difficult for us and I've said that in the morning already is not so much volatility of the markets, nor the slowing of the global economy, it's in the first place and of course this is connected to the further two level of interest rates that keeps us on our toes, not only in life insurance but also in insurance overall, because certainly we do have to price in the return on investments to some extent.</p>
          <p>Slide six, a brief run through only. What you see here that is different on what Torsten shows you is the entire year on the renewal side for reinsurance, quite pleasing as we see it so far. Very good Life Reinsurance continues to be good fluctuating a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, but overall on course. And I already here referred to the efficiency program, for the ERGO sales. Important to the lower right of that slide is the turnaround which is now tangible with ERGO international and that's in fact only South Korea slightly above 100% combined and Turkey over this is below and we think we now have a handle to that issue.</p>
          <p>Next slide seven, here I am talking a little bit about the investments. As I've said not only for the crisis, we since 2004 focused on the liabilities that are on our balance sheet and tried to strictly limit investment risk and managed them as closely as possible, including interest rate sensitivity. This is not new to you, in the upper part of the slide, in fact what we experienced in the last quarter is that we had a hard time catching up with the falling interest rates despite as sensitivity for the group is not what it used to be last quarter where it close to zero, it's more than &#x20AC;8 million for one basis point up on the yield curve, but still as we see it's manageable. Overall, you can diversification at work here across the two business segments Primary and Reinsurance. Reinsurance a little longer and Primary Insurance shorter also for its very business model and we try to compensate it and manage that actively to come close to a zero amount for the Group.</p>
          <p>The lower part of that slide interesting I think only for one reason. It shows you to what extent we are exposed to certain risks in the capital market right now in terms of relative share to the capital. And you see that the safe haven countries are close to the 10 times as relevant in terms of unrealized gains as or exposure compared to the PIIGS countries and then in fact this is a gross picture. Assuming that all the policyholder's funds do hold this sector goes up and close to even 18% on a net basis.</p>
          <p>My last slide is a slide on Solvency II which of course is a difficult animal these days because it's so hard to predict what will exactly happen when. The trialogue European Parliament Commission and Council did to come to terms before summer break, so they had to postpone their decision, which of course may, let's say, that may disturb the entire time plan. The discussion is an old one if you like on the question of how to set the interest rate terms structure right for the liabilities &#x2013; long liabilities of our insurance business. Still we talk about extrapolation method actually a little less than we used to it's &#x2013; mostly about countercyclical agreement and most of all about the matching adjustment.</p>
          <p>What is important to us is that we get things done rightly in a way that the right incentives will be set for doing the business, moving forward that one sticks to the letter and spirit of the Solvency II Directive to the extent possible. We still like the Solvency II even it's a major work at our end still is in fact because we prepare for the application. We think it's worth it because the right way to look at our business but we also agree that some smoothing going forward at today's interest rate level and economic conditions is not only acceptable but necessary to appropriately reflect the very nature of insurance business.</p>
          <p>The transition is not only likely, it will sure come, the challenge here is to make sure that you don't distort the level of playing field by sticking or allowing too much of a national decision on how exactly trends refer or the move into the new world of Solvency II. This all is being discussed both on the level one of the European legislation, the directive, the Omnibus II Directive as well on level two implementing measures.</p>
          <p>I don't take any bets or at least I wouldn't come up with one when Solvency II will be effective. As of today the likelihood of 2014, this may be still the highest, maybe it's a little later in 2014. I guess the latest that I can imagine is 2015.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to hand it over to J&#xF6;rg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nikolaus. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Before I talk about capital, let me point your attention to the fact that we had non-recurring currency losses for the first half year of overall minus &#x20AC;91 million. This is a negative swing of &#x20AC;287 million compared with 2011, and this makes the good result even more remarkable.</p>
          <p>We had some one-offs which by and large offset each other, but the year 2012 is much more normal than 2011. There are changes in comparison to 2012 which most &#x2013; between 2011 and 2012 these are mostly caused by major one-off items in 2011 like the major nat cat or like the impairments of our Greek bonds.</p>
          <p>I'll start with slide 10; our capital position remains strong according to all metrics. In the first quarter, our IFRS shareholders equity had grown by 4.8% and in the second quarter, there was another increase of almost 4% or &#x20AC;945 million. And this in-spite of the dividend payout of &#x20AC;1.1 billion and you see the reasons in the right column of that slide, foreign exchange development, plus &#x20AC;581 million. This is mainly due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Consolidated result, shareholders share of higher unrealized gains and losses, this was mainly due to the declining yields of the safe haven bonds.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the bottom of the slide, our debt leverage is back to the pleasingly low level of 2011. This is due to the impact of our buyback of &#x20AC;700 million of 2003 subordinated loan. We have no refinancing needs for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Our economic capital provision, we do not publish numbers on a quarterly basis, because we do not calculate the embedded value on a quarterly basis. I can give you an indication, although we have suffered in 2012 from declining swap-rates and increasing interest-rate volatility, our economic solvency ratio was a bit higher at the end of June than at the end of December 2011.</p>
          <p>Just to remind you at that date end of 2011, our available financial resources where 111% of Munich Re's target, capital level or in terms of Solvency II confidence level of 99.5%, confidence level, it was ratio of 194%. The further improvement in the second half of 2012 was mainly caused by the good underwriting performance with the high profit.</p>
          <p>With regard to the rating capital there, anyway nothing to worry about. We had a substantially low single-digit billion buffer above the AA requirements. The Group Solvency I capital stands at more than 2.5 times the required level. Hence for the German GAAP revenue reserve, the buffer for future dividends is increasing even after strengthening the equalization reserve against the backdrop the low large losses in 2012 year-to-date. So, all these varying metrics are currently pointing in the same direction. We are well equipped to seize business opportunities.</p>
          <p>On slide eleven, you see our standard overview of our well diversified investment portfolio. The market values increased by &#x20AC;10 billion to now &#x20AC;217 billion. We still have an emphasis on highly rated securities as Nikolaus demonstrated before and there were only small changes in the asset allocation.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to diversify our portfolio to deal with all kinds of scenarios as the capital markets remain very volatile. In Q2, specifically, we reduced our exposure to the Spanish covered bonds by &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;2.7 billion now, mainly by active sales. We also disposed of some Southern European government bonds, reduced our exposure especially to Greece and Portugal to zero, we made net investments in U.S. treasuries, British covered bonds in emerging market, government bonds and in supranational bonds that is mainly EU and EFSF. And we saw the market value of our safe haven assets increase also due to the currency effects.</p>
          <p>Let us move on to slide 12 for the composition of our investment results. For the first half year, the investment result totaled more than &#x20AC;4 billion. This is equal to an annualized return on investment of 3.8%, for second quarter only 3.4%. Regular income of roughly &#x20AC;2 billion translates into a return of 3.7% and you can see the decline here, we reinvest at lower interest rates. The average reinvestment rate for the first half year was 2.8%, but this is just the average, currently we must rather think in terms of 2% to 2.5% with some bias to the lower end of this range.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter on a standalone basis the decline of the running yield was mitigated by the dividend income. We had relatively low write-ups, write-downs; a strong contribution from net capital gains in quarter one, but no excessive harvesting. Overall, the on and off balance sheet reserve even grew in the second quarter by almost &#x20AC;3 billion to now &#x20AC;16.4 billion that is 7.6% of market value. As far as the segments are concerned, I will start with Primary Insurance and Munich Health and then I will hand over to Torsten for Reinsurance.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, Primary Insurance premium income, property casualty was up by 1.2% and this in spite of some negative foreign exchange effect. This is mainly domestic growth partially due to the strong German economy. Life was down 2.9%. This was German and international business, mainly endowment policies. And the APE, Annual Premium Equivalent of new business declined by 12.7%. This is, in our view, tolerable in such a low interest environment.</p>
          <p>Health Insurance showed a marginal fall in premium income. In supplementary health, premiums for the first six months grew by 3% year-on-year, but dipped slightly by 0.5% in comprehensive health insurance. As expected, new business in comprehensive health insurance in the first half was down compared with the same period last year, which had benefited from the evolution as at January 1 2011 of the three-year waiting period for switching to private health insurance. So it was a special positive effect in 2011.</p>
          <p>Primary Life, slide 15, had a good technical and net result. This was driven by an investment result with a return on investment of 4.3%. 0.3 percentage points of that were due to the increase in value of our swaption programs, with which we protect us against low interest scenarios.</p>
          <p>Another 0.5% came from investments for unit-linked business. This is not relevant for our bottom line because it is fully compensated by an increase of the provision for future policy holder benefits.</p>
          <p>Also some gains were realized to compensate for losses from further de-risking of the portfolio. Therefore, the good investment result as well as the net result should not be taken for granted for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, German Health. The technical result was down mainly due to higher medical expenses. The investment result developed favorably benefiting from not having to absorb the write-downs on Greek government bonds in 2012. All together both the operating result and the consolidated result improved.</p>
          <p>Property-Casualty slide 17 together with 18. The improved technical result came from a slightly better combined ratio and also from a special technical effect that is the refinement of the calculation of the technical interest for the foreign business, which is now based on all technical provisions and not only on the provisions for outstanding claims. The effect is &#x20AC;31 million alone of this change.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, combined ratio for German business was 3.8 percentage points worse than in the first half of 2011, which is not shown here on the slide. This was partly due to weather related claims and technical one-offs from the first half year 2011. But the combined ratio was better than for 2011 as a whole and what is worth noticing, German Motor is improving.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, the combined ratio of international business improved nicely by more than 7% to 98.9%. This has to be stabilized further. As you can see on the following slide 19, there is still some way to go for our Turkish subsidiary, but they are first cautious signs of improvement. It is on the right track.</p>
          <p>We successfully sold our operations in Korea, the deal is to be closed, but in this quarter, in the second quarter, we took a P&amp;L hit of &#x20AC;35 million. Our Polish subsidiary is back to its strong performance.</p>
          <p>Munich Health, slide 21, with the exception of the German Health Insurance belonging to ERGO Munich Re's global healthcare insurance and reinsurance expertise is combined under the Munich Health brand. In each of the first two quarters of 2012, growth, premiums written increased year-on-year. In Reinsurance, they were up by 10.9% to &#x20AC;2.2 billion in the first half. This was mainly owing to higher premium income from large volume treaties and organic growth in North America and the U.K. in particular.</p>
          <p>In Primary Insurance, premium income from our European companies and North America grew by almost 18% to &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Its exchange rates had remained unchanged. Our growth premium income would have shown a year-on-year increase of 8%.</p>
          <p>Next slide 22, combined ratio for January, which is not shown here was 100.5%. Reinsurance had a more favorable claims experience overall and profitable new business, in Primary, there was some deterioration due to the cost from U.S. Medicare business. Of the kind of pure cost reimbursements product which will expire at the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Very good performance from our subsidiary in Spain. The investment results improved somewhat on the previous year's level. Foreign exchange and investment income movements had relatively strong negative non-recurring impact. All-in-all consolidated result was lower than in the same period last year.</p>
          <p>With that, to Torsten for Reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to discuss the Reinsurance results and start on slide 24 with the premium development in the first half of 2012 and gross premium &#x20AC;13.7 billion, which is a growth of 4.7%. When you look at the composition, it's exclusive &#x2013; or almost exclusively driven by foreign exchange effects, organic change in these six months minus &#x20AC;132 million, which were caused exclusively by non-life business.</p>
          <p>When you look into non-life, non-life itself plus 1.4% in the right side of this slide, plus &#x20AC;116 million; and here the currency contributes more than &#x20AC;450 million positive to this &#x20AC;116 million growth. In other words, without considering currency, the organic growth was minus &#x20AC;340 million. And you would ask now why this negative change? Then, this is almost exclusively cost by expiration of a few large solvency related treaties in China from one client. We reported in the past years that there was demand in China for temporary solvency deals, which helped some clients to improve their solvency ratios. And it was foreseeable that not all of these treaties would be renewed and here we see the first sort of negative impact minus &#x20AC;300 million from non-renewal of such treaties.</p>
          <p>But on the Life side, very satisfactory growth plus 10.6%, &#x20AC;500 million, approximately &#x20AC;300 million part of that generated by currencies. The other &#x20AC;200 million organic growth. Where did it come from? To some extent from our successful china operation, which produced more growth and to another part from the large deals, the large treaties, which we concluded in the previous years. And those treaties generates still organic growth now. There were no new treaties written in Life in the last six months. One of the largest treaties however could already now be prolonged and extended.</p>
          <p>On the next slide 25, Life Reinsurance result and I would call it an unspectacular result on a very, very good level, &#x20AC;250 million stable when you look at the net result and maybe more interesting for you the technical result. Remember here we set a target of &#x20AC;400 million for the full year. After six months, we achieved &#x20AC;255 million already. There are always some fluctuations maybe the first quarter was a bit overstated, bit on the high side. We leave the target of &#x20AC;400 million unchanged, but we think we are on a very good way to achieve that this year.</p>
          <p>Investment result lower, and that has to do with high disposal gains in 2011, which could not be repeated this time. Tax income back to a more sort of normal after some of extraordinary burden last year did not lead to tax reductions.</p>
          <p>On the next slide 26, picture for non-life business. All the changes, dramatic changes, dramatic improvements, which you see here when you compare 2012 with 2011 are caused by the change in the natural catastrophe activity in those two years. When you look at the technical results, there is a difference between 2011, 2012 of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. That is almost exactly the difference of nat cat activity, which was &#x20AC;3.0 billion and explains it. So in other words we are back to a normal profitable level, where we want to be. Investment results stable and reduction in the other section is driven by the tax, also very explainable because 2011 led to a large tax release caused as a metro catastrophe events.</p>
          <p>Next slide 27, here, I would like now to dig a bit deeper into the non-life business, into the combined ratio as usual. Combined ratio is &#x2013; I would call it back to a normal level 95.7% for the first six months. That is satisfactory considering the circumstances and events, which occurred.</p>
          <p>What happened? I'll start with the man-made loss activity. Contribution of man-made looses in the first six months 4.7%. I would call that slightly above our long term average and also above previous year. Largest losses, which did occur was first across the Costa Concordia event in February, which is a medium size, middle double-digit million amount, and similar, the fire of Avionic in Germany, about &#x20AC;60 million. And then we had a few run-off losses from previous years not one specific loss, but various which deteriorated a bit.</p>
          <p>On the nat cat side, nat cat activity 4.0% which looks relatively low. The largest event, the tornados, various tornados in the United States, which contributed &#x20AC;135 million, thereof &#x20AC;80 million in the second quarter and then the two Italian earthquakes, which occurred in May 2012, are a bit higher than we originally developed here. We reserved a high double-digit amount in the first six months.</p>
          <p>And what else happened and of course here I have to mention the drought &#x2013; the ongoing drought in the United States, Nikolaus mentioned it already. And that is an event which is still in progress and which started in June 2012. And because of the ongoing nature of the event, the final loss depends on various sectors and can only be reported in the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>So what have we done? We sort &#x2013; the indications are strong enough to make a decision, to book a result in the second quarter already of &#x20AC;160 million. It has a bit to do with our prudent reserve policy. The reserve we booked was basically calculated from the exposures, which we run and considering the affected states, which are affected by the droughts currently.</p>
          <p>And this &#x20AC;160 million is an extra &#x2013; sort of extraordinary contribution of 1.9% to our half-year combined ratio. So in other words, deducting that it would theoretically mean combined ratio is a bit higher than 93%.</p>
          <p>Why have we made this decision? It gives also some release for the remaining quarters of 2012, and takes uncertainty out of our prediction, our forecast. And I'll come to that event a bit later and explain how we are positioned in the multi-peril crop insurance in United States.</p>
          <p>Maybe then third comment before I leave the slide. And when you look at the basic losses, as in the first quarter of 2012, they might appear or look high. What happened here? Remember, we have a reserving policy in place, which is intentionally conservative for the younger underwriting years. In other words to consider and to take into account the uncertainty of the youngest, we've put an extra margin into our youngest or newest loss reserves. That happens in the first and second quarter. We have not done reserve review yet; that will only happen in Q3 and Q4.</p>
          <p>In other words, there are no positive reserve contributions. And for that reason, for this asymmetric behavior in our reserving policy, you see always in the first and second quarter is slightly higher, basic loss figure in our results. What are the indications? Indications without mentioning or giving you the precise figure deviated from our &#x2013; what we call, actual expected comparison in our reserves, expectation for Q3, Q2 in respect of reserve releases are positive.</p>
          <p>Next slide 28. I would like to describe our involvement in the U.S. multi-peril crop insurance schemes. And why do we show this loss, what drives this loss? On the left side of that slide 28, you see our &#x2013; an overview of our agricultural book worldwide. We write approximately &#x20AC;900 million and 70% of that is generated in the United States, which is approximately US$750 million and that is almost exclusively multi-peril crop insurance. And that means here we have leading position in agricultural reinsurance, 10 year combined ratio, and the average is about 95%.</p>
          <p>The multi-peril crop insurance is what we call a state supported crop insurance scheme and it's collaboration of private, of the public sector together with state sector and it covers all possible kinds of natural perils.</p>
          <p>We exclusively entertain that business on the proportionate basis. We don't write any non-proportionate reinsurance structures, which are typical for reinsurance. In other words, the losses, which you see the premiums, which we write are proportionate share of this original private/public partnership scheme and of course, it's extremely short-tail in its nature.</p>
          <p>What's happened this year? And my words are, Reinsurance is always exciting. This time crop insurance made it more exciting. And when you look at the medium part of the slide, U.S. drought, the year started very normal. In May, the farmers and the specialists set optimal growing conditions in the United States. Then as from June onwards, consideration deteriorated. There were a lack of rainfall. There was extraordinary drought and extreme heat conditions. There was what they call early summer drought.</p>
          <p>75% of the corn and soybeans area was affected with &#x2013; and this means an involvement of 50% of MPCI portfolio. You'll see on the map, the dark red color states are those states which are mostly affected by the drought.</p>
          <p>And what happens now? And here you have to understand the nature of the private partnerships scheme. In the United States, under this scheme, you have two basic objectives and conditions. And it's a scheme which allows each and every farmer to be accepted by the scheme. That means, each farmer in the United States has access to insurance. And the other cornerstone is that there is a sort of predetermined formula in that scheme, which determines the amount of coverage, which is available for a specific farmer depending on his average yield, depending on the location where he lives. And on this experience and there is a predetermined premium calculation for each farmer.</p>
          <p>You can ask now how is that possible to participate as a private insurance company in such a scheme where you as an insurer can neither decline a farmer, nor you can charge an individual price what you want? There is a sort of compensation in this scheme for the inflexibility. And the compensation works in a way that the insurance companies must accept the farmer, but they have done right depending on the quality of the location and the farmer is to retain it to a larger extent in their net or to receive a larger extent to the U.S. government. So that means that retention is variable and gets insurer a right to anti select against the U.S. government. And this of course gives, in theory and in reality, the portfolio which generates then the right profits for the participating insurance companies.</p>
          <p>There is although then a sort of stop loss or a cat loss protection in place by the U.S. government for the private insurance companies and this stop loss protection works by insurer, by state. And it gradually increases in line with an increasing loss ratio in each of the states. The maximum loss ratio as from which onwards all further losses are ceded to the U.S. state is 500%. So that is a maximum cap per state. And based on this &#x2013; on the affected states and the possible limitation and coverage given by the U.S. government, we calculated our &#x20AC;160 million, US$200 million involvement.</p>
          <p>And what can change our loss? Is it conservative, is it not conservative? For the affected States it's a conservative assumption based on exposures, again there are loss reports or anything like that.</p>
          <p>The real loss can only be determined in October or November this year. It's based on exposure. For the affected states, that is a conservative assumption. It can however certainly increase under a scenario where further U.S. states become involved in the drought. There are no indications for that at this point in time, but of course we cannot completely exclude that.</p>
          <p>And then maybe my last comment, what will this drought mean now for the future? Because of this predetermined scheme where the maximum available sum insured and the price is predetermined, it means that in the affected states, the available coverage in the future for affected farmers will reduce. In other words, the retention of such farmers does increase. In other words, the private insurance companies move further apart or away from the risk.</p>
          <p>And due to the pricing formula, there are some price adjustment which will probably become effective not in 2013 yet, but maybe probably in 2014 due to a delayed reporting period. So in other words, the potential to generate increased profits will increase in times or in years after such event like this we have seen in 2012.</p>
          <p>So, so far the drought I'll switch to slide 29 and make a few remarks and describe the renewal of July 1. July 1, this is &#x2013; second figures renewal date of our P&amp;C treaty book premium which was up for renewal, you see it on the right side is &#x20AC;1.9 billion. And the main areas in which this renewal took place was North America, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 30 you see the result for our Munich Re portfolio. On the left side, the premium up for renewal &#x20AC;1.9 billion. On the right side the new premium volume on an underwriting year basis, &#x20AC;2.2 billion, which is an increase of 18.5%, so very satisfactory increase. I will come to that later, why we achieved it and what cost us this change?</p>
          <p>Maybe more important for you on that slide, the pure price change is two percentage points, you see that here in the middle of the chart, the other 16.5% of the premium volumes are related to exposure changes.</p>
          <p>So, we are pleased with that result, particularly, if you consider that it was a renewal where the majority of the premium income was generated in states or countries which were not affected by losses. We needed other reasons to change price and achieved that at least partly.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, an overview by the line of business, what drove this change? In the upper row, you'd see the price change by a line of business and by segment. In the lower row, you'll see the volume change. And here I think it has to be mentioned what caused the change in property proportionate business because that is the main driver for this 18.5% volume increase. And that is mainly a new treaty underwriting view from agricultural business.</p>
          <p>And this additional treaty contributed alone &#x20AC;275 million. To answer question which you will ask anyway, this new treaty did not contribute to the loss because it's underwriting year basis, the risk periods will only start in the coming year.</p>
          <p>And what else should be mentioned here, strong as price increase, of course by property excess non-proportionate business, of course from Australia and New Zealand where we achieved price increases in the order of 10% to 30% and in some cases up to 50%. In the United States, the price increase on the non-proportionate side was a bit lower than we expected. We originally expected price increases in the order of 10%, finally achieved 5%. RMS version 11 did support that price increase, but not to the extend we expected.</p>
          <p>You see then on the property non-proportionate book, the volume change of minus 4.8% and you can ask of course why did that happened if prices to increase, why did we reduced our book. This is basically a reflection of increased retention in Australia, to some extent also in United States, so less coverage was available in the market.</p>
          <p>On the last slide, I would like to give you here, slide 32, an overview of renewal 2012, the July renewal and compare that with July 2011, you see here the differences U.S. slightly behind the level of 2011. Of course we have to consider that large extent of the RMS related price increases did occur already one year ago. In Latin America and the Caribbean, an unchanged good pricing environment. There are some lack of capacity in that market and yes, Munich Re is well positioned to take advantage of that. And in Australia, another round pricing increases, which also reflect the increased losses from New Zealand, which did develop over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>All together, again 2.0% price increase versus 5.7% one year ago. We think under the current circumstances, that is a pretty good development. What is insufficient at &#x2013; in this environment I think is stronger increase in the primary rates, and to catch-up with the deteriorating interest environment. Here we have not seen the significant &#x2013; some &#x2013; I would say some increases but not significant increases to improve the picture.</p>
          <p>So that's from my side and I return to Nikolaus. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you Torsten and I'll finish it off with slide 34, which is the outlook for 2012. And the word outlook refers to rows that you here see including the combined ratios. And let me summarize by saying what I said when I started it off. I think that we have a business approach that proved robust so far, all through the five years of crisis and our clients do consider as a rock solid partner and we hopefully are being perceived as reliable by you, the shareholders and analysts in times of uncertainty.</p>
          <p>As I've said, we started already in 2004 to clearly focus on the insurance side of our balance sheet and by doing so tried to limit the correlation to economic cycles' ups and downs, and ups and downs of the capital markets as well. Risk management was on the top of our agenda already in 2004 and it's stayed up there, also of course for Solvency II, but we decided very earlier that is the name of the game for us, underwriting and decent risk management. And that is helping us to the extent possible also what I called our biggest challenge the low yield environment.</p>
          <p>The name of the game on the investment side of our balance sheet, the asset side of the balance sheet is diversification. We try to &#x2013; yeah, you could say, to be almost everywhere. We don't want put that the eggs in one basket, only we try to prepare for every different sometimes even really remote scenarios giving up upside as regards the ROI. But we never want to be caught on the wrong foot.</p>
          <p>The capital position as J&#xF6;rg put it is strong. It gives us flexibility and it certainly makes it possible for us to seize whatever opportunity is out there as regards profitable growth and the dividend continuity. And I hope you sensed that statement of J&#xF6;rg, where he said that the revenue reserves is better than it ever was in the last two, three years and that also after already we paid the dividend in the current year. So we feel that we're well on track after six month of this year to even slightly surpass the originally envisaged profit for the year. We worked in already the drought reserve as Torsten explained. We cannot work in yet, because we don't have the numbers yet, the restructuring expenses as a consequence of the sales project at ERGO.</p>
          <p>We feel quite well and Torsten mentioned that as regard to our reserving position so far, when it comes to basic losses, we did not check our reserves, but we see however, is that the experience of actual to expect it so far also the year is benign. So this is rather than an upside than a downside, but in few of the overall uncertainty out there, and of course not knowing what Mother Nature holds for us. We feel, we should not go beyond what I just said that we see a chance to slightly surplus the originally envisaged profit. This is it from me and I turn it back to Christian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instruction] I will now move to our first question for today from Maciej Wasilewicz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maciej from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions if I may. The first relates to your renewals. I saw that in the casualty section, you saw a 1% improvement in pricing and you grew the July renewals by 12%. Is that pricing figure that you gave the 1%, is that adjusted for the full that you've seen in yields in over the last year? So, that means that the actual pricing, the nominal pricing must be up massively, because yields have fallen. So first question is whether or not that's for the case?</p>
          <p>The second question, I wanted to ask is of course, you've told us	 then your basic loss ratio hasn't really reacted in the last six months to the improving pricing situation. Now you've said that this is because your margins, you are reserving very conservatively especially in the first half of the year. Is there any way you can at all quantify what additional conservatism you're putting in there, perhaps if you give us your confidence level on reserves or if your reserve buffer has increased? Is there anything you can give us there, so we can track just how conservative that basic loss ratio is, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me &#x2013; this is Nicholas, I'll start with the second one and then Torsten takes up the first one. I think we tried last time at the conference or at the Analyst Conference in London to explain what we consider our strategy here. And J&#xF6;rg &#x2013; Torsten just repeated again that we are very conservative in the first place. What we don't want to do is to come up with an exact, sort of kind of combined ratio points that we do expect. Last year, it was in the range of two to three. That may be a ballpark but we don't know exactly because things can change. You get fresh information on the long-tail claims that change the pattern and the picture, that's why we are very cautious there.</p>
          <p>The only thing that I can and I did say in fact, with the outlook is that, so far first six months of the year, we are very well on track and we see a cushion building up again actual versus expected. But forgive us and me, if we don't put the number to it yet. Torsten?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the price changes, so the figures you see in row price changes are not adjusted for changes in interest. So we always say that is not new that we have a permanent uphill struggle to achieve price increases which we measure on the technical side to compensate for declining interest. Of course that mainly was a major issue for the casualty business. And to give you an idea or rough figure for the renewals &#x2013; for the renewal in July, the interest rate for our book of business on a underwriting year basis and considering the duration declined by about 1%.</p>
          <p>So in other words, when you take the 2% and make economic view of the price change, you have to deduct approximately 1%. I don't have the figure available for casualty here, but the 12% you see on the slide 31 is of course only a volume, so price change is plus 1% you have to deduct an interest rate decline against that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would it be fair just &#x2013; if I could just finish on that point. Because that 1% price change given sort of the very long tail nature of this business, the multi-year nature, it would seem to me if you had a 1% decrease in your yield that the economic profitability of this business would have decreased quite substantially, so the question would then be why you increased the volume by 12%? I mean there is something obviously that I am missing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I do not agree with your assumption. The casualty business which we write and entertain on an underwriting year basis, it is in terms of duration completely different from our existing reserve book. It's pretty, pretty short-tail, what we have here. It's mainly driven by motor-type business and so therefore your assumption I think is not in line with reality. I would say that it's flat in terms of pricing if you make this deduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, fantastic, thank you very much. Great numbers. Actually I had &#x2013; my two questions. The first one, I was trying to get to a kind of underlying number in these results because you had lots of one-off negatives. I count the crop loss, I guess &#x20AC;160 million down disposal loss, &#x20AC;35 million, the life swaption gain which was offsetting and the FX loss of &#x20AC;91 million. So if I add all this together, your &#x20AC;1.1 billion reported operating profit becomes &#x20AC;1.3 billion. And if I multiply by that four and tax it, I guess I get to &#x20AC;4 billion which is way, way above. You are saying slightly above &#x20AC;2.5 billion and of course I am multiplying lots of things and you said there were offsetting factors. So maybe if you can give an idea of where you feel the underlying is at the moment? That would be really helpful.</p>
          <p>And then on the German non-life, Q1 was 91%, Q2 was 94% and so that actually was strange, given that in Q1, there was a comment in the slide saying, we have lots of storm losses, almost implying that the underlying was way, way better. Can you maybe say a little bit what happened there? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, this is J&#xF6;rg here. You correctly quoted these numbers with which you adjusted our result. But I would regard them as being seen on an individual basis non-recurring, but nevertheless typical for such a year, except for the FX part. So, therefore, our prognosis of 2.5 plus a little bit is based on very solid ground, I would say. But at least myself, I do not have a fantasy which goes far beyond. Nikolaus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>People do have different fantasy levels. I would like to answer your second question, Michael. And that is on quarter two combined ratio Germany in non-life, and the reason is a relatively simple one. We had a little bit of a time drag as regards the booking of winter freeze losses that came in late in the first quarter and have been booked in the second only. And the other one is single large losses on the commercial industrial book in fire. So that is random.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And two questions, please. The first was just returning to the question of casualty lines you mentioned in the July renewal. I wonder if you could just shed a bit more light on how you see the relevant markets there, because I sort of detect a slight improvement in your tone as regards the casualty business. And you do say now there are more positive factors of, say, outweighing the negative ones. So, could you just maybe give us a bit of an outlook there and what the specific moving parts are?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is, J&#xF6;rg, you mentioned &#x2013; so you indicated that the economic capital position would be somewhat higher now than it was at year-end. Can I just confirm my assumption that that doesn't include any model changes specifically as it relates to sort of liquidity premiums or derivatives in the point at which you're anchoring the yield curve? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start with the second question. No, there are no &#x2013; not substantial model changes, included especially we do not include up to now anything of the various premia, which have been discussed for Solvency II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I come to your casualty related question. It's difficult to make a general comment here. And usually I would say the casualty market that has not achieved to translate a declining interest into the necessary adequate premium changes, premium increases. So we struggle a bit this with this market to be very honest. There are however some exceptions in Latin America, in the UK motor business, and so where premium environment is very good. These are regional observations. What we see currently is that there are few markets like the German motor market where premium rates took place or still take place, which lead to better combined ratio levels, however not to the necessary profitable level.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we see premium increases on the primary side in the order of 2% to 3% or so. In other words, they are just enough to achieve an unchanged economical performance, I would say. So, there is a balance between the inflation and interest on one hand and the premium increase on the other hand. So there's no real economic improvement yet.</p>
          <p>What is important and what we try to do is, we try to play the regional card and to take advantage of those examples where premium development and profitability development is positive. And on the other hand, there are some markets like the large environmental business or high capacity business where you have just a few players and where selection of risk is of very high importance. And this allows us to keep a reasonable profitability in our portfolio. But again, market wide, it's a primary rate issue, which where we have improve as an industry, including, as said, Munich Re.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then move to our next question which comes from Andy Broadfield from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, and two questions. The first one straightforward, are figures on the tax rate, and I know it's been a little lower. You've got &#x2013; I don't think you have any tax charges on profits in the US to some time yet. So just two questions or two parts to that question. One is, can you remind me how long the sort of run rate, if you like, U.S. profits will &#x2013; won't need to pay taxes or your tax liabilities or assets set against them? And also, the second part I guess is just, is there any change to the strategy or the tax location of your earnings a little bit as your business evolves because I think it's been a little low for a couple of periods now. That's the first one.</p>
          <p>The second one, a little more of a subtle question of how you're dealing with the interest rate environment given that you've flagged this as a big issue, not so much to do with the mechanics as such but just the &#x2013; I guess different companies have different approaches to interest rates. Some have risk free plus a margin that they target for the business versus a sort of static, ROE-type or RORAC number that you sort of target. If the world stays as is, I guess mechanically we should expect those companies to continue to make or to take business given the hurdle rates are lower than yours. Do you consider how to &#x2013; whether you need to reconsider your approach to that or are you very happy with your static RORAC target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andy, I can start with the first one. J&#xF6;rg, speaking here tax rate is indeed low this time tax rates on a quarterly basis and even on a half year basis are always somewhat distorted because you have always, for example, tax inspection with a positive or negative outcome. You have new court rulings and things like that and you set the reserve as good as you can, but always with or very often with an effect that you accumulate multi-year effects in just one quarter sometimes, and therefore the movements up and down are quite high. But we foresee that our tax rate would definitely &#x2013; normally be substantially below our Group tax rate of 33%. This is due to a number of facts; first, we are operating in many locations which have lower tax rates. Second, some earnings are tax free like disposal gains from shares part of the dividend income, and also you mentioned the USA where we have losses carried forward where we have not put up a loss &#x2013; a deferred tax asset yet, how long will it last before these are expired, it depends on the profitability of our U.S. businesses. I can't give you a precise number. If we perform wonderfully, then it will last for another two years or so. But this is somewhat speculative if we have a major nat cat loss, for example, then it will last for a longer period. So, no precise answer on that at the moment.</p>
          <p>And then, Nikolaus, on the interest environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me try to sort of talk around the subject. First of all, let me start on a high level. That is, the RORAC target, of course, is a target that was set at a time with a certain interest rate level at the back of our own mind. And we already said that we would have to address it once the Solvency II world is a clearer one.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we did not yet approach that target just for the fact that interest rate level is risk free, interest rate levels came down. And we've said is quite a stretch to achieve this target in today's world and said 10% would be good that we came out with 13% now in the first half of the year. We would not take as an obligation at our end now to continue on that level, we will try hard.</p>
          <p>But whether it's important? No one in our Group who is an underwriter has a hand on the interest rate level. He will get updated quarterly normally the risk-free rate that he can work with when he is doing his pricing. We tried to really make sure that interest rate levels never, by the decision of an underwriter, find their way into pricing.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we also do not target specific interest rate levels when we invest the assets, the other important message, because we want to chase yields. So what we try to do is come up with the best result possible, but manage down risk capital to the extent possible on the asset side of the balance sheet. And what does it mean in today's world? Of course, it's difficult. It's difficult because it's like an elevator. We come down with the drop of the interest rate level. What we can do is try to manage actively convexity hedge, manage duration. After all, when it comes to the return on the investments, the only thing we can do is mix, mix, mix, stay broad and use to the extent possible, maybe here or there illiquidity premiums and going to more real assets.</p>
          <p>The important message from my end is, the interest rate is nothing that we use as a target without thinking first, nor do we feel pushed by our investors in fact to refill what is sort of dropping out by a lower free interest rate level, nor do we have our underwriters having a free hand. When it comes to lower interest rate level, that's why Torsten has the problem in the casualty business, because he is in the catch-up game for three, four years. So we try to do our best, but there's nothing that we can do our returns come down, both on the investment side and on the overall net income side as long as the interest rate levels come down.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, to be clear, the target you set, the sort of total return targets, which are ultimately dependent upon risk free that you said internally to your underwriters, including the risk free return is coming down in line with the lower risk free returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Everything is coming down, if you like, and we cannot &#x2013; we don't do anything to prevent it from coming down. So, the poor underwriter has to deliver more on the technical side of his business, because he is getting less on the return side on his investments. Our targets come down. We did not readdress them yet, because we don't want to do that every second year. We did discuss, of course, maybe taking it to the risk free interest rate level and saying, well, we delivered 700, 900 basis points above that. We didn't do that yet. That's why you still have the 50% RORAC target out there. But what is key to us is whatever happens to the interest rate level, we don't try to make up, we just follow that level, and that is given for us and everything else comes then.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, to go on &#x2013; but you are adjusting your margin above that risk free a little bit for your underwriters but not fulfill &#x2013; not to compensate for the full amount that they're targeting from underwriting returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The underwriter of course has to &#x2013; let's take the example of a mid-tail longer-tail casualty book. If you have the interest rate coming down, the risk free interest rate, then you have to do something to make up for combined ratio. That means you have to increase the price, the technical price. There's no way around it. And that's why Torsten is somehow unhappy, because if he says, I have a 1% increase nominal here, and at the same time I would probably need something close to 1 percentage point to make up for a lower interest level. Economically he didn't win anything, even though it looks as if he did. And that is the problem with casualty right now. We feel that from an economic standpoint, people in the markets, primary and reinsurance didn't do enough yet to make-up lower interest rate level.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, two questions please. First one, the restructuring you're doing in ERGO, the &#x20AC;160 million that you flagged of cost savings, presumably most of that figure will actually go to the benefits of the policyholders, so could you give us a policyholder, shareholder split? And then, when we're thinking about whatever charge may come towards the end of this year for restructuring, should we assume there's a similar split between policyholders and shareholders, so there might be a restructuring charge, but the impact on the shareholder is quite small?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, when you're looking Munich Health, even relative to your reduced expectations, we're still way below the run rate of the &#x20AC;50 million that you hope to get by the end of the year. So, should we infer from that that you're pretty confident that there's going to be a recovery in the second half of the year or should we be worried there may be further restructuring measures that could actually mean you quite visibly miss that &#x20AC;50 million at some point? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, William. On the first, hasn't been calculated yet how much of the restructuring expenses will go to the policyholders and the shareholders. I would guess between one-third and one-half for the shareholders. And you're right in assuming that the same for the restructuring as with the savings later on, so it's consistent with each other.</p>
          <p>With regard Munich Health, our prognosis for this year is still quite close to the original number, a little bit on the lower side, but not far enough to change our guidance officially. And it's highly impacted from currency effect there, because it's so close to the zero line. And the currency effect, like the taxes, like the investment income, is allocated to the segments according to artificial keys. That means that we always have somewhat of a distortion and that makes it a little bit more difficult than elsewhere to predict the result here.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, two questions. First of all, just focusing on the non-life reinsurance investment income; the recurring or the regular income there is very stable year-on-year, despite I would have expected some pressure on running yield there. Could you just clarify what is the reinvestment yield to the non-life reinsurance business currently? I'm guessing it's less than the group reinvestment yield.</p>
          <p>Related to that, you've increased the duration of the non-life reinsurance or the reinsurance business, I guess, to offset the convexity on the primary life side. How much further can you increase that duration? Presumably, it would start to get a bit comfortable if you started increasing the duration gap, i.e., lengthening the duration overweight on the reinsurance, so just clarify how much more room you've got on that?</p>
          <p>Second question a quick on renewals year-to-date, the overall volume growth is modest around 2%, what is the mix effect within the renewals year-to-date, I guess what I'm after is any effect on the expected attritional loss ratio from mix. I think, overall, your weighting of proportional would have gone up over the year-to-date and potentially you're weighting a bit on casualty? Could you just clarify mix effects on year-to-date renewal that would be great? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, Andrew, with the second and the middle one; that is the question on duration and reinsurance, on the assets and reinsurance. In fact, we feel we just did what it takes. We would not go any longer as it looks as of longer as it looks as of today with the duration on the reinsurance side. So we added something like a little less than 1 to the duration of reinsurance just for the sake of better balancing our picture in the group. But this is about it. We don't think more is needed, and actually if you look back, as I've said, last quarter we were right at zero at the group level. This quarter, we had a little bit of a problem chasing the downward drip of the yields, but we should not over do it. That's why we feel it's just about right. Who is next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's me, J&#xF6;rg. And on the reinvestment rate in reinsurance you asked about non-life, what is difficult to us, as you know, the same with Munich Health by the way, that the business in Munich Health reinsurance &#x2013; life reinsurance and non-life reinsurance is mostly written out of the same entities. That means we only have one part of investment and one part of investment returns, and it's artificially allocated then.</p>
          <p>That means that I cannot distinguish here. In tendency, I would say, our average reinvestment rate for the whole reinsurance which is somewhat like 2.7%, should be if we allocated it by segment, then life would get substantially higher duration and therefore somewhat of a higher return than non-life, than we would be lower in non-life. But that would be completely artificial, somewhat economic, but it hasn't been done yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that just because the regular income has held up in non-life but fallen in life, both primary and reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, no. We just have one reinvestment on the whole portfolio. And we if had separated the assets, then the life book would have had a much longer duration than the non-life book. But this is all I can say here. In reality, it's the reinvestment rate close to 2.7%. And Torsten now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, business mix effect from all the three renewals in 2012, hardly any, because various effects almost offsetting each other completely, so business mix remains almost unchanged.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I should also mention something else, because what I said before &#x2013; my colleague just pointed my attention to the reason why you asked. Because we have the different developments here in life and non-life reinsurance that is just by chance because in the U.S., we have a subsidiary which is &#x2013; we have separated subsidiary for life and non-life business. And there we had some special effects in 2011, which now show up in the investment results that we have an increase in investment results in non-life and a decline in life. Yeah, perhaps that answers a little bit better your question than I did before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Torsten earlier commented on the China quota share business. And I just wonder if you &#x2013; Torsten, if you could elaborate on that. What's been lost already, and I suppose the potential with what's still on the books? I thought you mentioned the impact was &#x20AC;300 million. I'm not sure if I got that right. I don't know if that's an annualized number or H1. I also wanted to ask, when did that impact start? Because I thought the business had been written in a January renewal earlier and so the business would have started to go away earlier than Q2?</p>
          <p>And then, I guess, the other one, what kind of premium income do you have left on the books from China quota share deals that are still on the book so that we &#x2013; obviously we'll have to make an assessment about whether those are at risk as well. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Just going back on this agriculture treaty, the &#x20AC;77 million we saw, now obviously you just &#x2013; we're still going through the drought and if you've already booked the loss. And you did say that this treaty was not the one which caused the loss, but generally in agriculture. And you did mention the prices are not in your control really, but when I look at this chart on page 31, there is 62% volume change but only 1% price change. And I just wanted to get a sense at how did you manage to get higher profitability along with higher volumes in this very large move? And yes, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And second question is, just going back on the duration, I do remember from the 1Q call, the comment around the bond future being used to manage the asset side, and this time obviously the gap has widened. And I just wanted to pick up on Nikolaus' comment. He said that there is no more need to really manage the duration of the gap. Is this something that &#x2013; is it just because you don't want to keep running towards this convexity or what are your thoughts on just this widened gap in the 1Q? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second one, this is Nikolaus. There should not be over-read now, what I said. The question that I answered beforehand was, whether we would further extend the duration on the reinsurance side to make up for &#x2013; to shorten duration on the primary side. And here the answer was, we probably did what we could do and should do. That does not mean, however, that we will not continue to actively manage duration overall. So if whatever interest rates continue to fall, we will do everything possible, of course, to match the structure of the liabilities with the assets we have by using derivatives, like receiver swaptions, by lengthening the duration or whatever it takes.</p>
          <p>To the extent possible, of course that's what we consider still economic costs. We never hedge entirely the entire book of the life primary, for example, in Germany, because we could not afford it. But to the extent we can, we are still in the market replacing expiring receiver swaptions by new one, so we continue to do that. And we have a plan in place, depending on the development of the interest rate level, also to step it up. But there is a limit as regards costs what we can do, but we will certainly not stop actively managing duration and closing the gap for sure.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vinit, your first question, I first have to apologize, we were all busy of looking up the China numbers, which Brian Shea asked, and therefore we missed a little bit of your question. It was about how much of the agriculture &#x2013; how much of the agricultural business is in the number for property on slide 31? Did I pick that up correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not really. The question was that, you just had U.S. drought loss and now you've gone ahead and suddenly increased a very large treaty. And Torsten, very kindly explained how the pricing is not in the insurance domain really, but the retentions are. And I'm just wanting to understand is, how you get comfort from 14.5% increase or a very large increase in a treaty in that line which you have just suffered a loss where you cannot control the price really? That was the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, now sorry that we were a little slower here by being so busy on the China. There is &#x2013; this is relatively simple. This treaty is underwritten on an underwriting year basis, and it's not dependent on the loss as such. And only when the seeds are out and will the treaty come into force, so this treaty is not at all effected by the event throughout nor was it written on sort of purposely to immediately catch on the consequences of the job, but of course it comes in handy that prices will change now, so call it good timing whatever, but there is no connection between the loss and the writing, nor does that treaty take any losses of that drought.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Brian, Torsten here. I'll come back to your China quota share question. And actually the treaty, which was cancelled that was a treaty which was renewed &#x20AC;300 million was renewed quarter-by-quarter. And this is one the treaties which was not renewed now, so here we see &#x20AC;300 million loss in premium volume, and there is another treaty which is not included in the six months figures, similar volume, which is also not renewed, most likely not renewed, which is only then visible in the following quarters. So is so there is approximately a premium volume left from these sort of extraordinary quota shares in the order of a bit more than &#x20AC;600 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, all together. I have question about your investments and particular about the story of not putting all egg in one box. If I look on page 11, while the differentiation between fixed income is perfect, I have the impression that only 5% are not invested in fixed income and similar, and so the share is even reducing. So this means that your newer investments are actually going towards this mono risk, and so I'm a little bit worried about this one.</p>
          <p>And also about your &#x2013; the dilution that you had on your direct income from 3.6%, so there was a dilution of 60 basis points. Could you show me that going forward we will have a considerable lower reduction by giving me the size of their investment base that you allocated 2.8%?</p>
          <p>Yes. And another question please, if I may. On page 11, where do you see the renewals and infrastructure investment? Where are they flowing in, because I have an impression that the categories in which it should flow in are reducing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question is the easiest. It would show up as miscellaneous and it's still only &#x20AC;500 million it's a lot, but relative to &#x20AC;270 billion, it's not so big yet. Then, yes we understand your concerns and I wouldn't call it many eggs in one basket, because even our fixed income portfolio is composed of many, many baskets, especially I may point your attention to the covered bonds where we have quite clear coverage by real assets, mostly at lease. And also we have to have a look on the volatility &#x2013; on the annual volatility and aggressively investing in shares now, we wouldn't stare doing that at the moment.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and you first question about reduction of the running yield, we do not expect the same kind of speed as we saw in 2012 yet. So, for 2013, with the normal reshuffling activity of the portfolio, perhaps another 20 to 25 basis points perhaps. Does it answer your question, Fabrizio?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I've got two questions. The first one relates to slide number six on your reinsurance P&amp;C renewals. So, prices up 2.4%, exposure plus 2.3%. I mean, how should I read these two numbers if I want to have a bit of understanding of how your technical margin of increased so far this year and the potential impact on your attritional level of ratio going forward? I mean maybe second half of this year and of course also net year.</p>
          <p>And the second question will be, could we have an idea of the size of your potential exposure to D&amp;O and E&amp;O of financials and potentially banks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understood the question correctly, you say when is it and how is it reflected, the 2.4%, in the end year result and where that's reflected. Let's put it this way, the figures we've shown here on an underwriting year basis, so they will hardly &#x2013; to the full extent be visible in 2012 only by about, let's say, 50% or so, you can see that in 2012.</p>
          <p>Secondly, where is it visible? This margin improvement, they are mainly generated, if I may recall, on the cat side, the attrition business so to speak, and its combined ratio or loss ratio is unaffected, we get more money for the take and cat exposures here, more or less. If you ask me how much is it at the end of the day, by how much will it improve the overall combined ratio, maybe at the end of the day by two-third of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and to your second question as regards exposure to financial institutions, what we did on the reinsurance side over the last year is that we &#x2013; year-after-year starting in 2008, lowered our exposure. You wouldn't see it easily if you look at the turnover, the premium, because the price per unit went up but the exposure as such overall came down. So we pull also partially out, but of course we still are exposed to some extent, but we of course was within financial institutions, fine-tuned our strategy so you would have very little direct exposure, for example, to investment banks. ERGO is not a player here that is of any significance. So it's a reinsurance topic.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Three questions, please. First on non-life reinsurance, I understand that in the first and in the second quarter, you put an extra margin to your basic loss ratio. Did you started that in the first quarter this year or have you done so previously? So is it a change in the reserving policy and what caused you to decide to do this more conservative reserving? Is it the good result or is it higher expectations for claims and inflation and so on?</p>
          <p>And the second question on ERGO Life. Can you give us an update on the regulatory additional reserving, the Zinszusatzreserve, how much did you reserve for already in the first half of this year and how much do you expect in total for 2012, assuming the current capital environment persists?</p>
          <p>And the third question is, how happy are you with the current capitalization of ERGO Life, I understand that Munich Re is perfectly is capitalized, but how comfortable are you with ERGO Life, the capitalization? Can you exclude an internal capital shift towards ERGO Life at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Torsten here. I'll start with the first question, reserving policy for the basic losses. The reserving policy is not new, so we have not changed that. And it's not that we put, let's say, an artificial extra buffer into our basic loss ratio or into the reserves. Now we what we do is, we stay within the feasible and possible outcomes of the expected value of the loss ratio for which we have to put the reserve aside. We take for the younger years within the feasible range a more conservative assumption. And that is not new. That is completely unchanged. Why when you compare this year with the year before do you see different numbers here, that has do with the specific effect in 2011 where we saw already in the first six months reserve releases from one of our subsidiaries, Hartford Steam Boiler. These are not &#x2013; there are no positive reserve effects included this year and that makes a difference here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, for instance, two years ago you would have done exactly the same, so reserve the younger underwriting year with higher, say, comfort level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely we did the same. We did all the three years and four years the same. The bottom line effect of this reserving policy pays however off or more off in the recent years because when you remember four, five, six years ago, we had to deal not with the positive reserve issues, where we discuss releases, we had to deal with negative reserve issues from the American Re side at that time. And therefore, you could not see any positive impact from this conservative or prudent reserve policy, which we put in place at that time. Now, I would say, we are more likely harvest the fruits from that reserving policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you in the future give us also the run off profits that you achieve on a quarterly basis or calendar year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On an annual basis, yes, but not on a quarterly basis, because usually we make the big reserve review and all the related figures to that in Q3, Q4, and that is available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me come to the other two questions as regarding German life business and this special interest reserve, Zinszusatzreserve in German, this additional interest reserve that was implemented into the supervisory not too long ago. The estimate as for the year end 2012 is somewhere around &#x20AC;400 million. And you should know that this is a running estimate, so that includes earlier years as well. Whatever you did in earlier years is accounted against that amount. And since we did a good &#x20AC;100 million already in 2011 and have done close to another &#x20AC;200 million already in the first half of 2012, you see the remainder is a somewhere low triple-digit million number right now that might have to be put into that reserve at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And this is an &#x2013; yeah. This is very important, thank you, J&#xF6;rg. He just said this is of course only local GAAP. This is a local GAAP supervisory rule. And as regards capitalization and here local GAAP is crucial too, the capitalization that is being expected from us as of today from our supervisory body of course is based on local GAAP. And therefore, we are not tightly capitalized in ERGO Life in this world.</p>
          <p>If you take our economic world, of course, this is a completely different picture. But since we try to keep daughters slim and mother rather fat, we will not try to move too quickly here. I cannot exclude, of course for obvious reasons, that we will never have to do anything which as regards our life insurers, but for the time being, we don't see a reason to add capital into those entities.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We now move to our next question from Jason Kalamboussis from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there. I've got two questions. One is on coming back on this issue on the attritional ratio. If I look at it, excluding the reserve releases, or if I look at it in any case for the first and second quarter where you don't have reserve released over the last three or four years. You can see something that's relatively &#x2013; first of all, we can see the high reserving that you're doing. But on the other hand, we can see that it's relatively stable too. If I look 2010, it's 59%, 56%, pretty much the same thing in 2011. And now we've got 57.5% both quarters.</p>
          <p>The question is, I don't see a lot of progression or effect, if you want, from price increases that we had last year. So I was trying to understand how much of it are we going to see, is it because it is delayed and we're going to see it strongly in the second half and where do you expect that to come out? If I look at second half, it's in general life. Here, for example, it was an attrition ratio of around 54.5%. Should we see that coming down below 54%?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a very quick one. What is the combined ratio at ERGO International in the second quarter, excluding Korea? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have excluding Korea here, but it's more or less the same because it's a tiny company. I'll look it up the number, it's...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Thank you. Now we move to our final question for today, which comes from Frank Kopfinger from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg Schneider speaking on the basic loss ratio. I can promise you, there hasn't been deterioration. There are tiny differences from quarter-to-quarter in the way how we handle, for example, major losses and that it's relevant here. If you have major losses for which you haven't set up an individual reserve, but what we call IBNyR, incurred but not yet reported and then the major loss comes up. There is the question whether you book it left or right, the difference, and this is the whole explanation for this difference.</p>
          <p>And going forward, we will book it like we did it this quarter. Therefore, you shouldn't be concerned at all about this tiny difference of 2 percentage points. Our business hasn't deteriorated what Torsten said before about the potential for reserve release is definitely right. We have more or less the same level of difference between actual and expected losses, actual reported and expected losses. So, the whole principle is intact. And therefore, unfortunately the terms are not improving as we would need it to compensate for the low interest rate, but except for that fact, business is performing really strongly and not worse than before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then let me try to answer the question on the Korean combined ratio. Let me start with the first half year. Here, the combined ratio for ERGO International was, as you could see on the slight 98.9%, the Korean business was 101.5%, went into second quarter. The South Korean business was 109.4% and the overall was 97.6%, if I'm not mistaken. If these numbers were wrong, we will correct them with you. But I'm sure that the half year numbers were right. With the second quarter, there's some uncertainty, but the half year should be right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you for that. Maybe if I just comeback on the answer I got before on the attrition ratio. I can understand that the interest rate is something that you know as you pointed out is difficult, yes, to see the price thing if you want. But surely we should be expecting, at certain point, to see the price increases coming through the attritional ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do what we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or am I wrong in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do what we can. I would also take this opportunity to also explain another &#x2013; to mention another aspect which explains part of the difference. There are always currency differences between premiums and claims. And they also can make up for something like 1 percentage point or so. So it's stable and you might call it disappointing, we are in a difficult economic environment and it is extremely difficult for the primary insurer to push up prices when their clients are struggling hard. So this, I think, describes the pure reality in a difficult economic world.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. It's Frank Kopfinger from Cheuvreux. I have two questions. One question is on your fixed government bond exposure and your Spanish cedulas. If you consistently reduce from quarter-to-quarter, are you now confident with the level and financial level that you currently have or should we expect further reduction in this exposure going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on &#x2013; in general on your view proportional business, because some of the bigger primary players in Europe and the U.S., they should some quite decent trade increases so far. And the question is, should we expect that this impact at some point of time also your proportional business going forward and that we should see better pricing there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Frank. Let me start, Nikolaus, with the first one. We did de-risk over the last years indeed and steps also and a bigger step to take on this Spanish cedulas recently. We feel with the exposure that we have now to peripheral European countries, including covered bonds is about right. And that also has to do with the fact, what I said, we don't want to put all eggs in one basket. We feel that with ERGO, it may be prudent for the Group to still have some exposure to the peripheral countries, because let's assume there is a gradual fiscal union coming, then we should not have all the eggs in the German basket only. That's why we feel that certain spread is good, but we did cut back tremendously and the reinsurance sector is pretty clean of all peripheral sovereign exposure. And that is about it. The other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your question regarding proportional business, and do we see improving primary rates into our performance. And certainly &#x2013; and we know what you mean when you say, there were some reports of larger companies. We have seen or got similar reports, particularly from the United States. We are however not certain or not completely sure whether the picture of the first indications we have seen are sustainable to be very honest. And we have not seen that as a market wide or market uniform rating picture, for that reason we have not shown any of these indicated primary rate increase in our own rate increase or rate reports.</p>
          <p>But if they should continue and become sustainable, you will see that in our proportional business too. Actually in two cases we have positioned ourselves and made a small bet in that respect and wrote some additional proportional business in the United States, not big things but we do think that in some cases, we can position ourselves. So, question is sustainability, yes or no here. Thank you.</p>
