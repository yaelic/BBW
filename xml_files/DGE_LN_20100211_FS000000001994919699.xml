        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your time today. We're going to stay with the format that we've used previously in these results webcasts. Firstly, Nick and I will take you through the results we released this morning in some more detail, and then we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>At that point, we'll be joined by our four regional Presidents, Stuart Fletcher, Ivan Menezes, Andrew Morgan and Gilbert Ghostine. We also have Andy Fennell, our Chief Marketing Officer with us too.</p>
          <p>As we expected this was a challenging six months. Economic and consumer trends in many markets remained weak, and in addition as you know we had a tough comparison against Q1. However, while our results today reflect these headwinds they also reflect our strengths. Nick will take you through our performance in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>But here are the headlines. Organic net sales were down 6% in Q1 yet up 2% in Q2 so we finished the half slightly stronger than we anticipated albeit still down 2% overall.</p>
          <p>Consumers are looking for value, but they're also looking respected leading brands to deliver this value for them. We have responded with promotions designed to increase the visibility of our brands. We intend to maintain the share gains this has delivered on our priority brands as the markets recovery.</p>
          <p>Consumers haven't yet moved back to the on-trade in developed markets and so we've seen our deluxe brands slow, down about 3% in net sales terms against our standard brands which were flat.</p>
          <p>In a difficult pricing environment, overall price mix was therefore flat in the half and we saw some gross margin erosion from the stronger performance of the standard brands over premium and super premium brands. So operating profit was down 3%.</p>
          <p>Favorable currency movements mean that reported net sales are up 3%. Operating profit in reported terms is broadly flat and EPS pre-exceptionals is up 5%. Lower interest rates mean we've reduced our interest costs by &#xA3;100 million. And we will maintain this benefit for the full year. Our free cash flow performance has been outstanding at almost &#xA3;1 billion. We have again increased the interim dividend by 5%.</p>
          <p>Now those are the financial headlines. What they don't show and what I will come to on later is the way we managed the business. We've implemented our restructuring program. As you will see from our recent announcements we have made some tough decisions and our cost base has now being reduced as we delivered more efficient ways of working.</p>
          <p>In adding to these structural changes, we have sourced out and delivered efficiencies in marketing spend and procurement. We have very strong marketing campaigns which we have consistently invested behind. They have driven the growth of brand such as Smirnoff, Johnny Walker, Captain Morgan and Guinness over a number of years. Our strong marketing platform gives us agility. We can vary the level of our executions to respond quickly to individual market dynamics.</p>
          <p>In the half we have up weighted activity on proven growth drivers. We have increased our share of voice where we believe it will be effective while reducing spend in Europe in response to the markets trend there. We've used innovation to build our brands and reach the consumer in new ways.</p>
          <p>Consumers have made changes in purchasing and consumption in response to the economic slowdown. Being alert to this we have found ways to bring our brands to them in new formats, new flavors and price points.</p>
          <p>In these challenging times, we need to put our brands where the consumers are and help our customers deliver against these changing opportunities. In the half, we've seen the benefits of the investments that we've made to build a leading sales function.</p>
          <p>The visibility of our brands has never been better and this has contributed to the share gains that we've made on priority brands in key markets.</p>
          <p>I am going to return to these themes later in the presentation. But first I will hand over to Nick to take you through the results in more detail. Nick?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. The last half has been characterized by mixed performance across the regions. Adverse trends, most notably the continued decline of the on-trade channel and an increasingly competitive pricing environment in the off-trade, have been a feature of many markets and there have been some pockets of further destocking.</p>
          <p>Against these mostly developed market trends, we have delivered good growth in some of our developing and emerging markets. In addition, we have experienced some significant one-off costs in the half and delivered on our cost saving program.</p>
          <p>So looking first at net sales, exchange rate movements again benefited reported net sales adding &#xA3;207 million. The U.S. dollar moved from 166 to 164 and the euro moved from 121 to 112. Currency fluctuations in Venezuela accounted for 35 million of the FX benefit while many Asia Pacific currencies strengthened in the year with Australia having the biggest impact.</p>
          <p>Organic net sales declined by 2% reflecting the challenging consumer environment with the continued move from the on-trade to the off-trade and with consumers across the world being more currently value conscious and shopping around for the best deal, in particular in more promotion driven, larger grocery and supermarket outlets.</p>
          <p>This led to a difficult pricing scenario and an increase in discounting with our customers. There was a limited impact from acquisitions and disposals in the period, mostly from the acquired distribution rights of Grand Marnier in Europe.</p>
          <p>So turning now to organic net sales growth on a regional basis. In North America the total <mark type="inaudible" /> alcohol market remained in growth. In U.S. spirits we estimate that the overall market grew 1%, mainly in the off-trade and the larger grocery channel. Diageo grew volume share and maintained value share on our priority brands, although overall value share declined by 0.2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Depletions in the period were flat and we outperformed most of the other full line spirit companies. There was a 6% decline in shipments reflecting the build up of inventory last year before the recession had really impacted the industry and in addition, we reduced stock levels in U.S. spirits partly because depletions were stronger than we expected in the second half of December.</p>
          <p>Beer and wine both grew volume, but within wine the growth continued to be at the lower priced variance which drove some negative pricing mix. Europe remained difficult. Great Britain grew net sales and gained share in spirits, beer and wine, mainly due to a strong Christmas in the grocery channel. The decline of beer in Ireland and the continued weakness of the Spanish on-trade continued to shape our performance.</p>
          <p>Developing Europe also remained challenging with consumers trading down to lower price brands and customers reducing inventories. International was again the best performing region. In Latin America and the Caribbean, sales of scotch performed strongly in Mexico and Brazil. In Venezuela, price increases to offset cost increases accounted for most of the price mix improvement we have seen in international.</p>
          <p>Our beer brands in Africa continued to be very resilient in particular Guinness in East Africa, Harp in Nigeria and Tusker in Kenya. It was also a return to growth in Global Travel Middle East as passenger numbers started to tick upwards and we increased promotional activities particularly on scotch.</p>
          <p>Excluding India, Asia Pacific recorded net sales growth driven by the return to growth in Australia the largest market in the region and a rebound in performance in Southeast Asia. In India our performance was impacted by the inappropriately high shipments that were recorded in the prior period, which we adjusted in the second half of last year. There was no overall impact from price and mix in the half. Positive price mix in the standard and super premium segments was offset by negative mix in the value segment. The latter was the result of higher sales of lower price scotch and the shift towards vodka.</p>
          <p>Within sprits price mix was negative by [audio skip] percentage point. This was offset by a strong performance in beer mainly from Guinness. The standard price segment continues to demonstrate resilience until we see a reversal of current consumer trends and in particular a return to more on-trade consumption price mix will remain under pressure.</p>
          <p>Trading within the half showed an improving trend, in quarter two performance improved against the first quarter in all four regions. And we saw NSV growth for the first time since quarter two of fiscal '09 as comparisons eased. And as we go into H2 we'll again be lapping some easier numbers.</p>
          <p>So turning now to operating profit, as you saw from the announcement this morning, our prior year numbers have been restated mainly for changes in accounting standards and we've given the details of this in the release.</p>
          <p>Organic operating profit declined by 3%, however on a reported basis FX movements of &#xA3;43 million benefited operating profit. The translation benefit of 35 million and a transaction benefit of &#xA3;53 million but they were offset by an adverse movement of &#xA3;45 million under IAS 21.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the organic profit growth through a regional lens. In North America operating profit fell by 2%, as a result of the 6% decline in net sales offset by a slight improvement in gross margin, lower marketing spend and overhead reductions.</p>
          <p>Organic operating profit was down 3% in Europe. Declines in gross margin were offset by lower marketing spend and overhead savings. We again saw the strong contribution from international where organic operating profit grew 16%, operating profit in Africa was maintained despite significant increases in local costs as a result of inflation there. In Latin America, operating profit growth was driven by net sales growth and some gross margin improvement.</p>
          <p>And Asia Pacific also recorded good profit growth as gross profit margins increased and overheads were reduced. There was a significant increase in corporate costs, &#xA3;40 million of this increase relates to differences between forecast and achieved FX rates in the period, that are not passed on to the regions.</p>
          <p>There are number of other increased cost within corporate which are likely to be non-recurring. Our H1 performance relative to our profit and cash targets has led to higher bonus accrual this half. Investment in systems increased, particularly around customer and supply chain planning. The revision of IFRS 3 means that we now have to take costs associated with M&amp;A studies to the income statement when incurred. And in addition, we have incurred substantial legal and accounting costs associated with the ongoing regulatory matters related to Korea and India.</p>
          <p>These period on period increases account for the majority of the &#xA3;49 million incremental corporate costs.</p>
          <p>The decline in operating margin during the period has been due mainly to the gross margin impact which was driven by increased promotional activity and a lower proportion of sales from the premium and super premium segments.</p>
          <p>Cost of good increased on a like-for-like basis, by about 2%, slightly lower than we'd anticipated at the beginning of the year. The resulting gross profit decline was offset by a 5% reduction in marketing spend mainly in Europe. And I'll go into this in a little more detail on the following slide.</p>
          <p>We are on track to deliver the full benefit of our global restructuring program in fiscal '10 and overheads decreased by 7%. The increase in other costs arose mainly in corporate as I have just described.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, I'd expect to see the gross margin improve in H2 as the high promotional activity that we've seen around Christmas is likely to abate. And looking at marketing in more detail, marketing spend was reduced by &#xA3;40 million and as a percentage of net sales was down 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>We continue to see media deflation in many markets which accounted for about 25% of the reduction. In North America marketing spend as a percentage of net sales was maintained and activities were tightly focused on proven growth drivers on priority brands. Share of voice also increased in the period. The main driver of the year-on-year reduction was Europe reflecting the challenging industry backdrop and therefore a focus on fewer growth drivers and brands.</p>
          <p>The "250th Celebration" campaign on Guinness across the region and the launch of new campaigns on Smirnoff in Great Britain and Johnnie Walker in Greece are good examples of where we fully funded campaigns to drive growth. Conversely spend has been significantly reduced on J&amp;B in Spain, beer in Ireland and on spirits in Eastern Europe reflecting the reduced growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Growth in marketing spend in international was inline with net sales reflecting efficiencies with increased activation of spirits in Latin America, especially Jonnie Walker in Mexico and Smirnoff in Brazil higher spend behind beer in Africa particularly Guinness, Tusker and Harp and increase spend on scotch in Global Travel and Middle East.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific spend was a gain targeted. Growth opportunities were fully funded including super deluxe whiskies in Korea, scotch and vodka in Southeast Asia and a significant increase behind our major spirits and ready to drink brands in Australia. Offsetting this were reductions in spend in India and in China where the later timing of both the Shanghai Grand Prix and Chinese New Year means spend is more waited into the second half of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>We expect marketing spend to grow in H2 and marketing as a percentage of net sales to build back to last year's levels.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the other lines in the income statement. There was a &#xA3;26 million reduction in associate income, mainly due to Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy. Against this there was a significant decrease in net finance charges and therefore PBET was up by &#xA3;69 million.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the net finance charge in more detail. Net finance charges have decreased by &#xA3;107 million. Net interest charges decreased by a 100 million, as a result of the significant decrease in floating interest rates and a favorable FX of &#xA3;8 million. The revaluation of interest rate swaps to period end rates under IAS39 resulted in a small charge this half against the &#xA3;31 million charge in the same period last year, giving rise to a 28 million positive year-on-year movement.</p>
          <p>Net other finance charges of &#xA3;40 million includes 25 million in respect of post employment plans. Other finance charges were &#xA3;4 million including 7 million for the unwinding of discounts on liabilities. And this reflects a &#xA3;24 million decrease over the prior period driven by changes in the fair value of investments.</p>
          <p>Translation differences on inter-company funding were &#xA3;11 million. For fiscal 2010 I would expect our interest rate excluding the impact of IAS21 and IAS39 to be 5.1% compared to 6.2% in the last full year. The &#xA3;82 million increase in exceptional charges to 95 million relates to the restructuring programs that were announced last year and I'll come on to these in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>The underlying tax rate remained at 22% which was our full year rate for last year; and we expect to maintain this going forward. By comparison last year the reported tax charge was 15% following the agreement of a number of settlements with tax authorities which did give rise to one off tax credits in the period totaling &#xA3;101 million.</p>
          <p>So let me now take you through the exceptional charge in [audio skip] detail. Exceptional charges in the half amounted to &#xA3;95 million comprising 21 million for the global restructuring program, 69 million for our supply footprint and five million for our Irish Brewing operations.</p>
          <p>The cash paid in H1 fiscal '10 was &#xA3;76 million comprised of 72 million for the global restructuring program and four million for the Irish Brewing operations. And for the full year I'd expect the cash paid to be about &#xA3;240 million.</p>
          <p>For the full fiscal year, I expect the total restructuring charges for this program to be about &#xA3;180 million and to deliver the cost savings of a 120 million that we previously identified. And when fully implemented our restructuring programs will reduce our cost base by around &#xA3;185 million a year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow remains one of our key strengths. We made the decision to have very tight management of cash in 2009. We introduced a number of new procedures and delivered outstanding results. Despite a 94 million reduction in reported operating profit, mainly the result of the increase in restructuring charges, we generated over &#xA3;0.5 billion more cash this half.</p>
          <p>Our net interest paid increased by &#xA3;18 million, despite a lower P&amp;L charge reflecting the phasing of coupon payments. Tax paid was &#xA3;61 million higher, despite an unchanged underlying tax rate due to the payment of audit settlements agreed in the prior year.</p>
          <p>The working capital benefit of 769 million was the biggest contributor to the increased free cash flow. The increase in inventories was lower than last year reflecting better management of finished goods stock and the lower cost of maturing inventories.</p>
          <p>The increase in debtors was lower period-on-period reflecting the introduction of earlier collection initiatives, and creditors and provisions were up substantially mainly reflecting our move to longer payment terms.</p>
          <p>Net CapEx was &#xA3;31 million lower in the half. Other items reflects the adjustment to fair value for hedging arrangements and payments made in respect of post employment obligations primarily in the United States. I expect to have a strong full-year performance on cash, however, some of this performance is not repeatable and fiscal '11 it's likely to return to a more normal run rate.</p>
          <p>Moving on to net borrowings the biggest driver of the decrease in net borrowings was the increased free cash flow that we've just been through. Dividend payments were 551 million. We discontinued our share buyback program and I'd not anticipate restarting it in this calendar year.</p>
          <p>Exchange rate movements accounted for &#xA3;201 million of the change due to the stronger dollar and euro at this balance sheet data versus June '09 rates. Reported basic EPS was &#xA3;0.409 per share compared to &#xA3;0.455 last year a deterioration of 10%. Adjusted for exceptional items, exceptional tax and discontinued operations, EPS increased by 5% from 0.419 to &#xA3;0.442 per share. The makeup of this 5% increase is shown on the bottom of this slide.</p>
          <p>Exchange benefited EPS by &#xA3;0.037 per share in the half. Disposals acquisitions and IAS 21 and 39 reduced EPS by &#xA3;0.006 per share. And the underlying fall of &#xA3;0.008 per share represents a decline of 2%.</p>
          <p>Having already described the impact of the individual exchange movements on our reported results I thought it would be helpful to pull them together.</p>
          <p>We slightly reduced our guidance for the full year impact of foreign exchange movements on operating profit from a benefit of &#xA3;80 million to &#xA3;75 million. This reflects slightly positive movements on the dollar, euro and naira exchange rates which have benefited the translation offset by the anticipated year-on-year loss of &#xA3;25 million on the Venezuelan bolivar. IAS 21 and 39 movements which we do not forecast at the beginning of the year, are expected to have little impact in aggregate for the full year, although they do have a material impact on the individual lines of operating profit and finance charges. Including the adverse impact of IAS 21 the impact of FX on operating profit for fiscal '10 will be a positive movement of about &#xA3;30 million. Including the positive impact of IAS 21 and IAS 39 the impact of FX on finance charges for fiscal '10 is expected to be a positive movement of approximately &#xA3;40 million.</p>
          <p>Economic profit decreased by &#xA3;59 million to the 653 million and our ROIC decreased by 110 basis points to 17.6%. The deterioration is due to slightly lower operating profit before exceptionals, lower associate profit and higher average invested capital mainly due to higher maturing inventories year-on-year.</p>
          <p>So in summary then, it has been a challenging half, economic trends are little improved over H2 fiscal '09 and in addition we had a tough comparable top line growth, in Q1 last year of 6%. We have implemented our restructuring programs and identified and delivered further cost efficiencies in marketing. In addition, we have mitigated the increasing cost of goods to less than our original plan. We have invested in IS to improve customer and supply chain management to help strengthen our relationships with our customers. And we have continued to invest in proven growth drivers to build brand equity.</p>
          <p>Consequently we have built a stronger business as Paul will come on to describe. And we are maintaining our guidance for low single digit, organic operating profit growth for the full year.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll hand back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Nick. The economic recovery is still uncertain and the level of recovery in markets and consumer confidence around the world is varied. However despite this challenging environment, we continue to demonstrate our resilience. Each market is unique. However our approach remains consistent. Sustained investment behind first class marketing campaigns introduce great innovation and build superior routes to market.</p>
          <p>As I take you through the regions this morning, you will see how we have applied these common tools, but tailor them for specific market circumstances. While signs of recovery are limited in many regions, we believe that in the long run our business will take advantage of the long-term resilience of North America, manage the structurally low growth markets of Europe and build on the high growth opportunities in emerging and developing markets.</p>
          <p>We can activate our global marketing campaigns quickly where we see the opportunity.</p>
          <p>At the end of the first half, we made the decision to up weight spend behind Johnnie Walker in Asia in Global Travel and Middle East. We've used innovation to move quickly to benefit from the tactical opportunities that have been created during this difficult period. The result is been increase in brand visibility and share gains.</p>
          <p>Our outstanding cash flow is further evidence that we have taken the right decisions during the economic downturn. Our balance sheet strength ensures that we are well positioned as markets and regions recover. We are well positioned to capitalize on changing consumer needs within categories and across regions.</p>
          <p>Scotch is an aspirational category especially for consumers in developing market, who want to demonstrate their improved social status and new found success. Scotch is therefore our biggest category and our scotch brands lead our global spirits business into emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Our breadth in scotch provides us with agility to launch new brands to make changing consumer demands. In Brazil, for example, we've increased the availability of some smaller brands like Old Parr, providing a well priced deluxe scotch and Black and White at the value end. In addition, we have selectively reduced the price of other brands accepting lower per case margins in order to achieve higher operating profits and stronger share positions.</p>
          <p>Our second most important category is beer. Beer is often the consumers' first experience of branded beverage alcohol and growth of beer in Africa demonstrates how our range of premium beers led by Guinness has given us access to the fast growing African markets.</p>
          <p>As markets develop, consumers broaden their repertoire. We can see this in the increased promotion of vodka and rum in North America and Europe which will historically beer and traditional brown-spirit markets.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through the regions to demonstrate this further. Signs of recovery in the U.S. are still weak, especially when we look at unemployment trends. Thanksgiving was disappointing with slow consumer demand and we reduced December shipments as a result. The holiday period however, was stronger and depletions were up 4%. A more competitive landscape has meant that there has been a short-term loss of price mix benefit given the weaker performance of the super and ultra premium segments.</p>
          <p>The weakness of the on-trade has reduced the number of premium occasions in which consumers trade up. But these opportunities will come back. Our promotions have supported visibility and display and our brands continue to command a price premium.</p>
          <p>The premium spirit segment where Diageo is best represented proved more resilient. Our priority brands continued to gains share and maintain their leadership positions providing the right platform for price mix acceleration when the market can support it.</p>
          <p>Value brands are peripheral to our strategy in North America and we are comfortable with the small loss in share we've seen here.</p>
          <p>We've improved the efficiency of marketing spend by reducing spend on those activities such as creative and production costs, which the consumer does not see. In addition, media deflation also contributed to the 5% reduction in marketing spend in North America. Investment was focused on priority brand activity that drove the best financial return and grew brand equity.</p>
          <p>As consumption has switched to the off-trade from the on-trade so has our focus for innovation. We've continued to support recent launches of our new ready-to-serve products such as Jeremiah Weed Sweet Tea and Captain Morgan Long Island Iced Tea. These innovations provide great sales opportunities for our customers and great brand experiences for our consumers.</p>
          <p>These are the products, which provide the great value, taste and ease of serve the consumers are currently seeking. Going forward, our strategy for North America remains the same to grow the market, invest behind proven growth drivers, further enhance our route to market and drive performance of our priority brands.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Ireland and Spain were weak. In Poland, our business grew and we gained share but we faced challenges in much of the rest of Eastern Europe where distributors reduced inventories as consumer confidence remain low. In those markets where the economic environment was relatively stable the industry was stronger. In a difficult economic environment, resource allocation is key.</p>
          <p>So let me take you through three examples of the choices that we've made in Europe.</p>
          <p>As expected, Iberia continues to be a slow market. Here we have significantly reduced our marketing spend on J&amp;B due to the continued decline in the on-trade, but taking our learning from the U.S. markets we've launched Cacique Mojito a ready to serve product to capitalize on the growing home consumption trend.</p>
          <p>Our GB business performed well with a very strong Christmas. We worked closely with our customers to give our brands the right share of retailer promotions and display to offer consumers a combination of value for money and product availability.</p>
          <p>Whilst there were some price mix dilution, off-trade prices of our brands were up year-on-year. Diageo increased its off-trade share of total beverage alcohol by 0.4 percentage points and its share of spirits by 1.4 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Marketing spend focused on the launch of the new Bring It To Life campaign and the 250th celebration for Guinness and Smirnoff "Be There", driving share gains for both brands. When recovery comes, these share gains will give us the best possible platform for growth.</p>
          <p>The economic downturn in Russia led consumers to trade down. In response to this we took three key steps. Firstly, we refocused our investment from deluxe scotch to standard scotch with investment on visibility, display and promotion of White Horse. Secondly, we introduced smaller formats and thirdly we launched Bell's at a price point below White Horse to limit the number of consumers leaving the category. The results have been very strong. Diageo's total share of scotch grew and White Horse is now the number one scotch in Russia.</p>
          <p>Europe is the only region where we decided to reduce our marketing spend as a percent of net sales. The reduction in spend reflects the adverse trading conditions in Iberia and Ireland where we [audio skip] behind fewer brands and switched investment from above the line activity to focus on sales drivers at the point of the purchase in Eastern Europe. Fundamentally we're selling the right brands at the right price in the current environment.</p>
          <p>We're protecting our positions to enable us to premiumize consumer as the economy recovers. In international the investments we've made over a number of years have build a fantastic platform. Across the region our leading brands, great marketing and great sales execution delivered another period of net sales growth.</p>
          <p>In Africa our performance was varied as the most developed economy in the continent, South Africa was impacted by the downturn. Scotch consumers traded down to secondary brands including Black and White and the moderate decline in our net sales reflected this. In spite of this our business here gained 0.9 percentage points of volume share in the category.</p>
          <p>The 250th celebration for Guinness reinforced the brands heritage credentials and its resonance with male consumers, as a result Guinness net sales in all of its key markets with the exception of Cameroon. In anticipation of future growth we have continued to increase our market presence in Africa with a new agreement to produce in Guinness in Angola.</p>
          <p>Marketing investment in Latin America was focused behind scotch and rum and we made substantial efficiency gains. In Brazil for example spend on Johnnie Walker reduced productivity increased, as spend was targeted. For example in the North East, we used the Johnnie Walker "Strides" campaign on TV, elsewhere in Brazil, we use that campaign on cable and in Sao Paulo we launched "Giants" campaign on radio, to a company it's digital launch.</p>
          <p>The continued slowdown of international travel has impacted our Global Travel and Middle Eastern business but passenger numbers begun to turn around in the last quarter. We significantly up weighted activity on Johnnie Walker returning the brand to growth in the half. Johnnie Walker Black Label grew more strongly than deluxe variants and share increased. Our business in Asia Pacific is a mixture of the mature markets of Australia, Japan and Korea and the fast growing emerging markets of China, India and South East Asia.</p>
          <p>The Australian economy weathered the global downturn well and the beverage alcohol market is in growth. In the last quarter they are ready to drink segment returned to growth following the significant duty increase of 2008. Ready to drink represents a significant proportion of our business and with it return to growth, net sales in Australia grew 3%.</p>
          <p>In contrast the Korean economy has been impacted by the economic downturn. The whisky category was down 3%, however Diageo maintained its leadership with Windsor and Johnnie Walker. And Johnnie Walker grew 2.5 percentage points of share. Here the Guinness brand also performed well with double digit growth as a result of great sales execution and increased distribution supported by the 250th celebration.</p>
          <p>In the emerging markets of Asia Pacific, there are signs of recovery. Penetration of international spirits remains low however as purchasing power increases, consumer aspire to enjoy global brands.</p>
          <p>In China net sales declined following the reduction in inventory of Johnnie Walker and Dimple. However consumer off take was strong. And Johnnie Walker share grew over two percentages points in the half as we expanded distribution of the brand in a category we estimate is growing in high single digits.</p>
          <p>In Southeast Asia we saw strong growth led by Johnnie Walker and Guinness and Indonesia is now the fastest growing market globally for Guinness. We are confident about our new business in Vietnam where we are one of the few global spirits company's with in-market operations.</p>
          <p>We have invested behind infrastructure, marketing of priority brands and IT systems. As a result net sales grew double digit. Total marketing investment as Nick described was down 5% as we cut spend in Europe. In contrast we've increased investment on those brands where we can see growth opportunities. For example, on Captain Morgan in new markets and Johnnie Walker in Global Travel and Middle East, more effective spend and increased digital spend together with the continued benefit from media deflation in many markets has allowed us to reduce total marketing costs, yet maintain our focus on our proven growth drivers.</p>
          <p>The biggest marketing event in the half was the 250th celebration of Guinness culminating with Arthur's Day in September. This remarkable event was activated at scale across all key Guinness markets and was the largest and most successful global initiative ever executed by Guinness. It generated over two billion media impressions worldwide.</p>
          <p>The Smirnoff "Be There" campaign was also launched in the half. The multimedia program which inspires consumers to create and seek out extraordinary experiences has been launched in all major Smirnoff markets.</p>
          <p>Now let me take you through another example of how we delivery marketing synergies by managing a key global message across many markets. The Johnnie Walker "Keep Walking" campaign. The inherent brand message is the same across the globe, personal progress. However, the "Keep Walking" execution subtly changes across different markets and cultures.</p>
          <p>In Brazil where consumers already recognize the Johnnie Walker brand, the marketing execution is more emotive. Here you'll rarely see a glass of Johnnie Walker, but you'll see an image of an inspirational individual combined with the iconic image of the striding demand.</p>
          <p>In markets where consumers are less familiar with both brand and the scotch category for example China the campaign celebrates collective success and features pack shots of a classic Johnnie Walker serve combining functional and emotional messages.</p>
          <p>Global campaign like these have enabled Diageo to drive greater returns whilst delivering a clear consistent message and improving our brand equity.</p>
          <p>Our capabilities in innovation have been a valuable assets in these changing times. We've moved quickly to meet tactical market opportunities with new formats, new pack sizes, flavors often built on comprehensive learning from other markets.</p>
          <p>Read to serve cocktails are a great example. We've take a proven concepts from North America that concept is to meet the current shifting consumption to the off-trade and the growing demand for simple solutions. So consumers can enjoy their favorite drink at home as they would in a bar.</p>
          <p>Now ready to serve cocktails have been successfully launched in many market across Europe, Latin America and Asia. Smaller pack sizes have also provided tactical growth opportunities as consumers want to continue to enjoy leading brands but with a smaller financial outlay.</p>
          <p>In Europe we have successfully applied this to Smirnoff in GB and Captain Morgan and Bushmills in Russia. Flavors continue to provide incremental growth for our global brands, launches in the half included Baileys with a hint of coffee in Australia and Ciroc Berry in North American.</p>
          <p>Whilst we have seen down trading the ultra premium segment still exists and we continue to selectively innovate in this area. The best example is the John Walker. This is a blend of the finest scotch whiskies in limited supply, it's beautifully packaged and it retails for $3,000 a bottle in duty free.</p>
          <p>Before we take questions, let me summarize what we've covered this morning. As we anticipated this has been a challenging six months driven by a difficult first quarter. However, our global reach means that despite the headwinds we faced in Europe and the negative impact in the half of our decision to reduce shipments in the U.S. spirits category, growth in the developed and emerging markets has offset this to deliver a resilient performance overall.</p>
          <p>Our category leading brands, our focused marketing spend, successful innovation and sales capabilities have led to share gains for Diageo's priority brands in key markets. We have again generated significant free cash flow, further enhancing our financial strength. We continued to improve our efficiency of our functions to reduce our cost base and strengthen our relationships with our customers.</p>
          <p>Within the context of economic uncertainty, we believe this are good results and demonstrate our ability to strengthen our business even in a tough environment.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your time this morning. I'd now like to open it up for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now take our first question from Simon Hales from Evolution Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Three questions if I can. Firstly, obviously going into the end of the first half you saw organic profits down 3%. Obviously for the full year you're still guiding towards low single-digit growth in operating profit. If my math is correct, that would suggest that you're going to have to see a half two growth rate of somewhere between 5 and 15% organically to get you into that range. Now given that we're going to see up weighting of A&amp;P spend in the second half is there any particular areas you could point to where you're already starting to see significant improvements in profitability in the current quarter?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the corporate expenses in the first half I see a big swing there. Nick, could you just clarify how you expect that to trend in the second half? I think in the second half last year the corporate line was a negative 115 million. Should we be expecting that to be broadly flat? And then finally, on the cost savings that you delivered in the first half, how much of that out of the 120 you're targeting for the full year has actually already been realized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, kind of, all of those questions are somewhat inter-twined, because clearly the non-recurring nature of corporate expenses and the acceleration of cost savings in the second half contribute to our confidence of a better second half performance, and therefore our ability to reiterate our guidance. But maybe Nick, you can take the specifics of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the corporate cost element, which is one of the impacts if you like in the first half that's holding our profit growth down, we are not expecting that if you like to trend forward to the full year. In other words, the 40 to 50 million hit that we've taken, we are not going to see that double to 100. In fact if anything, I think it could be actually slightly less in the full year than where we are in the half year. So, in terms of the underlying point of your question, Simon, where is the increased profitability going to come from in the second half? That is definitely an area where we won't see the same proportion of drag.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost savings, obviously we're looking in total for about 120 million. That's what we announced when we put the program together. The majority of that in overhead you'll remember some of it was going through cost of sales, the majority of it in overheads. And actually we are broadly on track for about half and half and so there is not going to be a disproportionate effect either one way or the other between the savings from the restructuring program first half to second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of the underlying momentum in the business as you go into the second half obviously clearly in the second quarter running up to Christmas you should see an improvement in organic sales growth. When you look at somewhere like the U.S. where you were seeing that sort of tick-up in sales and that's improved in the second quarter. As you go into the first quarter, given the strength of the holiday season are you seeing wholesalers restocking to some degree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Ivan to comment specifically on the U.S., but I think a reasonable assumption is that we will not see restocking by distributors in many markets. Our experience is that once our customers get used to operating with lower inventories, they realize the efficiency gains from that. They are very reluctant as we are for them to restock. So our guidance does not assume any fundamental restocking, but Ivan, maybe you can talk to depletion trends in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Simon. I would say our outlook for the second half is not based on a consumer recovery in the U.S. We did have a strong &#x2013; a pretty strong holiday, but I'd say the economic and consumer environment is still tough out there with unemployment, with the on-premise still weak, even in January was very weak, and so we're working for the next couple of quarters assuming the U.S. consumer environment is still going to be tough. And a result our outlook is based on those assumptions.</p>
          <p>But however, our plans are to continue to invest behind our brands. We will have a step-up in advertising in the second half on our priority brands. We have a strong program of innovation. We have our route to market and sales execution strength, which we're taking to the next level. And that's what's behind our outlook for H2. It's not help from the external environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very interesting as we look at how consumers react to our brands. We clearly need an improvement in GDP. You need to see unemployment start to ease and that in turn leads to revitalized consumer confidence and it's when you get that third element that I think we can start to expect to return to former growth levels and we do expect to see that return.</p>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah; good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions. Firstly, although on the U.S. you are quite cautious looking forward, the performance the spirits versus beer, certainly spirits looks a lot better. We've seen beer falling, quite dramatically in volumes in the last few months. And I wondered if you have any thoughts of why spirits was holding up more resilient than beer and how you saw that trending through 2010.</p>
          <p>My second question was around destocking globally. I think Paul you referred to pockets of destocking still being visible in this first half. I think it was mentioned particularly the U.S., China, Eastern Europe. Do you really have sense that we're through all that or are we still going to hear comments about that as we go into Q3 and Q4 this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk to the destocking issue and then maybe Ivan can share his insights on the trends around beer. Of course stock levels are a function of how you see the business in the future. And I think if we see more confidence returning to these markets, then you will de facto even with constant inventories see the number of days come down. If you don't see confidence and the forward outlook is more negative, then there will be a need to take further stock out. I don't anticipate that, but it is the reality of what we were dealing with. We are not anticipating further destocking but it's a function of your confidence in these markets in that regard.</p>
          <p>Before Ivan talks to beer, we are very pleased with our total beer performance. If you look at total beer in the half, it was up 5%. We think that stacks are very, very well against the category on a global basis, so we're pleased with that, but Ivan, specifically U.S. trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if you look at what's been happening in the last 12 months, you have spirits growing volumes above 1%, and value in this zero to 1%, the spirits industry. Beer is down one to 2% but value in the zero to plus 1%. There has been a shift in volumetric share, but I would say we don't see this as a structural shift in consumer behavior. If you look at what's happened in the industry both with innovation in spirits and the growth of vodka where actually a lot of the 70% of the growth in the industry is coming out of vodka, that's in part where some of the adjustments are taking place.</p>
          <p>We see this sweet spot absolutely remaining premium brands in the spirits space, so for us Captain Morgan, Cuervo, Crown Royal, Smirnoff -- these are the brands which we actually see even in this environment, consumers are resorting to and staying true to, and that's where we are directing a lot of our money. So spirits volumetrically is looking robust plus one; it's not the growth rates we saw few years ago, but looking at F '11 to your question on outlook, I would say we see similar trends. Spirits about plus one in volumes and in zero to plus one in value, and in beer slightly lower, about flat in beer.</p>
          <p>If I just take a minute in beer, there are the interesting dynamics within the beer segment which are clearly at play. Interestingly all the growth in beer is really coming out of the craft segment right now, which is as you know, higher priced and premium and that's where there's very strong growth right now. Guinness for us is performing well. We had a good first half on beer and we've grown share with Guinness in the imported beer segment.</p>
          <p>So overall I would say Ian, yes, there have been some shifts in the last year. I don't see them as structural and starting a big trend over time. Spirits if you look at the last 10 years has gradually gained share of total beverage alcohol, volumetrically and that trend is continuing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may just quickly, I think you referred earlier to January being a bit weak. It obviously seems to be extraordinarily weak for the beer industry. Is that just a comment on weather and it's a small month, or is there any sign of any changes within the dynamics of spirits as we go into calendar 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, it is the small month, so I wouldn't read too much into January. But clearly, as we talk to our distributors and look at the depletion trends in spirits and wine as well in January, they were disappointing. Which is why I think in this environment even through we had a good December as Paul talked about we're cautious, Ian, and I don't think you can &#x2013; when you look at all the data points in the U.S. from GDP to unemployment to retail sales in January more broadly, you get a bit of a mixed picture. But for us, for example, the on-premise is a very key indicator of is consumer confidence coming back and spending levels going up in our sector and that was still week in January so we don't as I said anticipate in this second half a strong recovery. We expect things to stay sluggish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is what our guidance has been predicated on but if I can just pick up on the beer point, I find it very encouraging that where you have seen a migration from on-premise to off-premise, the consumer has taken that preference for spirits into the home, despite the inherent inconvenience of that versus a beer you're offering. I think five, seven, eight, years ago you may not have seen that and the research that we continue to see is that, yes, people may be dialing back on their spend but while they still aspire for the experiences and the brands that we can provide. So we are very encouraged by that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. One question please. If you looked at the H2 of last year, organic sales were down 7%, actually a reasonable large component to that was destocking, have you any estimate of how much of that was underlying and much of it was destocking?</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Erwan Rambourg from HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. Erwan Rambourg, HSBC. One question for Ivan going back to the U.S. We've seen the shift from on- to off-trade I was just wondering do you think this has -- before we look at a reversion of trend -- do you think we have now stabilized in terms of share of business between on and off or do you still see in recent months that shift continuing to go from on to off?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I had a question for more Paul and Nick on balance sheet strength, you were mentioning the balance sheet strength, the fact that you're not looking to buy back shares at this point. Can you use this balance sheet strength to look at potentially additional brands or potentially invest in route to market in certain areas?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly I just wanted to make sure I understood how the marketing spend would develop in H2. Should we expect marketing spend to be in line with sales growth for H2 or over the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on marketing spend we've suggested that in the second half it will be a little ahead of the sales growth. So therefore overall, you will see an improvement in the full year regarding percent of sales invest in marketing.</p>
          <p>Regarding the buyback -- you talk about other opportunities for investment. We would always fully fund the growth opportunities within the existing business as we see them. Equally we are always alert to opportunities to expand our business, but we are very disciplined around that expansion criteria and there have been a number of opportunities we have walked away from. And I would say judging on certain category performance, we are very pleased that we have walked away from them.</p>
          <p>So the first priority on cash is to fund the business and fund our existing growth opportunities. Secondly we will look at M&amp;A activity. And then we will look at returning excess to shareholders and that philosophy has not changed at all.</p>
          <p>And going into this environment we took a very conscious effort to focus on cash because whatever interest rates are implicit in the current market dynamics is an increased cost of capital. That may not be calculable because of falling interest rates but it's implied and we have to recognize that and I think the cash flow that we demonstrated does exactly that it shows what we can generate from a cash flow point of view and further strengthen our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Regarding the on-premise trend particularly in the U.S. before Ivan comments you know on a global basis we did see more revitalization in the on-premise over the holiday period. And I interprete into that you know people still want to go out but they don't either have the disposable income or the confidence to spend that disposable income at the rate they used to but the fundamental desires have not changed. When we fully see a recovery in the on-premise is very, very different &#x2013; difficult to call it will vary by market but certainly the research that we did over Christmas shows that there is still a demand, a desire for consumers to go out enjoy themselves with premium brands. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Erwan, I would say the trends are still with the on-premise decline, though it's declining less than it was a year ago. So if you look at calendar 2009 we estimate the on-premise industry was down about 3% off-premise was up about two. In the last quarter and into January as I said on-premise is still in decline. However, I think there are few things about the U.S. market which are important to remember here. One is the on-premise about 25% of the total market. Second, our profitability given the three tier system is and margins are pretty aligned across on and off-premise. And thirdly, I would say, we view the on-premise coming back as actually a very important leading indicator of consumer confidence and the industry coming back. We are not seeing structural changes in consumer behavior that would suggest the on-premise won't come back. It's purely an economic issue in our view and as the consumer confidence and consumer disposable income picks up in the U.S., we expect to revert back to the norm. And indeed that will help our view that price mix and premiumization will also return when that happens.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just two quick questions. The first one, in terms of the GB performance with obviously strong volumes up 6%, I was wondering whether the one of stocking of Marks and Spencers had a material impact on that number? And the second question back to Ivan, given the budget deficit in the U.S. can you give us a bit of an update on whether you see any risk in terms of FET or any major state tax increases either? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie the short answer to your question is no, the stocking in Marks and Spencers was not a material part of the performance in GB. One hopes it might be at some point in the future. The strong performance in GB was largely based on market share gains and the grocery channel. We have been working at collaborating much more closely with our big customers in grocery channel to build category, and at that same time our brand share. So we got that perfect example in the U.K. business of the spirits category being up 6% and Diageo spirits being up 14% over the three months leading up to and including Christmas. That's exactly the kind of win-win relationship with our customers that we're trying to build and we saw our share gains right across scotch with Bell's and Smirnoff in the vodka category, Gordon's in the gin category. So strong performance in grocery leading up to Christmas was really behind the GB performance.</p>

          <p>Clearly the issue of the deficits both at a federal and state level do give us and the industry concern. However I would say right now, in terms of calendar 2010, we feel reasonably confident at the federal level, that we will avert an FET. At the state level, we literally have battles in every state going on. I think as an industry across suppliers, distributors and retailers, we are very well organized to fight it and the key themes in our favor is in this current tough consumer environment our industry, the hospitality industry drives a huge number of jobs and we view alcohol taxes which are already very highly taxed, as a taxed on the middle class. And that's the message we're taking to state capitals and to Washington and I would say I feel cautiously confident that we will prevail on the federal level and we've got to fight the battles and we're winning many of them at the state levels. So by no means is the threat over but I'd say the industry is well aligned and organized to ensure we keep some more change in the consumer's pocket.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I had two questions, please. The first one I guess is a question for Nick. Can you give us an idea on the COGS inflation that you saw in the first half and that how that will compare to your full year expectation which I think sounds it kind of flat to plus one.</p>
          <p>And secondly, and I guess this is a question more for Ivan. In the second half you said that in the U.S. you're expecting the consumer to remain weak and that is consistent within your guidance and your budgeting process. Does that mean you are not expecting to take prices up in the U.S. in the second half of fiscal '10? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Melissa. Nick on COGS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On COGS Melissa, we came into this year expecting COGS to actually grow at somewhere between four and 5%. And that was our planning assumption the first half as it turned out to be more like 2% and the way I think the world is trending particularly commodity prices as a good expectation, it will be about that for the full year. Of course within that 2% there is a quite a mix, what I'll call it traditional Western part of our business, Western Europe part of our business, COGS are actually flat to marginally down but having a large part of our business with some local production in international markets including Africa. You're seeing a cost increase that's more than the average so that too is a blend of some very favorable now and some still relatively increasing, but that 2% is significantly different and lower than where we came into the year, where we expected more like four to five and that's what, that 2% is broadly what I expect for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just to clarify on that, you would expect below the 2% in the U.S. as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And in fact one other things you may not have seen but we actually talk about a small gross margin improvement in the U.S. and part of that is because relatively across the globe cost of goods in North America is actually pretty good compared even to the average of 2%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on pricing before Ivan comments I would not anticipate kind of raw pricing in the balance of this fiscal year from a global perspective. Now we will price for currency. If we're operating in inflationary environments we will price for that. But as a sort of general philosophy I think the next four months which is the balance of our fiscal year probably no major price moves. However, we will remain alert to it, certainly as we enter our new fiscal year. Ivan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just a Melissa, I would say we are at the bottom of the cycle on discounting and promotional activities and so we don't anticipate that deepening as we go into the second half. Secondly, I'd say to Paul's point, we would &#x2013; our approach is really to keep our brands strong we will be taking up adverting spend in the second half against our priority brands and looking for the signs of recovery and consumer conference those early indicators I've talked about and that would be our trigger to move back into a cycle of price increases. Right now, I don't see it in the second half and however when you look at what we lapping this side versus the half last year, I do expect there to be slight improvement in gearing in our performance in the second half of this year versus last year.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Matthew Jordan from Matrix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good Morning, gentlemen. Two questions, firstly if I could just pin you down specifically on the U.S. stock level, I know there have been a couple of questions about this already, but you commented obviously that sales through the holiday period were a little stronger than anticipated at the start of December, post Thanksgiving and therefore maybe stock levels have run down to lower levels than you might have expected. However you've also said that January was fairly weak, do we therefore seems in that but there will be no restocking as it were in the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>And my second question was just on operation in Venezuela obviously you referred to &#xA3;25 million currency hit but could you talk about sort of consumer off take and how you expect to manage that business there going through the next six to 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the Venezuela situation Stuart can comment. Regarding the U.S. first of all we've got to keep to January in context. It is a very, very low month. But generally speaking we would not anticipate any re-stocking, so the under shipment in December on our part was quite deliberate born of soft sell through in Thanksgiving. You should not expect to see coming back. That is the underlying assumption. Stuart Venezuela?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matthew in Venezuela obviously it's quite a difficult economic situation there with oil revenues falling, disposable income under pressure and as a result particularly in our imported business scotch volume was down &#x2013; down 11% in fact in the first half. But because of the local inflation levels and the FX issues we being pricing up to cover that cost in FX and as a result actually our scotch revenues were up 16% in the first half. So we are seeing some reduction in the ability and willingness of consumers to spend within the import category.</p>
          <p>Having said that we as you know we have some very strong brand properties there in Buchanan's, in Johnnie Walker and indeed in Old Parr and so our investment behind those brands is very targeted but we continue to believe in those brands and as I say on net sales grew. One of the great pluses that we have in Venezuela in our portfolio is a very strong local portfolio. So Cacique rum is very healthy brand there and in fact what we have seen, this people switching into rum as they become slightly more challenged from a disposable income perspective and our Cacique volume was up 11%. But actually on net sales in rum grew about 50% part of that was pricing to recover inflation. The rest of that actually we're seeing some premiumization within the rum category. So we're seeing Cacique Quinientes, the 500 version of Cacique starting to take volume where people might be moving a little out of scotch, because of the relative price points.</p>
          <p>So for the second half and on we continue to drive very strongly behind the all of our brand equities very clear that rum continues to have a very strong role for us there. Cacique and Aniversario. And you know, we continue to be very agile what is quite probably the most volatile market environment we are operating in Latin America. But operating very, successfully with a lot of track record of operating through those difficult times.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you gentlemen. Just one question then. Giving what you are seeing going into the second half this year and particularly at looking at Europe but also looking at maybe the inability to help pricing in the short-term do you see your business recovering post the crisis to the previous seven to 9% level? That's what you are talking about beforehand?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly not this year. Because we guided to single digits and I'm not offering any guidance at this point regarding the next fiscal year, but I do believe that over time the point of intervention to be determined we will see our business return to historic growth levels. Of that that I've got no doubt I just don't know when it is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My point on pricing was that this &#x2013; the second half I'm not anticipating raw global price increases we will be looking at it in the first half next year. That isn't a commitment that we will increase price, but we will look at it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll ask Stuart to comment on that but I think to put it in context we have to recognize at present we've almost got a polarized world, certainly a two speed world. In Europe and the U.S. things are pretty flat, not declining, flattish. And in Asia, in Latin America and in Africa we are definitely seeing building momentum around growth rates. And we are well positioned in those markets to exploit that growth. However, we do need to see some recovery particularly in the U.S., but Stuart, why don't you talk specifically to Africa and LatAm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Briefly, Philip, this &#x2013; you're right, we saw some improvement in the second quarter and indeed in Global Travel and Middle East alongside LatAm and Africa. And our view is that hat kind of outlook for the second half -- that we saw in the first half is what we'll sort of see in the second half. So we are cycling in the second half of last year a more difficult period and therefore we're looking at slightly better comps. So you know we will be expecting continued good growth across LatAm, Africa and GTME particularly in scotch and particularly in beer.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. A question for Ivan. Just thinking about January, we can appreciate that it's a small month and that the consumer may have been a bit exhausted from Christmas, but February, the Super Bowl rating seemed to indicate that everyone stayed home to watch the game and the weather on the East Coast has been horrible. I mean, where we initially on the February read, and if things go much worse than expected in February, is there are certain point within the year where you know that even with conservative budget estimates, that you may not be able to make your numbers?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for giving me the opportunity as well. Just Paul on marketing, I think there's been lot written regarding the reduction in the A&amp;P spend within the spirits industry and yourselves, and also that the recovery of spirits in an upturn or recovery is slower then other consumer goods because the spirits industry cuts A&amp;P more than before. What assurance can you give us that you are fully invested behind your brands, the cut that you actually made will not impact the recovery potential, that there's actually is relative to other consumer goods?</p>
          <p>And then maybe if Nick wants to answer, you could say what is the impact of the FX at the current spot rate, which is 156 versus when you did yours at 164.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I don't know whether Nick's prepared for that, but I'll give him few moments to set his calculator up. Maybe Andy can comment on our marketing investment profile but, let me give you my context.</p>
          <p>First of all, there is real deflation, and there is no sign that we are seeing inflation come back into the marketplace. Secondly there are shifts. We have moved towards digital, it is far more cost effective and you can actually make yourself feel very comfortable because the reach is far broader. Also we have definitely cut back in certain markets, where we see little prospect for a bounceback in consumption trends anytime soon, for example Spain. 80% of consumption was in the on-premise, and a huge proportion of that was in night clubs. There is nobody going to those places, and therefore us to keep spending on party nights, nightology, hiring boats just makes no sense. So where it makes sense to invest, we have fully funded our programs, so I'm pretty confident that we will come out of this in very, very good shape.</p>
          <p>Andy, and then Nick and then we'll sign off.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. Nico, brands are the heartbeat of our company. They need to be in strong shape and I'm feeling pretty good about the shape that they're in. Equity is strong, shares are up on the key brands. And the key for conditions like this is the agility that Paul talked to. We've got to move our money to the brands, the geographies and the activities that we have most confidence in, and that's what we have done. Paul said we'd expect to invest more in aggregate in the second half. We would. Would expect to get to the ratios that we had last year in aggregate for the full year. But for the whole of this year we've being moving our money to fully fund the best opportunities, and that's what we need to continue to do.</p>

Just a health warning because you know people always ask me what's the currency impact of the currency that's moving favorably and you're right the dollar has moved a bit but you know we as you know we have to keep an eye on every other single currency and that's particularly true right now as you have seen some Africa currencies and some Asia currencies move and also right from where we sit today it's going to be a part year effect so if we stayed the way it is you know could we see another 15 million benefit? Yeah I'm sure we could but that's absolutely dependent on what will happen to all the other currencies along the way as well. So we just have to keep an eye on everything.</p>
