          <p>Thanks, Loren, and good morning, everybody. Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter 2011 net income of $574 million or $1.35 per fully diluted share on revenues of $4.26 billion. These earnings are 8% better than the third quarter of 2011 and 29% better than the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings for the entire year of 2011 totaled $2 billion or $4.70 per fully diluted share on revenues of $14.66 billion. These results are 20% better than 2010.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders in the quarter of $1.7 billion, bringing the total new orders in the year to $10.8 billion, which eclipses our old record of $7.3 billion set in 2008. We are very excited about these results and optimistic about the ordering atmosphere for 2012. I want to thank all of the employees around the world at National Oilwell Varco for their tremendous work in achieving these stellar results for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I will expand further on our operations in a moment, but will now turn it over to Clay to provide some color on our results.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pete. National Oilwell Varco posted excellent results in the fourth quarter, earning $574 million or $1.35 per fully diluted share on $4.3 billion in revenue. Operating profit was $848 million for the fourth quarter, up $76 million from the third quarter and up $224 million from the fourth quarter of last year on a GAAP basis. Excluding transaction charges from all periods, fourth quarter operating profit was $860 million, up 11% from the third quarter and up 38% from the fourth quarter last year. Operating margins on this basis were 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 20.8% in the third quarter and 19.7% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Sequential operating leverage or flow through was 16% on the 14% increase of sales. This is a little lower than we typically see for two reasons: First, we had nearly a full quarter's contribution from our Ameron acquisition, which closed October 5 and was responsible for about 25% of our consolidated sequential revenue growth.</p>
          <p>These businesses came in at a little lower margin as expected, but our integration initiatives to improve efficiency are fully mobilized and we are pleased with the progress so far. Four months into the Ameron combination we're very excited about what we see and, in particular, about the composite pipe powerhouse we are building.</p>
          <p>Second, most of the rest of the sequential sales growth, 67% came from our Rig Technology segment at slightly lower sequential margins, consistent with the gradual mix shift we described in the past. Outstanding execution once again by this team, their boosted revenue out of backlog a remarkable 26% sequentially, up $368 million over the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, the fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a strong year for NOV. 2011 saw National Oilwell Varco generate record net income of $1.994 million on record revenues of $14.7 billion. Compared to the full-year results for 2010 and excluding transaction charges from both years, revenues improved 21% at 21% operating leverage year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was a very solid $2.1 billion, and the company reinvested $1.5 billion in our business; one-third in organic growth opportunities and two-thirds in acquisition growth opportunities. Another $0.5 billion went to scheduled debt repayments and dividends to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>For five straight years in every single quarter, NOV has generated at least $500 million in operating profit and margins of at least 19%, a pretty good streak. And lest we forget, these past five years included the downfall of the Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, a $700 billion TARP bailout bill, a 70% collapse in commodity prices, the historic downgrade of U.S. debt ratings and the worst credit market meltdown in a generation. Nevertheless, NOV performed like a honey badger, illustrating the company's uniquely durable portfolio of oil field equipment and services.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed in the past, we expect three big trends to continue to shape NOV's fortunes in the coming years: One, deepwater development; two, retooling old land jack up drilling rig fleets; and three, shale developments. First, sometime in the mid 1990s, deepwater technologies blossomed, seismic advances illuminated deepwater structures, motion compensation systems permitted floating rigs to keep drill bits on bottom and drill these structures efficiently despite heaving seas, and floating production vessels hooked to subsea systems provided a way to economically produce the discoveries that followed.</p>
          <p>Science and entrepreneurial innovation in rapid succession opened up the rest of the planet, specifically the two-thirds of the globe covered by more than 500 feet of water to oil and gas development, which was inaccessible by our industry through its first century. The capability to drill and produce reliably in this environment coupled with $100 oil led predictably to rising demand for deepwater rigs. The late 1990s saw a handful of floating rigs built inefficiently almost all late and way over budget, but a second larger wave beginning in 2005 witnessed vastly improved execution and definitively signal the industry's intention to make the 21st century the deepwater century.</p>
          <p>NOV has quite a key role in this evolution by driving consistency of design, implementing more responsive cellular manufacturing techniques and training hundreds of highly skilled service technicians in our four technical colleges to commission these vessels. We have delivered 62 floating rig packages since 2005 with only one delay due to issues with our equipment, an outstanding record that is a testament to the high level of professionalism demonstrated daily by our Rig Technology team.</p>
          <p>The thing about deepwater drilling is that it begets more deepwater drilling. The initial armada that moved out into deeper waters made discoveries that require follow-on development drilling to produce. The success has whetted appetites for more exploration. That's why, paradoxically, the deepwater rig market is tightening and day rates are moving up in spite of a slew of new rig deliveries over the past several years, and that's why we are confident that there will be more to come.</p>
          <p>We believe drillers closely consider a half-dozen or so major factors when they launch offshore newbuild projects: Day rate environment, currently good and getting better and somewhat a derivative oil price; availability of financing, currently stable; cost of the rig, which is stable and reasonable; balance sheet capacity, which will vary by customer; operational bandwidth to crew and manage a new rig, which also will vary by customer; and risk of delays in building, which is currently low and approaching zero, at least with NOV rig packages.</p>
          <p>We believe most of these factors, save operational bandwidth, are to the positive today. Day rates are rising; credit is available to the extent operational bandwidth gives some drillers pause stems from the voracious appetite for many new rigs that they ordered in 2011. Drilling equipment package pricing is up 6% to 8% year-over-year but has stabilized recently while hull costs are actually down 1% or 2% in the last few months as Asian shipyards continue to try to replenish the declining commercial vessel backlogs.</p>
          <p>Stability has taken some of the urgency out of decisions to exercise options, and recent option activity has been a mixed bag. Some have been exercised. We have extended some for cash or modest uplifts in pricing, while other option holders have elected to let theirs expired out of the money. Options activity notwithstanding, we believe 2012 finds us in an environment still highly conducive to building deepwater rigs, which underpins our positive outlook.</p>
          <p>A little further down the road, we see rising demand for production systems to monetize deepwater discoveries. We think the most interesting of these are floating production storage and offloading systems or FPSOs, which are clever substitute for a pipeline. Our APL turret mooring products position us well to sell into future FPSO construction. However, orders were slow in coming in 2011. Nevertheless, we are scoping and quoting record levels of projects, and given that there have been 180-plus deepwater discoveries announced around the world over the past several years, our long term view for demand here is very bright.</p>
          <p>Onto retooling, the average jack-up was born in 1982, that's really old for a rig. The average land rig around the globe was born during the Carter administration. Kellys, master bushings, rock bits, 30-degree deviated drilling, rotary phones, IBM Selectric typewriters and eight-track tapes were the leading-edge technologies then. Today, these rigs are old, tired, rusty and inefficient. They are being replaced. In November, our ReedHycalog unit in conjunction with World Oil Magazine published our annual rig census where we count rigs across many markets as we've done since the early 1950s.</p>
          <p>This year's version was headlined again paradoxically, North American Rig Fleet Shrinks As Activity Climbs. Huh? It's true, despite high rig counts across North America, despite high and modestly rising day rates, despite the highest level of land rig building for North America in a generation, the number of rigs available to drill is dropping. The death rate is exceeding the birth rate. Machines like rigs have finite lives both physically and technologically, and this generation of jack-up and land rigs that has served us well, that we have relied upon to fuel rising levels of oil and gas consumptions since the 1980s, are in their sunset years.</p>
          <p>Public land drillers have announced the retirement of 200 land rigs in the past few months despite generally rising day rates. Obviously, the market makes an enormous distinction between new rigs and old rigs.</p>
          <p>The retooling phenomenon is most advanced in the U.S. where about 40% of the fleet has been replaced over the past several years. However, this likely overstates the impact somewhat because many rigs early in the replacement cycle were simply copies of old 1970s designs. The effective replacement rate is probably closer to a third, and at the current rate, we are probably replacing 6% or 7% per year. The 3,000 or so rigs in the international markets -- land rigs in the international markets, are in the very early days of retooling. Nevertheless, NOV and our competitors have sold new rigs now into most major markets, so early adopters are starting to prime the demand pump in these regions by differentiating themselves through performance.</p>
          <p>The replacement of the jack-up rig fleet is probably roughly a third of the way through too, inclusive of rigs still being constructed in shipyards to be delivered by 2014, representing about a decade's worth of serious effort. The strength of the jack-up cycle in particular has surprised many analysts, but we believe it will continue. Lately, we have seen the customer base shift to national oil company owned or controlled drilling contractors for conventional 350 foot or 400 foot leg cantilever jack-ups and IOC driven mega jack-up projects that can approach $0.5 billion in total cost.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe extrapolation of progress thus far in replacing these rig categories implies another 20 plus years to go. No question that the next 20 years will see commodity price and day rate volatility, starts and stops, but building will need to happen in more years than not.</p>
          <p>And finally, the third major trend driving NOV's destiny is shales. A major catalyst for the retooling of the land rig fleet in particular is the shale revolution. Like the deepwater revolution, the shale revolution was born of science and entrepreneurial ingenuity, thus creating jobs across North America, creating wealth for mineral rights owners, helping local governments balance their budgets and EIA report by EIA report, demonstrating a U.S. that is remarkably moving closer to energy independence.</p>
          <p>So here's an economics question for you. If 14th century alchemists had actually been successful of transforming rocks into gold, what would have happen to the price of gold? &#x2013; Answer? Pretty much what is happening to the price of gas now as 21st century alchemists have figured out how to turn rocks into gas. Like everyone else, we're wondering where North American gas prices find support and what does gas drilling look like once the dust settles, but encouragingly the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in our industry which is repositioning, rotating, some say sprinting from gas to liquids which still enjoy robust pricing, kind of like how gas in Continental Europe still enjoys robust pricing, five or six times higher than it is in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We predict this deep disequilibrium spanning the Atlantic will equilibrate over the several years as the industry employs technologies honed here into shales located there to make Europe more energy self sufficient. To this end we are expanding our rig up and manufacturing operations in Poland and elsewhere across Europe and adding new European rig designs to our offering to help our customers to make this happen.</p>
          <p>The shale revolution is gaining traction elsewhere too in places like China and Argentina. The EIA sees nearly 6,000 Tcf in shales across about three dozen countries. So how long do Europe and other countries continue to pay $10 or more for an Mcf of gas? NOV is a key supplier and the leading supplier of many of the technologies that go into successful shale programs: rigs, drill pipe, drilling motors, bits, coil tubing and pressure pumping equipments just to name a few. And although shale gas supply will certainly present structural pricing challenges from time to time, temporary slowdowns in drilling should quickly correct imbalances given steep decline curves that wipe out 75% or more of most wells' production within the first two years. Against the backdrop of this very drilling and hardware-intensive process, our outlook for drilling and hard work demand remains bright.</p>
          <p>Commodity, price volatility and rig count activity storms they unleashed are nothing new to NOV. Over the years, we've learned that the best course for our company is to always invest for the long haul. We remain passionate in our views on deepwater development, on retooling a fleet of rigs critical to the world's energy equation, and of an amazing new incremental source of energy wealth from shales. Our strategies and investments in 2011 reflect our high level of conviction in these themes.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the continued growth and success of NOV, our most valued resources is an exceptional workforce we are honored to serve. Pete, Loren and I are exceedingly grateful to work with a team of professionals at NOV who daily provide terrific service, products and technology to the world's oil and gas industry. We thank you all for your hard work in 2011 and look forward to a terrific execution in an exciting 2012 and beyond. You are the best.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our segment operating results. NOV's Rig Technology segment generated revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 18% sequentially and up 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating profit was $603 million, yielding operating margins for the group of 26%, a decline of 80 basis points from the third quarter and 250 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Incremental operating leverage or flow-through was 22% of the sequential sales improvement, up $346 million, and incremental leverage or flow-through was 18% from the fourth quarter of 2010 on the $559 million revenue improvement, with a little less than the 30% to 35% we would typically expect. This is due to the gradual decline in margins we've been guiding to for about a year, arising from a mix shift in the group. High operating margins north of 30% that we were seeing in the first half of 2010 from projects sold at exceptionally high pricing in 2007 and 2008 being executed in a low cost deflationary environment. As fatter margin projects wind away out of the backlog, we're reverting to a more normalized margin. Therefore, our guidance for the segment calls for margins to flatten in the 25% range before beginning a very gradual rise in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>As a later cycle business, in effect we are seeing the economic downturn of 2009 manifesting in the group's P&amp;L right now. Importantly, performance remains superb as the group's annualized fourth quarter NOPAT returns on tangible capital achieved triple digits this quarter.</p>
          <p>On previous calls, we've noted that construction cycles for offshore rigs are shortening, a result of increasingly hungry shipyards in Asia finding themselves with more and more idled assets that they can redirect to rig building speeding the process. They're committing to build schedules that are 6 to 10 months shorter now which requires a little faster delivery of drilling equipment packages into these projects by NOV.</p>
          <p>Unlike a land rig project where NOV essentially builds the entire rig and is wholly responsible for the critical path, the offshore rig critical paths still reside almost entirely within a shipyard. It takes longer to make a hull than it takes to make the drilling equipment package but nevertheless, we have to step up our delivery rates to meet the needs of our customers so we've been investing in expansion initiatives. This quarter saw our revenues out of backlog jump 26% sequentially to a new record level of $1.775 billion as we responded to these more challenging build schedules.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter orders for Rig Technology were $1.668 billion and included three floaters and six jack-up packages. Year-ending backlog totaled $10.164 billion down just a shade from September 30. For the full year, orders totaled a record $10.849 billion. We expect about $6.6 billion of our orders on the books at yearend to flow out as revenue during 2012, $1.8 billion to flow out in 2013 and the balance to flow out in 2014 and beyond. 86% of our backlog is destined for the offshore, 14% for land and 86% is international while 14% is domestic. Outlook for orders remains good with several major projects seeking bids now.</p>
          <p>Land bookings jumped from the third quarter, matched by higher land revenues leaving our land backlog about flat. Land orders were balanced between domestic and international sales and in addition to complete drilling and workover rigs, we sold several rig component packages. Demand for pressure pumping, coil tubing units and frac equipment remained exceptionally strong with 2012 largely sold out and several expansion initiatives underway to respond to demand.</p>
          <p>We're delivering nearly one frac-sander a day now. Mix for wellbore stimulation equipment was steady at about 60% North America, 40% international. We continue to see interest from emerging international shale markets as oilfield service companies begin to layer in infrastructure to accommodate hydraulic fracture stimulation.</p>
          <p>Domestically, pressure pumpers seemed to be settling on larger diameter 2-inch coil tubing while internationally, 1.75 inch is still preferred. Larger diameter permits accessing longer laterals without buckling and offers higher flow rates and better hydraulics but also requires much larger, heavier reel that can present transportation challenges.</p>
          <p>Non-backlog revenue for the group declined 4% sequentially this quarter due to lower after-market sales around the holidays. We saw the same thing in the fourth quarter of 2010 when non-backlog revenue declined 1% from the third quarter to the fourth. Year-over-year, it was up 11% for the fourth quarter and annual growth rates for the after-market has averaged over 20% over the past six years.</p>
          <p>For the full year, Rig Technology generated $7.8 billion in revenue and $2.1 billion in operating profit or 26.6% compared to $7 billion in revenues, $2.1 billion in operating profit and 29.7% operating margins in 2010. The mix effect we've described in the past led to lower operating margins for the year as expected but the group generated very strong returns on capital for the year and $10.2 billion in backlog after record orders positions rig technology for a strong performance in 2012. During the fourth quarter, the group commissioned six offshore rigs, bringing our total to 23 for the year and over 120 offshore rigs since 2005.</p>
          <p>Looking into the first quarter 2010, &#x2013; sorry, 2012, we expect rig technology revenues to be roughly flat with the fourth quarter at slightly lower margins. The Petroleum Services and Supply segment generated total sales of $1.570 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 8% from the third quarter and up 38% year-over-year. Operating profit was $301 million or 19.2% of sales. Margins fell from 20.5% in the third quarter as the contribution from Ameron came in at a little lower margin and a couple of the products within PSNS posted lower margins due to unfavorable mix and some higher costs.</p>
          <p>Most notably, margins for drill pipe declined sequentially due to much higher sequential purchases from third party -- of third party green tubes owing to our third quarter maintenance shutdown of the voestalpine mill and adverse euro movements early in the fourth quarter. Margins nevertheless remained decretive to the segment margins overall and we expect that these cost factors will be transient and for drill pipe margins to improve in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Further in the year, our outlook remains strong for drill pipe demand given that there are dozens of newbuild offshore rigs, which we expect to buy premium drill pipe. Mix and cost headwinds in certain businesses were partly offset by strong sequential performance in downhole tools with higher royalty revenues and strong sales growth in Canada and in the eastern hemisphere.</p>
          <p>Wellsite Services also had an excellent sequential performance with growth in equipment sales and rental and leasing operations in the U.S. Excel Systems posted a strong finish to the year and Tuboscope quality tubing and mission all showed sequential sales gains as well. For the full year 2011, Petroleum Services and Supply segment generated a record $5.7 billion in revenue, up 35% from $4.2 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>The segment generated $1.1 billion in operating profit, almost double operating profit levels for 2010 and representing 35% leverage on the year-over-year sales growth. Operating margins of 19.4% for the year were up from 14% in 2010. Looking into the first quarter of 2012, we expect Petroleum Services &amp; Supplies segment sales to grow in the low single-digit percentage range sequentially and for operating margins to push back above the 20% level.</p>
          <p>Turning to Distribution and Transmission. First note that it has a new name. The change this quarter reflects the inclusion of Ameron's Water Transmission and Infrastructure Product groups from October 5 onward. For the quarter, the group generated $560 million in sales and $45 million in operating profit or 8% of sales. Compared to the third quarter, sales improved 17% mostly due to Ameron and year-over-year quarterly sales grew 32%.</p>
          <p>Sequential operating leverage or flow-through excluding charges was 10%, and year-over-year flow-through was 11%. Margins for the newly acquired businesses in the aggregate were in line with the segment margins. The legacy NOV distribution portion of the segment saw revenues up slightly with strong flow-throughs due to terrific performance in Canada.</p>
          <p>International was up slightly and the U.S. was down slightly, owing to rig moves towards liquids plays, together with related drill site construction delays and weather issues in a few markets. Mono posted good performance once again with strong demand for power sections and artificial lift equipment. Fourth quarter results kept a strong year for the segment overall, with a record $1.873 billion in sales, a record $136 million in operating profit and 7.3% operating margins.</p>
          <p>Revenues were up 21% and flow-throughs were 18% for the year. Typical flow-through for the group runs about 10%, so we were pleased with the strong incremental resulting margins for the group. For the first quarter of 2012 we expect Distribution and Transmission revenues to be down slightly at slightly lower margins as compared to the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter income statement saw SG&amp;A increase $35 million sequentially due to acquisitions and sales growth.  SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was 10% in the fourth quarter, down from 10.5% in the third quarter and down from 11.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Transaction costs were $12 million pre-tax, and the equity income in our voestalpine joint venture was $12 million, up slightly from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect similar profitability in the first quarter of 2012. Other expense moved $13 million unfavorably from the third quarter to the fourth due to the non-recurrence of favorable FX moves in Q3, which offset bank charges and other items on this line which usually run about $11 million a quarter. FX was relatively quiet this quarter.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year was 32%, about what we expect in 2012. Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $89 million in the fourth quarter, up $3 million from the third quarter due to higher intersegment eliminations. Depreciation and amortization was roughly flat at $142 million and EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was $1 billion for the quarter and $3.6 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>NOV's December 31, 2011 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $3.5 billion or 20.6% of annualized sales, up $84 million from the third quarter on higher inventory and accounts receivable, partly offset by higher accrued taxes and liabilities. Total customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of cost, less costs in excess of billings, was $865 million at December 31, down $276 million due to the large increase in revenue out of backlog.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was $622 million for the fourth quarter and $2.143 billion for the year. CapEx increased $41 million sequentially in the quarter to $166 million, bringing full year capital expenditures to $483 million. We expect CapEx in 2012 to move into the $600 million range as we pursue a number of expansion opportunities launched last year as well as follow through on projects brought in with Ameron. Cash spent on nine acquisitions totaled $1.38 billion for the year and dividends paid to our shareholders totaled $191 million during 2011. Finally, NOV's cash balance was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clay. I'd like to make a few brief comments and then I'll turn it over for questions in just a moment. But, as we look back on the past year, there have really been three things that we've emphasized greatly in this company. And the first one has been efficiency and that's driving cost out of the system and that's being able to deliver products on time, on budget.</p>
          <p>And we've invested heavily, we've gone into our facilities, we've change things around, we've gone to cellular manufacturing, you've heard us talk about this an awful lot. We've expanded. We've bought new facilities and this has allowed us to do a couple of fairly unique things. We have been able to drive almost a year out of the delivery of deep water rigs. If you would have been ordering those back in 2006 and 2007, it was about a 36-month lead time, today it's 24 months.</p>
          <p>The reason for that is great shipyards: Samsung, Hyundai, the people in Korea, the people in Singapore have all done a very good job but more importantly we're able to get throughput out much more rapidly than we could before because of these efficiencies. We're driving down cost, you see great margins that are coming out of it and we're going to continue to emphasize this.</p>
          <p>The second thing is personnel. Personnel are extremely important. They're the most important thing we have in this company. We're investing heavily in training. We've opened up colleges around the country for our technical people. We currently have them in Norway, in Singapore, Brazil, and here in the United States but interestingly, in these colleges we actually last year set 5,000 of our customers' people through them and this year we expect to surpass 6,000 of that.</p>
          <p>So we're able to not only train our own people, but we're able to train our customers' people, so that we can better take care of these products as they're in the field. We also have agreements with Purdue University, Rice, University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M that we utilize in having different classes and different courses for our people internally, so that we can emphasize manufacturing, sales management and other things that we do, such as taking technology and turning it into a profitable venture.</p>
          <p>And then, finally, the thing I want to mention are new products. The life blood of the company is making sure that you're having the best technology out there that, really, our customers can utilize to create efficiency in the oil field. The shales have really created that. We're pushing more and more different things in the shales. We see the technology, as Clay kind of mentioned, we're turning that stuff into gold, making it a little bit cheaper, but we have a lot of new products. We continue to press ahead on our R&amp;D efforts. We introduced a new frac pump recently, our Helios bit, which is something that I think is going to be very, very effective in drilling these shale wells and a lot of products like that.</p>
          <p>So when we think about things, it's about efficiency, it's about personnel and it's about new products. We think those are what's going to lead us into the next couple of years to really be the market leader that we continue to be. So we're excited about it. We like what we're seeing in the first part of 2012. I think 2012, while it will have some challenges, will be a very, very exciting year for us. So Dawn, at this point. I'd like to turn it over to our callers for any questions they might have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Douglas Becker from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hi. Maybe as we think about PS&amp;S going forward, there's a few moving parts here. It sounds like we will see some acceleration in drill pipe. The Ameron acquisition could be coming in, getting some synergies there and then just &#x2013; I guess we have the low natural gas prices. Do you see the potential for 30%, 35% incrementals like we've seen in 2010, 2011 as we go through 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug. I think so. We've &#x2013; in Q4 if we talk about last quarter, we had Ameron coming in and so far so good on integrating that business and improving the margins that we see incremental from that and so that will help. And as we expected last quarter, we dropped a little below 20% margins. We're posting 19.2% this quarter. Going into 2012, as we begin to get traction on those efforts plus we continue to see improvements in our other businesses in terms of efficiency, maybe a little better pricing, we foresee marching up above the 20% range. And so I think 30%, 35% incrementals generally make sense. One thing though that I'll point out is that the pricing gains that we appear to be getting in the fourth quarter and as we moved into 2012 within PS&amp;S are a little more limited. They're a little more focused on either specific products and technologies or specific geographic areas like the Eagle Ford or the Bakken where you're seeing rigs moving into that area. So it's more of a little -- little more of a mixed bag.</p>
          <p>In the past, PS&amp;S has been able to post incremental margin gains north of 35% during periods when the rig count is running up. And right now, we're seeing a rig count in North America a little more flattish and pricing gains a little more limited as a result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It makes sense. And then just &#x2013; so I'm still very positive on the retooling of the industry. Have you noticed any short-term changes in maybe some of the more price-sensitive or North American-sensitive land rigs, coil tubings, frac spreads or stimulation equipment in terms of orders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we -- again, good demand but I think pricing has probably stabilized. But demand remains high; we haven't had any -- although I think most of our customers are a little nervous like we are about gas prices. We haven't seen anybody backing off their ordering for well stimulation equipment or land rigs. And again, it's -- we do a lot in North America, but we're also seeing a lot of interest from international markets too. So those, of course, are unaffected by the recent gas price downturn.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Many of your traditional customers seem to be taking a bit of a pause in their deepwater rig ordering. Given the strength in deepwater day rates that we've seen recently, do you expect this to be short lived?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jim, I think so. I mean, if you take a look at this, there's a couple of things that are impacting this right now. In my comments I mentioned that the speed with which we're getting these things out, we've knocked about a year off, and so I think the customers are taking to look at that going -- instead of having to plan, three, three and a half years out, now they can kind of look ahead to two years, and it gives them more flexibility.</p>
          <p>And also, I think as you look at some of the rigs that are being built right now, there's probably a pause that people are waiting to see some of those get contracted. And as they get contracted, then I think you'll see them come in and go, okay, let's go and let's order. So we're actually fairly optimistic. As we look at the project list that we review every week, and we kind of look at the things out there, we think that the ordering in fact will pick up from some of the traditional customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I realize you don't run your business off ODS-Petrodata, but if you look at all the deepwater rig orders we've seen and what National Oilwell has booked, do you think there's still some orders that are generally known to have happened in the industry or reported in ODS-Petrodata that for some reason you haven't put into your backlog and is that number larger than usual right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we take a look at that Jim, obviously, ODS-Petrodata, I mean that's out there and it's public. We generally don't make our information public for a lot of reasons. I mean, obviously, competitive reasons and everything else, but I would say that we probably have a little bit better knowledge as we look at things simply because as I've said many times, if you're going to order a rig, you've got to come to us. Not -- even if you don't want to order from us, you can at least use us a stalking horse.</p>
          <p>And so we think that we've got a little bit better insight into this and probably the things that we know don't necessarily match up with ODS-Petrodata. And obviously having said that, and I'm kind of bouncing around a little bit, but clearly, there's stuff out there and stuff that we know about that's not necessarily known publicly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question, Clay one for you. Could you give a sense as to the overall breakdown of PS&amp;S? How much of that -- of that total segment now is North America? And in your North American business, gas is to how much could be natural gas oriented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jim in the fourth quarter, the total North America was 58%. It's revenues by destination, about &#x2013; U.S. is right at 50% and Canada is about 8%.  That's within the PS&amp;S segment. And with regards to how much of that is gas, it's purely a guess -- perhaps, a third of the U.S. land fleet is drilling for gas. That's probably a pretty good proxy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Clay or Pete with $3.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet and just from my numbers, I have you generating some $5 billion or so in free cash flow over the next two years. It seems like you've got a lot of fire power to put to work. I know you guys are focused on M&amp;A. Do you think that we'll see deals here in the near term? Has the acquisition market improved? And I've heard from some that at least one of the competitors for deals has kind of dropped out of the market, which may clear the way for you to get some work done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, James, as we've said many, many times, our preference is really to utilize our cash to grow the company, and we've done that we think very effectively through M&amp;A. Obviously in the last quarter, we brought in Ameron and that was I think, give or take, about an $800 million deal.</p>
          <p>There are a lot of things that we're looking at today. I think that the buying opportunities are there. It's always kind of nice when people take a little bit of a pause and they think maybe there's some choppy waters ahead because that really makes the buying opportunities much more attractive for us.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at our history, we've probably made the best deals when things were kind of down a little bit. We're very disciplined. We stay very true to our core values on that. And if other people are willing to overpay, that's kind of the way it is. We get in very few auctions. We kind of put a value on something and tell people this is what it is and we've been successful at doing that.</p>
          <p>Having said that, it does appear that some competitors for things have dropped out, and we're very optimistic that we'll probably be able to announce a few deals here in the very &#x2013; in the near future. A lot of good things that we're looking at out there right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Good to hear. And just a somewhat related follow-up on that; with your exposure to your pressure pumping equipment sales, are there certain product lines that go into stimulation equipment that you are currently not in that maybe you would acquire companies to get into or maybe organically get into those certain products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The most conspicuously absent product has been a pressure pump. And here over the last 18 months or so, we've developed our own. So we've approached that organically and have a couple of dozen 2,400 horsepower pumps that work in the field and doing very, very well. So we &#x2013; as you know, we package a lot of frac spread equipment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...well stimulation equipment. And so we've had a lot of pressure pumps kind of pass through our operation being unitized and going into the field that way. And we also have, over the years, probably made more drilling pumps than anyone. So we make a lot of pumps on the one hand, but we weren't really focused in this area before. So, couple years ago we recognized that and launched an organic initiative to develop our own pressure pump and so far, so good. Very, very excited about the prospect for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, I just wanted to follow up on James' question on the pump. I know you've got about 20 or 30 of those out in the field or so as of this date. Can you follow up on how testing is going with those, number one and number two, are you looking at that as adding to the new market or as these things wear out that you pass through that you're going to have also a very robust replacement market as you put your pumps on some of the equipment that you've previously delivered using other folk's pumps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question and I would say it's all of the above. You know, obviously as we have this pump out there and we're very, very pleased with its performance at this point in time, and again, we're good pump manufacturers. This was almost just kind of a natural off-shoot for us. But the thing about it is we'll also have the footprint on it that not only will we put it on new equipment that goes out but as you have to replace pumps on existing equipment it'll be able to be retrofitted onto those trailers very easily.</p>
          <p>So we think it's a tremendous business and also as kind of a follow-up to the fluid end part of it, you know the expendable side of that business is outstanding. Not only do we have the expendable side on our regular drilling pumps but now with the expendable side on these frac pumps and they go through expendables very, very rapidly, that's a real positive business for our mission group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Brian, on this same theme too, in addition to the frac pump, over the last two years or so we've added other products that contribute to -- go into that pressure pumping phenomenon that we're seeing so much demand for. So we're -- for instance a lot of flow iron we brought in through acquisitions. We made an acquisition last year that brought us some frac-sander products that are used to transport and to move profit to locations and around locations. So those sorts of -- we've kind of quietly been building out more and more in this area to satisfy the needs of our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my follow-up kind of along with those consumable lines is really &#x2013; you mentioned artificial lift and power section business, you had some capacity expansion in the power lift -- I mean in the power section business. As you would deliver all those horizontal rigs this year and a lot of your rigs, do you see that ongoing demand increasing fairly substantially as we go through 2012? And then on artificial lift, what other areas &#x2013; what's your strong foothold right now? And what other areas of artificial lift do you think you want to expand into, either organically or through acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've &#x2013; through our Distribution and Transmission segment, we had long sold a lot of artificial lift products and it's kind of a variety of things. Mostly -- in the past, mostly we bought in those from other suppliers but here again over the last couple of years, we've been quietly building out our own products, our own kind of manufacturing capabilities. Mono within distribution manufacturers, the rotors and stators that really form the progressing cavity pumps that are used in certain artificial lift applications and it's the same design and technique that goes into downhole drilling motors and so that business sells into both of those.</p>
          <p>The strategy here is pretty straightforward with the sharp increase in number of rigs drilling for liquids. On down the road as those wells start to make water, start to lose initial reservoir energy, they're going to need to have artificial lift to lift them and so we want to be -- position ourselves to sell into that trend. Likewise, we have seen a big explosion in demand for downhole drilling motors used to drill horizontally and are the leading supplier of those kinds of motors to the industry. And so -- and it's basically the same kind of manufacturing technology. To that end, we've been expanding our manufacturing capabilities in Europe and expanding our motor reline and servicing capabilities here in North America to meet the demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Brian, I'd also add that when you talk about drilling motors today, you're really going to be using those on almost every type of well that you drill even if it's just a traditional vertical well. They add so much to your efficiency and your ability to get hydraulic horsepower to the bit and torque that it's really almost a natural part, Where in the past having a drilling motor was something unique, today, it's almost just like having drill collars on a drill bit. You're going to have that motor there and our market position in those is quite good.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys. Clay, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that the FPSO orders were slow on coming in 2011, but obviously you've been in the market marketing the concept and in particular, I guess more of a modular or kit approach as opposed to sort of the one-off and custom designs. I was wondering if you could just sort of address how that's going and maybe talk about the uptake of a more modular concept relative to what we saw in the drilling rig market in the earlier 2000's.</p>

          <p>Yeah. We're about &#x2013; we acquired APL in December 2010, so we're, what, 13 -- 12 and a half months into it. So it's still early days. We kind of also bought the business as we're seeing the effects of the financial market meltdown in 2009 sort of show up in the business. And so our sense is, right now, the whole subsea space is now just starting to kind of pull itself out of that downturn and getting serious about placing orders.</p>
          <p>We've also pointed out in the past, Michael, that the sanctioning of large subsea development projects doesn't move very quickly. You're talking about billions of dollars of expenditures for the FPSO for the subsea wellheads, for the flowlines and manifold and so getting approval within an IOC plus getting approval, usually within their partners' organizations takes a while. So this doesn't move quickly and that's no surprise to us, but as we've discussed with you and with others through 2011, our plan here really is to make this more modular and we think that that really will enhance the value to our customers.</p>
          <p>One of the big challenges that the owner-operators of FPSOs have is, after the initial contract -- they'll sign a contract to produce a field for, let's say, 10 years. The economics -- the ultimate economics on that project will often hinge on whether or not they can find a second field to move that FPSO onto after the initial contract expires out in year 2011.</p>
          <p>So what -- the sales pitch basically is to say, look, if we have a more systematic design of the turret, which is physically where the FPSO actually plugs into the field, it's going to increase potentially the number of fields of that FPSO can go into and work for -- on its second career and improve the returns to our customer.</p>
          <p>So in a nutshell, that's kind of the plan and it seems to work well. We think we're going to get some traction out there with that and hope to standardize those designs and that's a big part of our strategy. So, I'd say so far so good, but we'll know for sure once, I think, orders start to flow. And I think orders ought to start to flow this year 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was actually going to be my follow-up, I think with the subsea orders expected to ramp up this year, just in terms of timing. I would imagine construction of FPSO is a longer lead time item. So, should we see that even ahead of trees do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we're going to start to see some activity 2012 and as also referenced in my comments, we're quoting more projects now. We've got more feed studies going on. We've got a lot of people very, very interested in, in this hardware and a lot of activity. It just hasn't necessarily translated through the contracts yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, as we've said a lot of times, Michael, I mean, kind of B follows A, and you take a look at the number of deepwater rigs that we're putting out there and as I tell people, they're not drilling for practice. They're drilling, so that they can find oil and gas and the approved solution when they find it, really is going to be the FPSO mode of production. So we think that you'll probably see, certainly this year and in 2013, you'll see a greater demand for the products that we have in that regard.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. I apologize if you've answered this but I was Googling honey badger and so, I kind of was offline a little while. Let's talk backlog for a minute. I think in the third quarter your backlog came in huge, a lot bigger than most of us thought and then this quarter maybe a little bit shy of what we thought. It seems to me like that's just a lot of lumpiness. Going forward, should we expect the backlog adds we had this quarter to be more of a run rate? Or was this kind of a one-off lumpiness whereas down a little more than it would be on a run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marshall as we talk about backlog, and we've said this an awful lot, you almost have to look at backlog not necessarily on a quarterly basis but over about two or three quarters, because -- you take a look at the quarter we just came out of. Effectively, it's a nine-week quarter. You've got two weeks of Christmas, a week of Thanksgiving that you don't -- really aren't going to get much of anything done. And as we've always kind of said, it doesn't really matter to us if somebody orders something on the 30th of December or the 5th of January, but it does matter that backlog because we cut it off on the 1st of January.</p>
          <p>So I think by definition you'll see a little bit of lumpiness. You'll see some coming in a little bit better and some coming in a little bit weaker than you'd think. But when you look at it over the long term -- for instance this year, we did about $10.8 billion of new orders. And we think the coming year will also be a positive year, but I think it's very difficult for us to say it's all going to come in the first quarter or the second quarter or the third quarter. We are optimistic that it will be a positive year on new orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And that's &#x2013; and actually that's why we really encourage everybody to look at the fundamentals here. The cost of these rigs is pretty reasonable, pretty stable, you have a lot of hungry shipyards in Asia, in particular, and the day rates which will drive the returns, particularly for the deepwater assets, are the biases that they're moving up now. And so that sets up a pretty good year, we think, for 2012 orders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hard to believe it slows down if rates are going up and that's why I asked the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, second question, the distribution side; the biggest margins we've ever seen that I can remember in that business. How much of that was the Ameron versus -- being added to the mix &#x2013; versus maybe just a more sustainable distribution business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I'll let Clay give you the exact numbers on it. But I'll take this point just to say most of it is our regular distribution business. Our folks are phenomenal at this. I mean, we've got people that are out there, Marshall, and as you take a look, you can go back three or four years, we're always much better than the competition. We've got some folks that really know this business and they really deliver to our customers and they're really able to rub that buffalo off the nickel. I mean these guys are really, really good at being able to run an efficient operation. I just have to do a shout-out to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the short answer to your question is that they were all about the same; Ameron team roughly in line with our legacy businesses within the Distribution segment. Actually, they were just a shade below and then our legacy business outperformed just to shade. But if you squint, they're all about the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Clay, I don't remember margins ever being that high. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did a little over 8%, I think, few years ago but they're &#x2013; what we've seen this latest cycle since 2009 is really good sustained margins out of the group that just feel like they're more sustained and more solid than we were seeing 2006, 2007 and 2008. So just to Pete's point, outstanding execution by that team.</p>

          <p>Hello. Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask you about &#x2013; Clay, a little &#x2013; just to clarify your guidance on the Rig Tech margins. So it sounds like from what you're saying, you're kind of expecting Rig Tech margins in 2012 to be kind of flattish with 2011, a little bit lower in the first half and higher in the second half as, I guess, deliveries pick up. Is that roughly correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That is correct, Robin. And one kind of potential misunderstanding that I want to make sure we dispel is, we've guided to margins kind of drifting down in that segment. Don't expect a V-shape sort of pattern. We think mid-20%s margins is a more normalized kind of margin and the margins over the past several quarters have been slowly moving down into that range. And we've guided to bottoming mid-20%s around 25%, let's say. And then start to slowly lift out of that late 2012. So that's kind of the pattern we see over the next four quarters. And again, I'll stress margins at 25%, 26%, 27% for Rig Technology equals outstanding returns on capital. So that's a terrific margin, one that's rarely equaled by other manufacturers, both within our industry and other manufacturing businesses more broadly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So then on the top line of Rig Tech, you mentioned $6.6 billion of revenue from backlog. And then in 2011, the growth in non-backlog revenue was pretty impressive, and it increased over the quarter-by-quarter through the year, so -- kind of ending up in this mid-$500 million per quarter level. Should we expect kind of double-digit growth like you had in 2011 again in 2012 in the non-backlog portion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's a good &#x2013; year-over-year, I think that will be a good kind of range for growth for the non-backlog business. It did actually decline 4% sequentially. But we look back at last year's fourth quarter, it was down 1% sequentially. We suspect that had something to do with the holidays. When we look at that business longer term, the aftermarket business, which comprises almost all that non-backlog revenue over six years has posted compound annual growth rates north of 20% and very, very strong performance. And so, 2012, we see good growth ahead for that business as well.</p>
          <p>One thing when it comes to our overall segment revenues for Rig Technology, we had a big, big increase in revenue out of backlog in Q4, up $368 million sequentially. We do foresee that coming down Q1. And if you look back at revenue out of backlog for that segment, which is on the supplemental information we provide on our website, what you see is it's not uncommon for that business to jump and down $200 million or $300 million quarter-to-quarter. And what we saw in Q4 was a big spike up in well stimulation equipment deliveries in particular, and also land rig package deliveries, both of which are recognized on a completed contracts basis. So that completed contract's rev-rec model for Rig Technology drives a lot of volatility there. So that's kind of some of the basis for our outlook for the first quarter of 2012.</p>
