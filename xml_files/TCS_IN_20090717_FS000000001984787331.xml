          <p>Ram, Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance, followed by a Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Let me also remind you that anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation available on our website.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramadorai.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. And I'm happy to share that TCS has delivered a stellar quarter made possible by very strong operational execution.</p>
          <p>The net profit for this quarter stands at Rs.1,520 crores, an increase of 16% quarter-on-quarter and up 22% year-on-year. Driven by good execution on the ground, the operating profit at Rs.1,789 crores for this quarter shows an increase of 5% quarter-on-quarter and up 26% year-on-year. Our earnings per share is Rs.7.77, an increase of 16% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenues for this quarter are at Rs. 7,207 crores, an increase of 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter and up 12% year-on-year. Our net margins at 21.1% are 278 basis points quarter-on-quarter and up 172 basis points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The global economy across countries continues to be weak with job losses in various industries. We are watchful of the situation and we do not rule out the fact that more surprises can be expected. In times like this, I believe we have managed operations exceptionally well. Our full services play, global delivery capabilities, range of offerings, and the resulting value proposition has played out very well. It indicates our alignment to strategic intent and clearly demonstrates our single-minded focus on our customers.</p>
          <p>The overall growth has been broad-based across major and emerging markets, and the investments in people and capabilities in these markets are yielding results. We have increased our wallet share with our top 10 clients as well. Apart from the traditional sectors such as the banking, financial services, telecom, our ongoing investments in verticals like energy, utilities, pharma and healthcare are beginning to show results. This is evident from the current wins listed for this quarter and we are optimistic about these sectors spurring growth in the future as well.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we shall continue to excel operationally and work closely with customers and stakeholders and help them experience certainty.</p>
          <p>I'll request Chandra to add a few words before Mahalingam, our CFO, talks. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ram. Overall, it has been a very happy quarter because we have delivered growth and a good volume growth at that, 3.56%. And the BFS sector in particular and the U.S. geography have shown signs of stability and have given us growth.</p>
          <p>We are extremely happy with the execution. The offshore revenue has increased by 270 basis points. The gross margin is up by 20 basis points. The operating margin is up by 113 basis points.</p>
          <p>We had a good deal closure. Eight deals we closed. They're well spread out. From a market point of view, five of it came from the U.S. And from the sector point of view, two came from manufacturing and the remaining six came from each from six different verticals. So I think we couldn't be happier because when we started the quarter we were not thinking in terms of this level of volume growth for the quarter. Over to you, Maha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chandra. So as has been emphasized both by Ram and Chandra, this has been a quarter of growth in revenue and a bigger growth in margins at every level. We have lower cost in both COR and SG&amp;A, a lower forex loss, and an increase in terms of the dividend income. So overall we have delivered growth in revenue, EBITDA, operating margin, and net margin.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the top line. The impact of each of the drivers is as follows. Volume up by 3.54%, pricing down by 25 basis points, exchange movement down by 24 basis points, effort mix down by 2.56%. So totally it is 0.49%. As you know, even the negative ones are not all that negative. Offshore shift certainly of this magnitude is a huge plus from the margin perspective.</p>
          <p>On the operating margin side, the break up of 113 basis point improvement is as follows: currency, minus 41 basis points; offshore shift, positive 95 basis points; rate productivity change, negative 34 basis points; SG&amp;A efficiencies, positive 93 basis points; totaling 1.13% improvement.</p>
          <p>We treat the cost parameters using the levers that we have always talked to you about. Through onsite/offshore shift and head count management, brought down the overall employee cost by another 65 basis points this quarter. Continued scrutiny of every expense item helped us bring down the non-employee SG&amp;A cost by 101 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to currency, a topic which has an impact on our results whether we hedge or not hedge. There was currency volatility in Q1, but our policy of full foreseeable hedging continued to protect us. We did not take any new revenue hedges in Q1 and continued to write down those old hedges with limited outside participation of up to Rs. 41. Out of the total 349 million we have for FY '10, $123 million were hedges matured in Q1 and $112 million are maturing in Q2.</p>
          <p>Forex loss for the quarter was 841 million, 57% lower than the last quarter. Interest income was up 45% Q-on-Q with a yield of 7% and we also have an income of 471 million from mutual fund redemptions. All of this has resulted in the other income of positive 194 million this quarter compared to negative 1.3 billion rupees last quarter, expanding the net income margin significantly by 278 basis points Q-on-Q to 21.11%. EPS growth this quarter was 15.7%.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we brought down our DSO by another two days this quarter. Cash and liquid investments stood at 61,249 million rupees.</p>
          <p>In closing, our performance this quarter is a vindication of our approach during the downturn of continuing to invest in our business while maintaining pricing discipline and improving internal efficiencies. Customer proximity also helped us to benefit from the increased interest in offshore outsourcing while our cost management initiatives delivered margin expansion all round. And the resultant cost discipline is a sustainable one that will stand us in good stead going forward, regardless of whether those now-famous green shoots are the real thing or just weeds. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks and congratulations on a very well executed quarter. Can we get some additional details on volume growth, pricing trends maybe by vertical, maybe &#x2013; maybe by &#x2013; maybe some deeper details on that? And then, the deal pipeline, deal funding, has that improved? And then, it seems that the BFSI vertical is resurging, maybe we can talk a bit about the nature of the work in the pipeline? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the volume growth &#x2013; in terms of industries, primarily the BFS sector has shown some signs of stability and growth, and we have seen that this quarter and we hope that it will continue and hopefully there is no shocks. And other sectors which are doing well for us is retail, it is continuing to do well. Pharma, we have seen opportunities and growth opportunities volume as well as utilities. Then the three sectors which continue to worry us is manufacturing, telecom, and hi-tech, the three segments. There can be surprises. We still are watching it carefully. At this point in time, we are not confident that with any degree of certainty that they will grow or not grow.</p>
          <p>In terms of the spending, still the discretionary spending is still not up, still it is more offering related. There are some discretionary projects happening in some clients. So we have to be still watchful. We were not hopeful of this kind of a volume growth, 3.6% at the beginning of the quarter, and it got better and we were able to execute very well and capture those opportunities. So we are watching it carefully, but very difficult to say within a degree of certainty.</p>
          <p>In terms of the deal pipeline, it's good. We have closed eight deals and we are happy about it because it's well spread out. We got a deal each in retail, hi-tech, media, utilities, pharma and a couple of deals in manufacturing. So it's been a good all around wins.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I think at least we are foreseeing 20 important deals, large deals. And again the deal closures are to be carefully watched. And they are well spread out. There are deals in the U.S., there are deals in Europe, and in the emerging and developing markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally &#x2013; sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On pricing, the offshore pricing, I think we have been saying that the pricing pressure this year is going to be there. And we maintained during the last analyst call as well as during the quarter whenever we had meetings that the pricing is going to be affecting growth this year in lower single digits. We still stick to that statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then maybe just some more details on the nature of the work in financial services? Maybe break it down by banking financials and financials and insurance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the work so far has been in the banking side rather than the financial services side. Insurance I think is still affected, recovery and stability in insurance is yet to come. And banking and financial services, the nature of work, offshoring work, integration work and some BPO opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, a nice quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Katri. The next question is from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. This is actually Vincent Lin sitting for Julio. Just wanted to get a sense on the volume growth that you posted this quarter, the 3%, obviously that turns out to be better than your original expectations. Just wondering, I know that you don't provide official guidance, but looking out in terms of &#x2013; into the September quarter and in the second half of 2009, should we expect the positive volume growth to continue just given that &#x2013; it seems like pricing stability is better at least versus last quarter just in terms of the volume growth, whether you can provide some more color in terms of expectations into the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said with regard to volume we see the banking sector stability and there may be some opportunities there. On retail sector and pharma, utilities, those sectors are giving us comfort, but as I said, three sectors, manufacturing, telecom and hi-tech, including our large telecom client, are showing declines. And we don't know how they will perform in Q2. These sectors are to be watched very carefully. So at this point in time, we cannot give any degree of certainty in terms of volume growth as far as the second quarter is concerned. I think the best way to look at Q3 and Q4 would be to watch Q2 and some kind of stability to return to these sectors then we will be able to give a reasonable degree of comments on Q3 and Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's helpful. And then from a client's perspective, seems like the contribution from top clients increased pretty meaningfully over the last quarter, especially the top account. Just wondering if you can provide some specific commentary in terms of what actually drove the increase and whether that's sustainable in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the top one client, top five, and top 10 have grown this quarter. And top one client in fact has changed and that is to be expected. And we think that except the top telecom client, where we have had some issues, otherwise I think we have done reasonably well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any specific reason, just in terms of the kind of work that actually drove the increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kind of work that drove...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kind of work that drove the increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the growth has been &#x2013; the negative surprises that we had in the previous quarters have been arrested. That's the only way I would put it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, okay. And just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started to see ramp-ups in these clients, albeit small, but we started to see ramp-ups. And previously, last two quarters we have been having lot of shocks and surprises and the decline in volumes, cancellation of projects. We said that we are going to watch that carefully for three months in a row and none of that happened to these clients. That was a good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then &#x2013; and just lastly coming back to the revenue growth, and I think you've provided a lot of details in terms of the components on quarter-over-quarter basis, but just wondering on a year-over-year basis at least from last quarter if you exclude the FX impact and the acquisition from the Citi BPO, just wondering if you can give us the data in terms of year-over-year what the constant currency organic growth would look like for the June quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably Kedar can send you a mail on that. He is taking an action. We can give you those figures offline. And but basically I think business performance wise even year-on-year, even if you exclude, I think the performance has been satisfactory. But he'll give you the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Quinteros (sic) [Mr. Li]. A request to all the participants in the question queue, please limit your questions to one per participant. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from JM Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congrats on a good quarter. Chandra, you spoke about volume having surprised you from what you had thought of at the beginning of the quarter. Can you throw some color on where exactly the surprise came from? Was it a specific set of clients or just specific vertical that you saw the volume surprise come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Diviya, I want to correct you. I didn't say I was surprised. I said that we were not certain about committing a volume growth at the beginning of the quarter because of the uncertainties that prevailed in the market what other shocks can come. And the things that we said were we have to watch to make sure that three months in a row we don't get a negative surprise from any client. And we did not get any unanticipated surprises. And the BFS sector started to show some signs and we started to get some ramp-ups and back some projects. That have been good.</p>
          <p>So I basically want to clarify it has not been achieved because of one one-off positive surprise. There is no one one-off positive surprise that has brought growth. It's been a good all around performance, incremental, happening in several accounts across verticals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.  That is helpful.  And secondly, I know, I think somebody earlier also asked about this, given that we didn't have any positive surprise or one-off surprises, is it reasonable to assume that this is a definite return to positive growth rates and I know the volume decline that we saw the last quarters is behind us now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ram has emphasized it in his opening speech.  I want to reemphasize it now, I've said it.  At this point in time, we still have to be cautious because, as I said, we would like to see some stability in manufacturing, telecom and high-tech sectors.  And until then I think we'll have to be very cautious.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  I just have some bookkeeping questions.  I'll probably come for that later, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are optimistic, but be cautious.</p>

          <p>Good morning, good evening.  My question is around your hiring trends and expectations and how all the protectionist chatter in the U.S. is impacting all those moves.  I know you've been very successful in moving work offshore and improving margins, but has that slowed some of your efforts to hire local U.S. employees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as hiring is concerned, in this year what we had said is that we had given offers to the campuses totaling to about close to 24,885 and we will be honoring our commitments that we have made and they would be joining us during this particular year in a staggered manner starting from Q2 onwards.</p>
          <p>Now as far the U.S. team is concerned, we had also said that for our Cincinnati delivery center we would be hiring 250 from various campuses within U.S.  And we have already given offers to about 111. And close to 99 people have already accepted that offer, and 38 of those have already joined us in Q1 itself.  So we are on-track and we are going as per our plan.</p>
          <p>As far as the national hiring is concerned, that should go on based on very customer-specific requirements only.</p>

          <p>Hi.  Congratulations on a very nice quarter.  For the last two, three quarters, you've been maintaining that cautious approach towards the macro-environment, you've expressed your concerns with client-specific issues. And you still turned out a quarter which has been by far your best quarter in your listed history.  My question is, are we therefore looking at similar caution ahead while the macro-environment still looks not so good and we're still racing ahead with our similar growth rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See again, you're asking the question a different way.  It's very, very difficult to say the environment is still volatile and I have specifically mentioned sectors where we still would like to see a lot of stability to come and there are surprises possible.  And we have met with clients across geographies, a good number of clients across geographies of varying sizes. And it's a mixed bag.  So we have to be very, very watchful.</p>
          <p>With regard to our performance, I think we are on a path of continuing to improve the operational execution, number of initiatives which we'll continue to progress with a lot of rigor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chandra, do you notice this trend wherein during the time of crisis, BFSI was the first to hit and then followed with a lag, there was manufacturing and retail and the others.  So is it also a possibility that BFSI is the first to recover and then with a lag of manufacturing, retail and other verticals also recover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also hope like you.  But then, there are theories like U, UU, UUU, so I'm not able to say anything.  So at this point in time, I think we are just going to be cautious.  We are not going to say that a particular pattern is going to emerge.  It will be difficult.  No one has predicted it.  So it's going to be very difficult to predict.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What would you comment on Google, IBM and Intel last week?  All of them, they were seeing the trend towards a positive outlook for their future.  In light of that, aren't you benchmarking for a better next nine months every quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See we don't give guidance and our time would be to be cautious. And you've seen what we have delivered this quarter.  We have told you that we had a good deal process.  We have told you the deal pipeline is good.  But still whether the ramp-ups will happen as per plan, will there be any shocks, et cetera, it's still at this point in time unpredictable.  So we have to be still cautious is our view.  It's difficult to say anything more on that.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Maheshwari.  The next question is from the line of Priya Rohira from ENAM Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Hi.  Good evening to the management and congratulations on a very good set of numbers.  My first question relates to the comment on the fact that discretionary spend at offshore locations has seen an improvement.  Would it be possible for Chandra to highlight this more in the BFSI space?  And second is, if you could share your experience in the decision-making cycle which you're seeing currently in the large deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that I said that the discretionary spend in the offshore space has increased.  All I said was, still the discretionary spend is under pressure, the discretionary projects are sporadic.  That exactly was the word I used, sporadic.  We're seeing projects happening here and there.  Still, there is not a very systematic pattern where all customers have started to open the tap in terms of discretionary spending.</p>
          <p>In BFSI space, as I said, the opportunities are more to do with more offshoring, BPO, as well as a lot of integration work.  Some of the customers are spending money on integration work and we are well placed to capture some of those and we are capturing those. I think those are all the areas we are getting business in the business segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the decision-making cycle and the large deals, how has it changed from the last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we articulated it last quarter.  I think the same thing is continuing.  The difference between now and six months ago is that six months ago lot of things happened and people were in a state of shock, management teams were getting changed, customers were thinking how to react.  But now, everyone knows what the status is, they're all baseline, they all have money to spend on whatever they have to spend and they've cut lot of whatever they had to cut.  So the decision-making cycles are more structured and more or like similar to the times before the crisis.  But it is just that there are not too many projects on which decisions are to be made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  And just a small question from my side.  How do you see the Enterprise Solutions space shaping up more towards H2?  Do you see with improvement in certain accounts that this would see an up trend from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there will be opportunities in terms of upgrades and opportunities in terms of consolidation and single instance.  Those are the areas we are seeing opportunities in the Enterprise Solutions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hello, gentlemen.  I've got a question on Europe, which just happens to be in two parts.  The first part is on Diligenta.  I wonder if you can just bring us up to speed please as to when you hope the new consolidated Life and Pension's platform will be complete and when therefore you can start marketing it.  And secondly, a more broader view on Continental Europe in particular.  You had, I think you said eight new big deals, five are in the U.S.  I was just wondering whether any of the other big deals were in Europe and more specifically with your new clients, I think you had 26 new client adds, were any of those in Continental Europe and &#x2013; in other words are you seeing any, I don't know, increasing ability to open new business in Continental Europe?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Diligenta platform, the Russian, one of the platform has already gone live and it is operational and a portion of the policies have been migrated to the new platform.  And that platform is ready and we are already starting to take that platform to the market.  But fully the second phase which is a very critical phase, we expect it to be fully live by the end of this fiscal year, where we will have a complete set of functionality and a rich set of functionalities and the efficiencies going live.  But the &#x2013; as I said, we are already ready for taking it to the market and in fact we have started doing that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Continental Europe, yes, definitely.  One of the deals &#x2013; large deals this quarter was in Continental Europe and we do see opportunities in Continental Europe.  It has grown even this quarter because of the client wins we had in the earlier quarters.  It is a very focused market for us and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  The pricing decline that we gave is in constant currency because we remove the exchange effect first and thereafter work out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Okay.  And in terms of renegotiation on the pricing, you believe most of the renegotiation is behind?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean that is something that will continue to happen.  So a good number as in behind, but we won't rule out further renegotiations, I think that will continue we just have to carefully deal with them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be staggered over the next three quarters that is the way we will be doing that and yeah, some of them will join definitely in Q2 but majority will be in Q3 and Q4.</p>

          <p>I think the, our presence in China I think it's a very important one, but in terms of short-term, in terms of differences of numbers in short-term, pretty small.  We tend to be focused on this market but I think it will be a few more quarters before we can talk about substantial incremental revenues making a difference in the market.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'll follow-up on that offline.  Second question is in terms of; I want to get your thoughts I guess on investing in the current downturn, I mean what do you see as the key areas, the key things to invest in now to position TCS to capture growth when the macro environment rebounds?  You mentioned, you talked about investing for &#x2013; in the business, but SG&amp;A was down a little bit at least on a dollar basis quarter-over-quarter. What areas are you investing in, how should we expect to kind of see that flow through the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have thought about it and that's something that we have done quite well.  If you really look at the investments we have made in the emerging markets, it's not that just this month, last few quarters, few years we have created an excellent footprint in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of geography perspective, whether it's Latin America, whether it's parts of Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and China, these are markets in which we have invested heavily in the last few years.  When I say invested, we have done the ground work in terms of setting up the local offices, setting up the local delivery capability, recruiting local people, training them, getting the key clients, I think we have done all the hard work, I think that is something that we have to leverage and we'll continue to invest.</p>
          <p>In terms of domain, we are investing in healthcare and pharma, definitely, we are looking at government sector, and we are also creating a lot of frameworks and reusable components and products in multiple domains and we are invested in the platform BPO and the platform BPO offering is gaining a lot of traction. To date, it is still in the investment mode and we've got the pilot customers, four, five pilot customers have signed up and we expect that the economy picks up whether it is our platform in the HRO or the F&amp;A or in some of the other areas that we are investing now will all play out very, very well.</p>
          <p>And then from the Indian market point of view, we have also invested in the small and medium business.  We have been doing it for the last four quarters, that investments will pay-off as we complete the pilots and we are working with a set of pilot customers and it is going very well.  So I think there are a number of initiatives where we are investing and we are continuing to invest which are going to keep us in good stead when the economy returns.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Last thing if I could, U.S. versus Europe, I guess from a discretionary demand perspective in particular, as much as you can kind of get that granular where &#x2013; how far &#x2013; where do you think Europe is in relation to the U.S. in the cycle, and how much longer do you think it takes European spending particularly on the discretionary side to recover?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll at least answer the question in part as I can't answer it in full.  Definitely, the discretionary spend is sporadic, it is still not open right across the board.  Definitely, U.S. is ahead of the curve and Europe will definitely be behind and I cannot answer how long it will take.</p>

But last quarter, we had an additional tax debit coming from one of the overseas jurisdictions and that is why our tax rate last quarter was at 14.68% and whereas actually it was at 12.40 if I remove that extraordinary item.  So from 12.40 it has moved to 14.68% this quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And is 14.68 representative of the fiscal 10 year or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  It would be slightly &#x2013; we expect it to be &#x2013; earlier we have said that it is going to be much more than that.  But given the limited number of STPI that have gone out, we think that it is probably going to be somewhere around the 17% mark.  Not much more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Naughtin.  The next question is from the line of Yogesh Aggarwal from HSBC Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Hi.  I just have couple of questions, if I may?  Firstly, I reckon in &#x2013; next year probably will be a big upgrade cycle for the PC market after 2004 and '05.  Will that really impact your hi-tech clients and as well as overall spending on IT?  And secondly, also on the telecom market, I understand the next big upgrade cycle will probably be after 2012, whether it is  '14 U.S. or the next-generation exist in Europe.  So, in the meantime for the next couple of years do you think the spending by the telecom market will remain muted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the high-tech one, we need to wait and see, first if the economy should show some recovery or the high-tech industry to pick up. Until then, I think the high-tech industry is going to be a little bit of fluctuating is my assessment at this point, but we cannot say it with any certainty.</p>
          <p>With regard to the telco segment, I think there are opportunities in the telco segment, more in the system integration and outsourcing kind of opportunities in the developing markets.  And in the near-term, it may be fair to say that the opportunities in the established market telcos can be muted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just another one, at the risk of sounding na&#xEF;ve, how different is the continental European market compared to the Japanese market, because I believe the culture and the language issues are almost the same, how would the traction in continental Europe be much better than in Japan?  And thanks for the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the continental Europe is much more ahead in the maturity curve of off-shoring than the Japan, much more ahead.  And we have lot of proof points and we have many clients, a good number of clients doing work in India, doing work with us.  There are multiple scale of clients, different service offerings.  And so I think they're not comparable. I think definitely continental Europe is much ahead.  And it's just that the some of the labor laws on restructuring makes it a little difficult for our clients to pursue off-shoring with more vigor in continental Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you, gentlemen.</p>

          <p>Thank you Mr. Aggarwal.  The next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congratulations on a good set of numbers.  I had one question in terms of our domestic business which seems to have grown pretty well this quarter contributing almost 35% of our incremental growth, within what verticals would our growth have come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Particularly domestic business growth comes from government, as well as the banking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And another thing in terms of margins, we have seen almost a 160 crore decline over the last two quarters in our employee costs, do we see further possibilities of either cost rationalizations there or actually employee rationalizations there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is I think primary reduction you see in that, expense is due to a significant push in the off-shoring drive considering that we have achieved last three quarters a significant movement, I think to expect that level of movement is unrealistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, so you've got to give us some...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more thing, in terms of our involuntary attrition, what was the number this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Involuntary attrition is something that goes on throughout the year based on the performance, and it is not something that happens on a quarterly basis.  And, as we said last time, it's close to about 1000, 1100 in a year.  So, that's a very insignificant number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, this is Vihang.  I just had another question.  I heard you mention that your top client has changed in the current quarter.  Did I get this right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you got it right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, could you, just for the sake of comparison, give us the contributions from this particular client in 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't give it in the call now.  It is very marginal. I think I would say that 4Q to now will be a few single digit basis point difference.  This quarter will be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That there won't be much of a difference in 4Q and 1Q, you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, to growth, but it is growth in terms of a few crores, a few basis points.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from the line of Tarun Sisodia from AnandRathi Financial Services.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  My first question is regarding the actual performance versus at the end of fourth quarter, if you had given kind of guidance, or do you have some final estimation, how would you rate this performance versus your expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have already said that we couldn't have been happier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, secondly, related to the clients.  You have a lot of clients which were affected by a lot of these economic downturn conditions, both in transportation as well as in BFSI segment.  Are you seeing some budget traction in those sets of clients to which you had exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the BFSI sector, some of the clients are showing better recovery, but, some sort of stability, still not recovery.  In terms of manufacturing and other sectors, still there are concerns.  We still can't say with any degree of certainty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as regards to the new client involvement and given the existing trend when you are going for new projects, what kind of reactions &#x2013; are they more inclined now compared to say four months back, receptive, or whichever way you want to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Especially, if there is an opportunity, yes, they are more receptive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you would think in time, over the last four months, things have turned a bit more positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe in specific situations.  Overall, we cannot give a very comforting confident answer on that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes it's positive, otherwise it is negative, it varies.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Sisodia.  The next question is from the line of Dipen Shah from Kotak Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, congrats to the team on a very good set of numbers.  Most of the questions have been answered.  Just one bookkeeping question, can we have some breakup in terms of utilization of on-site and off-shore employees? And &#x2013; yeah, that's the basic question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, overall, the utilization excluding trainees is 79.2%, and the utilization including trainees is at 71.3%.  So, these are the two utilization numbers that we have been giving all along.  These are the numbers as of this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah.  The next question is from the line of Pinku Pappan from Nomura.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my question.  Just two follow-up questions actually.  On the India business, do you expect the growth to continue strongly in the next three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, the India business, we have always said will be volatile, because we don't have any contracts of any substantial size in the India market or the Asia market or emerging markets.  We still have a significant amount of project work.  So, India business in general will be volatile, and we should be prepared for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Could you tell me the constant currency growth in U.S. quarter-on-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Constant currency growth...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In the U.S. market...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not &#x2013; we are releasing that number.  So, I can't give you right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And, just the last question.  On compensation, have you changed anything, I mean, for the rest of the year, and about promotions and pay hikes, could you just elaborate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as compensation is concerned, we'd announced that there will be no increments, and we are sticking to that as far as this year is concerned.  Promotions is something, yes, that we will be going ahead with.  That is what we have announced.  For this year, we will be going ahead with the promotions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the variable pay that we are paying in full for this particular quarter.  So, these are the announcement that we made today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to answer your previous question, it was 1.5% increase in constant currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>1.5%, right?  Okay.   One final question, so were you saying earlier that you have reached the limit on the off-shoring, on the off-shore revenue mix, it's gone up 50.4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I was not saying any limit or anything.  All I was saying is that don't factor in such a pace, because the pace with which we have increased the off-shore movement over the last three quarters has been pretty high.  So, that is a pace that we cannot sustain.  As a principle, that's a core to our business model.  We will continue to focus on off-shore movement, continue to leverage our global delivery capability to ensure that the clients get the best value, and we execute extremely well.  But, you should not anticipate that okay because we moved 270 basis points that it's going to be repeated.  I was just setting the expectation for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I'll ask you one housekeeping question.  Equipment and software licenses, is it a one-off thing this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's also connected with some of the system integration projects and the India business that we do.  It will be volatile. Yes, it has gone up slightly this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Yeah, thanks a lot, and congrats on a great quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maha, I heard you talk about tax rates.  Am I correct in saying that 17% is the tax rate you are looking for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this year, I think, yeah, that's the rate that we are looking for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And why would this increase in tax rate come about, any specifics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is really in terms of expansion in some of these &#x2013; any of these non-HCPA, I mean HCPA units which have come out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is your outlook for FY '11 if I might preempt that?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, as I've said, it will be about 17%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>17, 18%.  All right, all right.  And, Ajoy, just one question.  You mentioned that fresher additions would probably come in bunched up in the second half.  So, could you give us a sense of what kind of gross additions you are looking at in 2Q from the fresher aspect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as 2Q is concerned, what I said was some of the freshers that we had offered, they would be joining in this particular quarter, and the lateral hiring that we would be doing will be very much controlled and would be customer specific as far as this quarter is concerned. And the remaining freshers would join in Q3 and Q4 staggered...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Any number that you can give us on the fresher additions planned next quarter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage, I will say somewhere around 800 to 1,000 is the number that we are looking at as far as Q2 is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.  And lastly, on the variable salary for &#x2013; when you said this quarter we're paying out the full variable, it means the 2Q, right, not for 1Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is, no, it is for 1Q performance.  As you know, we give the variable in two components.  One is monthly, and the other one is based on overall company's performance, that is the quarterly component.  So what I mean is, the quarterly component is being paid out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 1Q numbers that you see already includes the variable pay that we make to the employees.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  In terms of some of the travel verticals which you mentioned, these three verticals like telecom, manufacturing and the hi-tech for the last three quarters has been declining sequentially.  So what you are indicating is whether the bottom has been reached or no the bottom may not be reached and there is a possibility of further decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Yes, yes, you are interpreting me correctly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the sense bottom has reached?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I can't say whether the bottom has reached or not.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Yeah.  At this point, we are uncertain.  We can't say.  We are watching it carefully.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No.  I made it in my opening remarks saying that the environment has to be watched closely and please don't give up &#x2013; I mean there can be surprises.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah.  The next question is from the line of Anurag Purohit of Religare.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening gentlemen and congratulation on good numbers.  If you look at the number of active clients has declined quarter-on-quarter in this quarter despite 26 new clients adding into the company.  And also, the revenue growth from your best of the Top 10 clients has been returning this quarter.  If you combine these two, could you elaborate more on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think nothing much to read into the declining in these number of active clients primarily because some of the projects &#x2013; some of the clients we do are clients for single projects.  And when those projects are over, then they cease to be a client because there won't be any revenues from them.  And what typically happens is that when the company spend discretionary funding in terms of projects even if some clients goes or new clients come.  So one-off project clients, there can be a decline.  So I don't think &#x2013; it's a phase and I don't think that anything to be read.  We have not lost any of our N80 clients, we have not lost any of the clients who give us a comfortable business.  So nothing to read.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the top clients, I think the metric is pretty good.  Top 1 clients, the group of Top 5, the group of Top 10 all have grown which is a very good indication in this market because that's where you see surprises, that's where we can sense stability.  So we see stability in most of those clients and that's a good news actually.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And also, would it be fair enough to assume that the utilization including trainees would further go down in coming quarters as trainees come into the system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depends on the volume growth.  But we will factor in a slight decline, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Thank you, and all the best.</p>

          <p>Thank you Mr. Purohit.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will be taking one last question from the line of Shradha Agarwal from BNK Securities.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, sir.  Good evening.  I mean, in the previous two, three months, the TCS management has found it confident of maintaining organic revenue for FY10.  So does that confidence still hold or do you see some positive or negative surprises coming over in the remaining quarters of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, well, we don't give guidance first of all.  But we've been saying that we are looking to see a flat year organically and that's what we are looking at at this point in time.  But nothing more qualified comments can be added.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sir.  That will be helpful.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Agarwal.  I would now like to hand the floor back to Mr. Shirali for closing comments.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you everyone for participating in this call.  Like I said in the beginning, it has been an exceptionally good quarter in terms of performance across all parameters, and it has come out of operational excellence and efficiencies that have been brought out, focus on the customers and the caution which I expressed with regard to watchful of the situation, and the fact that one would not rule out some surprises.  But overall, I think the investments we have made for the future and the kind of domain competencies we are building should play out well in the long run.  Thank you.</p>
