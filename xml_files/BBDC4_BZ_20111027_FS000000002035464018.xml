        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this conference call. Despite the concerns of the financial environment, which has increased every day, and the fact that we are not totally immune to a global economic slowdown, it's clear that Brazil is currently much better prepared for an adverse global scenario than it was three years ago.</p>
          <p>We have already seen a moderation in the pace of domestic growth mainly due to the introduction of the monetary and macro prudential measures. However, we believe that demand generated by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (2:49) job market without any signs of excessive household investments will allow a continuation of the internal economic growth. Thanks to the scenario, Bradesco remains confident in the expansion of its business, aiming to implement initiatives that generate sustainable growth and add value to society.</p>
          <p>I'll begin with the highlights for the period on slide two. I would particularly like to emphasize our year-to-date adjusted net income, which totaled more R$1.4 billion, 18.4% up on the first nine months of the last year. Our total assets, which exceed R$722 billion, and our expanded loan portfolio which increased by 22% in the last nine months which is R$332 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide three, I'd like to draw your attention to our assets under management, which closed September last September at R$973 billion, 16.1% more than at the end of September last year. And the delinquency ratio which stood at 3.8% remaining stable in the 12-month comparison.</p>
          <p>On slide four, we show the consolidation between book net income and adjusted net income. This quarter, we reversed provisions for tax contingency in the total amount of R$2,126 million, which was absorbed by the increase of our additional provision for loan losses in the amount of R$1 billion and by addition of R$500 million to the provision for labor claims following improvements to its calculation method and of R$280 million to the provision for civil contingencies of R$110 million of which went to contingencies for economic plans.</p>
          <p>After adjusting for this event, our book net income for the quarter increased from <mark type="ph" /> R$2,815 million (5:08) to an adjusted R$2,864 million in the quarter, while year-to-date net income increased from R$8.3 billion to R$L8.4 billion. Also on this slide, I'd like to emphasize our return on average equity which came to around 23% in terms of both book net income and adjusted net income.</p>
          <p>Slide number five, the third quarter improvement in our net income was mainly due to the increase in net interest income, reflecting the higher business volume and increased fee income, partially offset by the increase in personnel expenses arising from the collective bargaining agreement and the administrative expense primarily due to organic growth as well as high provision for loan losses basically due to the increased volume of loans operations and a slight rise in delinquency as we shall see later on.</p>
          <p>In the year-to-date comparison, adjusted net income grew by R$1.3 billion or 18.4%, reflecting the increase in the net interest income, highest income, and increased revenues from our insurance group, partially offset by the increase in personnel and administrative expense.</p>
          <p>Slide six, this slide shows our efficiency ratios. The blue line shows our efficiency ratio adjusted to risk, which increased by 20 basis points in the quarter, which is 52.4%, and fell by 90 basis points over the third quarter of 2010. The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:03) reduction was due to reduced provisions.</p>
          <p>The 12-month ratio, the red line, remained flat in the recent quarters, despite the growth in the number of service points and the consequent expansion of the work force.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned several times, the maintenance of our efficiency ratio at the current levels despite a strong organic growth, the improvements to our segmentation which also absorbed substantial investment and the progress of our IT projects could be considered satisfactory.</p>
          <p>We believe we will be able to maintain these indicators at our present levels in the short-term. But it should improve in the mid-term &#x2013; mid and long-term with the maturation of all these investments and the operational gains we expect to turn to on our new system architecture.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, as we have seen, our total assets came to R$722 billion, a growth of R$110 billion or 80% over September 2010. Our return on average assets remain flat at 1.7%, while adjusted return on average equity stood at 22.4%. The Basel ratio closed the third quarter at 14.7%, remaining flat over the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide eight, this slide shows the relative share of our main operations in the net income. This quarter, the increase in the share of securities activities was basically due to higher trading gains. In the year-to-date terms, the higher share of funding was mainly due to the increase in business volume, the improved funding mix which generated operating gains and, obviously, the increase in interest rates during the period. I'd also like to emphasize the important contribution of our insurance segment which accounted for 28% of our net income in the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide nine, unrealized gains have been at high levels. The quarterly variation was basically due to devaluation of our equities caused by market volatility in the period, partially offset by the appreciation of some of our investments, especially in Cielo and OdontoPrev. Once again, I'd like to remind you that these figures do not include the potential goodwill from our own properties in the total amount of R$3 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide ten, on this slide, I would like to highlight the consistent evolution of our net interest income from both non-interest and interest-earnings operations which grew by 21% in the nine-month comparison and 8% in the quarterly comparison. The performance of the interest-earning portion was mainly due to the increase in average business volume, especially in the loan and funding portfolios during the last quarter. The improvement in the non-interest portion was especially due to higher trading income.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, net interest income increased by 5.5% in the quarter mainly through the higher volume of business. As a result, the analyzed net interest margin remained flat over the previous quarter at 7.6%. We expect that the reductions in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:48) rate, base rate, which began last August, will have very little impact on the net interest income in the short-term, given that the reduction in revenue from investment in our working capital will be offset by the accrual of additional gains in our securities portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 &#x2013; that gives the breakdown of our net interest income in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparison. The biggest increase came from funding activities due to, as I mentioned before, the higher business volume and the increase in average spread primarily caused by the improved funding mix. In the nine-month period, insurance operation recorded a growth of 36.4%, also due to a higher business volume and the increase in average <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:40).</p>
          <p>Slide 13, this quarter, gross interest income from loans, the great part of this business line, increased by 5.8% to R$6,928 billion, again, sustained by the higher business volume. The red area shows the provisions for loan losses which account for 40.1% of gross interest income, reflecting the slight increase in delinquency.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, this slide shows our total expanded loan portfolio which closed September 2011 at R$332 billion, 3.90% up in the quarter and 22% up on the same period last year. This improvement was mainly due to the increase in loans to micro business and SMEs, which moved up by around 6% in the quarter and 26% in the last 12 months, and the loans to large corporates which grew by around 4% in the quarter and 27% in the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>In the year-on-year comparison, the corporate portfolio highlights were <mark type="ph" /> foreign loans (13:00) partially due to depreciation of the dollar, mortgage loans and other capital market related operations with loan risk comprised of debentures and other securities.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, this quarter, our total delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days went up by 10 basis points over the previous three months, reaching 3.8%, mainly due to the increased delinquency ratio on loans to individuals, partially explained by the change in the criterion for registering delinquency on credit cards operation. We can talk to the &#x2013; further about the matter later. Given the behavior of the short-term delinquency, we expect this ratio to remain stable in the coming quarter or even record a slight reduction by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, this slide shows delinquency ratio for loans overdue between 50 and 90 days in comparison with the market. As you can see, our short-term delinquency has remained more stable in the second half of the year as we had pointed out on the previous occasions.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that for comparison purposes with the figures disclosed by the Central Bank, the figures on this slide refer to the same portfolios used in the Central Bank calculations and, therefore, do not reflect the delinquency of our entire loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, this slide shows delinquency ratio for loans overdue between 61 and 90 days which has remained stable. It may also indicate the stability for delinquency for loans overdue by more than 90 days.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, in response to a recently raised question regarding the possible effects of an increase in the level of the renegotiated loans on delinquency ratios, on this slide we present comparative historical series, showing the evolution of our loan portfolio and delinquency for loans overdue by more than 90 days, with end result, the renegotiation portfolio.</p>
          <p>An examination of these figures clearly shows the <mark type="ph" /> low and stable representativeness (15:30) of the renegotiation portfolio in relation to the total loan portfolio, around 3.2%; and two, that delinquency with end result the renegotiation portfolio has similar trends, showing that the renegotiation portfolio has no effect whatsoever on the delinquency curve.</p>
          <p>Looking specifically now at slide 19 &#x2013; sorry, looking specifically now at the renegotiation portfolio, we can see on this slide that its associated delinquency has remained stable and that our provisioning levels has also remained stable and high, at 62.3%, for a delinquency rate of 24.8% in September 2011. In other words, for each R$1 of delinquency in this portfolio, again, more than 90 days, we had R$2.50 in provisions. And this ratio has remained fairly stable in the last three years.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, this slide highlights our high provisioning levels, which were further strengthened this quarter when we constituted an additional R$1 billion in provision for loan losses to cover any greater deterioration in the global economic scenario and the possible impact on our economy. It's really important to emphasize that this is not our working scenario for the coming months, as we do not believe there will be further deterioration in our delinquency ratios. However, we believe it's important to increase our provision in caution in times of greater uncertainty.</p>
          <p>As a result, we had a surplus of R$4 billion in relation to the amount required by the Central Bank, or R$9.5 billion in relation to expected gross losses in the next 12 months &#x2013; the dotted part of the blue line &#x2013; or even R$12.3 billion in relation to expected losses, net of recoveries &#x2013; the dotted part of the purple line &#x2013; also for the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, reflecting our reinforced provisioning this quarter, our coverage ratio has recovered and now represent 194% of the credits overdue by more than 90 days, and around 160% of the credits overdue by more than 60 days, one of the highest levels among Brazilian banks.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, third quarter fee income moved up by 3.3% over the previous quarter, to around R$3.9 billion, mainly due to higher revenues from consortiums, with 7.8%, asset management with 6.8%, and cards with 5.1%, reflecting the higher volume of operations and expansion of the client base.</p>
          <p>In the nine-month comparison, fee income grew by 13.6%, mainly due to higher revenues from consortiums, 24%; credit cards with 21%; and check accounting orders around 19%, basically due to the increase in our client and card base, which helped mitigate the low growth of capital market related fees and fees dependent upon the behavior of the stock markets, such as underwriting, brokerage and asset management fees.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, operating expense increased by 8.7% in the third quarter, mainly due to the impact of the collective bargaining agreement and increase in the number of service points, especially the opening of 271 branches, and the net addition of more than 3,000 employees in the period.</p>
          <p>In the nine-month comparison, the increase in personnel expenses was primarily due to the 2010 and 2011 collective bargaining agreement, together with the expansion of the workforce, with a net addition of more than 9000 employees in the last 12 months. It's always very important to emphasize that expansion of our workforce is concentrated in our sales force, related to both organic growth and improved segmentation.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, to give a better idea of the behavior of our operating expense, on this slide, we have broken down the impact of our organic growth. As you can see, if these impacts were excluded, administrative and personnel expenses would have increased by 14.7% over the same period last year, levels which we consider consistent with the development of our business during the period.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, administrative expense moved up by 7.1% in the quarter and 17.5% in the nine-month period, driven by higher variable expenses related to products placement, for example, cards and direct consumer credits; and the revenues, for example, no bank correspondent, as well as expenses directly related to organic growth. We believe these increases are compatible with the growth of our Service network, which expanded by around 10,000 units and 35 service points in the last 12 months, including 447 branches.</p>
          <p>Slide 26, this slide shows income from our insurance segment, which fell by 6.3% over the second quarter, primarily impacted by the exceptionally strong growth of the pension plan segment in the previous quarter. In the nine-month comparison, however, there was an increase of 20.4%, led by the saving bonds, health, life and pension plans segment.</p>
          <p>Third quarter net income from our insurance segment totaled R$780 million, very close to the previous three months. In the nine-month comparison, the 10.2% improvement was basically due to the 20.4% increase in revenues, by the reduction in the claims ratios, and the improved financial position.</p>
          <p>Slide 27, this slide shows some of the main figures from our insurance activities. The combined ratio recorded 86.2% in the third quarter, 40 basis points higher than the previous three months, essentially due to reduced revenues from life insurance and pension plans products, partially offset by higher revenues from the saving bonds and health segment, and a reduction in the claims ratios. The financial assets totaled R$107.2 billion, while technical provisions stood at R$97.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, this slide shows our economical departments &#x2013; GDP, interest rates, inflation and exchange rate estimates for 2011 and 2012, considering the current scenario of inflationary pressure and devaluation of the real. Despite the reduction in the expected economic growth, we believe this scenario is still highly favorable for the development of our business in regard to both financial and insurance activities.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, this slide shows our guidance for 2011. Even though we are very close to the end of the year, we believe it's important to revise our guidance for operating expenses, given the strong second half acceleration of our organic growth process as we prepare for two important projects that's off the next year.</p>
          <p>The first one refers to the non-renewal of our contracts with the postal service which as a result will prevent us from using this distribution channel and require the opening of new points, owned and third-party points in order to maintain high quality customer service. And the second one, to the acquisition of Banco do Estado do Rio de Janeiro through which we are acquiring the right to pay civil servants in the State of Rio de Janeiro and should bring us around 450,000 new client, equivalent to one-third of our affluent client base in that state. So we shall certainly have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:17) network.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we believe we will close the year with slightly higher fee income than originally estimated and have also revised our guidance to growth of between 10% to 14%.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, despite the heavy investment in organic growth, which has certainly put additional pressure on our operating expenses, we have experienced another quarter of good results and have further strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our provisioning levels.</p>
          <p>Our figures are continuing to move up at a steady pace despite a slight upturn in the delinquency ratio this quarter. And our indicators have remained within our strategic parameters, both of which on a solid and sustainable basis.</p>
          <p>Our investment in infrastructure, technology and people generates singular, high quality products and service which are available through our extensive network. Despite the current domestic and global economic challenges, our long-term vision of Brazil remains positive based on upward social mobility which will continue to increase demand for banking and insurance products.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention so far and we are now available for answering any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes with Mr. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions, if I may. The first one is, I appreciate you're trying to strengthen your balance sheet by creating additional provisions with a R$2 billion tax reversal rather than just booking it as a profit. But given that you already have significant reserves for loan losses, with a coverage close to 200% on realized gains of close to R$9 billion, as you mentioned in the presentation, I wanted to understand the thinking behind creating provisions rather than booking profits and paying higher dividend, which I'm sure your shareholders would appreciate. Can you walk us through the decision on why you created the provisions, under what scenario you think it's prudent to add R$1 billion to your provisions for loan losses, and how likely is this scenario to play out? Also why exactly do you need R$500 million in provisions for labor, what exactly are those and why are they needed now? So I'll give you a chance to answer my first question before asking the second one. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jorge, we don't have our basic scenario for global economy, a scenario where Europe will continue to grow in a lower pace. We're not seeing another, let's say, stress &#x2013; big stress, but it will continue to grow in a lower pace. And we have a slowdown in China economy, right, in the soft lending in China. But you cannot discard if you have another stress in the economy. That's why we are &#x2013; we understand it's important when you have conditions to strengthening your balance sheet if you have condition to do so.</p>
          <p>Again, it's not our current scenario. Our current scenario is for delinquencies continuing relatively stable. But in an environment where you have a lot of challenges to face, it's important when you have condition to do so. It's our way to think in the way.</p>
          <p>Specifically about &#x2013; we already talked about delinquency provision, okay, but I'll talk the R$500 million in provision for labor costs. We make revise our method of calculation. We use in &#x2013; we make this based on some &#x2013; using statistically with the model, we make some improvement. I don't know it specifically. I'd say, maybe we raise the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:10) average that we have in capacity. We make some increase like this. It demands that you reverse provision for R$400 million <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:20). The second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. I didn't understand the last part. So why do you need the labor provision now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Labor provision, no, it's a discussion with the labors that we have &#x2013; we have plans for the &#x2013; we have a lot of discussion with employees that we have <mark type="ph" /> find (30:50) the best. So we have &#x2013; you see, the number has been increasing in the past. We have increased our number of labor workforce. You can see that we grew more than 10% period. So it's important &#x2013; we have seen that the numbers have been growing. So that's why it's important to emphasize &#x2013; to reinforce this now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so &#x2013; thanks. My second question is, you mentioned that lower SELIC rates are not going to have an impact on your margins, but you said you &#x2013; they're not going to have a significant impact on your margins in the short-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you help us understand more in detail what the expectation is for both short-term and long-term, what is short-term for you? Are we talking about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:41)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What impact do you think the decline in SELIC is going to have a year from today? Looking at your disclosure in US GAAP where you provide a very deep repricing of the balance sheet, it seems that the bank is asset sensitive beginning nine months after the re-pricing, so we would expect margins to come down as a result of lower SELIC rates. So you are forecasting SELIC to about 4.5% to 10% which is a very significant and rapid decline. So how many basis points you think you're going to see in the short-term, how many in the long-term? Just a little bit more detail would be appreciated? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Expectation for SELIC is continuing to grow on a pace like 50 basis points in the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:33) to reach something close to 10% <mark type="ph" /> which is the percentage (32:38), while we said that in the short-term we don't see a big impact in the margin because we had two effects. One of them, we have a reduction in the gains that we have in our working capital. You know that we invested this basically in SELIC. <mark type="ph" /> One thing (33:02) if you have 12% or I think you have 10% SELIC. And then average, it will be lower, the next 12 months that it has been the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>But it had a positive impact. It's depending &#x2013; the situation that you are &#x2013; when you think about in the fixed portfolio. Depending on the moment, if you have this movement in reduction, you have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:35). Fortunately, we were in a position when they have this movement reduction in the long-term interest rate, the future interest rate in the SELIC in a position that we don't have all the portfolio &#x2013; fixed portfolio hedged. So we have in that portfolio, again, extra gain, let's say, when you compare with new environment of the cost of funding. That will provide us good revenues. That would be enough to replace the reduction in the gain in the working capital. That's what I say. When you say short-term, we understand this is enough for, say, something close to 12 months <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:24), like in the long-term as we understand that we have a structural change when we think about reduced interest rate in Brazil. If we observe what we have in the last ten years, the last five years, so certainly it's positive. We understand it's positive. Maybe you can reduce on the net interest margin, but for the net interest income for the bank, it's positive. We will have space to grow more volumes and to reduce delinquencies. So I think it's natural to think <mark type="ph" /> of us (34:53).</p>

          <p>So how is the answer you are providing right now different to the disclosure you have? I'm looking right now at the disclosure on the 20-F which does include derivative positions. And it says you're asset sensitive after 91 days. And also actually in your Brazilian GAAP disclosure, the same is true. You're asset sensitive and it also includes derivatives. So I'm not understanding why your asset liability disclosures says you're asset sensitive and yet you're going to have a declining margin. I'm sorry.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I also have a couple of questions. First, I want to talk about the &#x2013; on a broad level about the outlook for 2012. You have a real GDP growth forecast of 3.7%. But as you've noted, there are some risks to the base case and maybe more risk to the base case now than previously. In an environment where growth is slower, perhaps low single-digit kind of real GDP growth, how does your outlook for 2012 change in terms of credit growth? Does your view on delinquency rates change? And just more broadly, speaking especially given that you are in growth mode and expense growth should continue to be elevated next year, how difficult will it for you to be sustained sort of at 22% ROE and low double-digit earnings growth in an environment where growth is slower than what you have in your base case scenario?</p>
          <p>Second question is on Basel III, can you walk us through what the impact will be? I don't know if you have the specific numbers, but, obviously, the deferred tax assets are going to be an impact. But for you, the insurance &#x2013; the treatment of capital for your insurance businesses could be pretty significant. Can you walk us through kind of what you think the impact would be and whether you feel comfortable with your current capital position in light of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with the first one. You see that our expectation in the GDP 2012 is 3.7%. Your question, okay, how sensitive that you can have in terms of credit growth and the delinquency for this environment situation. I'd say that we understand, if your economy is growing less than 3.7%, but because the global effect in our growth &#x2013; if your internal demand is continuing to grow in the level that we have, I don't think the big impact in our &#x2013; our numbers will have a big impact. It depends on how is &#x2013; let's say, the share of this growth will depend on how is the driver of this growth. If the demand &#x2013; internal demand continued to be strong that we understand it will continue to be because the environment for an employing rate and for increased salaries in Brazil will continue to be present in 2012. Of course, we have other inflation pressure in this environment, yes. But I don't think we see too many risk in this field for our economy. We can have, at the end, a reduction in GDP, more driven by a global &#x2013; a more difficult global environment. So in this respect, I don't think to be significantly &#x2013; we have a significant impact in this sense.</p>
          <p>We don't have a guidance for 2012 in terms of credit growth, but we can imagine something close to 15% of growth is not a big challenge, you understand. If you assume that your economy is going to be growing something close to 10% in nominal terms, one includes around 3% to 4% the GDP and the inflation around 5% to 6%, so it's not a big challenge, you understand, of growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of delinquency, we can have some improvement if you assume that the interest rate will continue to be in the lower pace. So I don't think it's a big significant improvement but you can have some expect some improvement <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:57).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One follow-up on that because it's a question I'm sure you get, we get often. If unemployment does pick up, even if it doesn't spike considerably, if it goes from historically low 6% to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>7%, 7.5% which is still low by historical standards, but it's an uptick from where we are. Now, you mentioned that it's a slowdown that's externally driven. It's one thing. But if it's internally, if there's a drop-off in internal demand, it's another. And it's an area where employment goes up 100, 150 basis points. Is that a scenario that would worry you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, our scenario is, we have, even in 2012, a marginal improvement in the unemployment rate, right? Of course, if you have different environment, the situation is completely different. You'll talk about another type of economy, like we are talking about &#x2013; you are not seeing our economy growing in negative base, for example. We can expect to grow lower than we had in mind before. But in this environment, we don't see the pressure in the unemployment rate in our point of view, right?</p>
          <p>In terms of Basel III, we know that we have a lot of things to understand, we have to be clear &#x2013; things to be clear for Central Bank of Brazil, just telling us that they are about to present what is the plan to &#x2013; the way that they plan to implement, they are about to send something to discuss about that. But you know that we have two challenges in Brazil to implementation of Basel III. One of them is in terms of tax spread, the rate of the tax spread in the capital. I think they are planning to put more pressure on this side. And the other one is the way that you see the insurance business. We don't have yet the total impact because, again, we need to see exactly the way that you implement.</p>
          <p>But we truly believe that we have some implementation, in terms of capital requirement in insurance business also, like they called Solvency II implementation. But we understand &#x2013; but for the biggest part of the required capital for insurance, we have a part of that in terms of provisions. So, again, we need to see exactly the way that it will be implemented, okay? We make some exercise that we &#x2013; probably the weight of insurance in our capital would demand us for something close to R$6 billion in new capital, in a consolidated basis. But, again, it's too early to see that it's good or not to see the rate, we need to expect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We need to see exactly. But, assuming that the way that we see that we have, in terms in terms of provision in insurance, we are stronger in provision if you compare in terms of market. We understand that we don't have that big a challenge, to adapt to that. But, again, it's important to see.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Following up on capital adequacy. It looks like &#x2013; even though the overall capital ratio remains the same, but there seems to be a big reduction in the Tier 1. Can you walk us through what's happened here? Is this the introduction of the higher capital weighting on consumer credit that's feeding through? And what happened with the Tier 2? Was there an issue there, that you did in Tier 2 capital, to bolster that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; in fact, we have &#x2013; remember that macro prudential that was implemented the end of last year, that require more capital for consumer lending and for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:40) loans, all right? The effects will start to have &#x2013; the effects of that measure started in July of this year. So <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:49) this impact. I think it explains more the reduction in Tier 1, right?</p>
          <p>In terms of Tier 2, we don't think we have more pressure in the same sense. I think what's implemented is &#x2013; we have this effect now. We don't expect to have a big impact for this thing. In terms of Tier 2, in fact, we have just renewed a part of subordinate debt that we have in Brazilian &#x2013; in Brazil &#x2013; inside Brazil, not outside Brazil. We renewed some of them. We replaced some. We have some that we have one year of maturity, and we asked the Central Bank the possibility to replace this for another <mark type="ph" /> up of (46:37) six years, for example. So basically, we make this &#x2013; we replaced this subordinate debt. When you see the total subordinate debt that we have, we didn't see a big growth there, in fact, because we have this &#x2013; we just make &#x2013; we increased the tenure of subordinated debt that we have.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just one quick follow-up, if I may, on costs and OpEx looking forward. I think kind of the guidance remains very much that there'll still be an inflation plus effect next year and probably still be double-digit growth in OpEx for 2012 and then a slowdown in 2013, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is our expectation, because 2012 certainly will be a year where we have a consolidation of this movement that we are doing in organic growth. We don't expect &#x2013; still we have some movement in organic growth in the next year, because we're in a process of &#x2013; to opening new branches, so we will continue. But we don't see &#x2013; we are not expect to continue this huge movement, the big movement, right? But we still have the effect of this growth that we have this year in the next year. In other words, our costs in December this year is much higher than it was in January this year. So if you just make this carryover of this process, we already have commitment of growth in the expenses next year. So you would say that it's a little bit higher of inflation <mark type="ph" /> in the year (48:30) maybe. Again, we don't have guidance yet. We need to see that. But it will be &#x2013; we <mark type="ph" /> may have (48:40) something lower that we have this year, but still we have some pressure in costs for next year. In 2013, we expect not to have the same pressure of costs, because we don't see this move &#x2013; the big movement that we have <mark type="ph" /> already (48:52).</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I'll try and keep my questions brief. Firstly, on spreads, we saw lending spreads of individuals continue to increase for the system in September, according to Central Bank data. Can you tell us at Bradesco, excluding the impact of mix, are we seeing spreads increase in lending to individuals and companies? So trying to exclude the impact of changing mix, what does that look like? And secondly, on the issue of your branch expansion strategy, you talked a bit about growing your branch network by 271 branches in the quarter. Can you give us an update there and what you're thinking and the sensitivity of that strategy if growth gets a lot slower going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The spreads, we are trying &#x2013; we are &#x2013; keeping the &#x2013; or try to keep the spreads in high level and we have been able to keep that, in both individuals and the corporate segments. But, of course, as you mentioned, we have the effect of the mix. We are going more in portfolios with lower spreads. So we'll have this impact <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:30). But, line by line, we are seeing it's not a big movement of the growth in spreads, but we are growing a little bit, and we have expectation of &#x2013; to continue this way.</p>
          <p>In terms of branches, we opened 271 branches this quarter. Biggest part of them was involving in the projects for the postal service &#x2013; to replace the postal service some place, right? These are small branches. The biggest part of that is small branch, with small number of employees in these branches. It's not comparable. So to have an idea, these kind of branches, in terms of investment, represents close, in an average, R$200,000, while in the common branch, we invest close to R$1.3 million, so to have an idea what we see.</p>
          <p>And in terms of number of employee, in our normal branches, we have, in an average, something close to nine employees, while in these branches we have an average something between two to three employees. So it's small branches, the biggest part of this movement, but we will continue to have some movement in Rio de Janeiro, to reinforce our network in that state. In this case, it should be normal, normal branches <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:04) average branch that we have. So we have this impact.</p>
          <p>In terms for next year, we don't &#x2013; we will continue to have just to post the new branch that we start during this year, that we will not be able to finish during this year, but we don't have plan to have a big movement of &#x2013; continue that &#x2013; to open 200 new branches a year, like we had so far. We will continue to see opportunities to open new branches going forward, but to understand, it's more marginal growth. I don't know if I got exactly your point in this question, Jason.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Most of my questions have been answered, but Abreu, recently the local press in Brazil reported the Central Bank is considering changing the remuneration of savings deposits. Just like to hear your reaction to this, if this would be beneficial for your funding costs, for volumes, or what do you think of what has been said, when they say they will not tie-in the remuneration savings deposits to the SELIC rates? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think it's one point &#x2013; a very important point in Brazil economy, something that we need to face sooner or later, because the problem in saving deposits is that you have &#x2013; the remuneration are fixed by law. It means we need to <mark type="ph" /> GR (53:53) plus 6% &#x2013; 17% a year. So it was created in a moment when Brazil economy used to be with very high level of interest rate. So, once we have improved &#x2013; continued improvement in our economy, we have condition to live with lower level interest rate. We understand it's important to take from our economy these kind of things. It's one of that &#x2013; those things is definitely the saving deposit, fixed remuneration. We need to fix that.</p>
          <p>We saw some signs that &#x2013; it's important to emphasize that this investment has a difference between other investments in our economy, because they don't pay tax, the individual that invested this. Normally, what they say is, investment for low income people because we don't have <mark type="ph" /> interest simple (54:49) investment. So it's very easy to understand that we don't pay tax for that. That's why the remuneration of that has been for the long-term, even though it's fixed, during many years, it has been lower than the other investments. But we agree that we need to do something in this direction, yes, but they need to be very careful the way that we put that. They don't &#x2013; they cannot do things in the way they can make a dis-balance in all the other investments. Otherwise, you can have a dis-balance in our economy.</p>
          <p>Like, we saw some sign like this, it could be, say, 80% of SELIC plus <mark type="ph" /> GR (55:33). I don't think it's sustainable this way, because this investment should be much more competitive when you compare even with the government bonds, for example. So the situation could be a dis-balanced situation that the biggest part of the investment we try to &#x2013; we put their money in this kind of investment and they will want to have &#x2013; for example, you have a reduction in the asset management industry, for example. That is, at the end of the day, is industry that financed the government debt. So one thing that would be very &#x2013; I think it's important to resume our position in this matter. I think they need to be done. We understand it needs to be done with some movement in this direction. But they need to be very careful in the way that they would put that. It's one thing <mark type="ph" /> there will be a (56:27) discussion, not to just put in the way that we have put in so far.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, Abreu, Paulo. Thanks for the opportunity to participate in the call. I have two questions. The first one is related to the reversal of the fiscal provisions that you had constituted in the prior quarter. I welcome balance sheet strengthening, but I noticed that you just reverted R$2.1 billion of the fiscal provisions and I had understood that tax credit generated. Sum it up, R$2.9 billion. So my question is, do you still have some balance of additional fiscal provisions to revert? And if that is the case, do you have already the destination and timeframe for such recognition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In fact, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:29) R$2.1 billion. We revert all of this R$2.9 billion, already reverted, because a part of that we use to &#x2013; in other fiscal contingencies, all right? That's why the net of fiscal contingency reverts was R$2.1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Understood. And the second question is, again, related to organic growth efforts, you gave us a lot of color on that, but just like to know how many branches you still plan to open to replace postal losses? I see that you have a footprint of more than 6,000 branches, and you opened in this quarter close to 300. So what is still plan to do, how many branches and how many people you believe you will need to hire in the next two quarters, and if you have maybe some internal targets for efficiency going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorg, we are not disclosing yet the number of branches, but certainly it won't be 6,000. We don't want to replace all the postal service, but certainly it will be much, much lower of that. But we expect to make &#x2013; sorry, I'm not disclosing by now &#x2013; but we expect to do this very soon. So we are just finishing all the details, all the plans, to be able to disclose.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; we don't &#x2013; expectation, we &#x2013; thanks for your question, because we want to emphasize this point that, even though we are facing this very strong movement of organic growth, we have been able to keep our efficiency ratio very stable. We could even expect to have some deterioration there. So to keep this in the level, it's really left us very, very happy with the results at the end <mark type="ph" /> of the period (1:00:33).</p>
          <p>In the long-term, we have &#x2013; it's not really a guidance that we have for efficiency ratio, but we have our internal challenges, to reach something close 39% by the end of 2014. It's internal challenge we have, it's important to understand. We have efficiency commit that we create, and we put to ourselves this challenge to reach 39%. We understand that it's possible, if you could &#x2013; the maturation of these investments that we are doing now, and the gain that we expect to have in the IT improvement process. So we understand it's possible. But I don't want to &#x2013; that you and all of the investors assuming this as guidance of efficiency ratio, because we need to face many different situations going forward. It's too long a period, 2014. We can have &#x2013; looking for the way that we are now and the expectation that we have, we think it's possible. But we need to understand what's going to happen going forward &#x2013; the environment, the scenario &#x2013; the economic scenario, so we think that we need to think about going forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Hello, Abreu, once again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of my questions have been answered, so I'd like to ask you something a little bit more top-down. There has been recurrent discussion currently about what the level of recurring profitability of Brazilian banks will be in the years to come. And there's a lot of debate around that theme. And one of the issues that I'm struggling with is that, going forward, if you have <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:47) at pretty high levels already and it seems that it's not increasing further, so it's relying a lot on the increase in the wage bill. Do you think that you can see Bradesco with &#x2013; coming back to the ROEs of 23%, 24%, let's say, three years from now or two years from now, once we pass by this asset quality <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:16) cycle? And I say that because I don't like to see spreads coming down in future, given that, in order for individual credit to be more affordable, you might have to move towards lower yield segments or even lower spreads within your current segment. So how do you think about long-term returns for Bradesco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Marcelo, it's very difficult to talk about that. But we say, in general terms, we have positive perspective for our business in terms &#x2013; even in insurance &#x2013; considering insurance, considering bank side. We are positive. We understand &#x2013; nowadays, we are running with a profitability around 22%. We understand, for example, that 22% today is better than it was when it was 35%, for example, in five, six years ago. In fact, I don't know really but 10 years ago, we have some slide that show that. Because we have a reduction in the risk in the system, in the cost of capital, like base capital like SELIC. At that time, we used to have 26%, 29% SELIC. Nowadays, we're talking about 12%. So we &#x2013; to say that in nominal terms to be 22%, 23%, we don't see that it's good for us. But it is better to see that. We expect to continue to have improvement. When we talk about efficiency ratio to be improved &#x2013; by not only reduction by not only reduction across, but because we expect to have more grow in revenues. We get good speculation that in this business itself, we are conditioned to keep the level &#x2013; in the revenue that we are originating and with lower risk. It depends the way that you see it. Sometimes we are posting a very big return, but with a much higher risk. In an environment that expect to have reduction risk, it's better to expect to have even a reduction there. But I think in the short-term, like five years, we can, I think, it's possible to be thinking about something from 18% to 20%. But to have 22% is, I think, too aggressive in our opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, actually it's a very fair assessment, thank you. I just want to follow up on a more or like certain question. Looking to 2012 I mean you seem to have a more bullish view on for the Brazilian economy especially like the performance of domestic growth and employment. It is I mean you have a lower growth &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; you have a lower growth scenario. Do you believe you have the capacity maybe to reduced costs? I mean in time that you make up or like a lower top line growth scenario or in terms of slowing down branch expansions anything you can do in that case to maybe control expenses a little bit more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have some space, but it is a very small space in the sense, Marcelo. Because we know that biggest part of costs is fixed costs. Of course in environment when we have a lower growth, certainly we talk about a lower number of transactions. So we have some costs that are linked to the transaction we have. We have a reduction that becomes can space to reduce costs in publicity for example, it's <mark type="ph" /> 24 (1:07:21), we can cut very, very fast. But the rest is very difficult to manage. You can have this space to <mark type="ph" /> plus (1:07:30) in the sense. In a process like this to open branches, we are in the process to build the branch. We cannot cut in the middle like that, to stop in the middle. So it's very difficult to see. But we have some space, but we don't consider this to be a good impact, a big impact. It's just not necessary being impacted just.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Eduardo Nishio from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:03).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The first one is a follow-up question on branches. How much of that especially on the small branches, are capitalized and how much is expansive? And you basically anticipate some of plans to this year, I would like to know if that will also shorten your long-term strategy of opening branches throughout Brazil that I believe it was before losing the postal banking <mark type="ph" /> JV (1:08:43) was to end in 2013. So that will basically go to 2012 or so. And that was my first question, and my second question is regarding the delinquency ratios in short-term. You said that the trend is basically flat in the fourth quarter or in the short-term or even declining, and I'd like to have a little more color on your comment and gives us &#x2013; also the issue on the credit cards, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in terms of brands they &#x2013; we have &#x2013; they all think that is capitalized is the investment in the branch. Investments in IT, for example, provide computers and the development of branch. .The part of structural, other part. All that rest is in expense. In terms of &#x2013; we anticipate &#x2013; when I said that we anticipate the part of the organic growth certainly, we had expectations that sooner or later in terms of Banco Postal, we should do this moving that we are doing now.</p>
          <p>So we didn't have an expectation for it. To have this now we have expectations to renew the contract, but unfortunately, it was impossible to renew. And you need to dissipated its productions. In terms of <mark type="ph" /> falling (1:10:04) expansion going forward, I think the biggest &#x2013; when you analyze our distribution network, we were weaker in some places like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:15) and Rio de Janeiro. This two movements that we made, <mark type="ph" /> penna book (1:10:21) we bought &#x2013; the pair of the penna which were also, at beginning of this year. We made the effort to reinforce our network there and We are doing this in Rio de Janeiro, certainly if you reduce our necessity of expand new branches going forward. Of course, we'll be looking for all the importance. Certainly, that's why, I said that you don't expect Bradesco &#x2013; don't see Bradesco continue to open 200 new brands for the current &#x2013; the next four years going forward, but certainly we will have some space to continue to improve our network, but not to the same base that we had doing so far, all right.</p>
          <p>In terms of delinquency, we have expectations to keep the delinquency relatively stable and even to have &#x2013; could have some expectation to reduce. If you see the early stage of delinquency, we are talking about delinquency more than 90 days, okay. You'll see the early delinquencies, see a very stable movement. We are not seen other movements of reduction of improvement. That's why in the debt for delinquencies more than 90 days, is relatively stable.</p>
          <p>And normally in the end, last month of the year, we have a good moment for delinquencies. Because the higher liquidity in the system that we have. Remember that you have that we have payments, the company pay the <mark type="ph" /> third salary (1:11:57) for the employees. So, they have space to reduce their exposure that moment. So you have created to &#x2013; that's why we take a risk to say that we can either expect to have some reductions going forward.</p>
          <p>You had a specific question about the impact of the credit card portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you can explain a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To explain the effect of credit card. Let me disclose about our delinquency ratio for individuals without the credit card portfolio. Exact because I don't know it would remain in the second quarter of the year, so we've mentioned about this impact of the demigration that we made for our portfolio credit card for the new system. In the way that now we are capturing the delinquency in the access the way we can see. This movement, by itself, cannot bring us more losses in the portfolio in the way, but it's different &#x2013; basically the way that we see the delinquency, all right. Remember that &#x2013; I don't know if you've had <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:13:23) to resume what happen, we &#x2013; that's a kind of business, when you've have more than one installment when you buy something, if you use a credit card, it would be more than one installment. In the past, you use to consider delinquency, when you don't pay your dues, for example, nine months, you have due for this month, you don't pay that, it includes just one installment that for the total that we compromise that we you assume.</p>
          <p>Nowadays, we are able to capture when you don't pay the first one. We consider you don't pay the first one, your due inside your &#x2013; and the other nine installments for example the same months. In other words we are anticipating the delinquency that's it. When I said that, okay, we understand that this jump delinquencies that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:19). A part of that is explained by this movements in the portfolio credit card exactly because that. When you see the other portfolios without these credit card, you don't see the same movement in delinquencies. Even &#x2013; it's very difficult for us to see &#x2013; that to tell that it is just because that you have this impact, but we have indication in order line of business that give us this direction. Because it was the only portfolio that we made this change. In the order portfolio we have a very stable behavior. Right?</p>
          <p>So we are not seeing this things. That's right, due to &#x2013; but to tell that we're not seeing other movement in &#x2013; a deterioration delinquency credit card, we don't have even the condition to tell that we have that. Assuming all the portfolios in credit card that we have, that is not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:30) past for this process, we see the movement is very similar that we have in this both the <mark type="ph" /> core (1:15:40) that we see in this slide 15.</p>
          <p>All right, that's why <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:42) a kind of certainty that we're maybe moving towards <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:50).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just a quick question, again, on the branches. Let's say that you have a branch that is &#x2013; cost you R$200,000, roughly how much that's capitalized, how much is expensive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I say R$200,000, exactly the investment <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:11) capitalized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, capitalized. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you say that okay, we have R$1.3 million and common branch is R$200,000 in an average branches, with the small branch. All of these I talk is capitalized. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The expenses came from the range of the pay for the &#x2013; I'd say that some part of that could be expenses, yeah. Sorry, I think the bigger part of this can be -but with the same effect you see an expenses but in five years, probably. Because a part of that is or you have capitalize or you have a leasing for the equipment for IT, for example, it depend on the moment we have.</p>

          <p>Hello. My question is regarding payroll loans. I notice that you have a very good organic growth in this portfolio in the quarter. But the credit portfolio actually reduced shrink in the quarter, I want to know, are you no longer interested in acquiring portfolios. And are you waiting for the change in accounting treatment next year for the smaller banks that you use to sell this type of portfolio? And will be willing to buy portfolios without recourse or if you think that after the change that the likelihood of may be large banks, being interest in may be buying &#x2013; acquiring smaller banks would be the case? Because <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:09) the large banks have a huge competitive advantage in terms of funding costs. I appreciate your comment on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, really we want to grow our own portfolio. Of course, it's better for us. We have better spreads on this. What's happened with credit portfolio? In fact we didn't change our policy of credit portfolio. We are open to buy other portfolio but dependent that you have other condition that we can analyze the way <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:46) security that we can have in different contracts with the different <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:57) banks. What is sure in fact, I don't see the small banks looking for this kind of funding in recent months. But in terms of debt, if you have condition to buy, we understand that once you have capital for doing that, and we have good spreads in the process, we can do it, right. We are doing that. So, I don't remember if I got exactly all the points you mentioned, Regina.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Look, we are very well concentrating our project to organic growth. Specific in this market, when we bough BMC, you understand that we acquired what we need to develop this business, right? So we don't see &#x2013; I wouldn't tell you that we cannot see &#x2013; take part if you have some opportunity on doing that. But looking for &#x2013; now looking for what we have slightly inside of bank, the project that we have inside. We'll not see a necessity of Bradesco to buy other small banks for doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And my other question, Abreu, is regarding the strength in the balance sheet. I mean I really welcome this higher provision allowance, and I see as a caution &#x2013; maybe precaution for &#x2013; maybe it's too uncertain diverse scenario. But when can we expect to see a discussion flowing into the bottom line of the bank, it's only when the scenario would be clear, I mean, less uncertainty or do you think I mean during next quarters, I mean we can see this going through? Or could be a one-time estimation, if the Basel III regulation, tends to require a more common equity Tier 1, and then in order to offset the impact of the deductions, you end up reverting maybe all the excess provisions for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:21:14) losses which today amounts to R$4 billion? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact we can consider those excess provision would too consider a part of capital. Of course we can understand how it should be the implementation of Basel III and how it to affect you can change the way that we have think about this, in the month. When you make discussion provision for credit, it's very difficult to imagine that we can that we can revert going forward, but we can revert only not constituting more, like if you see that our billing in good time. So then we'll continue to have good times going forward. What's going to that we continue to grow our portfolio and we continue certainly.</p>
          <p>And the correlation tends to reduce &#x2013; if you see the slide in 21, you see that we were in this process, right. We reach a point, but was 197% for example is a recovery ratio in terms of margin as to-date. And we started moving to reduce but not creating more to increase this <mark type="ph" /> personal (1:22:27) problem.</p>
          <p>It would just stay not &#x2013; it would naturally be reduced discussion if you just not to constitute <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:22:37). We're talking a normal term &#x2013; in the normal terms, expecting that your economy will continue to grow, we'd continue to grow credit. See we don't have these effects that we can expect. We don't see necessity to reverse that. But we can keep discussion if you reduce naturally. Of course if you have an event, like you mention like Basel III conception, we can see discussion could be even penalize of capital someway, we can think about another environment to revert to each other the aspect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking these questions. As a follow-up on the margin discussion, I understand the importance of looking at the repricing gaps, I do it myself as a way to gain more insight as to the trend of bank margins moving forward. Now looking back several years, even in the case that margin in Brazil are much more a function of spreads charged, rather than the level of benchmark rates, can you please help us better understand this trend? And then I have a second question. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My point, Abreu, is, I think that bank's margins are more a function of the spreads charge. So, it doesn't really matter where the level benchmark rates are because banks are actually in the business of charging a spread on implementation rather than making money out of government securities. So that's what we wanted &#x2013; we all wanted to understand better from you. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we have an effect of the base rate in margin. We <mark type="ph" /> agree with you (1:24:38) that the spreads is more a function, but the spread's a function of risk. If you are reducing you're able to live with lower level of base rate, certainly you reduce the risk in our client. So we can even reduce spread. We have this positive effect. That's why &#x2013; you saw this movement in the process, the spreads in Brazil, nowadays is still high is some line of business.</p>
          <p>But in an average, you see the long-term, you see that it had been reducing in the past. So I think this movement will continue to go &#x2013; to go forward. In the long-term, we don't see this with the margin around 7.6% the way that we are now. We can see some &#x2013; it used to be around 10% 10 years ago probably. So nowadays we continue to have this process. It's necessary.</p>
          <p>We talked about long-term, right. But in the short-term, of course, we have some effects for reductions SELIC, the effects of that. In nominal terms &#x2013; in normal terms, we understand that reduction in interest rate is better for the business as a whole, maybe not if you look going for the margin, you can see a reduction. But when you consider all together the volumes, the expectation of growth in the volumes and the reduction in delinquencies, it's positive.</p>
          <p>It's very clear when you look 10 years, we would compare with Brazilian banks 10 years ago and compare nowadays, you see very clear, this movement. So we &#x2013; I do recommend if someone make this exercise, it's really &#x2013; it's something that we can &#x2013; we always have been questioned about what expect for the margin in the coming year? I think you see more or less the same movement that we had in the past. So you see already compression in the margin, yes, but not necessary to be <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:26:50). I don't know if I got the exact point if I...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess that's a fair answer. Thanks, Abreu, for that. And if I may, a very quick follow-up. I know it has been already a long call, but when it will be the time for Bradesco to fully benefit from all these investment infrastructure? Or maybe &#x2013; let me rephrase myself, when will efficiency improve Bradesco based on your base case scenario, please? Thanks.</p>

            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:27:34) give a direction by the end of 2014, but for example, depend on the movement, for example. This expansion that we are doing in postal services, about to replace postal services. We will see at the beginning of next year, because we are replacing a cost, a fee cost that we pay for the postal service. In this case we have &#x2013; nowadays we have with the weight of this new cost, but at the beginning next year we see this impact.</p>
          <p>The effort that we are doing to grow in Rio de Janeiro, we can see some improvement in the next year because we expect to have revenue with the clients at beginning next year. But in the total efforts that we are doing in organic growth, I think by beginning 2013 you'll see the best moment probably. Because we have all these branches which already have been reaching there <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:28:38), so you see a better way.</p>
          <p>In terms of IT project, we know that we are about &#x2013; we have expectation to be very, very close to the end of this new <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:28:57) by the mid of the next year. So we have &#x2013; we doesn't mean that we have the impact immediately. Because when you have all the systems that we are writing again &#x2013; rewriting, we need to have to test, you need to have time to implement and it would &#x2013; it takes time to have that. That's why we have expectations and we have put in these expectations by more &#x2013; by the end of 2014. All right?</p>
