          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apache Corporation first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Tom Chambers, Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for Apache Corporation's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. As you've probably seen, this morning we reported a first quarter net loss of 1.76 billion or $5.25 per diluted share. The loss was the result of the continuing deterioration in North American gas prices since the end of 2008, which caused us to record a 1.98 billion non-cash, after-tax reduction in the carrying value of oil and gas properties, as required by the full-cost methodology of accounting.</p>
          <p>Just to reiterate, full-cost accounting rules require us to calculate the 10% discounted after-tax value of our proved reserves using flat period-end prices and costs for the entire life of the reserve base. If the calculated discounted value is less than our net carrying value, the excess must be written off, generally called a ceiling test write-down. The reported write-down is a non-cash charge and in no way impacts our ongoing financial flexibility. Roger Plank will provide more details in his comments.</p>
          <p>Today's discussions may contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that those expectations will be realized. A full disclaimer is located on our website. Any non-GAAP numbers that we discuss, such as adjusted earnings, cash flow from operations, or costs incurred, will be identified as such with the reconciliation located on our website at www.apachecorp.com. We routinely put important information on the website, and included today is additional detail on the Permian Basin acquisition from Marathon announced this morning.</p>
          <p>On today's call, we will have four speakers making prepared remarks prior to taking questions. We will open up with Steve Farris, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Rod Eichler, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President &#x2013; International, John Crum, our Co-Chief Operating Officer and President &#x2013; North America, and concluding by Roger Plank, our President.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2009 earnings call.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the first quarter remarks, I'd like to take a moment and outline the format of today's call, because we do have more speakers. Tom Chambers, as you heard, is our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Rod Eichler and John Crum are our new Co-Chief Operating Officers, and they'll review the operating highlights. And then Roger Plank, who is Apache's new President, will review the financial highlights for the quarter. And one final side note I'd like to mention is I'd like to publicly thank Bob Dye, who's done an outstanding job for over a decade in directing Apache's Investor Relations. Tom Chambers is taking over, and Bob is taking a broader administrative role within Apache.</p>
          <p>Hope all of you saw today we announced the acquisition of the Permian oil portfolio in the Permian Basin &#x2013; Marathon Oil in the Permian Basin. These long-lived oil properties are a great fit for our large portfolio in the Permian and will provide us with drilling inventories for many years. I think we've communicated over recent months that we're starting to see better value opportunities, and this transaction is representative of that view.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, Apache's global production increased by 6% over the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations for the year. And as Rod and John will review in greater detail in a moment, we had another quarter of important oil discoveries across a diverse range of basins and plays. We discovered new fields in Egypt, five new fields in Egypt, including three with a combined 9,400 barrels of oil per day. In Australia, we proved a new gas horizon in the multi-Tcf Julimar- Brunello complex. In Argentina we discovered a new field in Tierra del Fuego, and we also made an important oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>As the entire world faces challenging times, our focus on long-term growth and our financial discipline remains unchanged. Over our 54-year history, Apache's discipline, its values, and contrarian spirit have enabled the company not only to live through down cycles, but to emerge even stronger, and we're taking on that task once again. We're trying to take difficult steps as they are required.</p>
          <p>Last week we announced a painful but necessary 6% reduction in our worldwide head count. Living within one's cash flow has become a sector mantra during the recent months. And Apache was ahead of this new conventional wisdom and continue to maintain our discipline. Importantly, our portfolio allows us to live within our annual cash flow at today's oil and gas prices. It is very different from living now from hedging programs and hoping for massive price rebounds over the coming months. Our view is that Apache should be able to create value consistently across price scenarios, and today is no exception.</p>
          <p>The oil and gas sector operated for many years at prices below those we experience now and have done so profitably. We believe the current downturn should serve as a reminder of the imperative need for portfolio balance and focus on efficiency in our sector. Apache has long stood out in both of these areas and oftentimes been penalized in the market as a result. We're hopeful that the benefits of Apache's long-term strategies will be more widely recognized and more favorably accepted in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Although we're maintaining our 2009 production growth target of 6 to 14%, we expect to come in at the lower end of that range, when you take into account our lower capital spending and recently the contractor's delay at Van Gogh development in the offshore Western Australia. If there's a silver lining in the Van Gogh delay, it's that we now expect those barrels to come on around the end of the year of 2009, which should help our oil growth in 2010. For the second quarter of 2009, we're anticipating a 3 to 5% production increase from the first quarter volumes.</p>
          <p>And with that, I think I'll turn it over to Rod and John and Roger, and then we'll go to Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve, and I'll provide a quick overview of main developments in our international regions.</p>
          <p>Beginning in Egypt, our net production was 136,500 barrels of oil equipment per day, a 10.9% increase over the fourth quarter. The region achieved new daily production records for gross oil and condensate at 161,739 barrels of fluid per day, and gross gas at 685 million cubic feet of gas per day. On the exploration side, we completed drilling and/or testing operations on nine new wildcat wells, resulting in five new field discoveries during the first quarter. Apache has 100% contractor working interest in all of these wells.</p>
          <p>Some brief highlights on three of these new discoveries in the Greater Khalda Concession area are as follows. The Phiops 1X wildcat on the Kalabsha development lease logged 173 feet of oil pay in the Cretaceous AEB sand and 103 feet of pay in the Jurassic Safa sands. The Safa sands tested at 2,300 barrels of oil per day and 5.2 million cubic feet of gas per day, and production commenced on April 16. Additionally, two development wells are presently drilling to exploit the AEB and Safa pay seen at the discovery well.</p>
          <p>The West Kalabsha A-1X wildcat in the West Kalabsha Concession logged 202 net feet of oil pay in the AEB sands and 17 feet of Jurassic Safa sand pay. Test rates were 2,900 barrels of condensate per day and 15.8 million cubic feet of gas per day in the AEB and 770 barrels of oil per day and 3.9 million cubic feet of gas per day in the Safa. First production from the well should be in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>The North Tarek C-1X wildcat in the North Tarek Concession logged 48 fleet of AEB sand pay and tested 3,500 barrels of oil per day and 4.5 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is the first commercial oil discovery in this concession, and first production is expected in the fourth quarter. The remaining two field discoveries will be tested over the next few weeks. Separately we are currently drilling two new Jurassic wildcat wells at Falcon and Chelsea.</p>
          <p>On the development side, I'd like to note that commissioning and startup of the Salam gas plant Trains 3 and 4 and the Northern Pipeline Compression Project is progressing. Upon completion around June 1 and for the balance of the year, we expect gross gas production from the Khalda area concessions to average 730 million cubic feet of gas per day, a 34% increase from the 540 million cubic feet of gas per day that's been getting in the first quarter. And I should note that just before this call we learned that the northern gas compression project has been fully activated, and it is in operation.</p>
          <p>In Australia, net production was 31,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 13.7% increase over fourth quarter. On the exploration side, we drilled two wells in the multi-Tcf Julimar- Brunello complex. Brokenwood-1 was drilled to investigate two previously untested channel sands of the Mungaroo formation. The well encountered 21.8 meters of net gas pay in the B8 sand. Brokenwood-2 found 11 meters of net gas pay in the G30 sand. These two wells together confirmed the presence of a significant gas resource in this prolific area.</p>
          <p>In March, Apache, together with INPEX, completed the purchase of BHP Billiton's equity in two undeveloped oilfields in the Exmouth Subbasin. Apache's interest increased from 31.5% to 45.7% in the undeveloped Coniston and Novara fields. Apache will operate, and subject to a successful appraisal, these fields may be developed utilizing nearby Van Gogh FPSO.</p>
          <p>Turning to development and facilities projects, we had a very busy quarter in Australia. The Devil Creek development project for the Reindeer field was launched with the signing of the CP mining gas sales agreement in January. Work has commenced on the onshore gas plant under a contract issued to Clough Projects Australia. Offshore construction contracts will be issued by the third quarter, and we anticipate first production in 2011.</p>
          <p>The Varanus Island repair program is nearing completion. We have consistently produced 273 million cubic feet of gas per day off the island since the beginning of March, and we expect to raise the overall deliverability to 382 million cubic feet of gas per day by the first week in June, significantly exceeding the pre-incident rate of 293 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
          <p>As we announced April 14, Prosafe, the developer of the FPSO we have leased to service our Van Gogh oil project, informed us they had had a fire incident in the instrument control rooms of the vessel. The investigation teams have completed their on-board inspections, and site cleanup has commenced. The cause of the fire is yet unknown. Prosafe is pushing vendors for accelerated delivery times on replacement equipment. Based on information available to date, we estimate first production at Van Gogh around year-end.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea, net production averaged 60,900 barrels of oil per day, a decrease of 2% from the fourth quarter due to vessel overhauls and unplanned pipeline repairs. Before repair downtime, however, production was up a net 1,800 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>On the drilling side, we completed four successful oil development wells during the quarter, which are currently producing 8,500 barrels of oil per day. Of note is the Forties Alpha 4-5 well, which encountered 26 meters of pay and is producing 5,000 barrels of oil per day, water free. We are currently completing an additional two successful development wells, and we'll be on production in May. Production efficiency at the Forties Field was 91% during the quarter, a 31% fieldwide gain since our acquisition in 2003. As of today, the field has operated a record 224 days without a cease export interruption in production. Starting May 2, Delta platform, which makes 16,000 barrels of oil per day, shut down for a planned 16-day plant turnaround.</p>
          <p>Turning to Argentina. Net production was 47,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 4% down from fourth quarter, but without any decline in hydrocarbon liquids production. In the Neuqu&#xE9;n province, Apache finalized the extension of eight federal development blocks representing 590,000 acres for 10 additional years. These leases presently produce 7,000 barrels of liquids per day and 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. With this move, we extend the producing acreage base from 2016 to 2027. Apache paid a bonus of $23 million, increased the provincial royalty rate from 12% to 15%, and committed to a $320 million work program over the next 19 years. Also in the Neuqu&#xE9;n province, there was continued success in the drilling of nine wells in the deep gas fields at Ranquil Co and Guanaco. These wells tested between 3 million and 7 million cubic feet of gas per day.</p>
          <p>Apache also added a new oil basin position to its portfolio with the awarding of the Cuyo CC&amp;B-17 B block in the Mendoza province. The new block consists of just over 1 million sparsely drilled non-producing net acres, which surround 22 of the largest oil fields in Argentina. Apache's acreage is immediately adjacent to and on trend with several fields but has never been explored with 3D seismic. Apache plans two significant 3D surveys once permitting is completed in mid-2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Tierra del Fuego Austral Basin, Apache made a new field discovery with the Bagio Vuadiloso X-2001, which tested at 2.4 million cubic feet of gas per day and 300 barrels of oil per day. The structure's approximately 2 kilometers in size, and two development tests are planned. This discovery is significant because the structures a lookalike to several others in the immediate area, which were identified using the Apache's 2,500 square kilometer 3D seismic survey, acquired in 2008.</p>
          <p>And that wraps up the international. I'd like to now turn it over &#x2013; the presentation &#x2013; to John Crum, who will discuss our activities in North American operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rod. In Canada, net production was 78,000 barrels equivalent, an increase of 2% from the fourth quarter 2008, primarily on successful winter drilling program adds.</p>
          <p>As an update on the Ootla River Basin, which many of you've heard about, be aware that both Apache and our partner EnCana are drilling in the Two Island Lake area with pad-style development programs. This minimizes our infrastructure costs and reduces our footprint while testing the full development model pad operations. The partners have almost completed a shared dehydration compression facility for the area, and a 41-mile, 24-inch export line to the Spectra tie-in point at Cabin Lake is being commissioned as we speak. EnCana has already drilled and cased eight horizontal Muskwa wells and will drill three additional wells this year. Two of the EnCana operating wells are already completed, with the remainder expected by late summer. We expect to see first sales from the EnCana wells by July.</p>
          <p>On the Apache-operated D70K pad, we have two rigs in place, both with moving systems drilling on the same pad. We've batched that surface casing on all 16 wells planned for the pad. The first two horizontal wells have been drilled and cased to approximately 5,000-foot laterals. We will drill all 16 wells before mobilizing the frac spread to control our costs. We presently expect to start frac operations by September and have this pad producing to sales by the end of the year. We will be increasing the number of fracs per well in the program this year based on the success of last year's program, where our 10 frac well &#x2013; the most we did in any of those wells last year &#x2013; is still producing over 4 million a day after seven months on production.</p>
          <p>In the central region, net production was 89,600 barrels equivalent per day. That's down 3% from the last quarter of 2008, as we severely curtailed drilling due to the price realizations. This morning though, we announced that Apache is acquiring Permian Basin properties from Marathon, as Steve discussed, for 190 million. These properties are located in nine fields in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico and currently produce 1,850 barrels of oil and NGLs and 10 million feet of gas.</p>
          <p>The properties are a great fit for our large Permian positions, as most of the &#x2013; the most significant part directly offsets our units' operations, where we have a substantial operating base. That area has been the foundation of our Permian drilling programs for over a decade. Needless to say, we know this area very well. We've already identified 200 possible drilling locations. For example, as a general rule throughout the area, we have drilled these properties down to 20 acres profitably. The properties we're acquiring are remaining at 40-acre spacing, so we expect some good in-fill programs out of this.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in the central region, we drilled and completed our Moody-7H, a Bossier horizontal well in Freestone County, Texas. It tested to 15 million feet a day in February and is now producing to sales of over 700 million feet a day as of last week. The well's 100% working interest, and we have a number of other prospects in the area.</p>
          <p>We were also quite pleased to announce that Apache has begun operating its first compressed natural gas refueling station at Ok [Oklahoma] City, Oklahoma, enabling the company to fuel 40 field vehicles with cleaner-burning natural gas produced from the company's wells in the Anadarko Basin. We had to install conversion kits in these trucks since domestic pickup manufacturers do not presently produce CNG vehicles. We are hopeful that the success of this project will encourage production of such vehicles in the future, leading to both cleaner air and lower costs.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf Coast region, net production was 104,100 barrels equivalent per day. That's an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year as we continued to recover from our hurricane outages. A significant exploration success this last quarter Ewing Banks 998 #1 discovery, which tested at 4,254 barrels of oil a day with 5.4 million feet of gas. The well will be connected to existing facilities using subsea tie-backs, with first production expected during the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the development side, we've been telling you about Geauxpher. That discovery is expected to come on during May, and we'd expect to ramp up production to a net roughly 45 million feet a day by July.</p>
          <p>To update you a little more on the hurricane recovery, at the end of the quarter we were still down 63 million cubic feet a day on our gas production and some 4,250 barrels a day on our oil production, all of that primarily due to third-party pipeline outages that it's just taking longer to recover from. By the end of the second quarter, we'd expect those figures to be down to 35 million cubic feet of gas per day and 3,000 barrels of oil. And we expect to have all of this essentially back on by September.</p>
          <p>Across North America, we've been working within our capital discipline for the year. And our teams have been focused on building their prospect inventory on our large acreage position. In the current market, we enjoy the benefit that our acreage position is mostly held by production. We will have a substantial ready-to-drill inventory as soon as we see some product price health.</p>
          <p>Finally, I know there's a lot of interest on costs. So I'd like to give you a little color on cost levels. We are starting to see strong cost reduction movement. Here are some examples. In Canada, we've recently gone to bid for the fracs for our Ootla program. It looks like we'll be down 40% for an equal-sized job from last year. Some of this reduction, I will say, has to do with the way we're doing the job, with the efficiency gains out of multi-well pad operations. But the rest will be service and commodity pricing reductions.</p>
          <p>Rig rates are down as well in Canada, but we have got most of our drilling program done for the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, published rates are down 50% from their peak last fall. A 350-foot IC is now quoted at 70,000 a day, down from 150,000 per day last October. Mat rigs are down to 45,000 a day from 85,000 a day last year. Boats are running 30% down from last year. In the Anadarko Basin, rigs are being quoted at 12,500 a day, down from 20,000 last year. In the Permian Basin, we're seeing 8,600 versus 13,600 last year. Spending costs were down 30% and stimulations 35 to 40%. Overall, we can now drill and complete a well in Western Oklahoma for at least 30% less than last year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn over this discussion to Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, John. And good afternoon, everyone.</p>
          <p>In Cairo we drink a beer called Stella. It's not Stella Artois, but Stella local. It's rather murky in appearance, perhaps to hide the occasional chunks that are found floating in it. But Stella has a great motto on their T-shirts: "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." That's not a bad statement about Apache and what's happening in our industry today. Collapsing prices, particularly for North American natural gas, are straining producers, some to the snapping point. And while Apache, with our $2 billion write-down, is hardly unscathed, this is not our first downturn by any means. And our financial wherewithal remains intact. We intend to be among the few that come out the other end of this downturn stronger for it.</p>
          <p>As Steve mentioned, we are taking the tough steps as we endeavor to lead today's change rather than fall victim to it. We're reining in capital spending to preserve our financial flexibility and A rating. This gives us a tremendous competitive advantage in today's world of limited access to capital. Five-year money for Apache today costs under 5%. In the first quarter, we reduced capital over $0.5 billion from the prior quarter alone and kept exploration and development spending in line with our plan. Our investment and cash flow have different profiles through the year, but all in, 2009 projected E&amp;D capital of 3.5 to $4 billion is anticipated to fall well within cash flow.</p>
          <p>We are also battling costs at every turn, both cash and non-cash, which I will go into shortly. Our personnel reductions have been painful, but they've also been necessary to right-size the organization for today's much lower commodity price environment. The annualized savings of $21 million gross will become more apparent after getting beyond the one-time, $10 million severance charge that we expect in the second quarter. As an aside, I'd note that the four members of the office of the CEO have also cut their salaries by 10%.</p>
          <p>TD&amp;A costs are also coming down, a side benefit of write-downs that lessens our future amortization grade. And finally because we have over $1 billion in cash and short-term investments and a manageable debt-to-cap rate in the mid 20% range, we are one of few positioned to take advantage of today's adversity. The Marathon deal that John mentioned is a good example. At prices that we hedged averaging $57 a barrel and $5.70 per MMBtu, our acquisition economics indicate we are buying these long-lived legacy properties for just under 4.5 times cash flow. Using last year's 2008 average prices, these same properties would easily have fetched in purchase price around a $0.5 billion. While at $187 million this is a relatively small deal, these properties are modestly accretive to earnings and cash flow immediately and add 26 million barrels of equivalent reserves at just $7.21 per BOE. We plan to remain very discriminating as we sift through additional purchase opportunities, but clearly, the floodgate has opened.</p>
          <p>Now to specifics on the quarter. In comparing the first to the fourth quarter, we've removed write-down foreign exchange impacts on deferred tax and other tax adjustments in an effort to capture the normalized &#x2013; "normalized" &#x2013; earnings of the company. Accordingly, we earned an adjusted $218 million or $0.65 a share in the first quarter versus $276 million or $0.82 a share in the fourth quarter, despite oil and gas realizations dropping, 16% and 19% respectively.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations declined 10% to $983 million, driven by a 17% decline in realizations, but countered by a 6% increase in production and significant cost reductions. Leased operating expense, for example, totaled $8.06 per BOE, and that was down 26% from the $10.91 reported in the fourth quarter. The decrease includes lower hurricane repairs and insurance costs and lower power, fuel, and other costs. Absent one-off effects, the LOE rate per BOE should fall in a range of around $8.25, still well below the 10.91 reported in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Whole-cost DD&amp;A of $10.86 per BOE was down 17% from the fourth quarter and should drop another 5% or so following the first quarter write-down. The write-down, by the way, only affected North American properties and was driven by lower natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>General and administrative costs per BOE of $1.72 were up 17% on several one-time items. Absent nonrecurring items, the unit cost would have dropped to around $1.35 per BOE, which is an achievable run rate going forward. Our effective income tax rate was temporarily reduced to 28% by the write-down from our normalized run rate of 38 to 40%.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the first quarter was a tough one. The decline in our average realized price totaled $6.87 per BOE. On the bright side, however, we were able to extract $3.60 per BOE out of cash costs in order to preserve a $19.70 per BOE cash margin. And while this pales next to last year's average margin, it's still very robust relative to most of our 50-plus years. Given our progress in reducing costs and increasing production, and with $4 billion of financial capacity, this downturn will almost certainly make us stronger.</p>
          <p>With that, I think this five-man parade is over, and we'd be happy to address any questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Wanted to ask a question concerning your Egyptian discoveries. Specifically can you give us a ballpark estimate of the added resource potential associated with these three oil discoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; let me look at the first couple of wells. We have &#x2013; some of these are in early stage development. The Phiops is perhaps one of our most exciting projects we have in 2009, exploration side. We made this discovery early in the quarter. We anticipate drilling at least five wells on the feature in 2009, and our expectation is to be able to exploit that AEB, very large AEB oil column to achieve perhaps a field wide production rate of 10,000 barrels a day. Exact reserve size remains to be determined based on the success of the appraisal and <mark type="inaudible" /> drilling we're in the process of going right now.</p>
          <p>West Kalabsha, this is the third such well in an area &#x2013; in our Faghur Basin play, which we had discovered last year, 2008. We have &#x2013; very excited about the rates we've established in the first well. These structures typically will support a size up to about 2 to 3 million barrels. However, once again, this development drilling needs to be done in this prospect as well.</p>
          <p>In North Tarek C, it's the first discovery in the concession. It's a very attractive structural accumulation. We also need to do the development drilling in there. We won't be able to test the well in full production until we have a development lease from the government, which will come sometime in the next 45 to 90 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. Then jumping over to Argentina, I just wanted to know how the concession extension may have impacted your plans in the region? And to what degree is capital still restricted, and are you expecting gas prices to go up in the region going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The concession extension in Neuqu&#xE9;n was very important to our program, because it essentially doubled the existing life of the concession area. It protected our production and allowed us to add the tail of the reserves. Otherwise it'd have been granted back to the province beginning in 2016. It was essentially adding 9 million barrels net to us by the fact that we signed the extension. It's a significant area. It's our bread and butter area in Argentina at the present time, and so the extension gives us a lot of life and running room for our program in the future.</p>
          <p>With regard to the drilling program, our drilling program this year in Argentina is pretty heavily loaded on the front end of the year. And I don't see much activity, because we have curtailed CapEx in Argentina accordingly associated with the costs &#x2013; prevailing market prices, as well costs of doing business there at the current time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the gas price, you might have noticed that, year-over-year we were up $0.14 to $1.98. I think that's the highest price we've had since we've been there, and they still have severe shortages there. And basically, when we &#x2013; we can propose drilling new areas and get an exemption, if you will, from delivering that gas into low-price markets and selling it into free markets. And so the more new gas we bring on, the higher we hope to see our average price go.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Hey, a question about your thoughts around the A&amp;D market now with your first acquisition announced. How many do you think are out there, similar size kind of your target range, or what would be the maximum, and just trying to get a feel for what you're thinking now that you've started maybe buying some things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it's any secret that we are for the first time in two or three years actively looking for good things to buy. I think Roger pointed out the difference in price scenarios from last year to this year and putting reserves on your book at $7.21 rather than close to $20 a barrel is much more palatable to us. I think in terms of &#x2013; number one, we don't have anything in front of us, but we constantly are looking. And I would tell you I think the bid and the ask between the buyer and the seller is getting a lot closer. I truly anticipate by this summer a lot of things will start turning over. Obviously, we're looking for things to fit us like this Permian, so we don't chase every pretty girl. But I'm very confident that this year is going to be a good year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any thoughts about volumes that you'd buy, or any ranges, or is that just &#x2013; like you've talked in the past, acquisitions come and sometimes you get them, and when they happen they happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think if you think about the timeframe, it's probably a pretty good time to grow. And you can either grow drilling wells or you can grow buying things, and right now as costs start coming down, it gets a little more economic to drill. But in terms of the economics of acquisitions right now, it's probably a better time to acquire. So I'm not going to put a size on it, but &#x2013; and we're a &#x2013; we like to grow incrementally. So I doubt very seriously if you'd see us go off and buy something gigantic. But in terms of buying something a little bigger than what you saw there, we'd probably do that also.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Following up on the last question, but more towards your comments on drilling. With costs having come down &#x2013; and appreciate the color on that &#x2013; what gas price do you think it would make sense to begin drilling again in the U.S., onshore in the U.S., offshore? And how does that work in with your acquisition capital or planned acquisition capital as well? Does that further then mean you need a higher gas price to say it's not necessarily worth doing acquisitions, let's start drilling again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that &#x2013; the first premise is that we don't think costs have come down as far as they're going to come down yet. So it's a question of when you &#x2013; do you want a dollar gas cost average down, or do you want to wait until it gets down there? And I think to the extent that we can, we're going to push the service companies as far down as we can get them.</p>
          <p>And in terms of what price you need, it really depends on where it is. I mean it's very hard to make a blanket statement that you need $5 gas or you need $4 gas or &#x2013; because every prospect honestly has a different profile and a different cost. So that's a &#x2013; if anybody gives you a number, unless they're just drilling a lot of wells in one area &#x2013; it's pretty hard to come up with that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What about for Western Oklahoma specifically, or Oklahoma specifically, which I know is an area you've been very active in and is an area where we've seen the rig count come down significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>John, you want to &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think a lot of what you saw happen in Oklahoma was not only costs getting out of line, but our basis differentials got completely screwy there for a while. Those are starting to level out, and so we weren't even seeing what would be anywhere close to an acceptable price in Western Oklahoma in the first quarter. Obviously these costs coming down will help, but I just talked to our drilling manager up there a few hours before this call, and he's seeing even more reductions coming. So per Steve's point, I think we'll just kind of watch this hand a little bit longer and see where it's going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And if I could ask one more, can you give us an update on the Western Australia gas market, both on how your main industrial customers are &#x2013; or the main industrial consumers are faring in the current environment and where you see pricing on the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that there's no doubt that you'd see the supply of gas is just not in the United States, there's a &#x2013; as demand weakens in the United States, demand has weakened around the world. We were able to sign a very good contract with CP Mining that's going to underpin the development of the Reindeer Field. But in terms of current outlook, it's probably more in the 4 to $6 range rather than 6 to $8 range.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Going back to the M&amp;A market just for a second. Steve, you mentioned that you'd like to grow incrementally. Would that seem to suggest that you would not use the current low-price environment to step into some new area that you would like to be in that you're not currently in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gosh, you know the problem &#x2013; I mean never say never. It's probably a much better time to know what you're doing and do it in areas that you got people that know what they're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But with the right opportunity came along in an area that we wanted to be in, that wouldn't be out of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's helpful. The second question I've got, just about the acquisition. Could you just comment on how big you expect the well to be on 20 acres versus the 40-acre spacing that they're currently on, in terms of the EUR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, those wells will probably make 150,000 barrels apiece. So you're looking at &#x2013; me do, for example, that this wide offsets our Northeast Drinkard Unit that we picked up many years ago, and we had a tremendous program there. We ramped production up significantly, and still doing parts of that, extensional water flooding around that field. But I &#x2013; round numbers I think are about 150,000.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, importantly, too, in that area, these are multi-pay areas. So we've got other than the Drinkard available to us there, a lot of different sands and carbonates produced in that area. That's why we like it so well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. I was just trying to get a sense for how these wells, the 20-acre wells would perform versus the 40-acre wells. So would the 40-acre wells would be closer to 200,000 barrels or &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, in fact we haven't seen an awful lot interference between our 40-acre spacing. If you saw a lot of interference you wouldn't downspace. It's not acceleration drilling that you're doing to downspace to 20. What you're really trying to do is get oil that's not going to be produced from a 40-acre spacing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got quite a bit of acreage in the area, and so the guys are working pretty hard on seeing where else this might apply. But if you know something about chasing the Bossier, it's not a blanket operation. You've got to pick the right places when you go out.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're currently looking at a couple of different LNG options for development in that project, and it's a little bit too early in our decision making process to land on one versus another. But we're actively pursuing that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what's behind my question is, at some point would Apache consider taking an equity state in one or other of the new opportunities? And if so, any update as to how those discussions might be going?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll leave that one. Jumping to Egypt, again it seems that every time we turn around, there's substantial exploration success there, but you haven't really given any update on the production outlook since your &#x2013; I guess since your 2X target was set a few years ago. 2011 was your original target. What are your thoughts now in terms of what the potential is in Egypt, and when might we get an update in terms of the longer-term opportunity? What needs to happen to put the pieces in place where you could give us an update?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to give you an idea on the 2X, which &#x2013; for the benefit of everybody listening, the 2X program was the two times production project which we launched with the government back in 2005. And the objective was to be able to double our then-production, which was 163,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, to double that by year-end of 2010, which would take it up to 326,000 barrels a day &#x2013; that was our target &#x2013; of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>Presently, just as of last week, our forecast based on our original projections was to be at 260,443 barrels of oil equivalent per day as of the 19th of April, and I'm pleased to report that as of the 19th of April our actual production was 273,701 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we're well ahead of the forecast with just about 18 months left to go on the program. So we're -</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A big part of it, of course, is the gas component that we have, which is growing significantly, as I mentioned in my remarks, beginning in June this year with the completion of the two new gas trains at Salam and northern compression project, which will boost our net cash production incrementally by 100 million a day and about 5,000 barrels of condensate per day.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and the other thing you've got to recognize is we're just finishing Train 3 and 4 there, and we will have been &#x2013; again be captive until such time as we build another train out there. And we have shelved the train because of cost in 2008, and we're looking to pick that up again probably in 2010, which would be another 100 million a day train.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll wait on the updates. Just one final one from me. I'm sorry if I missed this earlier on the prepared remarks, but cash operating costs. What kind of guidance can give us in terms of how sustainable or where we see the LOE in particular go from here? I think you're down around $8, which is a fairly healthy decline from Q4 in particular, but how much lower do you think that can go given your current &#x2013; your new cost-cutting initiatives? What's your kind of target there, if you want to lay one out for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I mentioned that in the quarter we are at 8.06 from 10.91 or something &#x2013; 10.91. And we had some nonrecurring things in it. But we still foresee rate somewhere around 8.25 on a go-forward basis. The longer prices stay down, the more those costs will come down. But at least at this point in time, we see that low 8 &#x2013; $8 number as sustainable.</p>

          <p>Well, I talked a little bit about the &#x2013; being able to do business in any price environment. I'm going to give you some examples of some numbers, because we're going to have to see service companies get down on these levels. 2006, we averaged about $60 a barrel and about $5.60 on gas. Our operating cost were $5.40 a barrel. If you look at $8 a barrel, we've got a lot of services that still got to come out of this business to get down to those kind of numbers. And that's &#x2013; and do I think we'll get that far down? The mix has changed, but the fact of the matter is costs have got to continue to come down. I mean &#x2013; and they will. And as long as we &#x2013; if we continue to see these kind of prices, costs will continue to come down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon here, guys. Do you have any update on your activity in the Eagle Ford shale play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're presently evaluating that. I guess we did have some drilling problems on several wells there and were kind of working through that to make sure we understood what the issues are. I will say, we'll be trending toward looking at the gas windows a little more than the oil window there. And I guess that's as much as I can tell you about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just curious about what your other high-impact exploration activity looks like in 2009, kind of outside of Egypt. I know you guys had a program out there in Australia. Just curious to see what's going on these days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the primary exploration areas internationally are Egypt and Australia for 2009, and we have a 15-well program in Australia for 2009, and that includes 12 exploration appraisal wells and three development wells, which are &#x2013; the three development wells are at Van Gogh and John Brookes fields. We've drilled five of the exploration wells so far and one development well, with four successes.</p>
          <p>And so we have &#x2013; our floater just moved into the location just this past month, and we have a continual drilling campaign that will take us through into the early part of the third quarter. As far as the projects go, of course these key appraisal wells that I mentioned in my remarks with regard to &#x2013; in the Julimar-Brunello complex are very important in expanding our confidence in the size of that resource. As well as we anticipate beginning a appraisal and development program at the Cotistant acquisition later this year, which also has a significant reserve upside for us in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You folks talked quite a bit about reducing your onshore natural gas activity, given the low-price environment. Could you talk a little about your onshore oil activity and whether or not you've seen a bigger reduction there, and kind of what your thoughts are about drilling at the $50 price here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one of the examples we gave you was on the Permian Basin rigs, and they would primarily be working in oil prospects. So indeed we're seeing costs come down there as well. Obviously we'd like to get back to oil drilling as quickly as possible, but it really was around costs getting completely out of line over the last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess are you kind of saying that you don't really have many rigs running on the oil side at all in the U.S., you're just waiting for costs to come out -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to give you an example, in the central region right now we have one rig running. That's running in Western Oklahoma. So we would typically have, I don't know, maybe 35, 40 rigs running this time of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Afternoon, everybody. Nice quarter. Couple questions, and getting back to this economics, when do these projects become &#x2013; when do service costs drop enough to get the projects working? If you did have the puts, can you talk about just say if you look your natural gas plays? What today, given current service costs and current health prices has the best economics? Not to say you'd go out and drill today, but of the ones you look at in your portfolio on the natural gas side, which ones have the best economics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, it's the Gulf of Mexico, and the reason is you don't see the declines. And we drill off of our existing platforms, and so what happens is that you get a rate for a period of time. It doesn't have the &#x2013; whether it's Apache's shale play or anybody else's shale play, it doesn't have the hyperbolic curve to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what happens is that if you don't get the upfront price out of those nonconventional plays, you have a heck of a time ever making the economics. But if I make 20 million a day for three years flat and get the same reserves out of those two, I'll make much better economics drilling a Gulf of Mexico well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's number two right now? Do you have a feel for that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, fair enough. And I want to ask you one bigger-picture question on the gas side. Obviously on this side of the phone, everybody always tries to figure out what the right long-term natural gas price is. From your perspective, one, do you have an opinion on what that number is, and two, can service costs drop enough, or is it likely that service costs drop enough that maybe the number is 4 or 5 versus a 6 or 7 number? Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've been in this business 37 years. So I will tell you, if you have 4 or $5 gas price, for most of my career, 4 or $5 was Mecca.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we drilled a lot of wells. And if you have 4 or $5 gas price, you will have costs that are commensurate with that to make the rate of return, because &#x2013; and I love them all and they're good friends of mine, but drilling companies are parasites. I mean, you don't have a producer that spends money, then you don't have somebody to drill the well. And so I'm not so concerned about is there a margin. What I'm concerned about is that the current price fits the current costs, and right now they still don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They don't, but one thing I wanted to mention because this question's come up a couple of times. It's not that we have projects &#x2013; we do have these too. But it's not just that we have projects that aren't economic at today's price. It's really our capital has been curtailed in order to preserve our financial flexibility. It's &#x2013; from my perspective the question is what do prices have to rise to before we have the cash flow to put more into the ground? So if you would ask our regions, I think they'd tell you we've got a lot more inventory that makes economics than the amount of capital that we're allocating to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I &#x2013; one thing I would say about that, and hopefully it's come across, because Roger makes a very good point that I've been trying to make. The reason that we're not drilling right now is not because you can't make economics. It is because why would I drill a well if I know &#x2013; and I'm certain costs are going to keep coming down. Why would I drill a well and spend more money than I have to spend to drill a well?</p>
          <p>And we have &#x2013; if you looked at our original budget coming into the year, it is significantly what the regions have spots on the map for at $4.50 and $40 oil. It is significantly higher than the amount of money we're spending. What we're hoping is that those same 3.5 &#x2013; $3.6 billion is going to drill a lot more wells because costs are going to keep coming down.</p>
