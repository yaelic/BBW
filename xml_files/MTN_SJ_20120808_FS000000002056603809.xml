        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for that video, which is telling us about how MTN is transforming lives.</p>
          <p>On behalf of MTN and the Board, led by our Chairman, Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa who is not here with us today, and the leadership of MTN led by our CEO, Mr. Sifiso Dabengwa, I wish to welcome you to our Interim Results for the Year Ending June 30, 2012. I also wish to welcome our colleagues who are watching us through various media channels across our operations.</p>
          <p>Today's proceedings are fairly straightforward. Sorry, I think I pressed the wrong button here. Anyway, let me put this in. Today's proceedings are quite straightforward. First, we will have a strategic direction and input by our Group President and CEO and he will hand over to our Group Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Nazir Patel.</p>
          <p>Later on we will allow you to ask questions. You should look for microphones on both ends of the hall. For members of the media we have time for you to interact with our CEO for about 15 minutes in <mark type="ph" /> Chard (01:32), which is one of the meeting rooms. For the members of the electronic media who would like to have some sound bites, there are three rooms which have been reserved for you, if we can meet you at about 11 o'clock when the President and CEO is finished.</p>
          <p>Now, before I hand over to him, let me say that your BBMs and tweets and other social media platforms are welcome, but can you please bear with us by putting your phones on silent, so that our broadcast should be seamless and without any problems.</p>
          <p>Can I now welcome our CEO and President, Mr. Sifiso Dabengwa?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Yuraisha, and very good morning to members of the Board, my colleagues and our fellow MTNers, wherever you may be, and ladies and gentlemen, very welcome and thank you very much for being with us this morning. I will just go through some of our key strategic issues and then go through some of the key aspects of our results. And then hand over to Nazir to go through the financials.</p>
          <p>Looking at the strategic pillars of our business, we have identified the four areas as key to our business going forward. The creation of new value streams remains an important part of what we do, and we are continuing with a lot of work internally and in partnerships with others, looking at how we can find new revenue streams. Mobile Money and financial services continue to be a critical part of what we do and we hope to be able to significantly improve on the performance of Mobile Money during the course of this year and early next year, as we firmly believe that's an important part of our services.</p>
          <p>From a value-creation point of view, we still continue to focus on shareholder return and continue to evaluate and pursue M&amp;A opportunities and also want to maintain our position as an employer of choice, ensuring that whatever we do has long-term sustainability, driven by a strong performance-driven culture.</p>
          <p>From a customer experience point of view, we have decided that strategically we need to be able to differentiate through excellent customer service and be able to position ourselves in our different markets very strongly, through customer experience, <mark type="ph" /> excellence (04:36) and focusing on making sure that we address the different market segments as per their requirements.</p>
          <p>In terms of optimizing the business, leveraging on our scale and intellectual capacity is an important part of what we do and making sure that we optimize our cost base is also an important part of our activities. It is important and we firmly believe that it's important for us that in all our operating environments that we have the lowest cost structures in order to maintain and be able to compete effectively going forward.</p>
          <p>Implementation of best practices is an important part of what we are doing and also focusing on the speed of execution, specifically on our strategic initiatives. As I indicated, customer experience will be central to all our activities, driven primarily by high-quality networks, efficient and wide distribution and supported by effective segmentation and strong customer analytics, with good, experienced people. And from a services point of view, we will still continue to provide voice and data services, comparatively priced, and also making sure that from a quality point of view we continue to be &#x2013; offer the best in the different markets that we are in.</p>
          <p>If we look at the value creation as part of our strategic considerations, we will continue our shareholder return strategy on dividends and buybacks, as we indicated previously. As far as dividends are concerned, our dividend payout ratio is to be increased to 72%, as a result of the STC removal and that keeps MTN in a cash-neutral, from an outflow position. During 2012 we bought back ZAR2 billion &#x2013; just over ZAR2 billion worth of MTN shares and since we started the buyback program we have acquired just over ZAR3 billion of MTN shares.</p>
          <p>From an M&amp;A strategy point of view, nothing significant has changed. We are still focusing on local &#x2013; broadening local ownership and also we are finding that we are having to find opportunities for shareholder value extraction, especially amongst the local shareholders.</p>
          <p>We are still seeking consolidation for &#x2013; sorry, we are looking for opportunities for in-country consolidation. We haven't been able to succeed in any, but it's something that we consider &#x2013; we are spending a lot of time working on. The monetization of passive infrastructure through tower deals continues to be an important part of what we do. And in seeking licenses and acquiring additional spectrum is something that we continuously do and an important part of our strategy. And as far as spectrum acquisition is concerned, I will make some comments at a later stage.</p>
          <p>As indicated before, Africa and Middle East remain core and an important part of our footprint. We still are looking for bolt-on standalone opportunities, and we &#x2013; also we are looking at the number one or number two operators with meaningful scale and size. In terms of transformational opportunities, we believe that there really aren't too many at this stage and we always look at the execution risk as something to consider significantly.</p>
          <p>Looking at the issue of revenue streams, voice continues to be an important part of our revenue stream. Airtime and subscription revenue is down to 63% of total revenue from 66% at the same time last year. We still continue to focus on maintaining and growing market and value share, as pressure on pricing leads to tariff decreases.</p>
          <p>We've been able to successfully offer segmented and competitive offerings in most of our markets, and also the ability to distribute and drive low-cost handsets has been an important part of our strategy on growing voice. An important part of our strategy, obviously, is the issue of pricing in a manner than enables us to manage better the reality of multi-SIMs that we are seeing in most of our markets that are driven by promotions and short-term market share drivers by different players. And also we are seeing the fact that elasticity, it does have an impact on our network capacity requirements and therefore driving more CapEx.</p>
          <p>From a data and related services, we've seen good growth across our business. Data now accounts for 10% of our revenue, up from 6% at the same time last year. Mobile Money subscribers are now at 7 million and we're now operating &#x2013; we're providing the service in 13 countries. We do have a comprehensive device strategy, which we believe is very important in order to drive data services. Although in most countries other than in South Africa, we don't actually participate in distribution of handsets and devices. We have created very good and very strong relationships with local distributors to enable us to implement our data and our device strategies.</p>
          <p>We continue to have a coordinated digital services priority, with partners and revenue-share arrangements. We have, as we indicated last year or early this year that we are looking at implementing platforms that can be shared across countries, in order to be able to deliver digital services. There is a strong focus on 3G capacity and coverage to support the growth in data and related services.</p>
          <p>From an ICT perspective, we have recently reorganized the head office part, to streamline the ICT strategy to be managed under the Enterprise Business function and we continue to focus on the SME and the corporate segments and we also continue to make good progress in infrastructure investments to support ICT. As indicated previously, we are looking at ICT beyond mobile connectivity and we are focusing on cloud services for SME and corporates and also machine-to-machine services and we hope that by the end of this year, we should be in a position to start rolling out those services. A key part of our whole ICT strategy is that we intend to be delivering services that are based on utilizing the infrastructure that we already have that is based on mobile technologies.</p>
          <p>In terms of business optimization, a very important part of our strategy has been the issue of cost optimization initiatives. The procurement initiative, which we started about 18 months ago and has progressed really well and up to about 45% of all our procurement, is now done centrally. We are in the process of establishing a single integrated supply chain team across the Group and we believe that that will enhance further our operational effectiveness and also improve on our ability to manage our suppliers.</p>
          <p>We continue to grow in terms of shared IT services. The SEA IT hub is operating and continues to improve in terms of operational efficiencies. Uganda, Zambia and Swaziland are now operating from that hub. We hope that by the end of this year, Rwanda will also be included in that hub.</p>
          <p>From an infrastructure sharing strategy, we have continued with our sale of towers. The sale of the Uganda towers has been completed. And earlier on this year, we initiated a program to look at back-office rationalization, which will focus on transactional activities in Human Resources, Finance and Supply Chain management. We will now have more shared facilities in order to deliver these back-office services. And we have continued, successfully in power cost reduction through the implementation of hybrid power systems and that's progressing very well.</p>
          <p>Looking at the highlights of the business through June this year, subscribers are up 6.9% to 176 million; revenue, up 17.5% to ZAR66.426 billion and our EBITDA margin up to 44.9% and we're very pleased with that performance. Adjusted headline earnings per share, up 14% and the board has approved a dividend, interim dividend of ZAR0.321 per share. As indicated earlier on, the share buybacks for the six months through June has been to the value of ZAR2,088 million that's been completed.</p>
          <p>Some of the key considerations for the period that we have just gone through, we have seen a very competitive landscape continuing from last year. We have seen aggressive price competition, which has been impacting traffic on the networks and also on the revenue. Traffic has not &#x2013; we have not seen traffic growth &#x2013; we have not seen revenue being compensated for by the traffic growth as elasticity has generally been below one. But we've also seen good growth, as far as data is concerned and that remains an important part of our business. CapEx implementation for increased voice and data implementation has gone reasonably well across most of our operations, although we have had and seen some challenges.</p>
          <p>In terms of individual country backdrop issues, South Africa delivered very strong performance in a highly-penetrated market. So we're very satisfied with the performance across the board. Nigeria was impacted by aggressive price competition, also the reduction in fewer subsidies and lower than expected GDP performance. We've seen price stability in Ghana, Uganda, Iran and Cote d'Iv&#xF4;ire.</p>
          <p>And then we've also seen continued ongoing socio-political unrest in Syria. As far as Yemen is concerned, the situation has improved but there are still some elements of instability. We are still having to manage ongoing UN, EU and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Syria. And we believe that we're managing these as best as we can. On July 2, this year, MTN filed a motion to dismiss the case filed against us by Turkcell in the U.S. and we are still awaiting the progress on that particular case.</p>
          <p>Looking at individual countries and looking at them in terms of performance through June, as I indicated, South Africa performed very well, that we have seen the subscriber growth of 6.8% from December to 23.5 million subscribers and we've also seen ARPU slight decline to ZAR123 and minutes of use more or less stable from December at 68 minutes.</p>
          <p>We've seen very strong prepaid growth, very good promotional campaigns and also supported by very good data offerings. We've seen good postpaid hybrid subscriber growth, up 25%. And we've seen very good indications in terms of value share trending positively. The interconnect rate was cut to ZAR0.56 in March and also the ARPU has been impacted by the traffic mix and increase in telemetry SIMs.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, airtime and subscription has gone up by 5.6%, driven by strong prepaid growth. Revenue generating minutes up 15.6%, interconnect down 15.3% and handset revenue up 29.1%, driven by good volumes on the postpaid and Smartphone volumes as well. Data revenue has gone up by 49%. The number of Smartphones has increased to 4.4 million on our network and the number of data users is now just below 12 million subscribers.</p>
          <p>From an expense point of view, we have seen very good cost control and hence we have seen the EBITDA margin being managed to 35.4%. On-net traffic has increased from 60% to 65% and the higher handset cost due to depreciation of the rand is what we've had to deal with during the course of this period.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view there has been very good progress across the business and we've continued to focus on network modernization and also on self-providing. Focus also continued from a 3G coverage and a capacity point of view. The national long-distance projects have progressed very well after initial delays. We are still awaiting clarity on the process for the allocation of spectrum going forward and then also about 75% of the total authorized CapEx had been committed by the end of June. From a capitalization point of view, we have capitalized ZAR1.9 billion. As you can see, there's quite a significant improvement from last year at the same time.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Nigeria, we ended Nigeria with a total market &#x2013; with a total subscriber of 43,184,000, which was 3.7% growth from December last year. The market growth, as I indicated, was impacted by removal of fuel subsidies and generally lower consumption spending. We did experience in that market quite aggressive price competition during the first half and generally our pricing was at a premium of anything above 30% across the different offerings.</p>
          <p>Our SIM offerings were probably not as competitive and as a direct result of that our gross acquisition were not as high as we would have liked. However, despite the loss of &#x2013; or the slight loss of market share to 48%, we believe that form a value share point of view we have been able to maintain our value share. The SIM registration process is still very much continuing, and at this stage there's no indication when that will be terminated.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, interconnect revenue was up 11.5%, airtime and subscription down 4.4%, whilst the revenue generating minutes showed good growth of 28%. The effective tariff in this business really was significantly reduced by about 30% and hence the impact on the revenue growth. We've seen very good data growth albeit form a very small base, but we are very encouraged by what we have seen. We have 16 million active data users and 2.6 million Smartphones, and approximately 480,000 dongles.</p>
          <p>From an expenses point of view, there's been good cost control overall in terms of the network operating cost and also there's been a reduction in commissions. On-net traffic &#x2013; sorry, that's from the wrong one, sorry about that. The EBITDA margin in Nigeria has been impacted by the lower tariffs. The power costs are trending downwards as we increase the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:32) and 2,312 sites have been completed using hybrid power systems. Transmission costs have significantly gone up as a direct result of data traffic and related costs. And interconnect costs have gone up by about 37%, as a result of increases in the off-net traffic.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, there's been really good progress overall, in terms of rolling out our CapEx plans. The focus has been on network quality, capacity and also expanding the 3G network. The 3G population coverage is now at 35% and we've now do have about 7,600 2G sites, with 2,600 3G co-located sites. We have continued to roll out fiber to support the data strategy and obviously to support the increases in voice traffic. A key part of what we have been focusing on is getting the transmissions bottleneck addressed and we believe that, as we go into the second half of the year that will be well underway.</p>
          <p>And as at the end of June, 73% of the authorized CapEx had been committed. And again, from a capitalization point of view we have capitalized ZAR4.4 billion worth of CapEx, which is about twice what we had done at the same time last year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Ghana, very good performance overall, ending up with 10.7 million subscribers, very attractive market offerings and promotions. The market now has six strong operators. There has been a slight reduction in market share, but again, we believe that from the value share point of view, we have been able to maintain that. In terms of revenue, airtime and subscription revenue up 18%, interconnect up 11%. We've seen very strong data growth, but again from a low base. We now have 3.4 million data users and 987,000 Smartphones. Revenue generating minutes were up by 11% and we've seen a very stable market pricing situation in Ghana.</p>
          <p>From an expenses point of view, the rent and utilities have gone up by 130% due to the leasing of the 400 towers. Distribution and commission costs have gone up as a direct result of volumes. Interconnect costs has also gone up due to the increase in off-net traffic and we expect the WACS landing station to be implemented and operational during the second half of this year and that will assist significantly in terms of data traffic. EBITDA margin performance has been pleasing at 37.7%.</p>
          <p>Looking at it from a CapEx point of view, we've seen good improvement as far as capacity and quality of service is concerned. 3G coverage and capacity remains a priority. We're now covering about 38% of the population on 3G. There were minor delays earlier on this year. However 53% of the authorized CapEx has been committed.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Iran, we have seen, again, excellent performance from our Iranian operation. We have increased our market share now to about 47%, very good promotional offerings and excellent network quality. The third mobile operator did launch during the first half of the year in two cities, and they do have exclusivity on 3G up until May, 2013. We've seen this uplift in local currency ARPU of about 7.7%. As at the end of June, the subscriber base has moved up to 38.296 million, which has been a really good achievement.</p>
          <p>From a revenue point of view, airtime and subscription up by 25%, interconnect up by 13%, very good growth SMS revenue about 36%, strong data growth, including WiMax by 89%. We now have about 10.4 million data users. Total revenue-generating minutes up by 26% and we are seeing in the market that there's continuation of subsidy removals, but there are cash grants for the very low income groups.</p>
          <p>From an expenses point of view, whilst Iran is a high inflationary environment, particularly driven by fuel, electricity and imported goods, we have managed to manage the cost base quite effectively. Lower distribution costs and commissions, as we have pushed for increases in logical distribution. We have seen an increase in data and value-added services costs as a result of revenue share, and also from a result of increased uses of the services.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, the focus again is on improving quality and capacity and still on population and geographic coverage. We had a good performance as far as the rollout is concerned and 77% of the authorized CapEx had been committed by the end of June, which is again showing good progress on the management of our CapEx plans.</p>
          <p>Syria is still very much impacted by the political unrest, which is impacting the economy and the ability to operate. Staff safety remains an important priority for us. The overall business performance is really underpinned by network reliability and airtime availability and our ability to maintain the network and get product out into the market.</p>
          <p>The BOT conversion, which we have been discussing for the past 12 to 18 months, is clearly subject to the resolution of the political process. However, in terms of overall performance, we are quite satisfied that under the circumstances the business has performed reasonably well.</p>
          <p>Market share has been held at 45% and we have seen a subscriber growth of about 3.3% since December 2011. From a revenue point of view, we have seen an airtime and a subscription increase of 8.8%, data up 39%. Pricing has been generally stable and we have seen revenue-generating minutes up 13%.</p>
          <p>From an expenses point of view, we have experienced good cost control. Distribution and commission costs have gone up by about 36%. That's driven primarily by volume and also the use of our logical distribution to facilitate payments of postpaid bills, because this has and does carry commission costs and that has impacted that line. Fuel security and currency devaluation are the main cost drivers in this business at this moment in time.</p>
          <p>From a CapEx point of view, the main focus really has been on the core modernization, very limited activities around increasing coverage or capacity. 81% of the authorized CapEx has already been committed, but also the fact that the political environment has caused some challenges as far as rolling out is concerned, but, at the same time, there really has been very limited damages to our infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of the other operations, generally we have seen very good performance Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Uganda and Sudan and we are satisfied with the overall performance.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Nazir to just go through the financials. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sifiso. Good morning to members of the audience, a special welcome to members of the MTN Group Board, members of the MTN Executive Committee and all to the MTNers listening to this webcast or participating in this presentation.</p>
          <p>And as Sifiso noted, when we look at the six-month' results we see characteristics of a very strong underlying operating performance. But you should keep in mind that we had negative charges, both on the finance cost line, which increased quite significantly compared to the six-month period in 2011, as well as on the tax charge line, which I'll take you through in greater detail as we go through the rest of the presentation. These had a dilutive impact on the reported earnings per share for the six-month period.</p>
          <p>But overall, we reported EBITDA margins which have grown quite &#x2013; reasonably well to 44.9%, given the tough economic environment. Revenues on a reported basis have increased by 17%, which we believe is quite pleasing, given the underlying competition, of a heightened competition in many of the markets as Sifiso has taken you through as well as some very aggressive price competition in most of our key markets.</p>
          <p>Measured on an organic basis, revenues come through at 13%, indicating some currency impacts of about 4%. We see much of the same as we get down to the EBITDA line, and I will take you through this in a bit more detail as we get through the rest of the presentation.</p>
          <p>CapEx went pleasingly, it went up from ZAR5.7 billion to ZAR10 billion. It was a criticism of the Group that we generally trend to struggle to put CapEx into the ground. And what's important here is that at this stage, while we've capitalized ZAR10 billion of CapEx, a significant portion of the CapEx which we guided you at the first half &#x2013; or the end &#x2013; at the first half of the year has now been committed and I believe that number to be in the order of about 70%. Our CapEx-to-revenue, as a result, has increased about 15.3%.</p>
          <p>We've also shown you the impact of operating margins and the evolution of that, it goes up by 0.2 point, from 43.8% to 44%. But keep in mind what we've done in that number is eliminated what we call one-time items and there are two here to keep in mind, which again we'll talk about later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>One was the profit on the sale of the Ghana towers, which was concluded just before half year. That amount is ZAR547 million and for the accountants, just to show you that I do remember this one, there is an additional ZAR19 million of profit, which relates to the eliminated profit on the Ghana tower core transactions from last year, which are recognized over the 18 year period. So I hope the accountants are happy with that explanation.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, given that more than 70% of the Group's performance is measured in currencies other than the South African rand, exchange rate volatility during any period plays a meaningful, or has a meaningful impact on our Group consolidated rand reported results. And if we look at the underlying six months and you look at the performance of key currencies, in the portfolio against the U.S. dollar, you'll find the real, the cedi and the rand depreciated in a range of 14% to 18%. And you can see the numbers quite clearly on the chart.</p>
          <p>The Syrian pound, as a result of the political strife and upheaval in the country, has devalued quite markedly and it has had an impact, as you will see later on the finance cost line and on average rate basis compared to the first six months of last year has declined by about 36%.</p>
          <p>Although, the Sudanese pound looks much more conservative in terms of devaluation, please keep in mind that late in the second quarter of 2012 we saw a very significant devaluation that was announced by the Reserve Bank of Sudan and that devaluation came through at approximately about 80%. So as we go through the rest of the year, we will find that will have a much more meaningful impact.</p>
          <p>But clearly, as we move to consolidated rand results, what we should note here is the relatively muted devaluation of the naira versus the U.S. dollar of 4%, effectively translates into a gain in the rand exchange cross rate by about 10%. So whilst Nigeria revenues and EBITDA were relatively muted, even measured in rand terms when we translate those into &#x2013; sorry, in naira terms, when we translate those into rand terms it look a lot more meaningful and we'll take you through those as well.</p>
          <p>Again focusing on the revenue number, strong growth overall on a reported basis of 17%. That includes about a 4 point pickup or an impact, as a result of the foreign exchange movements of ZAR2.8 billion, which moves overall reported revenues to ZAR66 billion for the Group.</p>
          <p>Underlying that when you look at the organic growth, we saw particularly strong growth coming through from &#x2013; like South Africa, Iran, as well as Ghana as Sifiso has mentioned. If we look at the RSA numbers, that's reported as &#x2013; following the change in the interconnect rate adjustment back in March last year.</p>
          <p>If we had adjusted for those, the total South Africa revenues on a constant <mark type="ph" /> MTR (39:24) basis for 2011 would have been about 4 percentage points higher. So South Africa revenues would have grown by instead of 9.5%, a total of about 13%. That impact was about ZAR700 million dilutive to the interconnect revenue line.</p>
          <p>South Africa, as Sifiso also mentioned, was pretty strong in terms of prepaid growth. Prepaid grew 15% compared to the six months in the prior year. And data remained extremely strong as well at 49%. And I think you have enough color on that one.</p>
          <p>Nigeria, now keeping in mind of their &#x2013; a few fundamental characteristics. While we've shown you earlier that airtime revenue actually declined 5.5%, this is in the backdrop of a fairly significant change in effective tariffs in the Nigerian market, most of which took place during 2011. And that effective tariff change was in the order of 30%, so it's not surprising, despite the additional subscribers that are coming in, you have to keep in mind that the entire value in the airtime market has actually been eroded. We saw similar things happening in Uganda about a year ago, which we've subsequently corrected. So clearly there's still some adjustment. The market is heavily punctuated by aggressive promotional activity, freebies, et cetera, which will continue to impact this number for some time to come.</p>
          <p>The other point to note in Nigeria as well is based on some external research reports. We understand that that the actual level of consumer spending on communication services has declined by about 2% as a result of &#x2013; and this is in comparison with the same period last year &#x2013; as a result of the withdrawal of subsidies, which you're all aware of, took place very early in the first half of this particular year. So given that backdrop, I guess, Nigeria revenue growth of overall 4% coming through largely on a basis of higher interconnect revenues as well as a strong growth in data, which supports the overall great data strategy.</p>
          <p>Iran, not too much to comment. Extremely strong growth of 28%, and it's based on very strong customer acquisitions coming through, which is also reflected in market share gains against the incumbent operator.</p>
          <p>Ghana, very pleasingly continues to perform very well, and in fact, growing at a higher rate of revenue growth than we saw last year. Stabilized tariffs have helped, but clearly very well segmented value propositions into the market and well organized distribution strategy, et cetera, continue to drive value share in that market, as well as maintain our overall market share measured on a SIM basis of about 50%. So clearly a very good result for Ghana.</p>
          <p>Syria has come in pleasingly at 12%, despite the pressures in the market, and whilst revenue growth in the first quarter was on the low side, we saw fairly strong revenue growth coming through at the end of the second quarter. And again as Sifiso mentioned, this was largely due to availability of the network for airtimes sales.</p>
          <p>So looking at this more on a segmented basis, I think the key point to keep in mind here is the transition between what we call voice revenue growth as well as data revenue growth. It's not a surprise, as is noted elsewhere in the industry, that we see a slower rate of airtime revenue growth coming in whilst the airtime revenue on a nominal basis has grown from ZAR37 billion to almost ZAR42 billion. The rate of contribution to our total Group revenues has declined from 66% to 63%. Please keep in mind that these have not been adjusted for foreign currency effects.</p>
          <p>As I noted, overall data growth has moved from ZAR3.9 billion to ZAR 6.7 billion, which is an overall growth of 70% and that number now contributes to about 10% &#x2013; accounts for about 10% of total Group revenues. So it kind of sustains or at least justifies the entire investment in terms of data networks and obviously opens up further opportunity for growth as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Mobile phones and accessories, although a lower number, has grown sharply by 28% year-on-year, and that's largely due to the increased volume of handsets as well as Smartphones going through the South African network, and to an extent, a higher rate of selling prices, as well.</p>
          <p>Moving on to OpEx &#x2013; and as Sifiso mentioned, we have a number of OpEx initiatives, and I think the key point to keep in mind here is, when you look at the margin evolution at an individual OpCo level, most of the change that we've seen on the lower side has come from the cost of sales lines. When you look at pure OpEx in the Group, it has remained extremely well under control as a result of all the cost initiatives that we put into place.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, the biggest growth has come through areas like direct network operating costs as a result of the focus on network expansion in key countries like Nigeria and South Africa, as well as in selling and distribution costs as we're pursuing stronger customer acquisition initiatives as well as some higher commission costs coming through.</p>
          <p>One point to reflect on in Nigeria, by way of example, which is something that we keep talking about, is the initiative to actually control the rate of diesel usage on the network seems to be paying off. At half year 2011, we advised you that the total diesel bill as a percentage of revenue was at 3.6%. That's now declined to about 3.3%, and that's despite about an 8.5% increase in the diesel price per liter. This is an important number because it justifies the investment in what we call the hybrid strategy. To date, just over 2,000 towers in Nigeria are now on the hybrid network &#x2013; on the hybrid system, anyway.</p>
          <p>Looking at EBITDA margins, pure operating margins have declined marginally by 0.2%, and most of that comes through from Nigeria, which accounted for about 0.8% dilution of the Group EBITDA margins. This is not including the FX impacts. Once we add all the FX impacts, which has a beneficial impact, the margin overall actually picks up by 0.2%, moving it up by &#x2013; to 44%.</p>
          <p>But we should take a moment and just talk about the Nigerian margin. The 2.8% reduction, which took place since June 2011 to the reported date now, is largely due to two or three items. One is a higher rate of interconnect cost as we pushed a lot of traffic off-net as well &#x2013; and that number has moved down from 82% to roughly 81% in a bid to just counter the incoming traffic that was growing off other networks. That has an impact of about 1.7% negative impact on margin, comparing the six months this year to comparing the six months last year. And on a combined basis, increased commissions costs as well as higher SIM card costs accounted for another full point of the margin dilution.</p>
          <p>Iran, very pleasingly, as a result of solid cost control, was able to lift up margins to 44.7%, bringing the total ZAR-related growth in nominal EBITDA for Iran to about 38%. The drop-through on a local currency level was at 36%, which is significantly higher than the revenue growth of 28%. Again, this shows you the value of good cost control, but also through some &#x2013; a lot of the benefits coming through from the high revenue, while the costs were kept under control.</p>
          <p>Ghana margins pleasingly towards the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:28) 38%, and this is despite absorbing the costs related to leases for the Ghana towers, which now sit in <mark type="ph" /> Leap (46:37) joint venture.</p>
          <p>Syria margins were down by about 2.5 points. We took a charge as a provision, which is related to international interconnect. It does not sit in the cost of sales line. It sits in pure OpEx. For a potential revision of the international interconnect rate, down from SYP4 to SYP1.</p>
          <p>But very pleasingly, the dilution of the Nigerian margin was to a large extent offset by the combined effect of improvements that we saw in the South African margin by about 0.3%, the Iran margins, at least at Group level of 0.2%, from places like Sudan, which increased EBITDA margin performance year-on-year or half year-on-half year by 10%, Cote d'Iv&#xF4;ire by about 4% and Uganda by about 2.8%.</p>
          <p>The Ugandan one was quite pleasing, given some of the tariff trauma we saw in the market back in <mark type="audio gap" /> (47:17 &#x2013; 47:30) 2010 and 2011. So a lot of that margin recovery is coming through as a result of the higher revenue coming through in the operation, which is now growing at 30%-plus in more recent quarters. So overall, a very good story on margins for the Group.</p>
          <p>As I noted earlier on the first slide, the pain that we've taken really relates to two items, one on the finance cost line and one on the tax line. Finance costs have increased by almost ZAR1.2 billion as a charge to income. The net interest paid line was much lower at ZAR6 million compared to the ZAR 775 million of year last year, and it was largely due to interest income on treasury bills and bonds that we have invested in Nigeria and one or two other countries.</p>
          <p>ForEx losses, however, are really the key feature and they've increased by almost ZAR1.7 billion when comparing the current period to the six months of 2011. I'll unpack these in a little bit more detail but the Syria dividend which still sits out there have not been up-streamed accounts for about ZAR700 million of these ForEx losses, partially also attributable to Iran loans that still need to be repaid to Group subsidiary of ZAR155 million and then clearly the Sudan debt which is a little bit more complicated and I'll take you through on the next slide, which accounts for about ZAR880 million.</p>
          <p>Functional currencies were much lower, the rand closed at 8.07 I think during December 2011, weakened marginally. The closing rate at June 2011 was 8.14 and that particular change basically drove gains in bank balances of about ZAR247 million, offset by losses on intercompany accounts of about ZAR170 million.</p>
          <p>We'd also like to indicate to you right now that whilst we've talked about Sudan and Syria to a large extent we've been kind of sheltered from the Iranian losses. Most of you are aware that when you go out to Iran and you look at the market rates in Iran they're significantly higher than the official exchange rate even supplied by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p>In the last few days, the Governor of the Central Bank has made a public statement to the effect that he would expect that there would be a de-valuation in the official rate within the next 10 odd days. We have no sense at this stage of exactly how this will come out but there's a lot of speculation in the market that the rate will go out at between 1,600 and 1,700.</p>
          <p>To the extent that materializes is it likely to have a severe impact on second half earnings as we bring that through on a consolidated basis in rands. And, again, this is going to be a function of where those rates are finally finalized and the rates at which we are able to extract cash or pay for in rands at.</p>
          <p>The tax charge also increased from ZAR6.3 billion to ZAR7.5 billion, but more importantly the effective tax charge moved or the effective tax rate moved to 38%, driven by a few key items. The higher dividend attracted a higher STC charge of 4.54%, this will dilute over the course of the year as we know this is &#x2013; it's just a one-time STC charge and as we apply a higher taxable income in the rest of the year to this particular number. Withholding tax has remained roughly flat to last year, while the assessed losses related to ForEx losses accounted for another 2.2% increasing the effective tax charge for the Group. So overall the 38.1% was quite a hefty number to swallow.</p>
          <p>Just unpacking the ForEx story a little bit, now this is to give you a sense of how these have impacted the earnings per share that we report on the next slide. When you look at the different components of the Sudan loans these are how they're structured, so cash and bank, intercompany, vendor financing and shareholder loans.</p>
          <p>On a combined basis, without going through the details, these had the effect of diluting EPS for the Group by ZAR0.58. Similarly, when you look at the Syria number, it accounts for another ZAR0.36. So on a combined basis, whilst we reported about a14% improvement in adjusted headline earnings per share, there's a negative ZAR0.96 charge coming through from these two line items.</p>
          <p>Now just a point to note here and <mark type="ph" /> Nick (51:15) was very careful to get me to remind you of this, we are working on restructuring the standalone balance sheet of Sudan. So what this would have the effect of doing, to the extent that it is actually approved by the regulatory authorities and I must emphasize that it has not yet been approved and there is no certainty that it will be approved, we're looking to convert the intercompany and the shareholder loans into preference shares on a standalone basis.</p>
          <p>This would have the effect of obviously changing the ForEx losses as we see them now and the potential earnings impact and simply put the ZAR0.36 that we see under the intercompany line and the ZAR0.10 under the shareholder line would disappear off the earnings line and therefore be positively accretive to earnings for the second half, but, again I caution, its work in progress.</p>
          <p>So adjusted HEPS, again looking at attributable earnings per share growth of ZAR0.127, when you look at the ZAR0.575, but after eliminating profit and sale of assets as well as impairment charges and assets that grows to ZAR0.131. The next line is something that you've got used to be we believe we'll drop as we get into 2013 and that's really a put option adjustments related to a subsidiary. Given the fact that these are relatively insignificant you'd expect to continue them for the full year 2012 but drop them as we go further.</p>
          <p>Anyway, after accounting for that the Group's adjusted headline earnings per share grows by a healthy 14% compared to the six months previously. Now to demonstrate or just to confirm the course or the path that the Group set out on back in 2010 to return large amounts of cash to the shareholders, we can demonstrate what we've done in 2010, 2011 and how the Group is thinking about or the Board is thinking about 2012.</p>
          <p>So in 2010 the combined dividend returned to shareholders was about ZAR9.4 billion, that increased to about 15 billion as the payout ratio increased from 65% to 70% &#x2013; or from 60% to 70% and that included a ZAR930 million investment in share repurchases which we reported on at the final results presentation.</p>
          <p>Looking at the half year right now, what we've announced, as Sifiso indicated a bit earlier, was a lift of the dividend to 72% and that's purely to keep MTN as a Group, cash neutral. So effectively we will be returning the 70% as well as the STC that we had distributed previously, that gives you a nominal 72% on the dividend. But in terms of determining the &#x2013; the method to determine the half year dividend of ZAR0.321, is on the same basis as we would have done last year and that was based on 30% of last year's full-year earnings.</p>
          <p>So when you look at the combined effect of that dividend against the earnings we're returning an 18% dividend with 14% earnings growth, we think which is a reasonable place to be. So overall, I think looking at the total share repurchase program to-date we will have bought back about 1.2% of the shares on the book. Net cash for the Group, you might want to change the top slide to say net cash instead of net debt.</p>
          <p>Net cash has actually decreased by just a little bit more than ZAR2 billion and this is a function of repaying some Holdco debt of about ZAR3 billion. We also, this is to keep in mind, that in Nigeria generally we would have settled the prior year's full year taxes on a full year basis in the next 12 months going ahead. So, in other words, for this particular year we had a ZAR4 billion settlement which normally would have been settled in the second half of the year in equal installments.</p>
          <p>Due to a change in the local regulations in Nigeria, we're required to now pay that in the first half of the year. So over the full year, it actually is cash neutral but in comparison to what happened in the first half of last year it is an additional ZAR4 billion outflow. Also keep in mind we did ZAR2.1 billion in share buyback, so there was a fairly significant investment in some fundamental programs going out which reduced overall the cash position to ZAR7.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Some other points to note really we did a syndication in Ghana, we raised $300 million of debt which is the largest syndication ever done in Ghana. We also did some further fundraising in Zambia and Benin as well. And Fitch reaffirmed our AA negative rating with a stable outlook.</p>
          <p>On the income statement, just to take note of some items which we haven't already covered in the presentation and I'll just pick up on those items that we haven't dealt with. Other income of ZAR711 million, that includes the profit from the sale of the Uganda towers of ZAR547 million, the strange anomaly of the ZAR19 million which comes through over 18 years for the Ghana towers profit that we did not recognize last year, that's ZAR19 million and then there is an additional income which is the unwind of the big transaction of ZAR124 million which comes through from prior years. That's still, I believe, got two years to go.</p>
          <p>Further down the income statement the share in the results of the associates and that number is broken up into two items. There is our share in the losses of the Ghana joint venture with ATC, which were entirely foreseen as part of the business plan. This will occur for a few years before the operation starts going into profit, that's ZAR124 million, offset by another ZAR26 million charge which comes &#x2013; profit which comes through from the BICS profit for the current share, our share of that in any case.</p>
          <p>Non-controlling interests includes ZAR190 million of the minority share of ForEx losses which I showed you on the Sudan slide. When you have time you can go back and take a look at that. All the other numbers are as we have discussed previously. Minor changes I indicated earlier are, I said 8.16, actually we closed at, 8.14 we close at 8.16, we moved from 8.07 to 8.16 and that's the number that's used the measure the statement of financial position. Take note, this is not the balance sheet even though it looks like one.</p>
          <p>Goodwill and other intangible assets showed the major move on the top section of the balance sheet and that was due to revaluation of goodwill by about ZAR3 billion. Current assets were lower by about ZAR4 billion and it is entirely due to lower cash balances across the Group at the reporting period. And looking lower down the line, other liabilities were low by ZAR4 billion as a result of two items, a lower tax liability of about ZAR2 billion and lower trade payables by about ZAR1 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at cash flows, cash flows remained very solid, not surprisingly given the strong operational performance. We saw a 26% increase in cash generated by operations, largely absorbed by the higher dividend which the Board approved as a final. The interest paid number we've talked through. Tax paid increased to ZAR9.5 billion and this is where the ZAR4 billion hits you. So last year we paid ZAR3.4 billion. You add the Nigeria earlier payment, then we did last year ZAD4 billion and then there's an additional ZAR1 billion, which is a combined effect of higher taxes we've paid in Ghana and in Cameroon.</p>
          <p>Looking further down the line, other investing activities, ZAR5 billion, we had about ZAR4 billion invested and this related to cash that was upstream from Nigeria's dividend sitting in Mauritius which we invested in short-term deposits. There was an additional outflow of intangibles of ZAR1.2 billion that included some of the financing related to the acquisition of the Benin license which we renewed for a period of 20 years, as well as pre-payments of about ZAR700 million. These were offset by about ZAR1.4 million of proceeds from the sale of the Uganda towers.</p>
          <p>Looking a little down the line, ZAR3.676 billion, breaking up that number there's just two numbers to keep in mind there, one is the share buyback of ZAR2.1 billion and the ZAR1.4 billion which is the dividend to minorities.</p>
          <p>And that concludes the presentation. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nazir.</p>
          <p>Looking forward there has already been sufficient said in terms of the payout ratio. And then we will continue with share buybacks on an opportunistic basis. We do intend to establish tower companies in Cameroon and Cote d'Iv&#xF4;ire before the end of the year. And we will also start looking at the larger operations of South Africa and Nigeria later this year in to early next year.</p>
          <p>We will continue to look at value accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities and we will respond as and when the opportunities arise. From an operational point of view the focus on South Africa and Nigeria's competitiveness will be paramount. We believe that we are in a position to hold our positions and be able to continue with the levels of profitability despite the challenging competition that we're facing in those two operations. We really want to focus on improving our customer experience. A Group-wide initiative is being launched to focus on how we can significantly improve the customer experience.</p>
          <p>Looking at innovative and relevant products and services, I see that from a financial services point of view we will be looking at significantly improving our offerings around financial services as we believe that we really need to get at least 25% of our customer base in each of our operations using Mobile Money and/or other financial services offerings. So that's going to be an important part of our strategy going forward.</p>
          <p>And continuing to grow our market share and our value share where we can and the implementation of cost optimization initiatives. Also from a rollout point of view, I guess you've seen that all the indications are that this year we have been able to execute on our rollout much more effectively than we have historically and also preparing for our rollout targets into next year.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx guidance, very little change from what we guided at the beginning of the year, South Africa at ZAR5 billion, just slightly higher and then the others basically more-or-less the same as they were and the total being ZAR24.772 billion. No significant shift as far as that is concerned and then we do expect that at least 90% of the authorized CapEx will be capitalized during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>From a subscriber point of view, very little change in the overall picture from 21.3 million to 21.25 million, the main change their really being as a direct result of our expectations on Uganda. Because of the subscriber registration process which started in March and which has really had some significant challenges we are of the view that we might end the year with a negative 300,000 subscribers from a net additions point of view, that's really the significant one.</p>
          <p>South Africa, we expect to be just above what we initially had guided, Nigeria still the same at 4 million, Ghana at 950. Iran, we've increased by 500,000. Syria reduced. And in terms of the rest, that is really impacted primarily by Uganda and a number of the smaller countries for which subscriber registration has been introduced earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. That is the end of the presentation. We will take on some questions. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Jonathan Kennedy-Good here from Standard Bank.</p>
          <p>Just a quick question on Nigeria. You mentioned that you <mark type="ph" /> have been at a (01:03:22) premium to your competitors during the half from a tariff perspective. Has that been dealt with and are you more in line with competitors going into the second half?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, given the CapEx you invested in the region, how do you feel about the network capacity, given the increased usage in Nigeria? And does that allow you &#x2013; you have got sufficient headroom to compete, if you lower tariffs again this half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think the issue of premium is something that has continued from last year. It just happened that our competitors further reduced through significant promotions, so they further reduced their effective rates.</p>
          <p>We have reviewed our plan into the second half. We have reduced our pricing to be much more competitive. We probably will still have a premium of about 10% to 15%.</p>
          <p>We are concerned about the network quality, if we do get significant elasticity. So we have responded, and we are seeing good results already in the immediate short-term, but we are cautious about the implications on the network going forward.</p>
          <p>In terms of where we think we will be, I mean we don't have as much headroom as we would like to have. Whilst we have &#x2013; a significant amount of work has already been carried out, we did realize that from a transmission point of view, that was quite a bottleneck that is being worked on.</p>
          <p>So we will be more competitive. We don't expect to be more than &#x2013; between 10% and 15% premium. And we will see how that impacts on the network.</p>
          <p>The other issue is that we are in the process of introducing MTN Zone throughout Nigeria, and that will help us to manage the demand on the network on a real-time basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sifiso, it's Franca from HSBC. You made a general comment in the beginning of your presentation. You were talking about the fact that the &#x2013; your revenue loss in terms of drop-in tariffs is not compensated by increase in tariff &#x2013; increase in traffic, sorry. I just wanted to understand, is that a general comment throughout the Group or is it a specific comment that's impacting certain regions? So you're saying the elasticity is less than one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That was a general comment across the Group. I think the issues that we didn't have to look at each operation on its own in terms of the actual detail, in terms of what exactly is the price drop and what exactly is the kind of elasticity. But as a general comment, our experience in the recent past was that we're not getting elasticity greater than one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you clarify which areas in particular are concerning to you and which are not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly Nigeria is the biggest concern. But then again, it's also a question of what is the level of decline. You'll probably find maybe a 10% decline won't give you an elasticity closer to one, but a 30% decline could have given you an elasticity that's slightly above one.</p>
          <p>So one does expect in the different markets that, depending on what the decline in the tariff rate is, you're likely to get a point at which you can get elasticity levels that are greater than one. But you have to analyze it on a market-by-market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Chris Grundberg from UBS. Just one &#x2013; or three quick ones, actually.</p>
          <p>On the procurement number that you gave earlier, the 40% to 45% now being centralized, what sort of target do you have that for that on a medium-term view? Is that going to go much higher or is that largely done now?</p>
          <p>And as an extension to that, of all the kind of centralization of your costs, can you give any sense of how much of a margin attrition you have over the next couple years or how much those initiatives are likely to give you?</p>
          <p>And then as a follow-up to the earlier comments on Nigeria, when are you likely to launch MTN Zone? Is that something that could come about in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with your last question. We have already starting trialing it. We have launched it in the regions that we have Ericsson as the vendor, and we are in the process of launching in other regions, which has been Huawei. So we hope that within the next two months, we definitely will have it launched across the organization.</p>
          <p>In terms of our procurement centralization, there's an issue. The first thing is that we have, for example, the significant part of our CapEx has been centralized for quite some time, the issue has been bringing in the other categories in areas such as marketing spends and in the commercial parts of the business.</p>
          <p>So where we will end up is also a function of how we are wanting to organize, in the sense that we are now going to put our overall procurement under a single organization. So if you look at it from that perspective, you can assume that theoretically 100% of our procurement is going to be centralized, although it will be a centralized organization with people that are sitting in the operations as well. We believe that that will enable us to streamline our processes, and then also at the same time, have much better control on our suppliers and how we negotiate and manage our suppliers.</p>
          <p>And then I think on the issue of the margin, I think the question was whether we have a target. We really have not set any specific target from that procurement perspective. I think we've always looked at it from an overall perspective that as the challenges of revenue pressures driven by price declines, we need to be managing the rest of our business such that we can still maintain margins in the region of 43% to 45%. That's the way that we've generally looked at it.</p>

          <p>No, no, I'm talking in the emerging markets. Let's talk the emerging markets, particularly in China, in Brazil, in India.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should never say never, okay? But at this stage, I don't think that there's any obvious opportunities that make themselves available. But we will continue looking at opportunities that are value-accretive generally in any part of the developing world. But I mean at this stage, I don't think there is any obvious opportunity that would meet the criteria you're speaking about.</p>
          <p>I guess in terms of converged services, our intention, yes, is to provide converged services. But I guess the key issue for us would be that the services would be primarily off a mobile platform. We have no intentions of developing, let's say, a fixed-line infrastructure.</p>
          <p>And hence the comment that we made earlier on, that when we look at ICT services, we are looking primarily at being able to utilize the existing infrastructure. And hence it's important for us to acquire additional spectrum, especially for LTE, and be able to deliver services that would have been considered as converged services in the fixed mobile different world.</p>

          <p>Sifiso, Johan Snyman, Renaissance Capital. Good morning. Just two quick ones.</p>
          <p>You made the reference to potential tower sharing deals in Cote d'Iv&#xF4;ire and Cameroon. How many towers will be affected? And you gave a bit of color on effective tariff declines in Nigeria and Ghana. Can we have a number on SA, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The actual numbers of towers in Cote d'Iv&#xF4;ire and Cameroon is 900 and 400. The decline in South Africa is probably anywhere between 5% and 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Irnest Kaplan. Just on Nigeria again, you mentioned that you have reduced your tariffs already in the second half of the year, but what's your feeling about future tariff declines over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me not say they've actually reduced as we speak today. Let me say that they are plans, which we have agreed &#x2013; which they are implementing. As to whether they've actually implemented today, I'm not too sure.</p>
          <p>Look, we're quite concerned about where the pricing is, in terms of our competitors. Because if one just does some rough calculations, we think that some of our competitors are probably selling minutes as low as $0.03, $0.04 per minute, and we think that the cost structures in that environment are such that that's probably very much at the low end.</p>
          <p>If one looks at what has happened in other markets where there has been aggressive price competition, is that, yes, that goes on for a period of about 12 to 18 months. But at some stage, there is a general push upwards.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to be competitive. We will do what we need to do to be able to protect our margins. But at the same time, we just need to make sure that in protecting our margins and protecting our position, we are still able to build sufficient on subscriber growth and whatever value there is in the market for the future.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter here from RMB Morgan Stanley. Just two questions. The first one, if you can touch a bit on regulation in Nigeria. Has the review of <mark type="ph" /> MTR (01:14:49) started? And mobile number portability you just give us an update on that?</p>
          <p>And the second one would just be South Africa, a very good performance. How do you feel about going forward? Is that sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:16:04) can comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody. I mean South Africa, it's a very competitive market. So can we sustain the good performance for the past six months? Not to the same level, but we can sustain up to a percentage of that. I mean we have a lot of good things in the pipeline that we think will maintain similar levels. That's the short answer. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of regulation in Nigeria, yes, there is an intention to implement mobile number portability.</p>
          <p>I guess we can only use experiences in other countries to indicate what is likely to happen. And it's really not been that successful, primarily because SIM pricing is so low, and these markets accept the issue of multi-SIMing as a way of life. So I don't think mobile number portability is going to be significantly different in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>In terms of other regulatory issues, you are aware we have had the discussions and the agreement with the regulator in terms of network quality issues. We were penalized. We've paid the price. And we have now a new set of KPIs that have been agreed, which we believe are much more realistic.</p>
          <p>There may be consideration in relation to termination rates, but at this stage, there doesn't seem to be that much pressure, but it could be something that could be considered some time later this year or into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:18:18). Possibly a question &#x2013; a follow-up question to Karel. You mentioned that you won't be able to sustain the good performance that you've already had. Are you seeing any negative effective of the current pricing war that's going on, particularly by Cell C and obviously Vodacom with a lot of recently good promotional effort, particular in the data space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I did say not to the same level. I mean I did say also that I think we can sustain good results for the next six months.</p>
          <p>If you look at the tariffs at the moment, I keep saying we've got a lot of things in our arsenal. I think MTN Zone specifically gives us a capability that really, you've seen the good growth in prepaid revenues. So we find that there is still a lot of elasticity, the question earlier.</p>
          <p>So certainly in certain percentage drops, we've seen certainly elasticity of way above one. Not way above. 1.1, 1.2. So that's certainly a very big positive.</p>
          <p>And that product and the way we take it to market is very different from some of our competitors that are just going out with a pure pricing positioning here. I think one of the biggest problems with some of that positioning is that it does bastardize your existing base and revenues because &#x2013; especially if it's targeted to the segments, that is already your existing base.</p>
          <p>So certainly on the voice side, we feel still very competitive, and we have a lot of capability to compete.</p>
          <p>If you look at the data side, you've seen some new offers that we bring into the market, and you'll see some other things we're going to do to &#x2013; I think &#x2013; I suppose watch this space. I don't want to talk too much about what we're bringing out in the new products. But I mean we are &#x2013; we will maintain competitiveness. That's maintaining, let's say, profitable value in data, and not just unprofitable. I mean that's the short answer -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's important that there's clarity. We will maintain competitiveness. We have no intentions of losing our share of value. And we will make sure that we are able to at least sustain our share of value.</p>
          <p>If, as a direct result of aggressive pricing competition, the overall market value declines, we will just make sure that whatever our proportion is does not necessarily decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a couple of questions from the web, firstly for Nazir. How do you see the capital structure of the company evolving over the medium term? Specifically any debt-to-equity and EBITDA targets? And then also probably quite related to that is your outlook for dividend payout ratio post-2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, for those who haven't heard, I mean question was really around how the Group thinks about its capital structure, and any views on the payout ratio going forward.</p>
          <p>I think the short answer to this really is that the Board set out a call some years back, about two years ago, to find more efficient ways of returning cash to shareholders. And up to now, we've demonstrated the commitment to that objective by increasing the payout quite sharply, which I believe in mid-year 2010 was at about 25% of earnings to what it is now 72% of earnings.</p>
          <p>As to whether the Board in its wisdom decides to pick that number up is entirely at the discretion of the Board, but suffice to say that it considers this on a regular basis.</p>
          <p>The other commonly asked question, I guess, leading into capital structure &#x2013; is there a Board view on the ideal of sort of debt/equity structure for the company? And I guess without having formalized that in any discussion thus far, I think the way you could look at it, based on a range of possibilities, is the Board has an appetite for debt on the balance sheet up to a certain level. And I think whatever we saw at the time of the <mark type="ph" /> investment (1:22:57) transaction was probably the highest the board would ever go.</p>
          <p>But given that we are fairly far off that right now, it's really a theoretical discussion, and there's really nothing on the landscape in terms of transformational-type deals that would warrant a further review of that particular strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, and then just <mark type="ph" /> also (1:23:20) from the web, just on Nigeria, would you expect to get the bigger share of gross and net additions in the second half of this year, compared to what you got in the first half? Also, how do you plan to compete in Nigeria, given the high levels of multi-SIMing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, overall, we would like to see ourselves in a much better position than we were.</p>
          <p>I think the plans that have been put forward specifically around pricing and how we go to market and our SIM offerings, we firmly believe that they will put us in a much better position than we were in the last half.</p>
          <p>I think multi-SIMing is a reality of those markets, and we just need to be able to continue to make sure that our SIM remains the primary SIM. It's very difficult to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:23:53) in the sense that, there will always be promotions, there will always be, let's say, aggressive promotions that are attractive whether for a day or for a weekend or at night.</p>
          <p>So what we just need to continue doing is making sure that the primary SIM remains an MTN SIM, and accept that multi-SIMing is a reality of those markets.</p>
