          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Larry and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. John Colglazier. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today for Anadarko's fourth quarter and year end 2011 conference call. We also look forward to hosting you at our Investor Conference here in The Woodlands on March 13, where we will provide a more in depth look at the growth and value creation opportunities our portfolio can deliver as well as discuss our 2012 capital program and guidance.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that today's presentation will contain our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases, for the risk factors associated with our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures. So be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our website. We encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call. And we've included additional information in our quarterly operations report on our website.</p>
          <p>In just a moment, I'll turn the call over to Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, who will discuss our 2011 results. Jim is joined by other members of our executive team who will be available to answer questions later in the call.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. Anadarko had a strong finish to an excellent operational year, leading to record sales volumes, strong cash flows and industry leading exploration success. In 2011 we delivered sales volumes at the high end, while holding capital expenditures at the low end of guidance.</p>
          <p>We continued to drive improvements in drilling efficiencies across our U.S. onshore operating areas and this contributed to record sales volumes of 248 million barrels of oil equivalent, while spending less than anticipated in cash capital and achieving the best safety performance in the company's history.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are well on our way toward meeting our objective of 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves by year end 2014. We replaced 159% of our produced reserves at competitive cost this past year and ended the year with approximately 2.54 billion barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves, which is a 5% increase over year end 2010 and was accomplished almost entirely through the drill bit. Our record sales were driven by a 10% year-over-year increase in liquids volumes, which averaged more than 290,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter approximately 70% of our crude oil volumes received waterborne pricing, resulting in an overall oil price realization of $11 per barrel above WTI. We also benefited from NGL volumes, receiving 59% of WTI pricing through our ability to access Mont Belvieu in the premium Gulf Coast markets.</p>
          <p>These results demonstrated our liquids focused capital allocations are working. At year end 2011, liquids comprised 43% of our total sales volumes, delivering an incremental 70,000 barrels per day or a 31% increase since 2008, when we began targeting liquids rich areas of our portfolio. We plan to continue this capital allocation approach that will drive us toward higher liquids production in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter results provide an excellent illustration of the significant liquids growth achieved in several of our core operating areas. For instance, in the Wattenberg Field, which we'll talk more about momentarily, we achieved a 24% overall sales volume increase over the fourth quarter of 2010, with liquids from the field increasing at twice that rate, adding almost 13,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Comparing year-over-year gross exit rates in the Eagle Ford Shale, we achieved an increase of approximately 50,000 barrels per day from our 10 rig program, representing 185% growth. We remain one of the largest producers in this highly economic area with a gross production exit rate of approximately 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and with liquids comprising approximately 65% of the production stream.</p>
          <p>Collectively shales have become a material contributor to our portfolio. In 2011, our shale plays delivered a year-over-year sales volume increase of almost 200%. Shale volumes now account for slightly more than 10% of our total company sales volumes, up from less than 1% two years ago. Shales also represent about 5% of Anadarko's total proved reserves.</p>
          <p>In addition to the growth we have realized in the shale plays to date, we're very excited about our horizontal Wattenberg opportunity in Colorado. It's not easy to find a billion barrel field, so to have this kind of opportunity in your own backyard is especially unique.</p>
          <p>In November, we announced the potential of 500 million 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent of liquids rich net resources, which is accessed by applying horizontal drilling technology to the Niobrara and Codell formations that are underlying our 350,000 net acre position in the Wattenberg Field.</p>
          <p>The Wattenberg horizontal program has all the key components of a major resource play. Its exceptional economics are driven by estimated ultimate recoveries of between 300,000 and 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well. High quality, liquids rich reservoirs, very competitive development and drilling cost, currently estimated at around $4.5 million per well, a premier land and mineral position, operation of and access to existing infrastructure and extensive knowledge of the subsurface as a result of years of activity in the area.</p>
          <p>As the largest producer in Wattenberg and in anticipation of the significant growth offered by the new Wattenberg horizontal program, we took strategic steps to enhance the alignment of our upstream and midstream assets in the region by purchasing the Wattenberg plant early in 2011. This acquisition, combined with existing infrastructure and the Western Gas Partner affiliates purchase of the Platte Valley plant, provides us with substantial operated processing capacity in the Wattenberg Field and greater Denver-Julesburg Basin.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter Wattenberg averaged approximately 76,000 barrels of oil a day equivalent, with a growing liquids composition. We look forward to updating you on Anadarko's Wattenberg horizontal activities and plans for 2012 and beyond at our Investor Conference next month.</p>
          <p>Adding to our liquids growth profile in 2012 and beyond, we made significant progress in our megaprojects, all of which are oil focused. In the Gulf of Mexico we are currently installing the production risers at Caesar/Tonga and we continue to expect first oil sales by mid-2012.</p>
          <p>We also unitized and sanctioned the deepwater Lucius project in 2011. Fabrication on the 80,000 barrels of oil per day spar is underway and all major contracts have been awarded. We plan to bring this capital efficient project to first production in 2014.</p>
          <p>The 130,000 barrel per day El Merk project in Algeria is on target and we expect meaningful oil volumes by the end of this year. The project is now about 88% complete and our contractors continue to make excellent progress.</p>
          <p>In Ghana, our partnership is advancing the TEN Complex, which stands for Tweneboa, Enyenra and Ntomme, toward a plan of development that is expected to be completed later this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to exploration, our worldwide deepwater exploration and appraisal drilling programs continue to create differentiating value as we achieved an 80% success rate for wells completed in 2011. This success included de-risking the TEN Complex offshore Ghana that I just mentioned, as well as adjacent discoveries at Teak and Akasa.</p>
          <p>We also made our first post-moratorium discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at the Cheyenne East prospect. The well is already being tied back to Independence Hub with first production expected by the end of this quarter. We plan a return to pre-moratorium exploration levels in the Gulf this year, as we expect to participate in at least six deepwater wells.</p>
          <p>The most significant highlight of our 2011 exploration program is tripling the recoverable resource estimate offshore Mozambique to a range of 15 Tcf to 30 plus Tcf. Our 2011 activities included four successful wells and further confirmation of the connectivity and scope of this massive natural gas accumulation which is shaping up to be one of the most significant natural gas discoveries in the last decade. We recently brought a second drillship to the block to conduct testing while the other vessel continues appraisal and exploration activities.</p>
          <p>In parallel, we are working with our partners in the government of Mozambique to advance the development of an initial two train onshore liquefaction facility. We continue to target third-party reserve certification and a final investment decision around year end 2013 with first production anticipated in 2018.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we replaced 159% of our reserves in 2011 and ended the year with approximately 2.54 billion barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves. We added 377 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves from the drill bit and incurred costs of around $5.6 billion. Proved, developed reserves now comprise about 71% of our year-end total proved reserves, which is even stronger than the 69% we reported for yearend 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to the fourth-quarter financial results, we included a table in yesterday's earnings release regarding certain items affecting comparability, without which net income would have been $0.85 per share approximately. The largest of these items, which are typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates is a $1.5 billion non-cash impairment primarily related <mark type="ph" /> to our CBM properties (10:26) in the Powder River. The impairment was triggered by low natural gas prices which reduces the post-2006 acquisitions assigned carrying value of the assets. It has no impact on proved reserves.</p>
          <p>Another item is a non-cash charge of $250 million related to the Tronox adversary proceeding. We are confident about our case and are preparing for trial. We are currently engaged in the mediation process and this non-cash charge reflects the current estimate for reaching resolution.</p>
          <p>The value of our high liquids volumes generated exceptional discretionary cash flow for the year of approximately $7.2 billion, equating to $29 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is a 26% improvement over 2010. We generated approximately $625 million of free cash flow during 2011, even taking into consideration $880 million of investments associated with two strategic midstream infrastructure acquisitions in Colorado.</p>
          <p>In addition, as you are aware, resolved the dispute with BP over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon event, removing significant uncertainties for our stakeholders and returning everyone's focus to the growth and value creation opportunities in Anadarko's portfolio. We financed the settlement using $1.5 billion of cash on hand and $2.5 billion from our revolving credit facility.</p>
          <p>We ended the year with approximately $2.7 billion of cash on hand, which included the receipt of insurance proceeds related the Deepwater Horizon events and $419 million of contingent proceeds from the 2008 Peregrino sale in Brazil. We remain committed to reducing our net debt to cap level back to within our target range of 25% to 35% over the coming year and we expect to accomplish this primarily through asset sales and performance.</p>
          <p>As I stated at the beginning of the call, we had a strong finish to an excellent operational year. Recapping the fourth quarter we delivered strong liquids growth, enhanced price realizations and midstream margins, low operating costs, improved DD&amp;A from low-cost reserve additions, capital efficiency and continued exploration and appraisal success.</p>
          <p>The results of 2011 build greater momentum around our predictable and repeatable performance with unmatched exploration upside for our investors. We believe we are well-positioned to continue that success into the next decade. We hope to see all of you at our March 13 Investor Conference where we'll discuss our forward plan in more detail.</p>
          <p>With that, operator, if you would now open up for questions I'd appreciate it.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could kick off with an exploration question and then I have a follow-up, Jim, on Algeria please. Jupiter is still drilling, my recollection is that this was similar in structure to one or two of the other wells that you've drilled out there so far but it seems to be going on for quite a long time and I'm just wondering if there's a particular prognosis that one of the guys can give us there? And related, the implications of the Itauna result on the Brazilian sale process? And I have a follow-up on Algeria please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Doug. This is Bob. Regarding the Jupiter well. Yeah, it's taking a little bit longer than we've typically drilled out there and that's just typical operations. We had some things we had to do on the rig at one point in time. We're getting close to the end and we'll have information on that when we get the well down and completely evaluated. And then of course we're going to move from there over to our Mercury appraisal well and so we still got a lot of work to do there in Sierra Leone. Meanwhile we're drilling in Cote d'Ivoire on our Kosrou well, so a similar play type and looking for more success out there.</p>
          <p>Regarding Itauna, the Itauna well was not the bulk of the value there in &#x2013; the Itauna discovery is not the bulk of the value in our Brazilian assets. The two pre-salt discoveries are where the bulk of the value is. The Itauna well, we P&amp;A'd it, we had some hydrocarbons in a lower zone, the main objective for the appraisal section was wet and so we're going to roll that new data into our interpretations there on 29 and see what it tells us. But really the bulk of the value has always been in the pre-salt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Bob. I understand the sensitivities around Algeria, Jim, but I'm guessing we'd all kind of expected some news from the arbitration panel by year end. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update if whether or not you still believe that you have a good &#x2013; you're in a good position there and if so when we're likely to hear something and I'll leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Doug. And I understand that. We would have loved to have had a resolution to that here for you today. But it's not a court of law where we have a specific time to decision. It's an arbitration panel and so we still feel it's imminent. We will update you obviously immediately once we have some results on that. And I think it's upside for our investors if we are successful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great stuff. Thanks, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra of Jefferies. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was curious, Jim, if you thought this was the year that you see Gulf of Mexico volumes either stabilizing and if it's possible that even this year, later this year, that you see Gulf beginning to reverse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I do think that within the next two to three years for industry as a whole we'll end up being back to pre-moratorium levels with much longer &#x2013; with meaningfully longer lead times between actually trying to get a well ready to be drilled and getting it permitted. But I think those will all stack up to where it will be back to previous activity levels.</p>
          <p>In our particular case as I mentioned, from an exploration perspective, we're definitely going to be back to pre-moratorium levels as a company this year. From a development and develocat standpoint, it may be a little slower still for us as well. But I do think the signs are very positive and we're taking advantage of that with the drilling activity we see for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jim, you say pre-moratorium levels, is that in terms of activity or in terms of net volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's in terms of drilling activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, Independence Hub is on a decline so we're overcoming that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And do you think the net volumes achieve sort of a &#x2013; sort of flat line at some point this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you look out, the industry suffered a very significant decline in production during this moratorium followed by the permit-torium and I'm not sure that the industry as a whole can catch back up to the pre-moratorium levels, just because of the significance of the decline. I think in Anadarko's case, with the placing Caesar/Tonga on production we should see a very nice bump toward mid-year this year and that'll make up a fair share of the loss that we've had during this moratorium period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks and a final one. And Joe, I think you mentioned that the 25%, 35% debt ratio target, asset sales and execution. So on the asset sales is I suspect Brazil is the most significant part of that. Is there anything else proposed for sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob Gwin. We've just begun marketing our Indonesian assets. That's something that we'll be working on here in the coming months. In addition, although it's relatively small, a little less than couple of hundred million dollars, we've recently signed a couple of PSAs for some sale of some gas properties in South Texas. And there is always things that we're doing within the portfolio that don't rise to really what I'd call level of materiality, but in the aggregate, they add up over the course of the year that we continue to work on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, everybody.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Joe Allman of JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim, in terms of the Tronox litigation, <mark type="ph" /> could you (19:02) describe why you're confident about your position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I might have Bobby Reeves do that if you don't mind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, good morning. Look, this is a case that has some very unusual claims and we believe it's pretty simple as to what the law provides and we're confident that the testimony when presented to the court will go in our favor. We're involved in reviewing the expert testimony through depositions right now. We still have a lot to go before trial with some motion practice and what have you. But we're confident about our case. But as Jim said, anytime you have a complicated case like that it makes sense for the parties to look at potential resolution and that's what we're doing in mediation and that's what this charge relates to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then just a separate topic, I was struck by looking at your operations report at the growth in natural gas in a couple areas, in particular East Texas Haynesville and Pinedale. So could you describe what's really driving the growth in those two areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, in East Texas we're in a unique position in Panola, Henderson County areas where our Cotton Valley and Haynesville production has some liquids <mark type="ph" /> associated with (20:15) primarily our Cotton Valley production, we're starting to drill horizontal wells, seeing very good results at our old properties like Southeast Carthage and Central Carthage JV. So we've just taken on a horizontal program with five or six rigs to knock out those opportunities and they have good economics, they're reasonably liquids-rich, and we have good contracts in the areas, so we get good netbacks and the combination of all that adds good economics to our system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you targeting the &#x2013; the Taylor and Davis sands there in the Cotton Valley?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just the Cotton Valley section that we're working through.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim. That was actually a perfect segue for my question. As you think about going the other direction, <mark type="ph" /> with low (21:17) natural gas prices, the only area that you were really drilling dry gas was the Marcellus. You've had a couple wells that you're completing in the Utica. Can you talk about that region in general as far as activity levels for 2012 and what that means from a capital spending as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Chuck. We really haven't finalized our 2012 activity yet. But our company <mark type="ph" /> activity (21:42) has been around seven rigs in the Marcellus so &#x2013; and Chesapeake is drilling 12 to 13 rigs in our JV area. They, as you've seen in the press, they've mentioned they're moving down on their rig count. We're using our rigs &#x2013; we're going back and forth to the Utica to drill wells with those rigs and if we have a better liquids rich opportunity for those rigs we'll take advantage of it. The economics we still see in the Marcellus are good, we're in a very high delivery, high value area and we'll need an opportunity to substitute them out, <mark type="ph" /> but in the event we (22:18) can come across that opportunity we will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just generally speaking, as you think about 2012 production and CapEx, can you give just a bread box, higher or lower than 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think what we can say on the CapEx piece of it is just that we are still committed to staying within cash flow. As you look at the current strip prices, David, we should be underneath that and we'll give you more details around that when we get to the March Investor Conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of things. Let me go back to Mr. Heikkinen's question real quick. In the last couple of years your production growth has been at single-digit, 5% to 6% kind of guidance is that, can you &#x2013; to take David's term, can you bread box it any more than that? I mean is that generally what we should be looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Al, I think you can expect that that's a reasonable assumption. I think we've projected 7% to 9% compounded over a five-year period. But in any given year we may be below that 7% to 9%, you've seen 6% in some recent years for us. As you think about CapEx for us next year &#x2013; just to come back to Jim's comment, in addition to saying that we think in the current strip we're going to be cash flow positive, you can expect that capital number to be below 7%.</p>
          <p>So, as we think about growth as it relates to our spend next year, we got a lot of things of which production growth would be a part of the equation. But, I don't think we're married to having <mark type="ph" /> to deliver (24:05) 7% to 9% growth in any given year if we in fact don't see good well head economics. And in the current world where we've got $3 or less gas, we're not going to pursue production growth where we don't think we have good well head economics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No I appreciate that. That's helpful. And then whoever wants to take this, asset sales. I know you mentioned potentially looking at the other things to divest, what &#x2013; can you give us any indications there what you'd be looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bob. David, really at this stage we can't. We will expect to get bids in here on Brazil now that the appraisal wells have been drilled, we'll expect bids here in the coming weeks and if any of them are attractive obviously we'd expect pursue a sale there. If they are not, as you know we manage the portfolio fairly aggressively, understand where we can make the most money and where assets fit into our multi-year growth plans for production reserves and we continually evaluate that and we'll continue to do so. I think by the Investor Conference we'll have some clarity around Brazil certainly, and it will enable us to speak in a little more definitive terms about direction for the balance of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one more. I don't believe it was any of you but somebody made &#x2013; from Anadarko made some comments about &#x2013; I think it came out of the international side, but made comments about CFTC and potential margin requirements and the impact that would have on producers given there is a decision apparently coming in the next couple weeks. Can you &#x2013; can anybody there address that and kind of your stance on that, what impact you think it would have on the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Scott Moore. Our comments were more just hypothetical for any producer, if you have to collateralize your derivates position, that cash flow has got to come out of somewhere and so that's the concern of the industry. If the regulators try and protect consumers taking capital out of producers' pockets isn't really going to help consumers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been weighing in on that politically through several different associations and we'll continue to try to do that. We'll see where it ends up, but we feel good about the relative cash flow CapEx dynamic for our company as we mentioned for this year and I presume for future years, that we don't have to live outside of cash flow and therefore some of this is a bit of &#x2013; we've done hedging tactically, not long-term and if we didn't have as much of that accessible to us, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but we still think it's important for the commodities side of the business to be active for the industry and so we'll continue to fight for the right answers there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, just a few follow-up questions. In the Wattenberg field, the 11 horizontal wells that are on line, can you give us a break down of how many of those are Codell versus Niobrara wells, and any comments on how the performance between those two horizons varies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In the original 11 wells, I think nine of them were Niobrara wells and two of them were Codell wells. The performance we've seen between the two reservoirs is very similar, they're outstanding. That's part of the reason you are starting to see our growth in liquids, we were up 10% year-over-year and a fair share of that's coming from Wattenberg.</p>
          <p>If you look quarter-to-quarter, we continue to see growth in Wattenberg and we are now approaching 80,000 barrels a day of production from the field in which roughly half of it's liquids and the target lines that we're picking in both the Codell and Niobrara, we're starting to hone in on the various parts of the field that have better production characteristics from each and then targeting that interval.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, sticking with that area, outside of the Wattenberg, how does your sort of testing program, how are the results of that looking in southeastern Wyoming and north of the Wattenberg in Colorado, any recent results to speak to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue our program. We slowed it down. We are now running two rigs between the Powder River Basin and the Greater DJ. We've had mixed results, originally. They are improving with time. We are now focused more on the Niobrara, Codell section in the Greater DJ and working a number of horizons in the Powder River Basin including the Sussex, the Shannon, the Mowry and other intervals. We have the great advantage of having that large mineral position in the Greater DJ which gives us access to more data and as well as having offset information from other industry players. So we're just soaking it all in. We're putting together our plans for execution in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then going back to a couple of the recent questions, over time if you are able to live within cash flow, you mentioned that you would like to get to the 25% to 35% debt-to-cap range this year, what would your priorities will be for free cash-flow over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean, obviously, we are currently rated BBB- from a credit perspective, if we were towards the lower end of that 25% range we'd probably &#x2013; I would expect would be a stronger credit quality. And we've got lots of places to go invest capital. It's our strategic approach to live within cash flow because we think it's appropriate to have that discipline, but with all the exploration success that we've had over time there is lots of growth potential in this company to the extent we had additional free cash flow I think you could expect us to push on that accelerator a little bit and drive toward marginally higher growth rates, still, staying true to that capital structure.</p>

          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, so Independence Hub is running around 4.25 right now gross, is that about where it's right now. And with Cheyenne East, what does that get gross production back up to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was running 4.25 in the fourth quarter is actually currently running more on the 3.75 range with one additional well we've watered out during the course of the fourth quarter and what we see with Cheyenne East is taking us back up to that 4.25 range. That well was drilled last year, it's now being completed and will be put on line before the end of this quarter and you should see a volume pop back up accordingly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you doing any other drilling around Cheyenne East or does gas prices sort of impact your thoughts of trying to grow that back to sort of max capacity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't &#x2013; at these gas prices, we certainly don't see further investment in Independence Hub. We have a lot of opportunity out there, there is a number prospects that we could take advantage of, but it will take higher gas prices than these. Frankly, we want to use our rig resources and assets to expand our oil portfolio in the Gulf of Mexico including Heidelberg, Shenandoah, Spartacus those types of prospects and those are all coming this year, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate that and in the Niobrara Wattenberg area, you seem to have provided an inordinate amount of emphasis in your operational update as well your prepared comments. Are you guys kind of leading into potentially looking at finding a JV partner or some sort of monetization here? Just kind of the thoughts around the emphasis on that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the emphasis is associated with great performance. The field areas just done fantastic for us. We continue to grow it like we've talked about earlier and the wells that we have in that area have performed very well with EURs from 300,000 to 600,000 barrels for less than $5 million wells. And so the economics are fantastic. I don't see us doing a JV in Wattenberg proper for quite some time as we accelerate our production profile out there and it's better than 50% liquids in all areas and 70% in the areas we're focusing on. So I think you'll see us continue to invest in that and continue to grow our volumes as we indicated in our release several months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's got short-dated cash cycling and we de-risked it. So it's not an ideal candidate in any case, even for investors, I think areas outside of that are where you would look harder.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And, is that something that I mean, could be a 2012 type of event, it sounds like you scaled down the drilling outside of the Wattenberg proper but where do we go from here?</p>

          <p>Real quickly following up on the Niobrara a little bit and just generally your liquids growth. If you kind of keep that trajectory of 10% liquids growth year-over-year can you talk a little bit about what your bigger picture is for the liquids pricing environment in the States and then obviously you have the infrastructure in Wattenberg to deliver the growth. Can you talk a little bit about what the Eagle Ford and Permian look like for your guys on liquids levered growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We, as far as the liquids pricing environment have been experiencing obviously very strong recent pricing relative to WTI. That's been in part due to the fact that your downstream markets connect to global waterborne Brent pricing as well as extremely strong petrochemical demand. And <mark type="ph" /> we think on a go-forward, (34:26) long-term basis that U.S. petrochemical consumption will remain very strong and that global oil pricing remains strong. So, we like that aspect of the market for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we continue make infrastructure improvements in South Texas, et cetera and the objective as Scott mentioned is to get as much to places we like to market from whether or not we control that infrastructure and we've done a lot of work in that area, making sure that we are able to keep pace with our production growth and I think it's worked pretty well.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then maybe digging into the Bone Springs a little bit. Can you talk to us a little bit about the well cost and well designs that generated the IPs that you released in your Ops update?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The Bone Springs play of course is out in the Permian Basin, western Permian Basin. We currently have four operated rings and four non-operated rigs on average running in that area. Our current production now is approaching 22,000 barrels on a gross basis of oil and about an equivalent amount of gas.</p>
          <p>Our well designs are into the Bone Springs are horizontal wells, 5,000 foot laterals, they've been running us between $6 million and $7 million apiece and we've been looking at EURs in and around 400,000 barrels equivalent from the wells. Most of which of course is oil and it's very rich gas so we have a good NGL stream coming off the gas and the economics are strong and we've been fracking with 12 to 15 stages on an average and just having great results. Our execution has been good, our well costs have been coming down, our drill times have been down, our cycle times on our completions have been coming down. And so, we're just now starting to get into what I would refer to as a manufacturing mode where we're doing additional pad drilling and density drilling of various sections. So our economics are actually improving.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you for the clarification there. And then maybe just one question on Mozambique. In the past, you guys have talked about finding a partner to build and market the LNG there. What's the latest thoughts given kind of your resource potential and the size of the play at this point?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Al. I think you can continue to expect that that's part of the algorithm for us. The timing of it could in fact, as I've indicated in the past, be post FID. On the other hand, I'm not opposed to and we are not opposed to seeing something pre-FID if we see something real attractive. So, I would say just so that one's on a coming attraction basis.

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. A couple questions, first on Ghana, can you talk to where you see the production trajectory heading first over the course of this year as some of the phase I sidetracks you referenced come on and then where you see production relative to the 120,000 barrel a day capacity once IA comes on, which I guess would be essentially at full by the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, this is Chuck. I think the information Tullow's put out is along our expectations, you know what they intend to do is sidetrack three additional wells that were drilled in phase I, the first which was the J7. Production from it looks good, it's strong. They are ramping it up to over 5,000 barrels a day. They are going very slow with the ramp up, doing lots of reservoir testing trying to figure out what we're &#x2013; what's actually happening in the reservoir with regard to the plugging of the gravel-pack screens.</p>
          <p>I think all the testing to date, both pressure and production testing, reservoir modeling, and the fact that we're seeing no pressure depletion of any significance anywhere in the field, in fact, we're seeing pressure build in a good share of the field, is the evidence that this is a mechanical problem associated with our screens. The sidetrack should take that into account and repair that problem, just essentially opening up the screen so these small fines can flow through and we'll catch them on the FPSO.</p>
          <p>And then later in the year we will start our phase 1A drilling, and that's five producers and three injectors. The combination of all that work should that build back volume. What we're going to have to do during the interim is &#x2013; within the field is as we drill on a drill center and shut in some production around that drill center to accommodate our drilling plans, what we're seeing is a steady climb but 70,000 to 90,000 barrels a day in 2012 and then pushing upwards from that in 2013 once the work is completed and I think that's a reasonable expectation particularly given the success of our J7 sidetrack and sorting out this field problem.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And then in some of the earlier questions you kind of talked around, well Independence Hub needs gas prices to be higher and Marcellus shale it would be great if gas prices were higher. When you think about capital allocation can you talk to what gas price it would take given all the opportunities you have in your portfolio for you to allocate more capital to some of the drier gas drilling in the Marcellus and the Haynesville and Independence Hub or other parts of your onshore portfolio?</p>

          <p>Higher. Brian, this is Al. It's just &#x2013; I think as you can probably appreciate, it's very basin specific, it's play specific, the type of things we need to see in gas price for drilling a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico, to produce through Independence Hub would be very different for the same economic equation in the Marcellus. And also gas price discoveries, we're continuing to see that basis is changing in the Marcellus from where it used to be relative to Henry Hub. So I think we're monitoring those pretty darn closely. I think today, like many of our industry peers and certainly you've heard us talk in the past, we are moving more towards oily and liquids rich opportunities in order to be able to survive a sub $3 gas world.</p>
          <p>It's not attractive and I'd challenge very many places to be able to explain how you get positive well head economics at sub $3. So, the answer is just simply higher, it's going to be better but it's very basin, very play specific, and I think in our case given the portfolio that we've got and the ability to move capital around and not be dependent upon one or two types of plays or being overly dependent upon natural gas as a hydrocarbon product.</p>
          <p>You can see in our results, we've been trying where we can to move to more liquids and more oil opportunities and I think you should just expect that will continue to occur and hopefully at some point industry will start to see some balance between supply and demand and P will move back up the curve.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, just &#x2013; this is Jim, there is a lot of flexibility there to go back to gas if we need to, but I might remind you, we started this process in 2009. We haven't really changed since then and prices have been far excess of $4 a dekatherm during that period. And so our view as Al mentioned is the relative oil economics are still so attractive that you still need to have gas come up a fair degree before we'd start relocating capital to gas. That's unlike some of our peers perhaps because of the flexibility that's inherent in the portfolio, but we have a lot of flexibility to go back to that when and if cash flows support it, we think the economics do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups on Africa. Can you give some idea of timing on the two wells you've got in Cote d'Ivoire, what you're targeting there. Then also its looks pretty clear that the TEN Complex in Ghana is probably going to get an FPSO dedicated to it, what's the timing on West Cape Three Points, when do you think you'll make a decision on a standalone development there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Bob. I'll start with Cote d'Ivoire drilling and then I'll ask Chuck to take over on the sanctioning. On the Cote d'Ivoire drilling, we're drilling at Kosrou right now, and the target there is the same as what we've been looking for in the West African margin is the Jubilee look-alike sands, cretaceous age fan systems. We think that we've got some good prospects there in Cote d'Ivoire with Kosrou and then followed on by Paon. So we'll see what we find in there.</p>
          <p>I'd say the timing on Kosrou is that it's got a couple of months to go, I mean, we're just getting underway we've top set both of them and now we're now back on Kosrou getting ready to really start the drilling. And I'd expect maybe end of the quarter results on it, and then moving into Paon.</p>
          <p>We also announced last week or signed last week two additional blocks in Cote d'Ivoire adjacent to our CI-105 block that we're going to be the operator of. So we do think there is a lot of potential in Cote d'Ivoire and we're setting ourselves up for success with the additional acreage acquisition.</p>
          <p>With the TEN Complex, we've got a lot of activity going out there. And that's all driven towards getting enough information for the sanction. And as Chuck mentioned, that's supposed to happen this year and I'll let him go on to what he sees in the West Cape Three Points. We have quite a bit of activity there from an exploratory appraisal standpoint, both the Akasa and Teak areas need some additional appraisal work, but Chuck, I'll let you go on with the sanctioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just go back for a second to the TEN Complex. We're expecting FEED to be completed in the third quarter as Tullow has indicated. And then we'll make the proposals to the Government of Ghana and the actual sanction will be dependent upon when they approve that plan of development. We're hopeful that it will be this year.</p>
          <p>If you skip over to West Cape Three Points, we're evaluating really two outcomes, one is a standalone development between Teak, Akasa, Mahogany East, putting all that together in one large facility, probably another FPSO, which we are evaluating in a FEED process today and the other option would of course be tying each individual field back to Jubilee in a stage fashion. And the economics of those are being evaluated and all that's underway. We hope to conclude that work again by the end of this year, propose it to the Government of Ghana, GNPC and have a decision sometime either late this year or next year depending on when their approval process concludes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just a quick detail &#x2013; can you confirm, you said there is three side tracts at Jubilee, is that three in addition to J7 or is it J7 and another pair?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two quick questions. One is a follow-up. I didn't hear the answer on Pinedale/Jonah, why those volumes seem to be up 60% year-on-year for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, this is Colglazier. Pinedale/Jonah is a field we have less than a 10% interest in, so we're really at the mercy of when we receive information from the operator. So it's just as we get the info in, and this happened to be a good quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the other would be on the Haynesville. I take it that given you've got five rigs in East Taxes Haynesville chasing liquids you've got no rigs in the Haynesville. So you guys have a nice little laboratory of what Haynesville production looks like when you stop. Can you talk about decline rates out there that you've experienced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. We're early in a program out there &#x2013; we've drilled very few Haynesville wells. We didn't participate in the big rush a few years ago when &#x2013; if we look at the dry gas Haynesville, we see it as being breakeven at best right now and we don't have a lot of information. You might ask those that have a large Haynesville position.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the question around liquids earlier in terms of U.S. liquids, I'm just curious if there is any, let's say basin-specific kind of commentary you might make around any potential kind of tightness this year, any bottlenecks you're seeing on the processing side, at least on a relative basis, if you see any potential for varying kind of differentials on a liquids basis this year in any of the pieces of the U.S. portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key for us is making sure that our liquids reach Belvieu pricing and about 70% of our liquids are sold directly in that price, another 10% are sold in multiple markets that have to be better. So, congestion would only impact us for 20% out of Coway, which is why we partnered with Enterprise on the Texas Express project to help debottleneck that part of the grid. I think in general we're pretty careful to pay attention to make sure that our downstream takeaway matches our processing agreements and are comfortable with our position.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No, not at this stage, it's too preliminary.
