        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome here on this Thursday morning, very early in the morning. Thank you for joining us so early in the morning for the presentation of the Group Annual Results.</p>
          <p>Just a quick word by way of introduction and then I'll give the floor to Bertrand Badr&#xE9;, our CFO, to make the presentation of results, and then S&#xE9;verin Cabannes, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Sammarcelli and Bernardo Sanchez will answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Now, I think it is worth reminding you about the fact that 2011 was indeed a very exceptional year with a lot happening on the political and economic standpoints, with lot of different crises, changes in the Mediterranean region, Fukushima, and also the crisis faced last summer and the crisis in the euro zone as well as concerning the sovereign debt.</p>
          <p>And now on the whole, if the European Central Bank and European governments did make certain number of decisions that enabled things to sort of come back to normal at the beginning of this year, one still has to build confidence in the months to come, make sure that we have positive results, so that confidence is back.</p>
          <p>And in this respect, before I talk about the results, let me first talk about our universal bank model, that model that we have at the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, and it has proved to be extremely solid, resilient and relevant. And it's true that all our teams have worked very hard to support our clients. We meet a lot of different customers every week, and I think that in such difficult times, our models can really make a difference.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the results. Here we go. So into this very turbulent context, the financial results for the Group proved to be very resilient, &#x20AC;2.4 billion in the year with non-economic or non-recurring items, representing &#x20AC;850 million in the year. Therefore, we can say that the total results were &#x20AC;3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>And now, these economic pressures were observed particularly in Q4, with non-recurring items representing &#x20AC;450 million with restructuring costs; revaluations of certain portfolios and the write-down of the Greek debt were mainly responsible for this. And as I underscored earlier, we must continue to do our business as a banker. Loans are increasing by 4.4% in French Networks and 4.7% in International Retail Banking.</p>
          <p>And coming to France, I would just like to say that the momentum of loan intake inflows is very, very good, very solid, and it has outperformed economic performance, and at the end of the year, it was only &#x2013; it was in Finland that loans were not going up. So therefore, I would say that our customers, both SMEs and large corporations, are being supported by us in the developments in their business and therefore results in Q4, including investments, underscore this point.</p>
          <p>Now, you know that financing the economy will mean more reliance on markets and this is a key element. And you know that the regulatory framework has changed considerably, posing a major challenge for Europe. It's the consequence of Basel 3; less loans on bank balance sheets and market activities, and that is really the challenge that we face and that is the main challenge of our transformation.</p>
          <p>So we have preserved the first plan in 2011, euro-denominated funds, so we were number three in that respect. And we are very satisfied with the beginning of the year, because we were able to conduct about 50 different operations with companies across Europe as well as financial institutions and European countries.</p>
          <p>So we were able to combine this financing franchise and the market franchise, and it's also very important to underscore the fact that market activities are absolutely crucial for the economy and we must continues these activities, this business, in the euro zone.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we pursued our transformation process despite the fact that it was a challenging year and we were able to produce tangible results. First of all, we managed to reduce our exposure to Greek sovereign debt. In particular, we have moved to a 75% markdown, so we only have a residual exposure of &#x20AC;307 million at end of January.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, given that we have begun a process about three years ago, we also decided to reduce our risk profile in Corporate and Investment Banking. We were able to speed up asset disposals, representing &#x20AC;19 billion in all, at a limited cost in 2011. And therefore, we have reduced our balance sheet by &#x20AC;48 billion in six months, and the highlight of the quarter was as follows.</p>
          <p>Well, as you know, there was the target of reaching 9% of core Tier 1 in Basel 2.5, and we managed to reach this 9% target six months ahead of schedule. We did this at the end of December 2011. So now, we've managed to move on and we are more forward-looking with Basel III requirements to be met.</p>
          <p>Now, the first stage when it comes to this deleveraging, involves Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale CIB. You can see the reduction in the assets of SG CIB in the four quarters of 2011 with things beginning to pick up in Q4 of 2011. There was &#x20AC;13 billion of disposals of &#x2013; NBI impact is just minus &#x20AC;116 million, &#x20AC;3 billion for natural amortizations and &#x20AC;6 billion by way of loan sales, and mainly, as I said, in Q4.</p>
          <p>And these sales have improved our liquidity situation, because we have reduced our liquidity needs in U.S. dollars by &#x20AC;55 billion. The figure has moved from $100 billion to $45 billion. So we are no longer that dependent on U.S. money market fund resources, so we will maintain this independence in the future.</p>
          <p>Now, as to management of our balance sheet, we have managed to reap the benefits of these risk-weighted assets management. Now, as you can see, we have managed to proceed with a very strict control of our risk-weighted assets in the different branches, with growth at 2% a year. And we have managed to significantly reduce our RWAs in the &#x2013; French Retail Banking by minus 13% of CIB &#x2013; minus 13%.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the impact, this is the bottom of the slide, if you look at the positive impact on core Tier 1 of 50 basis points for CIB. Now, it was decided to retain our earnings within the Bank, which has provided us with an additional 50 basis points for core Tier 1 and there was &#x2013; and increase in scrip dividends. This was the choice that was made by our shareholders, to accept the scrip dividend option for dividends for 2010. Then we also managed to gain 11 bps through the buyback of our hybrids and we were also able to improve our Basel II ratio by 130 basis points.</p>
          <p>And then of course there is the negative impact of Basel 2.5, costing 81 bps, with &#x20AC;25 billion. That was the total cost. We have managed to reduce our business, reduce our assets faster than expected, and we have a new mechanism now. And we have implemented this new regulation and therefore reached the 9% target.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased to have reached this 9% target, because it just goes to show that we were able to deleverage our balance sheets, and this can also be seen through the reduction of our funding profile. Our funding profile has improved considerably. At the end of 2011, it was at &#x20AC;636 billion. And I think we can do even better. We can improve our balance sheet even further. Long-term resources are going down, and generally speaking, our long-term resources are higher than consumption. And short-term funding represents only 19% of funded balance sheet. We have a stable deposit base as well.</p>
          <p>Now, as to the long-term funding program for 2012, it's between &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;15 billion. We have already pre-funded &#x20AC;2.6 billion, and in 2012, we have already funded &#x20AC;2.8 billion to date.</p>
          <p>Now, as to exposure to sovereign debt, particularly in the five high-risk countries, exposure is rather limited now. You can see here the change, the trend, from end of December 2010 to the beginning of 2012, and this is for the five GIIPS countries. &#x20AC;307 million for Greek government bonds. We don't have any exposure as far as Portugal goes &#x2013; is concerned. And you can see that we have a very limited exposure when it comes to Ireland, Italy and Spain. &#x20AC;300 million for Ireland, &#x20AC;1.4 billion for Italy and &#x20AC;700 million for Spain.</p>
          <p>We have short maturities for these portfolios. 32% of exposure is maturing in less than 18 months, so these figures will automatically go down in the months to come.</p>
          <p>Concerning trading activities, these figures vary, and for the five countries, the figure &#x2013; the trading book exposure is &#x20AC;1.1 billion. As to our Greek subsidiary, exposure went down considerably, from &#x20AC;3.5 million to &#x20AC;2.6 million in one year, so we also proceeded to weight further allocations of provisions, bringing the loan coverage ratio to 35%. And we have also reduced reliance on Group funding, down to &#x20AC;168 million at end of 2011, with a policy of deposit inflows that are at &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, if you look at the portfolio on the whole, and if you look at exposure to private debt of risky countries, I would say that this exposure is fairly moderate, and that is excellent news for the years to come.</p>
          <p>I'd like to give the floor now to Bertrand, who will give you more details about our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. I think that the key points have already been discussed. Let's look at the details a bit. The salient point, so what you pointed out, the fact that we had achieved a risk-weighted &#x2013; we at 9% core capital. We'll spend a bit of time looking at some of the one-offs or exceptional items.</p>
          <p>But before going into those points, we would like to briefly review the five-year banking income for the Bank, and we see that we've had something pretty steady through 2011 and despite the sharp shocks, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric pointed out at the start, which affected all of our businesses, not only in CIB, which was initially impacted, we saw that over the past three years, Group revenues are around &#x20AC;25 billion, and the decline in 2011 was, to a large extent, reduced. This is due to the resilience or growth of Retail Banking in France and abroad, and the strong performance by Specialized Financial Services, which in 2011 largely offset the shock which came about with &#x2013; in a very active way as we deleveraged CIB in H2.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the results, looking at the consolidated results. Here you see Net Banking income, as I said, declined very slightly. If you look at it on like-for-like basis, by 2.5% or 3%, largely due to the decline in CIB because of market conditions and deleveraging and, to a lesser extent, the GIIPS-type businesses, this is our securities business and management, while other activities continued to raise the Net Banking income. On the operating expenses line for our costs, here we &#x2013; a direct reading of this shows a rise in expenses, either on a like-by-like basis or on common terms.</p>
          <p>But if you look at this in greater detail, you see a strong negative impact in 2011 which we allocated provisions to in 2011 for the restructuring we've announced in CIB, and when we adjust for that, when we adjust for the systemic taxes in France and to a lesser extent in the UK and Germany, then we have 1% growth, but minus 4% in Q4.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind here that you see the Bank's reaction, which was not only to deleverage, starting with CIB, but also to vigorously control costs in the second part of the year. I think this is a major message. The cost of risk is up 4%. That's a face value. But it was &#x2013; give us two contrasted pictures. First, you have the very significant impact of the provisions for Geniki and also for the &#x20AC;830 million for Greek debt. But we have a 20% decline in the cost of risk, including a risk for the year.</p>
          <p>So this has impacted the operating result. We have the two factors <mark type="ph" /> standing (18:01) against each other, but the &#x20AC;100-million result and the full-year results are explained to a larger extent by a set of exceptional items. So this shows the slight difference between the consensus figures and our figures. So I think that if you look at it in the results, it's less significant.</p>
          <p>What are the key points here? The first, unfortunately, is something we've begun to be accustomed to since the start of the crisis. This year, it was a positive impact; in other years, it was a negative &#x20AC;700 million for the quarter and &#x20AC;1.1 billion for our exceptional items.</p>
          <p>The second exceptional item, as I pointed out, is the depreciation, &#x20AC;192 million, up to 75% impairment for Greek debt, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric pointed out. The restructuring charges, including &#x20AC;230 million for CIB alone, and a number of adjustments in goodwill for losses on securities. These are small amounts, but added up, they come to close to &#x20AC;350 million.</p>
          <p>And finally, deleveraging expenses, because deleveraging isn't simply trimming the balance sheet, but as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric pointed out, it does have a cost. It was extremely <mark type="ph" /> lucky (19:26) because we are able to divest ourselves of assets in a very positive way, better than expected <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:33). &#x20AC;250 million in <mark type="ph" /> core debts] (19:36).</p>
          <p>And the last exceptional item I'd like to mention, I'll get back to that later, is the impairment on assets managed on a run-off basis, and we'll be looking at that later. &#x20AC;400 million before taxes. Now, if we adjust, I know this is going to be a complicated test to adjust this, but if you adjust our quarterly and full-year result for the sum of these positive and negative items, the net result would be &#x20AC;3.2 billion going for the year, and for Q4, we'd be closer to &#x20AC;600 million. And this shows the underlying performance of the businesses.</p>
          <p>The next page shows the decline in cost of risk across our businesses. A slight inflection in France, as we saw, with a slight uptick in H2. Regarding 2012 perspectives, so far we haven't seen any deterioration. We have remained vigilant in the conditions of economic uncertainty. That stands to reason. But now, we anticipate that we'd see the same moderate levels as at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the French Networks. The situation is quite clear. Net Banking income higher, driven by a very successful duration of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit, which is boosting NBI, but we also have the increase in the costs relating to that. There is another factor here, and this is IT spending to ensure for conversion to the IT platforms. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Credit du Nord and SocGen in France, the cost of risk is lower, and now the NBI shows a higher financial result. And here, we see the strong financial performance here with growth in deposits higher than growth in loans, 8% up deposits, 4% in loans. And as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric pointed out, we are funding the French economy. The loan-to-deposit ratio, which is an important indicator you are tracking, it rose considerably over the year.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at International Networks, here we see that in commercial terms, despite the adverse situation in some countries, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric pointed this out, we have events in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The consequences of the Arab Spring and the challenging conditions in Greece and Romania now, all of this isn't translated into a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:24) figure, which is still strong, and we have revenues rising in all countries except for Greece and Romania.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, despite the geopolitical context, we have strong growth in our Net Banking income in the Mediterranean Basin and in most of Central and Eastern Europe. The net result is &#x20AC;673 million, exclusive of Greece. Greece is important because just over half of the result is offset by losses incurred in Greece due to the impairment we've taken, as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>The key point regarding our International Networks is the tight management approach as we ensure the proper balance between loans and deposits. Here we see that it's not the case in absolutely every country, but overall, we have a 99% ratio and we want this to weigh less on the Group. So Group funding, once again, was reduced in all of the international countries.</p>
          <p>We have a third major business here. This is CIB, and this is obviously the business which was most severely affected by the highly graded situation in H2. The first half of the year was good. The second part of the year saw a dislocation of markets and a significant slowdown in capital markets, with very little in the way of issuance in this environment, which is very challenging.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, in those conditions we took reactive actions here, reducing our size of our balance sheet, reducing short-term funding for market activities, and strong deleveraging in our various activities. Here, we had net revenues roughly the same, especially for equities, 4% comparison to two years. A slight dip in Q4 versus Q3, but the equity business was driven by our equity derivatives franchise.</p>
          <p>The fixed income area was also highly impacted obviously, with a decline in comparable conditions or similar to the market. Here again, a strong rebound in Q4. Unfortunately that was offset by the weakness in the markets and issuance in terms of financing and advisory. Here again the year was marked by the environment. Our structured finance franchise made it possible to see a decline limited to 16%, so CIB proved resilient across its components.</p>
          <p>CIB deleveraged and CIB confirmed the strategy commenced four years ago with systematic de-risking. We tried to illustrate that with the three indicators you see on the chart at the top. And we could discuss the relevance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:39) all pointing in the same direction in a very significant way.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the activities being managed on a run-off basis, I see there were questions regarding this. So the quarter didn't continue the &#x20AC;100 million per quarter rate you are familiar with. There were number of points here.</p>
          <p>The first thing I'd like to point out is the deleveraging focus first on the activities operated on a run-off basis with &#x20AC;13 billion in &#x2013; so we see the two impacts are disposals and amortization, and the net value of USD-denominated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:26) was around <mark type="ph" /> 68% (26:29) year-on-year. And we are going to be continuing looking at this with CDOs, and the key point here was the valuation of our CDOs and their hedges.</p>
          <p>Now, we have a number of points. First, we adjusted our CDO values in parallel with the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:55) assessments. We didn't change method. We adjusted in the parameters, and that's the first point. Second, we had a specific thing we looked at a good deal of &#x2013; our exposure is hedged with the NBI(a)s. And here, we deemed it prudent to move to a full recording of the mark-to-market of CDS rather than neutralizing it after taking account of notional amounts of the hedge and determining our monocline reserve as we did previously.</p>
          <p>So remember that now the market has a stronger approach to NBI(a)s, first in light of what the U.S. authorities could do going forward. And second, due that &#x2013; the fact that there were a number of computations, most recently with another French bank in recent week. So the NBI(a) situation is a bit better.</p>
          <p>The mark-to-market value of our CDSs was positive and has now become significantly negative, because we didn't book the gain. Now, as a matter of conservatism, we are booking the loss. So this is a &#x20AC;400-million impact on our value before taxes, and this will in future have a different impact.</p>
          <p>The valuation of CDOs is done. The additional impairment is not something which is going to fluctuate each quarter. On the other hand, there will be a possible impact in future, depending on how the market looks at the NBI(a)s and therefore the value of the CDSs. So there could be volatility in that area in terms of hedging our exposure to NBI(a)s.</p>
          <p>The second point we'd like to <mark type="ph" /> resist (28:35) upon today is that we have to examine in greater detail. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:40) I think we have to do with greater rigor now. What we have in the &#x20AC;17 billion in assets in bad bank. Now, we see the &#x20AC;17 billion is the sum of two pools of assets of different qualities. On the one hand, you have over &#x20AC;12 billion, just over &#x20AC;12 billion in assets, which would be called good bank assets, even though technically they're in the bad bank.</p>
          <p>Now, these assets have little or nothing in the way of expected losses. It costs very little in terms of capital allocations, and we can do our arbitrage looking at the various components, as we would do with other portfolios in the Bank.</p>
          <p>So I think that the &#x20AC;12 billion, although technically still in the bad bank, should not be considered to be bad-bank assets. The key issue here has to do with the &#x20AC;5 billion remaining here. As you know, the key questions are the RMBSs and the CDOs, which account for &#x2013; about half of that is U.S. RMBSs and CDOs for U.S. RMBSs, and this is what we'll be managing through the end of 2013. So we are going to be focusing our attention on this in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding Specialized Financial Services, the positive point is that we are on the right path this year after a number of difficult years. So the path is positive and all of the Specialized Financial Services areas, despite the constraint of stability in <mark type="ph" /> long-term (30:30) standing, now the key point recently was securitization. It was successful in Germany, just under &#x20AC;700 million. So this business can be funded itself, and insurance was a very, very good year. Perhaps the best ever. We haven't got enough hindsight yet to look at that, despite the condition in life insurance in France.</p>
          <p>And if you look at last point, these are the Financial Services. So very good work, good inflows, Private Banking and TCW stabilization in a new hedge. And at Amundi, we have no change in the contribution. The net income is affected by a &#x20AC;65-million goodwill write-down and a number of minor points, joined with disputes and other things. But once again in the year and the end of the year, the performance of these businesses was very positive.</p>
          <p>Now, there were three more points that we have to look at before I give the floor to Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric. Here we see systemic taxes and the NBI(a) impact and revaluation of own debt, the 2011 impact in costs was <mark type="indiscernible" /> (32:04) France and the UK, and 2011, that cost of risk including Greek sovereign exposure is &#x20AC;190 million, of which &#x20AC;162 million in Q4, Group net income, as you see.</p>
          <p>Now, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd like to wrap up here. And 2011 was a turning point, as I think we saw, and we were able to show the resilience, also robustness, of our universal banking model and our banking areas. So we can look forward to 2012 with confidence, although with 2012, we still have limited visibility. We will continue to accentuate optimizing the Bank's balance sheet and also developing our businesses, our franchises, with a focus on the customer in the strategy.</p>
          <p>What does this mean for our business line? In the French Network, we will continue to focus on quality of service and also combining our strength with the three bank names internationally. We want to consolidate our growth strategy in line with each country, and also manage our risk areas in CIB. We want to continue the transformation, managing the situation with the environment, as I explained. The start of the year has been good in market areas and we're continuing to develop our credit distribution model and we are continuing to sell some CIB assets.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Financial Services, asset management and insurance, we anticipate higher results, developing this in synergy across the key business lines in the Group. So in 2012, we're going to continue our balance sheet optimization and continue to improve the financial structure in terms of equity, capital and liquidity, and continue the efforts begun in 2011 to reach our target for core Tier 1 according to Basel 3. We are at 9%, six months ahead of time. So I think we've completed that chapter, and now in the next few years we have to transform our Group. This affects all of our banks, all the banks, in what will probably remain an uncertain volatile environment.</p>
          <p>So now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have a few small questions regarding to your risk-weighted assets. I just want to understand, because I wasn't sure that I understood the logic behind it, so it's probably very technical. But would it be possible to explain this in simple terms?</p>
          <p>Regarding the CDOs, you said the methodology for valuation of the CDOs hasn't changed. Well, currently the value should have &#x2013; has been &#x2013; has deteriorated <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:33). What parameters has it been deteriorated on? I don't understand, because when you say you are taking the mark-to-market value of the hedges, but typically when a hedge is well designed, it's suppose to hedge or offset the loss in value of the underlying asset.</p>
          <p>So logically, they should be symmetrical, otherwise it serves no purpose to hedge unless if the insurer defaults, but apparently you didn't take that into account with the potential default of the hedge. So I don't see why you have a negative impact of &#x20AC;400 million, because typically when the issuer &#x2013; the insurer can meet its responsibilities, the valuation should be symmetrical.</p>
          <p>Another point. You said that in Q4 2011, the equity signed to the assets managed on a run-off basis are &#x20AC;4 billion. They were being managed on a run-off basis. Okay, so we've got &#x20AC;4 billion for that, of which &#x20AC;2.9 billion for the CDOs, for RMBSs. So this leaves &#x20AC;1.1 billion for the other assets, the &#x20AC;12 billion that you claim are sound assets. So that's &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;12 billion.</p>
          <p>The question is, why you are selling them? Because &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;12 billion; that's the type of weighting you could have for any asset class. So I don't see why you are focusing on them when you are trying &#x2013; claiming to improve your ratios, because they shouldn't improve your capital adequacy. Ratios is not any more than if you were to sell of your conventional loan portfolios.</p>
          <p>Now, another technical point, in the footnote, you write, in computing that &#x20AC;4 billion, that it accounts to 8% of net risk-weighted assets, 8% of RWAs. Are you saying 8% for the other businesses? Or I thought you were at 7%. Is this a new development with Basel III or is this something specific for these assets? So I think it might be good to have your insight on that point as well.</p>
          <p>And to wrap up on CIB, regarding Q4, with the pullback in funding, it's significant, down 40%, if I read that properly, because I did it very quickly. So the 16% decline for the full year is primarily what happened at the end of the year. So what portion of this can you attribute to the overall economic situation, which would appear to be fairly stable? If we could compare you to one of your competitors with general funding, the deleverage has just begun, did something go wrong or was there something specific in your organization?</p>
          <p>And one more. I think I'll stop here. No, no, I do have one more question. Now, regarding insurance, do you anticipate selling credit portfolios to insurance companies? This is becoming a fashionable thing and wouldn't it make sense to do arbitrage in this way in selling credit loan portfolios to insurance subsidiaries, which would manage these on a solvency basis, because insurance companies tend to be well capitalized?</p>
          <p>One last question regarding Greece now. Unless I'm mistaken, because I haven't had a chance to find it, I don't see any information on Q4 specifically. Okay, maybe it's in there and I didn't see it, but information on the cost of risk and net income. Maybe it's in another line, but I didn't see Greece results in &#x2013; for Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to let Bertrand answer specifically regarding CDOs and I'm going to let S&#xE9;verin discuss CDOs. And Mr. Oud&#xE9;a speaking, I'm going to just talk about the portfolio run on a run-off basis and insurance. You are precisely correct here. And this is what we want to show when we make this distinction.</p>
          <p>We have &#x20AC;12 billion which are investment grade assets and there is no reason fundamentally to deal with them differently from any the other loan in the Bank's balance sheet. It just turns out that four years ago, a request was made that securitization-type projects be segmented in this specific set of reports, but over the subsequent four years or 3.5 years, the track record of those products, the economy and the underlyings show that these assets are actually investment-grade.</p>
          <p>Indeed, as Bertrand pointed out, we manage them exactly like any loan. It's not a major issue in terms of capital constraints, no more than anything else, nor is it an issue in terms of liquidity in light of what we've sold because of the &#x20AC;12 billion. There's only &#x20AC;8.5 billion that actually requires a capital allocation. That's very small in light of the whole. So as we explained, this is simply a standard way of managing these assets, and whether or not we sell them will depend on market opportunities and management decisions.</p>
          <p>Then we have the &#x20AC;4.9 billion, of which &#x20AC;2.9 billion in <mark type="ph" /> UMBS (41:41) CDOs which aren't investment-grade and which could lead to additional allocation supervisions with a capital deduction now under Basel 2.5, and under Basel III, it's going to be higher. So that's what we are going to be working on with a limited impact on capital, because now these are activities which have a cost in terms of capital allocation, but the amount itself is quite limited in light of what we've already done on the portfolio and the provisions we've already booked. Now, that's what we can say about the portfolio being managed on a run-off basis.</p>
          <p>Now regarding insurance more generally, I think we have to move &#x2013; we have to have a clear view of the origination distribution model under Basel III, and this is a fundamental challenge for Europe. Basel III means that the banks, I believe, will continue to originate credit and will often hold them for a significant period of time, especially if you look at project financing, perhaps during the build phase when cash flows aren't certain, when there are construction-related risks on the projects, where the risk is a function of our assessment of the country, the technology, the project, the sponsor, et cetera, and then we will be distributing more in the way of the launch, especially when the cash flow is coming in to investors who are obviously interested in an area in a period when euros are going to remain low across a larger range of assets and when liquidity is high.</p>
          <p>So you have to bear in mind that these are assets which could be sold, but investors have to be in a position to understand them. So insurance companies are one among many potential types of investors. Some are currently taking on the capabilities required with the funds or anything it takes. That is only one type of potential investor, and not others.</p>
          <p>But it's important for this to be put in place swiftly in Europe. So there are three or four years for Europe to be able to fund itself this way in the run up to the Basel III requirements. This is in the interest of many parties, including customers who can do this, because going through a bank for this type intermediation could be expensive in light of the constraints on the banking industry going forward. Now, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale makes its own decisions. We &#x2013; remember that our insurance company is just one among many on the market.</p>
          <p>Now, maybe we could get back to the CDOs. This is technical issue. So the valuation of our CDOs is based on a set of parameters, as you know, including final loss, the rate of which those developments occur, and this is done, as we do it. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:25) have their methods and what we saw was that conditions were tighter, and we are just lining up with overall conditions. There is no change in method at all. And these are things which are done on a systematic &#x2013; not on a one-off basis each quarter. So hedges may not be perfect hedges. So if we were perfectly hedged in terms of maturity and amount, that would be &#x2013; wouldn't be the &#x2013; that isn't the case. So once again, we recognize a loss.</p>
          <p>So the real problem is properly recognizing and identifying the NBI(a) risk, will the company default, and when. So remember, the CDSs don't have an infinite maturity either. So you have a large number of factors, meaning that once again, as a matter of conservatism, we readjusted significantly to reduce this. And as the model &#x2013; if the situations on the market were to change over the next six months, we'd be recognizing a gain. This is complex. It's not all that easy to explain, but there is no fundamental change in method. This is simply to deal with your question.</p>
          <p>Now, there is a question regarding the cost under Basel III. So it's 125%. No change in method. So I think those are the only questions I am to answer.</p>
          <p>Yes, so S&#xE9;verin, could you say something about funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the question was were there exceptional items which affected our NBI or &#x2013; well, in Q4. Well, as we accelerated sale of part of our loan portfolio, we sold &#x20AC;6 billion and the NBI impact was mentioned here, with the reduction in the last quarter. So if you adjust for the adjustment of that, we'd be looking at an NBI decline of 10% for a year, and especially in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, bear in mind that our activity, we are very strong in structured finance. And in the last quarter of last year, there were no major projects funded. So maybe this is because there were no major projects in structured finance there, and our global capital market activities were obviously affected here with debt issuance and equity issuance. But as Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric said, this year has started up well. So apart from deleveraging and apart for the impact we mentioned on NBI, there is nothing specific.</p>
          <p>Now regarding Greece in Q4, Bernardo, in Greece in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our provisions were what we &#x2013; compliant with the rate we had mentioned before. So we allocated to risk and it was between &#x20AC;75 million and &#x20AC;80 million for the quarter. So a bit less than the slightly positive operating income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Pascal Decque from Cheuvreux. I have number of questions. There aren't that many of us here in the room, so I'll take advantage of that with a number of questions. First, with Basel III, I didn't hear you mention a new target. Now that we've moved beyond Basel 2.5, have you got more specific figures for your common equity Tier 1 under Basel III? Apparently there are some slight changes in potential treatment of insurance for you, so it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:51) just 10 basis points. Has that changed?</p>
          <p>Another question for Basel III. If your objectives at 1 January are end December 2013 for Greece, what's your run rate with Genesis? Is it still &#x20AC;100 million in provisions for a year?</p>
          <p>Then regarding the deleveraging, you didn't mention a figure for losses on sales of assets. We thought there was &#x20AC;163 million in the portfolio and BNP sold about the same, had about the same amount, and they anticipate another &#x20AC;650 million in losses in 2012. Could you give us figures for potential losses on &#x2013; other potential sales on that portfolio? What could we expect in the way of restructuring charges for CIB in 2012 in addition to 2011? And then could you give us a split between losses on CDOs at the mark-to-market value of the hedge for the NBI?</p>
          <p>And two other questions. &#x20AC;65 million in goodwill impairment; you didn't explain what business line that's occurring in. And finally, what's the prudential lever we can expect to see if all goes well of the &#x20AC;5 billion in bad-book assets you plan to sell or run off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll let S&#xE9;verin and Bertrand answer those questions. Mr. Oud&#xE9;a speaking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for Basel III, our target at end 2013 is about 9%. There remain points of uncertainty regarding regulations. You mentioned insurance, so there is still some uncertainty. Bear in mind that what we have in mind in terms of the rules for systemic institutions is that we would be a small systemic institution. So we should be between 8% and 8.5%. So we think that the target relative to the scale, as you know, which ranges between 9.5% for the biggest bank and 8% for smaller systemic institutions, we know that this target is satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Now regarding the prudential lever, I would like to point out again, this &#x20AC;5 billion including &#x20AC;3 billion in RMBSs and CDOs for them, we have about &#x20AC;3 billion deducted under Basel III, so this is a natural lever. And as naturally, these assets are either sold or provisioned. That's going to be usable. So in fact, we have a cushion, a reserve of de facto of Basel III capital which could be used. So the question is over the next three years, to what extent can we crack the CDOs in order to release the capital tied up with them.</p>
          <p>Now, next S&#xE9;verin, could you go over those other questions on CIB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First you had a question regarding restructuring charges. Well, the bulk of restructuring charges were provisioned in 2011. We'll probably have some additional amounts in 2011 on the amount of &#x20AC;50 million. Well, between &#x20AC;50 million and &#x20AC;100 million. That will still affect our costs here. Regarding disposals, we continue our deleveraging program, and here, well, it depends on the amount that's sold and on marketing conditions, but the ballpark figure would be a &#x20AC;500-million to &#x20AC;600-million impact on next year. So we're looking at some 5% on average, but it is extremely variable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that. Bertrand will answer the other questions regarding goodwill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For centralized finance, I will give you an answer which is a bit curious. You've got the CDOs and RMBSs, so they interact, so the impact will be &#x20AC;400 million. So just under a half is connected to the MBIAs and just over half is related to the CDOs on the RMBSs. So regarding goodwill, it's broken down primarily. I mentioned it specifically for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:44) &#x20AC;65 million, and the rest is in SFS.</p>
          <p>And the run rate for Greece, well, that's difficult, but we are still in the same orders of magnitude, roughly speaking.</p>
          <p>So I think we've answered those questions in that series of questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions. The first on French Networks. You have like-for-like NBI growth of 1.7%. It fell down slightly in Q4. Could you give us some information for 2012 bearing in mind that service fees and commissions tend to be under 1%? And I have a question about net interest margins. With lower volumes potentially going forward, can you re-price loans or move prices? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is the following. When we look at the cost income ratios, we see that in some areas they tend to be pretty high, in CIB Russia, or what could we expect in 2012 in those areas?</p>
          <p>And one question regarding Lyxor. Apparently 2011 was a very complex year because of the environment, and looking at trackers, in 2012 is there going to be a strategic adjustment in Lyxor or was it just a one-off issue last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois, maybe French Networks, and then S&#xE9;verin and Bernardo, you could discuss the cost income ratio in different businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the French Networks, we did have it proved at 1.7% in NBI in 2011, which comes up to 3.7% when you include Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Marseillaise de Cr&#xE9;dit, SMC. So on the other hand, it was very early &#x2013; these are early days for 2012. Everything is very hazy in macroeconomic terms, although <mark type="indiscernible" /> (57:09) we have a somewhat clearer view than we could've had two or three months ago. So we don't want to provide any guidance regarding changes in our NBI in 2012.</p>
          <p>What we can say however, to answer your question, is that we have the major issue in our Bank and in other banks, which is the change in the Livret A, savings passbook accounts. And we had good news in that the rates haven't changed. That was what we learned in January regarding February rates. We don't know what's going to happen when rates could be adjusted again in August.</p>
          <p>Now, another thing we'd like to say is that now we are in the process of re-pricing some loans. Obviously this is done in a differentiated manner, so re-pricing loans to major companies which can compare that to the cost of funding on the market. That's more &#x2013; going ahead more smoothly than with SMEs.</p>
          <p>So we have a curious situation which is contrary to what we see in other parts of the market. So re-pricing is underway in differentiated manners. So all things borne in mind, we think we should be able to keep our intermediation margin at roughly the same level it was in 2011; 45. Yes, the intermediation margin is supposed to balance loans and deposits, with deposits rising faster than loans.</p>
          <p>S&#xE9;verin, would you like to discuss the other points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Bernardo discuss the cost income ratio in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, regarding private banking, our cost income ratio rose this year. This is not an area we have &#x2013; we put in place in 2011 a cost-adjustment program. This has the cost. So we should have a more favorable trend in 2012. Well, Lyxor's business was affected by market conditions in 2011. So after that false debate that came out regarding ETFs regarding physical or synthetic, well, that's not really a debate and that naturally just fade out after ESMA intervened saying that the same two &#x2013; the risks of the replication were the same, so our strategy in Lyxor is unchanged. We are convinced of the capability of this product to grow. Obviously that's dependent on market conditions so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Oud&#xE9;a asking (1:00:19) well, maybe this is something about CIB cost-to-income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in 2011, our CIB cost-to-income ratio rose significantly. It's impacted first by the cost of restructuring. And when you look at this, you have to look at the dynamics over the course of the year, and you have to adjust Q4 for restructuring costs. So we should have a trend improvement in that.</p>
          <p>Bernardo, regarding Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding Rosebank first. That's our retail bank, the costs rose significantly this year because we decided to accelerate the merger of our two former Retail Banking entities. They were merged together faster than expected in legal terms and also in IT terms during the year. So this led to number of costs. In addition, there were provisions for restructuring which we booked at the end of the year, so this affected all of our costs.</p>
          <p>Opposite this, there were two exogenous events. First, inflation in Russia, which remained high in 2011; and then two, a success of changes in regulations, one at the start of the year, one at mid-year. Payroll taxes rose considerably twice during the year. So we have a restructuring plan which is a logical continuation of the merger of the networks. Our ambition plan was already in place to simplify the structure and reorganize our network, moving from 42 branch groups to 10 branch groups in the Group.</p>
          <p>So this is an intermediate structure, not just a commercial, not just for sales purposes, but also for administrative purposes, in a very large country. So we've simplified that significantly over the course of the year, and that should make it possible to reduce head count by 2,000 positions in Russia.</p>
          <p>So overall, in 2012, and perhaps to some extent in Russia, we will have a reduction of &#x20AC;200 million, which will be offset to some extent by inflation. So this trend is going to help us to significantly improve our cost/income ratio in the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hello. Alex Koagne, Natixis. I've got one or two questions to put you. The first, based upon the target, the equity of 9% in 2013. So the working hypothesis you had regarding the disposal of the CDOs that we've just talked about, are you going to see a total disposal of that or not an entirety disposal? I'm just referring to the working hypothesis you raised earlier on.</p>
          <p>And the second point, in regard to post-Basel II, what's the weighting of CIB in terms of RWA and in terms of revenue according to your forecast? With regard to disposals, euro-denominated disposals, &#x20AC;4 billion, to the tune of &#x20AC;4 billion with regard to the regulatory environment. Where do you stand today? Is this still topical? Could you give us one or two more pointers?</p>
          <p>Now, with regard to Russia, would you mind giving us information about increased revenues and what you have top-of-mind with regard to a target income statement following the state of affairs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'll let my colleagues respond to that, in regard to Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps one or two points with regard to the disposals and the balanced nature of the portfolio. Now, the disposals, indeed this is very topical. We are forecasting releasing four basis points, &#x20AC;4 billion worth. This is set in train, this procedure, but I'll be remaining consistent in my response, the best way to destroy value in this field is to say what you're going to sell. So because I don't really want to sound badly, I am not going to say any more.</p>
          <p>Now, with regard to the portfolio balance, I think that, well, obviously, we have to look at this state of the capital. But Basel III, in Basel III, you are reducing funding with a view to develop more loan distribution and more quickly than the initial schedule. That's, what, two years back. I think we'll be seeing RWA allocated to CIB. It will be down lower within the Groups than what was forecast only two years back, and of course it will be building in increase because of Basel 2.3 and Basel III. So on a like-for-like basis, when you think about this increase, I think it's going to be lower. Now, our model will be more focused, and this is what we had lingering in the back of our mind percentage-wise, more focused on Retail Banking.</p>
          <p>Yes. Now, with regard to the CDA, now, with Basel III, I put up the slide here, Alex, and you can see that with regard to the natural run-off, it's falling off. But &#x2013; so the leverage effect that Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric has just referred to, this is out of our hands, really. It'd be an arbitrage between the capital that you want to save, but of course this is a legacy asset and it will take time to be run off. But generally speaking, I would say this is a topic which doesn't weigh structurally, weigh down structurally. We can pick up speed or slow down, not very easily necessarily, but I think that's what we need to think about.</p>
          <p>So the order of magnitude between now and 2013, 2.5. If we can do better in a better economic backdrop, then we will do so. But anyway, this is where we stand for the time being. I think it's important once again, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:10) for me, I make a distinction between what deductions, if I can put this way, that is structural linked to the business environments, and this is likely to change in the future, and it's &#x20AC;2.5 billion of reductions in 2013, which will gradually disappear from our computation. So here we've taken a working &#x2013; a thought experiment, an average, which strikes us as reasonable, and we'll see whether we can surpass that threshold, based on the market conditions underlying.</p>
          <p>Now, with regard to Russia, the cost/income ratio, yes, there was a question. Now, let's be clear, our Retail in Russia, Specialized Bank and Universal Banking, together generate &#x20AC;1.9 million worth of profit in 2011. Now, the Universal Bank, which is the lot of &#x2013; which is enjoying a lot of focus, has seen a revenue dynamic, revenue momentum, which was very positive in 2011. We're seeing NBI growth, sales growth, or corporates, rather, to the tune of about 15%, with strong growth in revenue gleaned from interest. We're also seeing a very sharp increase in terms of performance fees to the tune of 20%.</p>
          <p>Now, we are also seeing strong synergies with our Universal Bank and insurance businesses. Now, the growth in our revenues and the restructuring plan, cost/income ratio, taking underneath 60%, below our underlying earnings. I don't think this will be the final figure for 2012, because of course we'll be still going through the throes of restructuring, but a target that we've got top-of-mind is to take it below the 60% threshold.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now, with regard to refunding, refinancing, would you mind telling us a little bit about the LTRO? What's your take on that with this second transaction which is in the offing, particularly in relation to the first transaction that was already realized? In addition to that, because you know that there are lots of polemic about the carriage rate, would you mind just touching upon this? We know that in the PIIGS this is out a little bit, but thinking about the changes in your position with regard to sovereign debts portfolio, Germany and France, to name just that two countries.</p>
          <p>Another question, if you wouldn't mind, just within broader nature, with regard to dollar-denominated financing. Now, of course you've all understood that there are solvency issues that need to be taken on board, and of course long-term issues, franchise for example, on funding that is denominated in dollars and that have really been impacted since August last. But we can see very well today that the dollar is perking up, and you've got liquidity dominated in euros and dollars, so I would imagine that dollar funding may not pose as many problems as was first thought when panic was hammering at the gate, and I think this behind us now.</p>
          <p>So, with that in mind, once again open beyond the Basel III issues, which, as early as 2014, will only prove and might be only slowly &#x2013; won't prove as obsessive as they are today. So what's your position with regard to the pick-up, if you will, the possible pick-up, of this? And is it possible to snap back market share lost in the panic years, particularly when you think about expertise which really was a major Franco-French skill set.</p>
          <p>And then the last point, with regard to the originating distribute model, now, okay, it depends on your view, but you might think that it seems to fit into the long-term trend. But it's made ravages in the U.S. with regard to risk monitoring. And we know that a bank's bread-and-butter business is to take risk. Now, earlier on you talked about portfolio disposals to the benefits of insurers, but of course insurers then are &#x2013; well, of course, it's their business to evaluate risks among SMEs.</p>
          <p>So this originating distribution model, at the end of the day, aren't you taking us out on a limb, you or the regulatory authorities, I don't know, but aren't you likely to prompt, in Europe, a model which is just as rubbish as that prevailing in the United States, and much more volatile to boot?</p>
          <p>But the Americans, they're taking this on the chin, and that's the way they think, isn't it? I mean, they know full well to take things on their chin. They get up again, like a boxer hitting the floor. It's cultural. It's written into their DNA. But we don't know how to do that in Europe. So how do you envisage doing things, doing originating distribute model, with a European flavor, which is maybe a bit more secure and sees less volatility?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Pierre, this is quite an interesting question from an organization point of view. I think you need, first and foremost, to think about the following. What will the world look like in five years and &#x2013; two years and five years down the road, just to pick up on your question with regard to U.S. dollar-denominated funding, for example, and their economy as a whole? Now it's my feeling, once again, that the ability of developed economies, I'm talking about Europe, but you could also talk about the UK and the U.S., because these latter are in the same &#x2013; find themselves in the same circumstances, define a growth model that is built less on indebtedness, that will take time, this particular model. And deleveraging in the private sector and the states, sovereign states, will take time.</p>
          <p>And I think along that pathway, no doubt there will be moments of doubts and lack of confidence, but for all that, I think we are now on a pathway where, for three years, there wouldn't be a fragmentation of financial flows around the world. And we can see this.</p>
          <p>You can see that what's happening today, even if you just confine your view to Europe, with governments that are preoccupied, and rightly so, to protect the taxpayer, with governments that are concerned with funding, servicing their debts with their national savings. So we are seeing a slight fragmentation, even with that.</p>
          <p>But I don't think we will be harking back very quickly to a paradigm, even though liquidity is available, I mean, this liquidity being &#x2013; I mean, I don't &#x2013; I mean, it might be invested long-term from one region of the world to another. But when you think about American U.S. dollar-denominated money market funds, it's true; they are starting to pick up a little bit in relation to the sharp withdrawal earlier on, but I don't think we can place money on that, if you like, for long-term financing, if nothing else. Regulatory bodies forbid that now. And the European banking system was starting to build long-term financing in U.S. Even ourselves, in 2010, we set up such financial models. But it will take time now before we actually see the long-term financing denominated in dollars.</p>
          <p>Now, not withstanding, I think we have seen a sea-change structurally, and I am not putting my money on recouping short-term <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:57) at least in the short term, in those particular fields. Now, once again, unfortunately, there are dollars that can be available and they don't only come from the United States, for that matter. And we can continue to develop our distribution platforms denominated in dollars in the United States in fixed income, and particularly in the investment-grade segments, to enable our customers to tap dollars <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:15:27) under funding.</p>
          <p>Now, we've actually a originate and distribute model. Now, we are suffering from that to some extent, and we didn't call for the Basel III rules to be brought into force. But I think we need to be alive to the fact that necessarily, well, there'll be less indebtedness at the end of the day. There will be a deleveraging effect, and this'll be particularly true in regions such as the southern reaches of Europe that may be deleveraging very sharply. But we will be seeing &#x2013; I think it's important to finance through intermediaries such as banks. But I think there is a way to avoid the pitfalls seen in the United States. Loan origination, from this perspective, will be a linchpin.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, what matters, it's not what was corrosive or toxic; it's not distribution, but it's the origination of the loan. Let's be clear about this. Sometimes it's just a complete disaster in the United States, and think here we need to be very careful in Europe to make sure that we retain origination mechanisms that are very sound for real estate, for private individuals or for corporates, for that matter.</p>
          <p>And then we've got to keep on our books, products, distribution or securitization products that are simple, straightforward, with a particularly &#x2013; without extra costs for securitization and homogenous asset classes, and stop cross-pollinating asset classes that may prove rather tricky. So I think this is &#x2013; it's inevitable that there will be products that will be straightforward, vanilla-flavored. I mean, it's not very &#x2013; it's not rocket science sometimes, so securitizing automotive loans isn't all that much rocket science. And I think we need to stay that level at of simplicity to avoid, circumvent of course, what we've seen in the past, but also when you think about origination as a whole.</p>
          <p>Now, the LTRO and how it's dealt with. First and foremost, I think we need to underscore the following. The importance of the decision that was taken, and this decision really is designed to look at one thing; to avoid a credit crunch in Europe. At the end of 2011, what did we see? In the stress, extreme stress scenario, where Europe is in the &#x2013; there is a crucial certainty for the European banking sector to have a long-term financing capacity, right in the beginning of 2012. And so to loan to the economy, we need long-term resources. You can't build the development of financing on one-week or one-month lending. You can't do it, and that strikes me as obvious.</p>
          <p>Now, with that in mind, the European Central Bank's decision extracts a credit crunch risk. It's nipped that in the bud, and it's enabled European banks, therefore, to continue to envisage providing financing in 2012 to European economies.</p>
          <p>Now, in addition to that, and this is a positive point which goes over and beyond people's expectations, in addition to what I have mentioned, at least at this point in time &#x2013; this of course could change, and this remains uncertain, but of course the markets, the debt markets, senior debt markets, at the end of the day, they are open. The taps are open, if you like, at this beginning of the year, 2012, if you will.</p>
          <p>There is a safety net, which is transitory, that will enable to reassure funding for the European economies, and this will obviously enable states to reduce their public debt. This is &#x2013; it's a virtuous cycle. And in addition to that, probably will enable the markets to open up further, hence banks can seek financing over these markets and then, little by little, longer and longer bank financing. That's a very good decision. We have to see how things play out in the second tranche and then we'll take a decision, a nuts-and-bolts tangible decision, but this is &#x2013; the purpose of this is to finance the economy. And in 2012, we want to continue to finance European economies, be it France, of course, or beyond France's borders.</p>
          <p>And exposures to other sovereign debts, perhaps we can start thinking about setting up liquidity buffers. But the very good news at the beginning of the year is the following. What we see is that investments are being built with a view of a final investor &#x2013; and I think this is crucial to restore confidence, and this is one of the things that we have to really nip in the bud. It's at the beginning of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one &#x2013; two further questions. You can see that senior secure debt market open at the beginning of the year, but this only affects northern or Nordic banks, if you like, because these are perceived as very sound banks. And what's the SocGen is doing to enter into this? I mean, are you sending a particular message to the market?</p>
          <p>Second point, I'd like to return to Russia. I find it difficult &#x2013; from one quarter to the next, you can see that the bottom line is never really far from zero. Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's just down. Probably lots of underlying reasons for that. But what can we expect reasonably for our bottom line, or a return on equity, on that particular Russian arm of the business?</p>
          <p>And, staying with Russia, in this summer in the French papers, I believe I saw articles that were rather gloomy, not to say drastic, about the immediate consequences of the IT merger with customers who are very, very disgruntled, and managers leaving the company on the CIB arm. Can you give us some information about what happened in the Russian network following the merger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps I'll hand over to Bernardo, but before I do so, I'd just like to just talk about the breakdowns that we make in our income statements. There is a Russian division that is part of the Specialized Services. That's part of Universal Bank. But this operates in an integrated fashion in Russia. So if you like, there's an artificial breakdown. Well, I'll hand it over to Bernardo so he can give you the final detail on that.</p>
          <p>With regard to your question therefore, before handing over to Bernardo, to be honest with you, this is because we're in the closing period, and so we were &#x2013; obviously we were &#x2013; we'll have to look at unsecured debt. <mark type="ph" /> Seeing as, (81:56) from a regulatory point of view, we can do that. We will be tracking how the market progresses. The market remains volatile and the situation can change in the space of a fortnight. But the important point is that, in the &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;15 billion, we financed &#x20AC;5.5 billion of that long-term financing.</p>
          <p>Bernardo over to you, with regard to Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with Russia, just keep it very simple, as I said earlier on. And by way of reminder, I can just say that, with regard to our domestic activities, &#x20AC;125 million of profit in 2011. Now, I think you were alluding to the Universal Bank model. Let me cite &#x2013; well, I did cite actually, the increase in &#x2013; well, the picking up of pace of the merger. This is what happened. The restructuring costs that were thrown up, but those weren't provisioned for in 2010 because we &#x2013; because the decision was taken at the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, over and beyond any other point, to succeed an IT merger in the space of nine months, this is pretty exceptional. I'm not quite sure that you can find examples of that elsewhere. Our local teams worked very closely with the Group's HR, and of course local teams. There was a good synergies, they worked hand in glove, and they produced exceptional results. And they, from a technical perspective and an organizational perspective, they produced the goods, and it was a remarkable success.</p>
          <p>Now, in any merger, in any company, what we saw was the following. There were two Universal Banks, two bosses, two deputy general managers, with a whole raft of different management positions that were doubled-up, as you see in any merger situation. So we had to come up with funds, had to make the decisions. We organized the structural model. We chose the best organization &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> organic ground (1:24:37) to make sure that we can do very well.</p>
          <p>And then unfortunately, because we didn't actually see &#x2013; we didn't want necessary this result, but four Russian managers and four French experts voiced their views in the French papers, and so there were two contradictory messages; people that were disgruntled. This is a source of regret for me, but it's not for all of that that we'd have done things differently, no. We chose people, and when they leave the company, well, then they may have been unhappy. But I am not &#x2013; I wouldn't backtrack on that were I to do it again.</p>
          <p>And there were a certain number of large corporates you had to adapt because our IT solution was rather radical and it changed the type of service that we render. And during the merger process, the transformation process, we talked about this inconvenience that we created. 90% of that was remedied very swiftly.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the day, we didn't lose any customers. We managed to retain good relationships we enjoyed, particularly with international corporates. And so we've got an action plan now which has been approved and discussed with our customer, with a view to find &#x2013; recoup the level of service that we &#x2013; the level of service that dipped a little bit in a certain category of administrative services. So if we had to put that into nutshell, in terms of a merger, it was a successful merger.</p>
          <p>Now, the second part, or the second chapter, if you will, that you're alluding to, we have done the merger, not just for the fun of it, of course, but to provide a solid foundation and to run a deep-seated initiative built on that foundation. Now, we've made sales choices, commercial choices, we've specialized a specialized facility, if you like, so we structured our commercial activity. And you can see in the credit for automotive &#x2013; for automobiles, we've got a strong position there, and particularly with Rosebank, and also with &#x2013; and this comes under the banner of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:27:27).</p>
          <p>So today, it depends on the quarter, but we do see quarters where we're poll-position in the markets across all asset categories, asset classes. So today, we don't have to be jealous of anybody now because of our business, our Retail business, with private individuals. This Retail arm has seen fantastic pace of growth over 2011.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, we haven't yet rounded off our corporate program. This was really not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:28:11) a little bit by the merger. And in the second half, we gave it fresh momentum, and the corporate was made more &#x2013; we looked at it more intensely. And there was a joint venture that we established between the Investment Bank and our Retail arm. And in the Russian domestic market we are now providing a service that no other non-national Russian bank can provide, in theory at least. And we've got an execution capacity which is absolutely fantastic.</p>
          <p>So our apparatus, if you will, our own apparatus is able to swallow a huge volume of business. Now, as I said earlier on, I'm not forgetting something &#x2013; hang on. The cost of risk in the Retail Bank was drawn down, was cut in half in its book value. Cost of risk was at 30%, and now we are reaching levels which are very much consistent with your expectations and what you would expect to see in a country that has certain singularities, if I can put it that way.</p>
          <p>So all this, what is involved, a massive cost reduction and transformation programs, a weighty task, a tall order, and we set this in train, but we've got a joint venture that is yielding results are very much inline with our other subsidiaries and our other commercial businesses.</p>
