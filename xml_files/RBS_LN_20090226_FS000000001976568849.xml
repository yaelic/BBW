        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning ladies and gentlemen.  If we're all settled down, welcome to RBS' 2008 Annual Results.  Whilst I've only been Chairman for a few weeks now, I'm acutely conscious that 2008 was an extraordinarily difficult year for the business, for our customers, for employees and of course the shareholders, public and private, who put very large amounts of money, new capital, into the business in the course of the year.  And of course we're particularly grateful today to the continuing support we have from the government, from UK taxpayers, that support which now secures our financial stability and underpins our future.</p>
          <p>We're going to be a little bit longer today because we've got three things to discuss.  Guy will go through the financial results in the customary way, although I think it's fair to say there's some fairly uncustomary figures and issues in there that we don't want to see repeated.  And then critically today of course, Stephen is going to go through the conclusions of the strategic review that he and his team have been working on in recent months; and then we'll &#x2013; Stephen will give our first public thoughts on the asset protection scheme announced this morning.</p>
          <p>We're going to start with Stephen and since we've got a lot to do we'll get on with it straightaway.  If I can make one request is that your mobiles are completely turned off please, not just on mute.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philip.  Good morning everyone.  We unconventionally, as Philip mentioned, thought I would go first so that whilst you're awake you will hear from me and then the fireworks and the numbers will give you a jolt towards the end.  You should also have in packs extensive appendices and it's been our attempt to make a significant stride forward from RBS' previous position in terms of financial transparency.  We want to be at the forefront of financial transparency and so we are open to any suggestions in the future as to what more we can do that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>So rather than, if you like, talk about the business backward looking its seems sensible to forward look as much as we could this morning, and the key task ahead of us is to execute the strategy that we're laying out to restructure RBS, to return it to being one of the world's premier financial institutions.  We'll be anchored in the UK but serving customers globally.  Clearly we need to rebuild shareholder value, clearly we need to allow the government to get out of our hair and get their money back, and that could only be accomplished if we reinforce leadership in our markets, but are disciplined in the way we do that and that's what we're getting on with.</p>
          <p>I wanted to just give this next slide a perspective because I think that moving back, if you like, to the October wake up call and recapitalization that we're required and may others required, there are an essential set of building blocks without which we can't go on the path of recovery and I think that we are pushing those building blocks in place and many of them are indeed after today in place against which to execute.  Clearly, recapitalization and government support on funding have been a very, very important component of that, as the management and Board changes as well; understanding our problems and presenting them and of course the most comprehensive version of that, again, is in the financial statement presented today.</p>
          <p>We then announced today the new strategy, the roadmap, around which to unite our people, our resources and to tell you where we are planning to go.  But of course since the early years of the execution of that strategy are going to be fraught with uncertainty, the stability that the asset protection scheme affords or improves is an equally essential bit of allowing us to be able to execute that strategic plan.  And then, of course, there's the unmanageable bit, which is exactly how many headwinds are we going to face and with what volatility from the market.  But essentially, after today our job becomes execution; that's no small job, but that's what it becomes.</p>
          <p>And the strategy which I will be going through today in headlines is putting over 20% of our funded assets into a non-core division to work off over the next three to five years, cutting the cost base; obviously the asset protection scheme we'll talk about, and then all of the rest of our business will have extensive restructuring ranging from GBM where there is the most work to do.  We will cut, we plan to cut 45% out of the capital base of GBM in restructuring it to what we believe will be a very strong and successful investment bank on its revised mandate, and then clearly a substantive change to all the rest of our businesses, and alongside that the management and processes.  And we've been pretty busy to date, I won't go through this slide, it's not been a relaxing few months and it won't be yet, but I think we are, one-by-one, ticking off a lot of things.</p>
          <p>Now, just to say on the results and Guy will obviously go through the numbers, but it is unambiguous bad results both in terms of the headline and in terms of the loss, even pre-goodwill.  I do think though that it is important, first of all, obviously to put into context that that's true of a number of other banks.  I think we still only rank tenth in the lead table of shame in terms of losses.  But within these results, actually the vast majority of our business was profitable.  Even in GBM where the losses were concentrated there were &#xA3;10 billion of revenues, nearly an all time record before the concentrated, more specific areas that gave a rise to very large losses were recorded.  And that's important not just if you like to give credit to the past, which is important, but also to give a sense of assurance that we are not building on sand here, we are building on rock.  What we need to do is sweep away the sand that currently lies over some of that rock.</p>
          <p>So, what we are trying hard not to do, because it's unproductive, is to get into the blame game for the past.  There are plenty of people who are spending their time doing that without you needing to hear it from me.  But I think it is very important to just think a little bit about the issues that got us where we are because unless we correct for them we have risk going forward, but also if you identify them it's understandable what you don't need to correct for and puts the strategy in context.  And as I say, I don't want to belabor it, but these six areas in my view are the areas where &#x2013; which we need to address in order to correct what went wrong.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we clearly need to change the company to suit the way that markets are likely to change and those are two components of the strategic plan.  Leverage is clear.  The ABN AMRO acquisition, in a sense, has ingredients from all the other boxes here.  I say strategy, I think the strategy is vital for companies, not just because it gives you a purposeful roadmap, but I think it makes you think more about your markets, about your position in the markets, the capacity for growth and therefore, if you are trying to do things with your business, the markets you operate in won't support; you'll make mistakes.  And whether it be the growth rate that markets will support, whether it be the strength of your competitive position and therefore the likely quality of the business you do and so on, founding things in clear strategy as opposed to, if you like, day-to-day profit growth and opportunism will be a very, very important base.  I think it's a quality of business.</p>
          <p>Risk controls, I suspect, go without saying.  Profit focus, we'll look &#x2013; our job is to make profits and our job is to grow profits and there should be no ambiguity about that, and unless we do that well we'll be seen to have failed.  But there is, I think, a risk often, frankly, encouraged by audiences that public companies have of making that a solitary goal and you have to think very carefully about how your profits are being made, with what resources, with what risks and make sure that there is a full suite of targets and management aspirations from which profit derives.</p>
          <p>And then clearly, if you like management processes, the culture of the firm, the bench strength of the management, the empowerment of the businesses around their strategic targets, all of these are issues that we will address and strengthen and are doing.  So in conceptualizing the strategic plan, we were really working both top down and bottom up.  And the strategic plan that we have is, if you like, the resolution of those.</p>
          <p>I set out for you when I last addressed you on joining three months ago five tests that I put forward if you like, as the bottom up tests for every business we have to meet through the strategic plan process.  Top tier competitive positions, from which I think quality profits derive, 15% plus ROE which is where I believe we will get back to.  How many years?  I don't know the answer to that, but we will get back to after the downturn.</p>
          <p>Proportionate use of balance sheet risk and funding, incredibly important.  Organic growth potential and that doesn't just mean taking a swipe at acquisitions, but it does mean that if your business is to grow organically you have to work them harder.  You have to invest in them.  The management capacity is stretched in doing that and so on.  And then, of course, connectivity within the Group.  We can't have fiefdoms.  We have to have businesses that work together.</p>
          <p>And so these are the five tests against which every one of our businesses has been measured and the plans have been developed and the things that we're discarding have been discarded.  But they have to fit the top down, and I think the key disciplines, or we could make this more complex, we need to return to standalone strength.  And for now I see that as AA category ratings standalone today.  We benefit from those, courtesy of government support.  We need to benefit from those standalone.  Guy, at the end of his presentation, will give some indication of what we think that might be in terms of balance sheet and capital, although of course that's a voyage of discovery for many.  And profitability I set out the targets top down as well as bottom up and obviously business mix where we are not in any way saying we won't take risk.  If you don't take risk you don't make money in financial services, but obviously that has to be more balanced than it was before.</p>
          <p>So the first, if you like, step of the plan is to identify those things that we believe are not capable of meeting my five strategic tests and initially labeling them our non-core division and by doing that and managing that division separately, albeit on a matrix basis within the Group, we free the rest of the Group, both visually and in terms of management effort, to do its own restructuring to meet our GBM business targets.</p>
          <p>And I think that you can see that throughout the plan what we have to do is basically come up with what I would describe as a self-help plan.  There is not at the moment an active M&amp;A market that ascribes good values to financial services assets.  It would be nice if there was a wonderful rabbit to pull out of a hat that way, but there isn't.  That may change, and as a matter of management philosophy, there is no business that we will be irrational with in terms of value.  If someone wants to pay more for business than it's worth we must always, regards that business, be open to that.  However, we're not relying on that, we have to chart, we believe, a self-help plan and any inorganic opportunities to short cut that will be what they will be.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some more dimensions around the non-core division.  We did announce, by the way, this morning separately that we have hired or rehired Nathan Bostock, who was at Abbey recently as Finance Director, but he ran the portfolio business unit for me at Abbey in the early 2000s and so he has done this before albeit on a different scale and he will be heading up the division in which is the non-core division for us.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that the non-core division contains a bunch of different things.  It does contain a bunch of our stressed assets, in fact many of our stressed assets, but it also contains assets that are not stressed but simply are non-strategic relative to the five tests that I set out.  It is a mixture of portfolios, individual assets and businesses and it comes in large part from our wholesale businesses, but not exclusively and I'll show that on the next slide.  Unfortunately, because of the liquidity and distressed nature of markets for assets, we can't, with confidence, chart the speed of sell-down of these businesses and these assets or indeed the costs.  And one of the major benefits of the asset protection scheme is to allow us to do it with a higher likely end NPV than if we are under pressure to do it very, very fast because of the capital risk involved.  But we clearly can't give that forecast. What we will do, obviously, is report regularly against it, but so the objective in selling it down is to sell it down purposefully, but with the best eye on NPV of outcome that we can have.</p>
          <p>You'll see the broad financial parameters on the right hand side of the slide; and just to give you some sense of where these assets come from geographically and through our divisions divided into the derivative assets, which are in the lighter shading, and the balance sheet funded assets, we give this breakdown.  There are other breakdowns that we will give, but I would ask you for some patience.  We've been going at break-neck speeds to come up with this plan.  There are many details that still in the next two or three months will need to be worked out.  There are also a whole bunch of human sensitivities and so we may not be as forthcoming on detailed disclosure about this as you would like until the summer.</p>
          <p>What I can now do, in a sense having just given you the dimensions of the non-core business there, is move on, if you like, to our ongoing businesses.  And I'm going to spend time slightly strangely on this because I will spend not very much time on the businesses that, if you like, need the least surgery or have the least questions around them, and more time on the ones which I know, if you like, are newsworthy; but that is not in any way to suggest that that's the portion of importance.</p>
          <p>So clearly, as I've mentioned already, the biggest changes that we need to execute are in our investment banking business where we plan to take 45% out.  But it's important to note that we believe that there is a good future for this business.  We have top tier positions in a number of key customer franchises, liquid markets, and we believe that we can make a good living out of those that they will be complementary, that they can have risk characteristics that will pave their way; and that we can have a very successful business as part of the Group on a significantly smaller scale overall, but on a big scale in the areas in which we choose to compete.  And we set out on this slide some of the parameters around that.</p>
          <p>And giving you a few more details on this next slide, dividing if you like, between core businesses, every business we have needs to do some things to strengthen and improve.  Non-core businesses where we will substantially exit, and then what we call restructured core businesses in the middle where they will remain very important businesses for us, but need particularly heavy changes or surgery in order to regain the risk and return characteristics and the, if you like, the centering around customer franchises that we require.</p>
          <p>And geographically, as you all know one of the consequences of the ABN acquisition was that we became extremely diverse in geography, but the vast majority of those geographies we were actually fairly small and marginal players in.  And in a different world where we need to husband our resources, where we need to pay attention to the places we can definitely be winners, that investment profile is not sustainable.  And so as a consequence there will be a significant reduction in the number of countries in which we have a presence.  And in a number of countries our presence will be significantly reduced in order to make sure we can be strong, meaningful market leaders in our core countries.  That doesn't mean to say we won't be global.  We will be global, but you do not need to be in every country to be global; and it's better to be meaningful in lesser countries that to be spread thin, and that's at heart what this slide is trying to say.</p>
          <p>Let me move off GBM to our U.S. retail and commercial business, which I think has attracted, if you like, lots of attention and thought.  It is our belief that this business can be restructured in a way that makes it an attractive part of our Group.  It is also our belief that in any event today there is not a value accretive alternative to that strategy, although that won't always be the case.  Citizens does have strong market leading positions in the attractive markets of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in the United States.  It is, relative to other U.S. retail commercial banks, low risk.  Now at the moment that doesn't mean absolutely low risk, that's a relative statement.  And it does have, and will have in restructured form, very attractive funding characteristics being largely deposit funded, in a way that improves the overall Group balance as well.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we have major things that we have to do to make Citizens what it can be.  In particular, we are going to draw back from a whole range of, if you like, incursions that have been made outside the core footprint geographically of Citizens both in terms of branches, but in particular in terms of individual lines, and credit cards and also loans and dealer finance and things like that.  Secondly, we have a major restructuring to do in cost base and investment to do.  Citizens, ironically, has been starved of technological investment in a number of ways which partly makes it inefficient, but partly means that the retail network, for example, is not operating as well as it should in terms of cross-sells and revenues.</p>
          <p>The retail area we need to particularly revitalize, both as a revenue generator and as a funding generator.  Our risk portfolios have been growing faster than deposits and we need to peel back on those and peel back out of footprint lending.  We believe that if we do all of that we have tough targets for Citizens, not just the return targets and the market leadership targets that we have for all our businesses, but we need to regain a one-to-one ratio, which would be typical of U.S. banks, but we don't have in Citizens in terms of funding to deposits.  We need to retain the below average risk profile for its markets and prove that we can grow it organically, which has not been the case in the past, although other banks in the same markets do grow organically, and therefore, we believe we can.  And the connectivity with the rest of the Group, both in terms of use of products, in terms of personnel interchange, in terms of shared platforms is dramatically increasing as we speak.  So we think that if we do all these things to Citizens, that Citizens will be valuable, attractive, meet our tests both as a holder and as an asset to the Group.</p>
          <p>Now summarizing, if you like, the other businesses, every one of our other businesses, which clearly mostly lie now in the UK, have got major things that we want to do to them in order to enhance their prospects of meeting my five business tests; all to do with costs, to do with risk concentrations, to do with funding and balance sheet balance.  There are some areas where there are more fundamental issues we need to confront.  For example, retail banking, I think for the industry in the UK has got big issues.  Those issues arise clearly from low interest rates, although hopefully that's cyclical.  They arise from the various regulatory attacks on products like PPI and overdraft charging.  And I do think that the retail banking model in the UK will need to undergo substantial change: the ways in which money can be made; the cost bases that can be supported; in our case looking also at the geographic footprint.  There's a lot of work to do here, I think, for all banks and for us going forward.</p>
          <p>Our market shares clearly are going to be hard to enhance because they're very, very good, although it may be with Lloyds and HBOS combination may make some market share easier to pick up if there's disruption in that area.  Clearly, our new lending commitments in support of the government are importantly executed through retail and corporate and commercial.</p>
          <p>And covering the other three business areas of the Group on this next slide, I mean Ulster Bank, of course, in effect is part of the UK both as it relates to Northern Ireland, but obviously with the important Irish presence.  It shares the UK infrastructure and many of the products, but clearly the island of Ireland has a very major set of economic challenges which are further exacerbated by the commercial property and residential property concentrations that we and all others in Ireland have and a major restructuring of that business is required, although it ultimately will meet the five tests and in effect is an extension of what we do in the UK, albeit under a different brand.  We are engaged in quite a radical set of actions there including the closure of the First Active brand, which is part of the goodwill write-off that we announced.</p>
          <p>Insurance, I think we went through, if you like, a very public debate.  It's a great business.  There was an issue about whether it was worth more to others than to us.  For now, that's demonstrably not the case.  We can make it still better and there's lots of work around to do that.</p>
          <p>And then GTS, which we sort of report separately, but really isn't a separate business because it feeds off the back of the client relationships that we have in all our other businesses and the capital that's deployed there.  Nevertheless, a very high quality, high ROE, cash generative, funding generative business that which we need to continue to roll out, albeit the global ambitions of which will clearly be slowed a little bit by the global moves that we're making in other businesses.</p>
          <p>And, if you like, spread across the top of all the business specific actions we have will be a whole range of changes to management process and culture, which are all about addressing the issues that have arisen in the past, making sure that we are one of the best managed banks out there.  None of this is rocket science.  None of this is inventing something that hasn't been done before, that which is why I'm confident we can do it; it just takes time.</p>
          <p>Expenses, clearly there's lots of work to do on expenses and all banks in the world have a fast changing marketplace against which to aim efficiency and so we don't know whether this will be the last word or not.  But in addition to eliminating the expenses associated with the non-core division we've set ourselves a target to cut out more than &#xA3;2.5 billion from our costs over the next three years.  The important provisos are: that's constant exchange rates; half a billion of that is the remaining fag end not yet delivered of the ABN synergies, so you could say it's really an incremental 2 billion; and there will be restructuring charges taken over the next three years to pay for that.  We're obviously still working through the details, so we give a range of possible restructuring charge for that and I don't yet have a spread over in which year they will occur.  And it's also important to note, as I say, this does not include cost saves from business exits.  It does also not include the effect of inflation, if there is any, in the next three years.  That's the joy ahead of us, of course; any movements on incentive pay or more new projects if there are any.  But nevertheless, a substantive body of work across every one of our businesses and a necessary one.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now, if you like, to the asset protection scheme and a number of my colleagues have not had a lot of sleep for a number of weeks and have done an unbelievable, stellar job in grappling with this sort of slippery octopus of a process in coming up with what has been announced overnight.  The facts are that we have, if you like, headlined or outlined terms for the asset protection scheme, but there is not a definitive agreement; there are lots of details still to work through.  This needs to be put to our shareholders among other things.  And obviously we can't make a full recommendation to our shareholders until the details are worked out.  So what we're saying is we are minded to go into it.  We believe it is in shareholders' interest, but these details are very important and it's not a decision to take lightly, because this is not a free; there are many difficult aspects to this for shareholders and hopefully I'll take you through some of them as we go along.</p>
          <p>But clearly what we have been setting out to do, our objectives in engaging with the government in this, has been to do something that enhances our financial strength.  Obviously, shareholders will have nothing if our customers and counterparties are not confident in dealing with us even if conditions get much worse than they are today.  Reducing risk to shareholders, which has been, if you like, a predominant theme of all financial services equities in recent months and weeks.  Clearly, the price tag for that is increased commitment in the UK; that, in many respects though, is a welcome price tag.  We have leading market shares.</p>
          <p>We can do great business in the UK.  We remain free to price and risk assess as we would wish; but if we have the wherewithal to capitalize when others are pulling back in our core market, that ought to be attractive to shareholders over time in its own right.  And clearly, to the extent that stability and insurance allows us to run off the non-core division more profitability for shareholders, and I believe this does, that's good as well.</p>
          <p>So against, if you like, those objectives going into it, this is the opportunity that we have should we participate in the scheme as we intend.  We have an outline agreement for a pool of 300 billion of assets made up approximately of 225 billion, if you like, funded assets on the balance sheet; 44 billion of committed undrawn lines at the counterparties where we're worried about future stress; 33 billion of mark-to-market possible future exposure on derivatives; and underneath that, approximately 160 billion of risk-weighted assets.  Although, we need to be careful with all of these, because all of these portfolios will have a fair amount of additional refinement between now and the scheme becoming effective.  So anything we say now may be off a few percentage points either way.  But I think, in big picture terms, we'll be right.</p>
          <p>And to give you a sense, this is a bigger, a significantly bigger scheme than we planned for or were even seeking, but you can conceptually think of it as two things.  We are trying to ensure against our most stressed assets in order to protect the stability of the bank in a bad case.  We are trying to make room for additional UK lending, which is the price tag.  And in order to do that, we need a bigger scheme, which ensures a bunch of ongoing good assets if you like.  I mean they'll all be subject to stress in a downturn, but it's that extra size that allows us to pony up on the lending whilst keeping the financial stability that was the goal of it.  And so that's why approximately 55% of these assets are ones that you'll find in our non-core and the balance are ones that you'll find in our core businesses, mostly in the UK, in terms of the ongoing lending.</p>
          <p>And now just going through, if you like, the pricing; risk-weighted asset relief, the FSA has put out a ruling that gives us risk-weighted asset relief in respect to these assets caveated by two things.  We keep a 10% strip of risks, so we obviously have the risk-weighted assets associated with that.  And then there are risk-weighted assets associated with the first loss.  So that's why of the full even though there's 160 billion, that's covered, there's only 144 billion that actually comes off once you take account of the loss retention in the scheme.</p>
          <p>Losses up to 6% of that pool will be borne by us as a first loss, and then split 90/10.  And we're paying, actually, two kinds of fees.  The explicit fee is 2% of the gross pool, which is paid up front although in our accounts, will be amortized over seven years.  In addition to that, we are being asked to give up tax relief in the UK in relation to our current deferred tax asset, which is about &#xA3;5 billion, and any losses that we might make over the next two or three years before returning to profitability in the UK.  And so &#x2013; who knows the real value of that tax give-up and it's still to be worked through, it's of the details that remains the source of, let's say, controversy between the parties.  But the NPV of that depends very much, a) on what losses we make and how much increases, and then how quickly we'll be able to use it over the next 10, 20 years whatever it would be; but that de facto has the impact of probably doubling the fee from the stated 2%; but you can come up with your own numbers as to what you think it does relative the fee.</p>
          <p>Now, the other important bits of the scheme is, in a sense, the capital side and that is to say that we are issuing to the government B shares, which fall into, in a sense, three parts.  One, B shares to pay for the fee, which is &#xA3;6.5 billion.  Secondly, a &#xA3;13 billion issuance of B shares and I'll explain what's that's for in a second; and we have an option to draw down a further &#xA3;6 billion should, in our judgment, we need it for capital purposes as we go through whatever the downturn is bringing to us.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk about, if you like, the impact of all of this and why we're doing and how it all works.  On the pro forma, the risk-weighted assets change pro forma is obviously straightforward, it's a 144 billion change or roughly 25%.  There are few moving pieces in the Core Tier 1 and that's also one of the reasons why we need some additional capital up front.  The Core Tier 1 clearly goes up by the amount of B shares that we issue because the B shares are designed to count as Core Tier 1 as the FSA has confirmed.  But the regulatory treatment of the Insurance is that 50% of the first loss piece needs to be deducted from Core Tier 1 capital, subject to a cap of 4% of the risk-weighted assets that are being protected.  And so putting that crudely in numbers, there is roughly a &#xA3;6 billion deduction from Core Tier 1 as a function of the way the FSA will count for the risk-weighted asset relief that they give on the other side and that creates a capital hole. Clearly, as we go through in subsequent years as this thing unwinds there will be various movements.</p>
          <p>The amortization of the fee will hit Core Tier 1, because that doesn't hit on day one, that hits over the next seven years.  As we make losses under the first loss piece, then those losses hit Core Tier 1, but half of them are offset by the deduction that you take up front in Core Tier 1 from the FSA 50% allocation.  So there's quite a few sort of moving parts in how that will play out in the next few years.  But what it means is that although our Core Tier 1 ratio jumps to a rather attractively high level pro forma, that's misleadingly high, because we know over the next seven years 6.5 billion comes off that as the fee amortizes through but that's already &#x2013; that's in a sense a commitment up front.</p>
          <p>We know that if we go into this we have to wipe 5 billion off Core Tier 1 because of the deferred tax asset that would have to go if we went into it; and then clearly to the extent we take losses against the first loss piece there is a further deduction to Core Tier 1; and finally to the extent we lend more in the UK that's an increase in risk-weighted assets.  So, all of those moving parts are why you need to start with an unusually high Core Tier 1 ratio if you want to be very resilient even if things get really bad in the next two or three years in terms of capital hits.  And it's for that reason that an up front issuance of capital over and above the one that offsets the fee is needed to offset the write off of deferred tax assets and of the FSA immediate deductions against Core Tier 1, and then whatever you think is going to happen as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Now I just &#x2013; I'll come on to lending commitments in a moment.  The characteristics of the B shares, and again what we have is a term sheet as opposed to detailed, if you like, terms and conditions that are still to be worked out.  But they can be seen in quite different ways according to what perspective you want to take.  They are designed in a liquidation to rank alongside ordinary shares.  But in liquidation no one is very happy, so that's probably the least important way of thinking about them, but that's what gets in Core Tier 1 treatment.  They are &#x2013; in ordinary course, they will pay a 7% dividend, after tax dividend of course.  Actually, it's a formula that's the higher off 7% or 250% of dividends announced on the ordinary shares and that's &#x2013; and the detail of that is set out in the press release of the company minutes.  So it's 7% or higher.  And in a sense, that is in perpetuity unless certain things happen.</p>
          <p>So if you just thought about that in wanting to decide what are these things worth, you have to decide what discount rate you want to apply relative the 7% and then you discount 7% in perpetuity to get to whatever value you think is the economic give, if you like, of that.  Clearly, if you're the government funding at 3% you might see it in one way; if you were looking at the markets for preference shares you might think it was unbelievably cheap and a good deal for shareholders.  There's a wide range of how you might think about that.</p>
          <p>The preference share dividends, the dividends on the B shares are effectively what I'll call junior preference shares.  In other words, they rank ahead of ordinaries in dividend priority but a bit behind preference shares.  We can waive them, they're non-cumulative, although obviously the government which holds them also holds a majority of our ordinary shares.</p>
          <p>Now, the other feature of these B shares is that they are convertible at the government's option into ordinary shares at a price of 50 p per share.  There are few, if you like, conditions around that, that is to say that the government has agreed that it won't take its voting above 75% and so therefore, in reality if they converted they'd have to convert and sell, thereby increasing the float and clearly if they converted prior to the share price being above 50 p they'd take a loss in doing it.</p>
          <p>And so in thinking through the economics of that, again there are two quite different perspectives you can take.  If we do a fully diluted calculation assuming that they convert on day one, with our share price yesterday at 20 p, we'll see where it ends today, then obviously a conversion price at 50 p is an incredibly good deal for shareholders relative to what would be available in the market and would mean that these capital instruments would be in a sense worth a big discount to face in terms of the value of ordinary shareholders of this capital.</p>
          <p>On the other hand if you want to think about it different way, the government can collect 7% every year until such time as the share price is at 50 p and then convert and treat that as the maturity of its bond as it were in having the 7% bond, albeit with the risk characteristics associated with very, very junior preferred.  And so in just trying to think through what this means for shareholders, there is actually quite a wide range of ways of thinking about the economic interests and subordination of shareholders to either the 7% cash flow streams or to the conversion, and it gives rise to the ability to have quite different perspectives on how dilutive this is of shareholders.  I believe that in all scenarios this is cheap insurance and the right thing for us to do, but that is quite a different thing than saying it's a shareholder bonanza, it is not.</p>
          <p>The situation that we face if the economic downturn is tough and lots of the first loss is required does, in effect, dilute ordinary shareholders interest in book value below these shares because of the 7% preference dividend.  So you, I just urge you to think it through.  I think no one will come to the conclusion other than it's a good deal, but you can come to quite a lot of different conclusions in terms of the end value, if you like, of what the ordinary shareholders have today.</p>
          <p>Along with this is UK lending commitments.  We have committed to increase lending relative to our '09 plan.  Our '09 plan was flat on '08, so call it relative to the end of '08, by 25 billion in each of the next two years.  It won't be quite calendar year because we're starting a quarter late, obviously.  That commitment is split between mortgages and corporate business, although there's some flexibility in that if needed and it is with the override of &#x2013; beyond a price commercially and beyond a risk assess commercially.</p>
          <p>Moving away from AE APS, I would be remiss to conclude my part of the presentation without reminding you that there's lots of things that can go wrong and there's a lot of hard work and time to elapse before we know of the success and therefore ultimate value of the restructuring plan and of RBS and &#x2013; but I think you know all of that.</p>
          <p>But I would then end in just simply reminding you, if you like, on a positive note I do think that when you look at what are the building blocks that are necessary for us to put in place to have a credible shot at rebuilding one of the world's premier financial institutions with all the value that that can potentially do, and we're making really good progress on putting those building blocks in place and having something against which to execute with a good chance of success.</p>
          <p>So, I'm sorry if that's gone on for a little while, but anyway, now over to the main event, the numbers; thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good morning.  We provided an enormous amount of information to you this morning, and what I would like to do is go through some of the main elements of the company announcement in really three main themes.  Firstly the financial review, secondly some areas of our risk profile, and finally some observations on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The results we announced this morning are very much in line with the guidance, the trading update that we provided on January 19.  The Group generated pre-impairment profit of &#xA3;7.1 billion, took an impairment charge of &#xA3;7 billion, credit market write-downs, as indicated, of &#xA3;7.8 billion.  After tax and minority interests and a few other things, reported an attributable loss from our business operations of &#xA3;7.9 billion.</p>
          <p>We undertook an assessment to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet.  The net was &#xA3;700 million deferred tax asset release, wrote-down &#xA3;16.2 billion; about half of that related to the ABN transaction, about a quarter to acquisitions that had taken place in the United States.  Combination of those two resulted in the attributable loss of &#xA3;24.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our Group income fell on the year by 19%.  We have the benefit of a strong performance from GTS, the benefit of a weaker Sterling.  On the positive side, this is offset by an increase in funding related costs as well as a lower performance in the core GBM business, the main driver of which was a &#xA3;5.8 billion write-down in our trading assets, which I will talk in more detail about later.</p>
          <p>Costs overall fell 4% to &#xA3;15.9 billion, principally a reduction of variable compensation down 66% year-over-year, offset by a number of small items and an adverse FX move the other side of the positive impact on the income statement all adding up to 15.9 billion costs and cost income ratio which rose from 49% to 59%, largely on the back of the weaker income number.</p>
          <p>Our impairments rose by &#xA3;4.8 billion to &#xA3;6.9 billion on our loan books.  The drivers of those are principally corporate and commercial activities in the UK and Ireland, personal and corporate activities in the United States in Citizens, and a &#xA3;3 billion increase in the charge in global banking markets, 2.7 of which occurred in the fourth quarter, &#xA3;900 million of which, as we previously indicated, was related to LyondellBasell.  In addition, as part of the reclassification of assets under IAS 39, which took place at the end of the third quarter, we realized impairments against those available for sale assets of &#xA3;500 million.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting, really, that all of our major divisions, with the exception of GBM, were profitable during the course of 2008.  In fact, it was a record year for RBS Insurance on the back of significantly reduced claims and a stable income line and Global Transaction Services where profits grew 12% to &#xA3;1.3 billion, generated &#xA3;3.3 billion of profits for our UK operations.  Sadly, all of this was offset by 3.6 billion of losses in global banking markets as well as &#xA3;1.9 billion relating to central funding costs and central department items.  As result of that, our underlying business was in line with the January 19 statement of &#xA3;80 million underlying profit.</p>
          <p>Now this slide just highlights the main building blocks of income where you can see pretty flat year-over-year across our regional market business, pretty flat on Insurance, GTS I've mentioned before; and the major difference, really, GBM income coming down from 10.9 to 4.4 billion with the larger part of that relating to the write-downs year-over-year down 19% from 33 billion to 26.7.  Within that, obviously, non-interest income fell considerably down 48% to &#xA3;10.9 billion whilst net interest income grew 29% to &#xA3;15.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Our Group NIM rose by 10 basis points to 210, largely on the back of a very strong GBM money market performance benefiting from the falling rate environment, tighter margins across the regional markets business with higher funding costs and low deposit margins also outweighing the improved front book pricing contributed to an overall 15 basis point decline in that activity.  Figures at the bottom really talk to the trends there, and I think worth noting that the impact of low rates, the impact of tighter deposit pricing and the cost of holding incremental liquidity consistent with the emerging regulatory regimes are expected to cost somewhere between 25 and 40 basis points in 2009.</p>
          <p>I said I would come back to the GBM's income story.  Last year 10.9 billion headline income from an underlying basis around the businesses, 10.2 for 2008 with a very strong performance in rates, currencies, and commodities with a very welcome &#xA3;800 million contribution from our joint venture with Sempra, which began on April 1; offset by weak and subdued credit market and equity market related activity.  And falling asset values, wider spreads and counterparty failure cost the &#xA3;5.8 billion in trading write-downs to give a published underlying business revenue 4.4, in addition to the previously disclosed credit market related write-downs, large and structured credit from Monolines and some leveraged finance of &#xA3;7 billion; revenue fell to negative &#xA3;2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>What I would like to do now is just look at the main components of some of the risk elements in the portfolio.  The 5.8 billion that I mentioned earlier was principally down to four main areas.  Firstly with structured credit, where we took the write-downs on the business of &#xA3;2.4 billion.  This business is part of our discontinued operations.  And now in run-off, we incurred &#xA3;2.3 billion worth of counterparty failures; principally three names: Lehman Brothers, the catalyst, <mark type="inaudible" /> again which unfolded in the fourth quarter; Icelandic Banks; and Madoff.  We raised an additional &#xA3;600 million of provisions against our exposure to credit derivative product companies.  We lost around &#xA3;500 million in principal finance activities, mostly in the Merchant Banking and Private Equity arena.  It's worth noting that 4.9 billion of these pounds occurred in the second half of 2008 with 4.1 in the fourth quarter, post Lehman.</p>
          <p>On the previously disclosed credit market write-downs, we lost 7.3 billion with an additional 500 of impairments on top of that.  Within this, we now have the ABS CDOs high grade marks between 35 and 20, the <mark type="inaudible" /> markdown to six.  You can note that the most of mortgage exposure has pretty much gone.  At this stage, the larger part of our residual exposure now is to the Monoline counterparties where a net basis after hedges and reserves, we still have 4.8 billion of open exposure.  We have a &#xA3;6 billion credit valuation adjustment more than 50% reserved at this point.</p>
          <p>Looking at the loan books, our impairments were up by &#xA3;4.8 billion, particularly in the second half of the year within the retail and commercial businesses largely centered around small business and mid-corporate and commercial in the UK and Ireland, mostly small business, mostly real estate related, but now starting to spread more widely across the portfolio.  In the UK personal and secured sector, impairments were flat although the second half was weaker than the first.</p>
          <p>GBM saw losses of &#xA3;3.2 billion; I mentioned earlier, 2.6 of which were in Q4.  Overall, for the portfolio, loans grew by 8% on a constant currency basis.  The non-performing book more than doubled to just under &#xA3;19 billion with charge-off rates starting at &#x2013; sorry, non-performing loans now at 2.69% of the portfolio versus 1.49 a year ago.</p>
          <p>Charge-off rates up from 37 basis points to 91 basis points.  The half-over-half split for 2008 was 46 in H1 and 135 basis points in the second half.  Maybe slightly surprising in this environment, our provision coverage fell.  Two principal reasons behind that, first is the higher proportion of secured corporate credits that are now in our non-performing book versus the higher preponderance of unsecured personal lending a year ago, as well as write-offs to provisions of &#xA3;3 billion in 2008 versus &#xA3;2 billion in 2007.</p>
          <p>Some new disclosure on overall portfolio credit quality, this is our total number of credit exposure to customers and banks both credit and trading risk total &#xA3;855 million over half of which resides within GBM, the remainder is spread between our UK retail, Corporate Ulster Bank, and United States activities; three quarters of that is above the sort of 825 mid-point rating on our grading scales, that would equate to last year's reported accounts is 823 or above.  It's worth noting over 80% of the portfolio at this stage is under our sort of regular review and normal monitoring.  We have heightened monitoring against about 15% of the portfolio, half of which is in the FI space and half of which is corporate and then non-performing books, as I mentioned earlier, are just over 2.5%.</p>
          <p>Geographically, it's well spread; obviously the largest market in the UK but principally spread amongst the major economies of the world.  By sector, it is generally well-diversified <mark type="inaudible" /> concentration of 12% in property, although that is slightly lower than the percentage at this time a year ago.  Our heightened monitoring, if you look at this, its centered really in three main areas at this point: firstly financial institutions and intermediaries, not surprising in the environment we are going through; in the commercial property sector; and in the United States geographically.  As I mentioned earlier, the signs of this monitoring are now spreading out more widely to other sectors.</p>
          <p>Just a few slides on areas of concentration.  Commercial property, &#xA3;97 billion of total exposure, 58% of which is in the UK, roughly three quarters investment, one quarter development, 1.6% speculative development at this point.  The average LTVs have moved from around 69% in the half year to, on an index basis, around 84% at the end of 2008.  Our exposure, really, with larger tenanted properties is to the occupier.  Ability and signs are there, the occupier markets are weakening and obviously lower interest helping to minimize or mitigate some of the cash flow impacts of that.</p>
          <p>Stephen had mentioned in his remarks around concentrations.  We have 300 names with over &#xA3;500 million worth of total committed exposure.  This covers credit and counterparty risks.  Substantial parts of this, certainly with the FI names, would be collateralized in some way or form, and 60% of this exposure is with financial institutions, 40% is with corporates.</p>
          <p>Amongst the financial institutions, 93% investment grade; in the top 20 exposures, 96% in investment grade, two of them under heightened monitoring on the investment grade category.</p>
          <p>In the corporate books, a slightly broader split, 75% investment grade, 25% non-investment grade amongst the top 20; 83% and 17%, the two watch list names are both investment grade.</p>
          <p>A sharp up tick in impairments took place both in numbers of cases going into our Global Restructuring Group and also by value of cases going into the Global Restructuring Group.  I think earlier in the year, the growth was very much related to this sort of early cycle sectors, largely real estate, property related activities that I have mentioned; now more broadly into other sectors as well.</p>
          <p>Considerable actions going on in risk mitigation: scaling up the recoveries unit around the world; scaling up problem recognition and collection; tightening trading exposures; strengthening collateral management; targeted opportunities to reduce the largest exposures in concentrations as they present themselves; bringing down some of our country risk exposures; and obviously the APS scheme announced this morning will provide insurance against a significant element of these difficult areas of risk.</p>
          <p>Within the derivative portfolio, we saw significant growth from 280 billion to just under &#xA3;1 trillion of assets.  It's worth noting that 80% of that was a function of movement in the underlying parameters against then which those derivatives were quantified; 12% was due to the weakness in Sterling and 8% was down to growth in volume and underlying activity notwithstanding a very large <mark type="inaudible" /> increase.  The bulk of our activities are in the liquid flow markets, rates, currencies, credit markets and the bulk of our activity if we do take risk is leveraging the back of the client flows.  90% also is covered by netting or collateral agreements.  That leaves around &#xA3;90 million worth of uncollateralized exposure against which we hold a &#xA3;10 billion reserve.</p>
          <p>Just a few remarks on the balance sheet.  Headline number &#xA3;2.2 trillion up from 1.6 this time a year ago; derivative's really the entire driver of that, growing from roughly say 300 million to &#xA3;1 trillion.  The funded balance sheet was flat on a reported basis 2007; with the weakness of Sterling at a constant FX number that would be down 17%.  Looking at a leverage ratio if you net, not strictly U.S. GAAP, but if you netted all our derivatives against each other we'd be looking at a 4.7 Tier 1 to total asset ratio.</p>
          <p>The driver reduction, the funded balance sheet on constant FX basis GBM related, and you can see the progress that was made; we did have a spike in the third quarter which we talked about at the time of the October capital raising.  The headline numbers coming down from 874 to 692 on a reported basis; 874 to 594, a 31% decline, on constant currency with securities and repos driving that reduction.  The loan book in this environment, not surprisingly, is remaining rather sticky.</p>
          <p>RWAs grew from 486 to 578 billion, two-thirds of that was foreign exchange related, and 30% of our risk-weighted assets are in dollars, 17% in Euros; the balance was a pro-cyclical impact of Basel II and largely within the GBM portfolios.  There are other sort of small elements of data calibration, redesignation, various things that didn't make a great deal of difference, so the main drivers FX and pro-cyclicality.</p>
          <p>On a capital basis, our Core Tier I move from 4 to 7 on a pro-forma basis within the 6.9 to 7.4 range that we indicated on January 19, the drivers of that obviously are major capital raisings and the pref share conversion which was offset by the attributable loss by the pro-cyclical impact and by the dividend that was paid in the first half of 2008.  You can see the FX impacts on the risk-weighted assets were largely offset by hedges that we hold against that exposure.  The final sort of two columns there just show the Tier 1 deductions; FSA guidelines would deduct emerging loss &#x2013; expected losses from Core Tier 1.  It's about a 35 basis point pre-tax deduction, 25 basis points post tax and per those guidelines would bring our Core Tier 1 down to 6.8.  In line, I think, with emerging best practice, we will report on this basis going forward from this point.</p>
          <p>And finally, just to sort of bring it all back into where it might look like with three to five years time, an illustrative balance sheet that would take sort of where we are and some of the strategic actions which Stephen outlined would see us getting to a nominal balance sheet of more like a &#xA3;900 billion or so, of which risk-weighted assets something in the order of 470, Core Tier 1 of 6.5, implies a 250 billion reduction in nominal assets, 110 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets, essentially the non-core bank scale.</p>
          <p>Good to see a more balanced funding position.  You can see the sort of implied growth rates that means for deposits over loans over that time period; also there will be significant parts of the loan book we will be looking to exit over that three to five year period and we think these will be at least order of magnitude doable and achievable; and then moving to an environment of stable returns in the 15% plus category.  Our immediate challenges are really weathering the next period, 2009 to 2011, and the measures announced this morning are certainly helpful in mitigating the extensive whatever economic slowdown we are about to experience.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand it back for questions.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, good morning.  It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox-Pitt Kelton.  Couple of questions please, if I may, on the government asset protection scheme and the capital effects, just so that I understand, and apologies if I missed your descriptions Stephen; and then a couple on the outlook on income.  Just wanted to understand, again, this point about how losses get absorbed, not in the event of liquidation now, but just in the events of just losses occurring, and whether you confirm the FSA is quite happy for the A shares, ordinary equity Tier 1 ratio so to speak, to 4, below 4%, given that we now have the B share components as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as I am aware, the FSA is, has agreed to treat Core Tier 1 as Core Tier 1, and therefore the 4% applies to Core Tier 1.  But they've put out a separate announcement and which you must read and I'm afraid I've been too busy to read it.</p>
          <p>The loss absorption, again I think I'm sorry to say this comes back into this matter of interpretation, that obviously losses are absorbed against our book value which contains both A shares &#x2013; ordinary shares, let's call them A shares for the sake of this, and B shares.  To the extent that the B shares carry a preferential set of dividend rights, you might have the perspective that the reality is that the A shares bear the first loss except in liquidation.  To the extent that you feel that the right way to think about the B shares is that they're convertible into A shares at 50 p and therefore have inherent in them a huge amount of loss absorption capacity before you get to 50 p, you might have a different perspective.  So you pays your money and you takes your choice.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good.  Just I wanted to ask about the assets that are going into the asset protection scheme, clearly we haven't got a definitive list of those.  Could you perhaps venture to tell us whether the commercial real estate assets are going in in total or whether that is still something that's being developed?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's still being fiddled with and it is subject both to our ability to fiddle with it before completion and to government due diligence, or government advisors' due diligence, making sure.  So far the only assets that they have said is not eligible have been our merchant banking assets, but all our other assets, so far, have been conceptually available and so obviously what we've been trying to do is work through in the first instance stressed assets including derivatives or CDPC type things as well, and then in the second instance, as I mentioned, there were a &#x2013; the significant growth in the target size of the pool which occurred in recent days was really a lot of the UK loan books; not because they were stressed, although there's stress certainly in, but to make room for additional UK lending.</p>

          <p>But we &#x2013; now I'm very conscious.  We will give full disclosure, but there's sort of no point right now while it's a moving piece.  So &#x2013; and because we have to have an EGM and we have to give out information you'll have to wait a little bit, I'm afraid, to get more.  But clearly it is in our interest to cover the stressed assets first and to work through that and the government wants us to do that, is allowing us to do that.  And one other very important feature that I should have pointed out is the intent is the insurance is backdated to the 1st of January.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  If I may just ask a question, just in terms of looking forward, two things; and thanks for the disclosure, it's very, very helpful on the risk concentrations.  But clearly there's a cost involved in managing down those concentrations, usually some capital loss perhaps taken.  I don't know how much this is a feature of the very &#x2013; sort of fourth quarter of last year and perhaps you could guide us as to what we might be thinking in terms of the cost of de-risking or taking out the risk concentrations going forward.  And just related to that, there was quite a sizable jumping in the impairments in GBM in the fourth quarter.  Taking out Lyondell, there's still 2 billion.  And I don't know what &#x2013; whether you could indicate to us what sort of mix that was and how we might think about 2009, whether that starts a trend or whether that was just a blip?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try the first bit and I'll ask Guy to have a crack at the second bit.  I suppose the simple answer to you is that the cost of buying protection against big single name exposures is very, very expensive to the extent it's available at all.  There are some instances where we judge that expense nevertheless worth it, because we have a more pessimistic view than the market; but there are other instances where we'd much rather not and in the sense the advent of the APS is one of our routes out of that process.  And that covers my earlier comments as it relates to the non-core division because in a sense the excess large exposures are non-core.  We may still want to bank these companies, but not in that amount and the ability to work these down with the benefit of APS protection over time as opposed to have to in a sense panic and risk ground short-term is there, albeit we're subject to a very large first loss piece which one clearly can't lose sight off.  But Guy, do you want to have a crack at that?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the fourth quarter, Lyondell was the only large, single large name, in balance there was 30 or 40 names in the range of 50 to &#xA3;100 million; obviously, some property- related names, but not in a special concentration within that sector.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  It's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon.  Just to carry on the themes, I guess you're going to be getting a lot of questions on the asset protection scheme, but to focus, you just made that comment on the CDPC portfolio and other sort of very toxic parts of the balance sheet.  It would seem very much in your interest to try to get as much of that on to the government asset protection scheme, the CDPC, the Monoline exposures and the CLOs within that.  And it seems that you're getting it at a very good price, effectively 6 to 8% loss ratios on assets that could easily take a 70-80% loss.  I guess the question is, really, how explicit is the sort of government's acknowledgment of the potential losses that it might face in the near term, i.e. 2009, on these types of assets, and are you as wary about the potential losses that those assets might &#x2013; losses that might be crystallized on those assets in the course of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just qualify some of your opening statements.  Of course it is the case that there are some assets in this mix which cause particular worries about the potential for loss, because the pool gets as big as 300 billion.  In judging whether it's cheap insurance or not you have to take the average loss potential, not the loss potential on just some of the assets.  And in a sense a bigger pool dilutes, therefore, the insurance benefit as a percentage, not as an absolute amount.  And so in an extreme you could lose 100% of a whole bunch of assets and if you don't lose much on a whole bunch of others your average loss could well come within the 6%.  The government has done &#x2013; has had advisors crawling all over the portfolios in a complete open book approach.  They &#x2013; and I think they go into it with their eyes open, but all of us have our eyes open, but we still can't foresee the future.  And so who knows?  I don't think any of us have any ability to ascribe a sensible probability to where the eventual loss will occur or with what pace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Don't get me wrong, I think it's obviously very favorable pricing on RBS' terms.  And just a second question; I mean, you mentioned a sort of ROE expectation, but given that you're probably going to be de-leveraging, shrinking, particularly in GBM, I mean could you give guidance in terms of the return on risk-weighted asset, return on asset expectations then on behalf of the Group?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, it's Tom Rayner from Citigroup here.  Could I just ask you a question which focuses on slide 25?  It looks like you've built yourself a buffer here, which compared to the 4% FSA post-stress test minimum is sort of around the 36 billion.  And if I take out the 6.5 billion fee, the 5 billion deferred tax and maybe another 3 billion just to fund your lending commitments, it still looks like a buffer against that minimum of 20, 21 billion.  I'm just trying to get a sense is that a realistic proxy for how bad you might &#x2013; things might get in terms of retained losses over the next few years or am I sort of putting some of my inputs into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the caveat &#x2013; who knows how bad losses will get?  No idea, you can guess as well as I can.  What we were trying to do was to stay well above the regulatory minimum even in really bad cases.  Whether we succeed or not the future will tell.  But the other thing that we were quite mindful about is that while the APS improves our regulatory ratios, there is some risk that the B shares are not given the same credit as A shares by rating agencies.  We don't yet know how the rating agencies will react to them.  And our absolute leverage ratio doesn't improve, it actually gets worse, because we do actually UK lending until such time as we can work off the assets that are in the non-core division.</p>
          <p>And therefore, I think that, increasingly, banks will need to look both at the regulatory ratios and at the simple funding requirements, if you like, the actual assets that are balanced on top of this amount of equity.  And so we're also conscious that we weren't just solving Core Tier 1, but just absolute amounts of equity that support the funding that we've got to do in uncertain times.  And so that, I think that's the nearest I can get to give you some ways to thinking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And just quickly on the same point.  I'm just a little bit confused by the amortization of the &#xA3;6.5 billion fee because the way I understood it when I read it first thing was that you would be issuing a certain number of shares, 13 billion shares to the government, but there wouldn't be any actual cash being transferred to you.  But obviously I need to maybe get a bit more clarification exactly how that works and why the 6.5 amortized now is ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>13 billion is cash to us.  The 6.5 is non-cash, in other words, fee has changed to 6.5.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 13 is cash. But there is a difference.  We, in a sense, up front issue the 6.5 billion in compensation for the fee.  From day one, we have to service that, the 7% coupon, but through our accounts the fee will be written off over seven years.  And so our accounts will each year in respect to this fee component see a 7 &#x2013; 6.5 billion written off, plus the servicing cost in perpetuity, if you like, or until conversion of the instruments that we paid with.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Simon Samuels, also from Citigroup, so kind of in team-tag with Tom.  The &#x2013; actually I kind of &#x2013; actually, partly, a few questions.  The first is sort of a follow on from what Tom was asking.  If I look at, in fact, Philip, your very last slide, slide 56, and I appreciate you just described this illustrative, but at 6.5% Core Tier 1 and whatever it was, 470 billion of RWAs, is Core Tier 1 capital of about 30 billion versus the 54 billion that you're saying you've got at the moment.  So can you just kind of tell us how that illustrative balance sheet &#x2013; how you get there, basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you are &#x2013; this is the danger of putting it up which I recognize, that you're in danger of investing significance in it.  What we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any other sides that are in the same category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no ability to be precise about what it takes to be standalone AA rated in five years' time because the rating agencies don't know themselves yet, and the regulatory environment will change.  So, we have a moving target, but it nonetheless is something we have to think about.  So what we're trying to do is think about directionally, what are the things that we have to change in our financial make-up to have a chance of having the standalone financial strength that we want to have.  And that slide is designed to say we need to have some things that relate to capital ratios; we need to have some things that relate to absolute leverage; we need to have some things that relate to the nature of our funded balance sheet customer deposits versus wholesale funding; and then we need to have some healthy businesses that are throwing off cash flow.</p>
          <p>So it's sort of &#x2013; it was designed really almost as a checklist of the things we have to do some surgery on, with perhaps an order of magnitude as to where they might have to end up for AA rating, but no more than perhaps.  But there is no attempt to then link that in to a particular set of financial ratios that we have at any one moment in time and what equity we may or may not lose and so on and so forth; absolutely not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Because I mean which, yeah I kind of expected that.  Where this links in, I think, is with your non-performing loan trends in a way because your NPLs, although they've gone from about 8 billion in June to about 17 billion by December, so kind of up 1.5 billion a month run rate, and I know that was asked earlier; and if you look at the other slide that sort of gave out the impairment showing the proportion of with the number of corporate cases transferred to your recoveries unit, that shows nothing like that trend.  I mean it's up 20-30% as the year progressed versus doubling in the NPL trends.  So, I mean, can you give us some, and I hear what you say about January's not been as bad as December, its <mark type="inaudible" />.  Can you give us any sort of guidance, other banks have as you know in both UK and Ireland in terms of their outlook for bad debt, can you give us any sense of your cutting charge forecast?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the exact guidance is foolhardy because there's too much uncertainty, but what I might do is ask Peter Nathanial, who's our Chief Risk Officer, to see if he wants to give you some words without giving you a forecast.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I &#x2013; all I would say is the trends on the heightened management portfolio, I think the way it was put up there, which you might consider some of the early warning parts of the portfolio, are continuing to trend the way you might expect.  So as January might not have seen the actual credit costs come through the trend on the early warning indicators in that pipeline is still trending the way I think you're trying to allude to.  So that's come through, fourth quarter, January at the same trend and I would expect it to continue, indeed, all the way through to the recovery there through the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  It's Jon Kirk of Redburn Partners.  I'm just trying to understand and I appreciate there are certain restrictions on what you can say, but exactly how much risk remains with the Royal Bank of Scotland, because if I look at the assets that you've lost and say the risk-weighted assets that you've lost, the risk-weighting over the residual assets isn't wildly different actually from what it was before.  I can't do the numbers in my head, but it was not materially different.  Now, does that mean that actually, proportionately, you haven't reduced that much risk compared, i.e., the riskiness of the assets that's left the business or been insured rather is not wildly different to what's left or is the risk-weighting a very bad guide to the relative riskiness of those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a bad guide for two reasons.  The first reason is that we haven't precisely calculated because it all happened too fast.  And one of the things that we will do as we work through precisely what assets go in is improve on precisely what risk weighting those have, because none of our internal systems were designed to &#x2013; for the sort of pick and mix activity that has just been taking place.  So, there's an element where the data will change; but also Basel II does not well cope with our subjective forward-looking thoughts on where the most stress might arise and a good example of that would be commercial real estate where under Basel II, because it's secured and because the scenarios you ran normally didn't include a 50% decline in the underlying asset values, you came up with very low loss given defaults and therefore a low risk weighting.</p>
          <p>But I think subjectively, in the face of what we see in the market we might have subscribe a subjective weighting in our own minds significantly higher than that of the Basel II models based on historic modeling throughout.  So, I think that's &#x2013; those are the two answers that I think I would give you.  But equally, I think everyone would love there to be this really nice parcel you could say these are my bad loans; they're gone and everything else is good and of course as we all know the world isn't like that.  You have an infinite gradation of grey from good to bad and something you think is good may actually not be good tomorrow depending on exactly how this economic downturn twists and turns.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I do think that we will have significant impairments in our non-insured portfolios; but obviously if we do our job properly they will be rather less as a percent of assets than the ones that are insured.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I just I mean, just sort of continuing then when you were negotiating with the Treasury was there a general acceptance on both sides of the negotiating table that actually it was better if you submitted your highest risk assets or were they trying to prevent you from submitting a <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think negotiation is a kind word.  It doesn't feel like it was one to me but no, the Treasury &#x2013; I mean, you know and I want to be really fair, I think that what the government has done is a really major politically courageous scheme, which is obviously available to many banks, we just happened to be the first, which I think has important benefits to the financial system and to RBS, which is why our expectation is that we will recommend it.  I don't want to take anything away from that.  And we shared, in a sense, many goals because unless the banks are more financial stable the economy is hurt and unless they're more financially stable they can't make the additional lending that was called upon to fill the gap.</p>
          <p>And so I would say that as it relates to asset selection, the government has been encouraging of us putting in the most stressed assets, subject to their due diligence.  And so, if you like, we really have not been having any disagreements with them about asset selection.  They drove us to a bigger pool than we put forward, but that was because they wanted the lending on the other side.  The differences of view we would have would have been you know more about the other aspects of the insurance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Mike Trippet at Oriel.  Just, I wanted to understand the logic of the pool and the asset protection scheme of 300 billion and within the sort of non-core division of RBS the asset pool is 240.  So I think you've said that about 47% of the asset protection scheme assets would be within the ongoing sort of core businesses.  Does that sort of suggest that there's an immediate kind of replacement where you've had high-risk assets carrying quite high losses that you're &#x2013; it sounds like you're almost immediately going to both sort of lend behind those in terms of creating room from more lending within the core businesses?  I think that's the right interpretation but also I'm just trying to understand what the mix is going to be?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; what I'm trying to understand is only the 47% of the asset protection scheme assets remain referred to the core businesses.  And you're saying that that is being done to make way for the UK lending commitment.  So I'm sort of trying to understand the risk profile of the lending that will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I suppose you've got quite a mixed bag, so let's take UK mortgage book.  We &#x2013; by and large we have one of the safer UK mortgage books out there.  On the other hand, there is a sliver of our UK mortgage book that is stressed or that may become stressed in the next year if house prices continue to fall.  And so even though that is a core business and it's part of the ongoing core division, there would be a sliver of the UK mortgage book that we would have put in APS for two reasons.  One, we'd have put the most stress bit in; but secondly, we were also solving for a certain risk asset relief in order to be able to put some risk assets back on and so we probably moved the cutoff point beyond the stressed bit to still stressed, but less stressed, in order to give us &#x2013; in order to solve for a given risk asset result.  Does that answer the...?</p>

          <p>It's a loss, as I say, because one, just because something is a core business doesn't mean to say it doesn't have stress.  Our UK and U.S. and Irish corporate lend businesses have enormous stresses although they're core businesses.  So there can be plenty of stressed assets in core businesses but there also are assets that are less stressed in core businesses that are sold for a given risk-weighted asset reduction in order to be able to commit responsibly to a risk-weighted asset increase that we added to it.  And I &#x2013; obviously when we give you full details, when we, a) have ourselves full details, and b) then can make them available to you, you'll be able to get more granularity.  So I appreciate all I can give you at the moment is words, but unfortunately this thing was still being sort of fiddled with into the early hours of this morning, so we just simply don't &#x2013; we have a term sheet.  That's what we have.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... scheme.  So <mark type="inaudible" /> 5.4.  And then moving forwards, are you saying you'll give up all, if any, tax credits associated with the UK losses?  Is that how we should think about it for what...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is what the government are asking for.  It was an ask that was inserted late yesterday which has not had any ability to be defined, codified, made clear as to how possible it is or isn't or exactly how extensive it is.  So I can't tell you much more than that because that's, you know, this thing went down to the wire.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as I understand the concept that is being asked, and there's no more than a concept until it's codified and we don't have to agree to it in the sense of shareholders don't have to agree to the whole scheme.  The concept would be that losses that arise between now, UK, between now and when we return to profitability, which might be this year or might be longer depending on the view you take of the downturn, would also in a sense not ultimately be deductible, i.e. we would start paying tax as soon as we are profitable again in the UK.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would regard the overriding priority for everyone as being financial stability because from that everything derives and so I think that we'll be thinking of it in those terms and taking account, if you like, what's happening to our ratios, but not just our Core Tier 1 ratio, also thinking about the equity leverage ratios and the outlook that we see.</p>

          <p>Robert Law at Nomura.  I have a number of questions also on the scheme, please.  Firstly, can I probe a bit more about the relative stress within the different buckets you've now got, if you like.  I mean, you talked about your expected loss I think or likely level of credit stress in the various buckets, so could you comment on how you'd see that in terms of the assets in the asset portfolio scheme, the assets in the non-core bank and the assets that are retained in the core bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't quantitatively comment on it.  It is our intent to push in descending order our most stressed and <mark type="inaudible" /> intensive assets into the APS.  We've had a crack at it so far and it will be refined subject to, obviously, government due diligence and control before the scheme is entered into, assuming it is entered into.  But I can give you no quantitative assessment of that in part because we haven't finished the process and in part because it's an exercise of gazing into the future and I'm very, very reluctant to do that quantitatively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Will you take any reserves against assets put into the asset protection scheme initially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not as an initial transfer.  Obviously, there is an initial reserve taken in the Core Tier 1, as I have explained.  And &#x2013; but are conceptually, and again all of this, anything I say now I might unsay in a week or two's time when I really work through the details; it just kind of happened in a compressed way.  But conceptually, until we get to the first loss piece, we'll behave completely normally, because it's for our tab, and it's only once you get to the first loss piece that we obviously still behave normally in respect to 10% but where the accounting will then need to take account of, if like the government receivable that in effect we get to make with the...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's JP Crutchley from UBS.  It just maybe a slightly longer term question in terms of what is the eventual game plan in terms of exiting from the B shares, if there is one?  Is your expectation at this point that at some point, eventually, they will convert to ordinary shares and we'll look at things on a <mark type="inaudible" /> basis and they'll all just be A shares; or do you expect at some stage if a bank returns profitability that you can buy those back at a price from the treasury and has that been discussed in terms of how that mechanism might work?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of Guy's slide, in terms of capital, when he was talking about Core Tier 1, was that intending to be just A type capital or was that aggregate in the assumption that there still be some B shares outstanding?  So, just assuming things do actually get back to some form of normality, how should we think about the shares in the Group going forward, long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capital slide was written, I'm afraid, before we had any idea of A and B shares, so it wasn't that clever.  I guess the government has not agreed or discussed with us any formula as it relates to repurchase.  And so that would be an open book if and when we had those capital riches.  I suspect it's slightly topological that if we're doing so well that we've got those capital riches the share price is likely to be allowing them to be distributed by increasing the free float.  And so I suspect it will end up being in a sense of circular answer but there isn't a deal.  And clearly from our point of view, if we could &#x2013; if we were feeling safe in our financial stability goals and felt we had excess capital on top of that and felt we could do an accretive deal for ordinary shareholders, we'd do that.  That will be a happy problem to have when it arises.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley.  Just two questions, firstly, on the non-core assets.  Thanks very much for giving us the revenue and the cost breakout to that.  I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how much of that is annuity-type revenue and how much is flow revenue, so would you just times the reduction in the cash flows coming from that.  And also if I look at slide 37 where you give us some comments on the net interest margin outlook and it's noticeable that widening assets, also spreads and re-pricing for risk premium isn't in your outlook.  Is that just because it's been offset somewhere else or is that on top?  It's quite a big margin reduction that you're flagging for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But just on the first, Guy can answer the second obviously.  On the first, I'm afraid I don't have a breakdown for you, but my sort of off the cuff answer would be it will mostly be recurring revenues because this is not &#x2013; the trading businesses that are in here are the ones that were doing badly last year anyway and so credit areas and so on.  And so most of this will be in a sense loan and in quasi-loan assets &#x2013; loan assets and stock securities, which will mostly be quotes recurring albeit subject to credit stress.  Guy, do you want say something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second point, there are pressures on the margins, particularly when low rates start to kick in towards deposit flows and saving accounts and some of that has already taken into consideration in the '09 plan.  And obviously there are scenarios where rates go even lower from here and there are still risks to the downside, I'd say.  I think funding costs, as you know from banks remained high, competition for deposits is high, and <mark type="inaudible" /> pricing is going up; it still feels as if overall we'll see tightening in 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Simon Willis from NCB, two quick bigger picture questions if I could.  From the viewpoint of an investor or maybe an objective analyst, I think you could argue that the last few months have been a coach and horses driven through IFRS accounting and moving the goal post on some of the ball to background for capital ratios.  Can I ask, looking in particular at the capital base, the slide, Stephen, that you set out including the new capital and then looking at the first loss element, if I look at that in relation to the commercial property portfolio which I think from memory was 97 billion, up from 91 last disclosed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's FX by the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  If you take a 3 to 10% loss you might chose to look at from a commercial property portfolio in relation to the capital base going forward.  Can I ask whether there have been or there might be any changes in recognition of impairments in areas as such as commercial property?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not envisioned.  We've provided on the base of everything we know this juncture, Simon.  So we're not expecting a sort of step change in that at this juncture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  And secondly, and briefly, is there any meaningful risk that the first loss element at 6% falls foul of EU regulations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have no ability to judge the risk.  I think all of EU governments are in a state of heightened discussion with the EU.  They have all sorts of political ebbs and swirls and so this is subject to EU approval.  Obviously, it's subject to that, yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that.  I should have asked it on the way.  But can I ask how the loss scheme works?  So you got a 6% first loss scheme.  If you end up with loss around particular assets being above that, are you capping the loss on each particular asset or are you &#x2013; it's an absolutely loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's a pool.  So all losses of whatever percent on all the assets in it are for our account until you get to the threshold number and then 90% of losses thereafter, whatever percent they are and whatever assets, switch over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think since the strategy is all about execution then we need to go away and execute.  So thank you all very much.</p>
