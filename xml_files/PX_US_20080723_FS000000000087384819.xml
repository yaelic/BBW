          <p>Thanks, Jim and good morning.  Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the "Investors" section.  Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 3 for a summary of our second quarter results.  Praxair had another very strong quarter, with double-digit sales growth in all our geographic regions.  We achieved these results despite a challenging US economy and some signs of macroeconomic weakness in Europe.  In both these regions, we achieved solid organic growth from new business and new applications.</p>
          <p>Growth in Asia and South America has continued to accelerate.  New project proposal activity is robust.  Domestic and foreign investment in China, India, Brazil and other South American countries for infrastructure expansion and commodity production is growing and we are very well positioned in these locations.  Our base business in these emerging markets continues to benefit from strong economic activity and a positive pricing environment.</p>
          <p>Overall sales grew 23% to $2.88 billion.  Currency appreciation contributed 7% to sales growth.  Underlying organic growth was a strong 12% from higher volumes and higher pricing in all our geographies.  Acquisitions contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter.  This was primarily the quarter-over-quarter impact of North American packaged gas distributors that we acquired in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>Globally sales growth was highest in Energy, Manufacturing and Metals markets, continuing the business trends we have been seeing in recent quarters.  High oil and gas prices continue to stimulate oxy-fuel combustion conversions and oil and gas well fracturing.  Industrial manufacturing has continued to be strong in the emerging markets and for us has remained reasonably strong in the US.  Our business is not directly exposed to the obvious weakness in US consumer demand and we have a relatively small exposure to the auto industry.  We estimate that about 4% of our sales are to that industry, both direct and indirect through suppliers and steel and stainless production.  Our sales are largely going into non-residential construction, infrastructure spending and commodities.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was a record $543 million, 24% above the second quarter of 2007.  The higher mix of hydrogen sales dilutes its operating leverage a bit as hydrogen sales have a lower operating margin percentage than oxygen or nitrogen due to the high cost of the natural gas feedstock, which is passed through to the customers in our hydrogen prices.  Ex-hydrogen our operating profit margin would be over 19%, demonstrating the success we are having in largely offsetting escalating power and fuel costs with higher prices and cost savings from productivity programs.</p>
          <p>Net income increased 20% quarter-over-quarter to $349 million.  The slower growth in net income versus operating profit results from higher interest expense due to higher debt levels to support our common stock repurchases and also due to the higher effective tax rate of 28% versus 26% in 2007.</p>
          <p>Our earnings per share this quarter were $1.08 versus $0.89 in the prior year quarter.  EPS grew 21% from the strong growth in net income and fewer shares outstanding versus the prior year.  Earnings per share would have grown 25% with an equivalent tax rate in both years, which indicates the operating leverage we continue to achieve from growth and good control of fixed expenses.  We generated cash flow from operations of 389 million in the quarter.  Capital expenditures were 380 million primarily funding the growing number of on-site plants in our backlog.  We invested 30 million this quarter to acquire several North American packaged gas distributors.  We closed the sale of our Industrial Gas business in Israel and this represented the bulk of the divestiture proceeds.</p>
          <p>We announced this morning a new 1 billion share repurchase program.  You will recall that we announced a $1 billion program in July 2007 and at that time said that we expected to complete the repurchases over a two year timeframe.  Due to our strong cash flow generation we are substantially ahead of that schedule and have repurchased 931 million to-date under that program.  This new program is in addition to what is remaining under the first authorization and demonstrates our on-going commitment to using our free cash flow for shareholder value creation.  Our first priority for cash flow is to fund our profitable growth projects.  But we forecast that because of our high return on capital we will continue to generate cash well above what we need for capital investment.</p>
          <p>Our debt to capital ratio at quarter-end was 43.4%, lower than last quarter due to strong net income growth.  Our return-on-capital and return-on-equity ratios both increased to 15.4% and 25.7% respectively.</p>
          <p>Please refer to pages 4 and 5 for our results in North America.  Sales in North America rose to 1.57 billion, 22% above the prior year quarter.  Higher natural gas prices passed through to customers in hydrogen prices contributed 4% of this sales growth.</p>
          <p>Sales from acquired packaged gas companies added another 4%.  Underlying growth from higher volumes and price was 12% versus the prior year.  Sales growth was broadly diversified, coming from new business and solid demand from existing customers in energy and refining, metals, chemicals and general manufacturing markets.  Though certain sectors of the US economy like housing, auto and financials are struggling, we do not have any significant exposure to these markets and as such we have not seen significant slowdown in our base business.</p>
          <p>The year-over-year volume growth in merchant and packaged gases is more moderate than what we were experiencing a year ago.  But new business activity is robust and pricing trends are very strong for all products and in all markets, given steady demand, generally tight supply conditions, minimal expected incremental production capacity coming online and inflation in power and fuel costs.</p>
          <p>In North America sales growth to the manufacturing sector excluding acquisitions was a solid 9%.  This may sound surprising, but sectors that we serve including agriculture, metals, commodities and energy are growing well due to the weak US dollar and strong global demand.  Mexico's economy is growing rapidly and our sales there were up 21% in the quarter, boosted by higher sales to energy due to increasing demand from refiners and oil and natural gas well service companies.</p>
          <p>On-site sales grew 25% excluding the effect of higher natural gas prices.  Higher on-site hydrogen volumes to refiners, which were 28% above the prior year, contributed to this growth.  Strong demand for hydrogen from our refining customers is driven by low sulfur diesel production.  Refiners are currently running at minimal gasoline production due to rising inventories and low margins, due to softening consumer demand.  Therefore, they have switched their production to diesel fuel and other middle distillates, which have better margins for them.  These products are very hydrogen intensive and we have seen no impact on our hydrogen demand from lower gasoline demand.</p>
          <p>On-site oxygen and nitrogen volumes were 12% above the prior year, on solid demand from steel and chemical customers.  Merchant sales were up 13% from good volume growth and higher pricing.  Sales to oil well service companies were strong in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  We expect sales to this sector to continue to grow.  Rapidly escalating natural gas prices have supported increasing investment in natural gas exploration, new technology, and drilling in tighter geological strata, such as coal, shale, and sandstone.</p>
          <p>Nitrogen or carbon dioxide is required, when the formations are under pressurized and require an energized fluid to stimulate flow from the well.  Carbon dioxide and nitrogen sales were also up to food and beverage from new applications and seasonal demand, as is typical in warmer weather.  Packaged gases sales in North America grew 15% from the prior year, including the benefit of several acquisitions we made in the U.S. and in Canada.  In PDI, which is our U.S. and Canadian business, same-store sales growth was 5%, driven by higher gases sales.</p>
          <p>Demand for rare gases and specialty gases is increasing and supplies are tight.  Some key markets where we are seeing strong growth are refining, universities and research labs, electronics and biopharma.  Pricing trends are positive and up substantially for these specialized gases.  We are successfully implementing the most recent price increases that we announced in April to recover higher power and distribution costs.  Sales of hard goods weakened in the US and Canada, which we believe reflects the slowdown in the auto, transportation and construction industries.  Energy, metals, mining and agriculture are sectors where we continue to see some strength.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in North America grew 19% to $275 million from volume growth and higher pricing and the operating margin was 17.5%.  The growth is slightly lower than the sales growth because of the sharply higher prices of natural gas, power and fuel.  We recover these costs by passing the increases through to customers contractually in our product prices, but the impact depresses the operating margin percentage.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 6 for our results in Europe.  Sales in Europe of 406 million grew 21% versus 2007, with currency appreciation contributing 16%.  Underlying growth was 7%.  We are seeing moderate growth in Spain and Italy despite slowing industrial production and a weak housing market.  Sales in Spain were up 8% ex-currency.  Industrial production in Germany is stronger due to growing exports and our business is growing.  Underlying sales in the quarter grew 13%.  We announced last week that we are building a large new plant on our pipeline, which will supply, under contract, the increasing requirements of our chemical, steel and refining customers in that region, as well as a number of new customers.  In addition, the plant will supply liquid to the growing merchant market.</p>
          <p>New business from applications technology transfer is driving good growth in merchant and packaged gases.  Operating profit grew 25% to $99 million.  We are working hard to increase prices to stay ahead of rapidly escalating power costs, which are up more than 20% versus last year.  We completed the sale of our industrial gas business in Israel this quarter.  The business had sales of 27 million in 2007.  The impact of the sale on operating profit is immaterial.</p>
          <p>Page 7 highlights our results in South America.  Sales in South America continue to reflect the strength and stability of Brazil's economy, as well as growth in the rapidly developing economies of Peru, Chile, Colombia and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Industrial production in Brazil far exceeds the US and the Euro zone driven by exports and high prices of commodities and growing consumer demand.  Sales of 514 million were 31% above the prior year.  Year-over-year growth was 15%, excluding currency appreciation from higher on-site merchant and packaged gas sales.  Our backlog of projects in the region is increasing as our on-site customers in steel and non-ferrous metals, petrochemicals, paper and other general manufacturing are expanding and adding capacity.</p>
          <p>The supply systems which we are currently building will come on stream through the end of 2010.  Merchant and packaged gases sales are also growing to food and beverage and healthcare.  Sales of LNG through our joint venture with Petrobras continued to ramp up.  Operating profit grew 34% to 102 million.  Price increases and productivity savings outpaced cost increases and the operating margin improved to 19.8%.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 8 for our results in Asia.  Our Asia results were very strong this quarter.  Sales of 232 million were 30% above the prior year from strong volume growth and higher prices.  On-site and liquid sales grew in China, India and Korea.</p>
          <p>Our sales to electronics grew 37%.  Growth in flat panel and solar manufacturing is fueling demand for on-site nitrogen supply, xylene, helium and rare gases.  Demand for these products globally is outstripping supply, leading to strong pricing gains, which you can see in our results.  This quarter we announced a new 2,000-ton-per-day plant, which in late 2009 will supply multiple on-site and liquid gases to Samsung for one of its thin-film transistor liquid crystal display facilities.</p>
          <p>Chemicals, metals and manufacturing are also rapidly growing markets for our products.  A newer market for us China is pharmaceuticals.  We recently announced a new contract for our proprietary nitrogen cooling system and technology, which will be used for precision cooling of production freeze-dryers and chemical reactors.  We have not seen any slowdown in the region in our base business and project proposal activity is accelerating.  Many of these projects are expansions with existing customers.  We started up two new plants this quarter, which will ramp-up in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew 33% to $40 million.  We have an operating margin over 17% even though we are growing our engineering infrastructure to support the large number of projects we are building and bidding in the region as well as globally.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 9 for Surface Technology's results.  Surface Technology sales grew 17% to 153 million and 9% excluding currency effects.  Our sales growth came from two sectors.  First, we coated higher volumes of jet engine parts for the major airline engine manufacturers.  We are seeing a little trickle through effect of delays in the new large Boeing and Airbus planes, but orders are not being canceled, so we see this as perhaps just a more moderate ramp in our expected growth this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, coatings demand for industrial gas turbines and oil well components is growing, a function of high global energy prices.  We just started up a new manufacturing plant in India to supply thermal spray coatings for gate valve components, made in India, used in oil and gas production.  TFT's operating profit grew 17% to 27 million.  The operating margin of 17.6% improved from last quarter, due to higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Now please look at page 10, which shows our global end market trends for this quarter.  On this chart, we are showing you year-over-year sales growth in our major markets, with and without currency effects.  And you can see that underlying growth is very strong across the board.  Sales to the energy markets continue to be very strong and were up 33% in the quarter, excluding higher natural gas pass-through in the hydrogen business.</p>
          <p>While refining margins are being squeezed from high crude prices and softening gasoline demand, this has not impacted our hydrogen sales.  The spread between heavy and light crude still favors processing heavy crude, which is very hydrogen-intensive.</p>
          <p>Most of our Gulf Coast customers are making large amounts of ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which has been one of the few profitable products for refiners.  Growing demand from Europe for diesel fuel passenger cars is supporting diesel margins.  High global crude and natural gas prices also support increased drilling activity and we expect there will be increasing opportunities to supply gases for  well fracing in many of the new shale locations in North America that are being developed.</p>
          <p>Our LNG business in Brazil continues to grow and we are exploring similar opportunities in other countries.  Electronics continues to grow nicely.  Sales were up 15% this quarter driven by sales in Asia for flat panel and semiconductor production.  The photovoltaic market is an emerging opportunity.  It is forecasted to grow rapidly and we estimate that the total solar gigawatts will grow by 30 to 40% per year through 2015.</p>
          <p>Gas products which are required in the manufacturing of polysilicon and the modules include nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium, specialty gases like xylene and dopant gases.  In addition targets are required for physical vapor deposition and we are uniquely positioned to be able to supply both.  We expect that the total market for gases and deposition materials will grow from about 100 million this year to over $2 billion in 2015.  We currently supply a number of customers in the US, Europe and Asia and most recently announced a new contract with the Pevafersa Group in Spain.</p>
          <p>Sales to the chemical sector are up 24%.  As all of you know North American producers are benefiting from a weak dollar and the spread between natural gas and oil.  While domestic demand has fallen, exports are picking up the slack and so our volumes have been generally strong.  I mentioned earlier the growth we are seeing in Germany.  In addition we're continuing to build-out our key petrochemical enclave in China to meet the requirements of our customers there.</p>
          <p>Sales to metals were up 19% and 10%, ex-currency.  Most of the new growth is from projects in Brazil, China and India.  US volumes are strong as steel producers here are cost competitive globally with the weak dollar and though US demand has dropped the difference is made up in the export market.</p>
          <p>High global prices for other metals like zinc and copper are supporting new investment by the mining sector and we have signed numerous contracts to supply the mining industry expansions in Chile and Peru.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing was strong with sales up 29%.  Excluding currency and acquisitions, underlying sales were up 11%.  We saw strong growth in all regions and highest in the emerging markets where infrastructure spending is still very strong.  The US is beginning to weaken in certain markets, but not all.</p>
          <p>Global healthcare sales grew 8% coming from Spain, Brazil and our US hospital business.  Growth from these business is somewhat offset by US Homecare, which is still under pressure from reimbursement rate cuts and from rationalization we are doing in the non-gas or DME portion of the business.  Sales to aerospace were up 13% due to higher jet engine coatings in our Surface Technologies business and sales to NASA.</p>
          <p>The Food and Beverage market, up 11%, is giving us good growth in North and South America.  Our sales to the Food segment are very strong from new applications and growing demand.  However underlying growth was muted by lower carbon dioxide sales in Thailand where shrimp exports have declined due to the strengthening currency.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 11 for our financial outlook and earnings guidance.  For the balance of 2008 we have a positive outlook for our business in spite of a global economy which is presenting some challenges.  We expect to achieve strong growth in sales, earnings and cash generation in the second half of the year fueled by double-digit growth in South America and Asia.  For North America we expect growth to moderate in most end markets but that will be offset by additional growth from several new plant startups and increasing sales to the energy sector.</p>
          <p>We are appropriately cautious on economic growth particularly in Europe, but expect that our business will grow faster than the economy with new contracts and new plants coming on stream.  For the third quarter our earnings guidance is a range of $1.06 to $1.10 per share on a fully diluted basis.  This represents earnings growth of 13% to 17% from the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>For the full year we now expect higher year-over-year sales growth in the range of 16% to 20%.  This increase from our prior guidance is based on the underlying business trends we are seeing and the additional currency appreciation which we have realized in the first two quarters.</p>
          <p>The expected growth percentage is below our 23% growth rate in the first half of this year primarily because currency appreciation contributed 7% in the first half and we don't expect it to continue at that rate.</p>
          <p>We are raising the upper end of our 2008 earnings guidance by a nickel and the bottom end by $0.10 to a range of $4.20 to $4.30 per diluted share excluding the $0.03 impact of the pension settlement charge which we took in the first quarter.  This represents earnings growth of 16% to 19% above 2007 in spite of the higher tax rate this year.</p>
          <p>At the bottom we have better visibility now on the full year results.  At the top we are very confident in our ability to achieve higher earnings due to the growth we are seeing and our tight focus on pricing and productivity to offset fairly significant cost inflation.  We are keeping our 2008 CapEx forecast at about 1.5 billion.  Due to our rapidly increasing backlog of projects this could be several hundred million higher in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Overall our outlook continues to be positive particularly considering the negative macroeconomic data which is coming out.  We will likely see some slowdown in our base business in the US and Europe, but that will be offset by growth in South America, China and India, plus our large backlog of new projects coming on stream.</p>
          <p>Now, we will take some questions.  And I'd like to ask you to please limit your questions to one and a follow-up and then you can get back in the queue, so everyone who is on the line will have a chance.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  First of all I apologize, I have a cold this morning so my voice is a little bit off, but we started up six projects during the quarter.  We signed seven new ones.  And just to give you a little bit of an idea of the diversification in those projects, among the new ones that we signed two were in the US, one in Mexico, one in Europe, two in South America, and one in Asia.  And also to show the diversification of the new sign-ups from end market point of view we had one in energy, one in electronics, one in chemicals, one in glass, one in pulp and paper and two in metals.  So you can see that we are still signing new projects on a broad basis globally both by end market sector and the size of the new projects continues to grow relative to the sizes of the projects that we are starting up.</p>

          <p>Yeah I mean basically we are getting pricing to offset energy costs first of all, plus we are getting another 3% or 4% of price which I would call real price, and then on top of that our productivity programs are primarily offsetting the inflation in labor and non-energy items.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your competitor is selling its healthcare business. I think you've done a much better job in this area, in this difficult time of reimbursement cuts, so the question is what kind of synergies do you see between your healthcare and your packaged gas business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, we have a fair amount of synergy between the healthcare and packaged gas in the sense that the packaged gas business is somewhat of a backbone from a production, distribution, <mark type="inaudible" /> point of view. But I think actually both the packaged gas and healthcare businesses, the key competency is how you -- what kind of people you have and how you manage those people and so forth.  It is not like the on-site business, where you're relying on a machine to generate your sales and earnings.  You're relying on your people to generate your earnings and sales.</p>
          <p>And I think that's what we have been focusing on in the healthcare business because it is even more people-dependent than the packaged gas business.  And having -- we got a good set of technicians out there visiting with customers, taking care of them. For the most part, I can't say it for all, but I think for the most part they're motivated and committed to what they do.  And the same thing on the productivity side, with the price cuts coming down from Medicare, we do have to generate productivity, and so far we've been able to generate enough productivity pretty much to offset the price cuts coming down from Medicare.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it should stay at about the 28% rate.  The main reason that it had been going up is really that we -- in one sense you can <mark type="inaudible" /> have a certain amount of tax deductions and the growth of the company is exceeding that.  But I expect the rate will remain about 28%.  Our US rate is full statutory rate and the businesses in Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico and South America are really where the tax rates are lower.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  Just a question on your PDI business. Have you seen any sort of margin squeeze due to higher energy and distribution costs during the quarter, or have you been able to cover that with pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the cost has been an issue because of higher diesel costs and transportation costs.  I think we've -- on the gases side we've been able to offset that pretty well with price increases so far.  On the hard goods side, the margins of hard goods are just lower than the margins in gases and what we're seeing right now is that while our same-store sales growth is above 5%, our gases growth is above 5%, in our hard goods there was actually shrinking.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.  You said last quarter that your PDI gas rent same-store sales were up 9% and hard goods was more like 1 to 2%. Did I understand correctly that hard good sales were negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just slightly negative, but you can clearly see the trends of what's going on, and I'll just reference the Commerce Department's Industrial Production Report that came out a week ago. In the U.S. second quarter industrial production was about a full percentage point lower than the first quarter industrial production.  So, that's industrial production going down at a 4% annualized rate and that will probably continue going forward.  And so we can see a one-to-one correlation between our hard goods sales and the industrial production rate there.  But the gas sales stay well above industrial production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys.  I had a question regarding CapEx to sales and Liz addressed this at the very end of her commentary, I think on one of the slides.  You talked about a several hundred million dollar increase in CapEx in '09; one of your competitors has announced a big ramp as well.  Can you kind of hone in a little bit more precisely on what that CapEx could be for next year, Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our guidance this year, as we said, was 1.5 billion; we might be slightly above that.  Based on what's coming into the backlog it could be 100, maybe 200 million higher than that next year and the year after.  So I don't see a huge pick-up, but we've just got more and more inquiries coming in that we are doing FEL2 cost quotations on, and the projects are bigger.  And really, there are two reasons why the projects are bigger. One is that the customers' requirements are larger. The other one is that the cost of building projects has gone up.  But that's not really a problem because all that means is that the facility fee that we are charging our customers is going up proportionately to how much the cost of building the projects is going up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For my follow-up question, I noted with interest the big price increase you posted in Asia.  I know for a time that had been a problem, but now seems to be in the double-digit category?  Was that kind of a one-off thing on mix or are those kind of price increases sustainable in Asia?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is primarily a one-off thing and it's primarily rare gases. The rare gases that we make, which come from atmospheric plants and the very large atmospheric plants, are totally sold out and I'm talking about xenon and krypton, and then argon's tight and helium is tight.  So most of that price increase came from those products.  But on the positive side, we did get some positive price increase in <mark type="inaudible" /> in China and in India.</p>

          <p>Hi, I want to ask you about the chemical business. The 18% growth excluding ForEx is pretty strong. Can you help us split between the pricing volume growth in new customers and plus what you expect it to be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yeah we had surprisingly high year-over-year sales to chemicals, but &#x2013; and that's really in three specific areas, all three of which where we have pipeline enclaves. The Gulf Coast, we had higher sales with certain of our customers producing higher volume.  Secondly in Caojing, the Chemical Industrial Park in China that we've got a pipeline system in is building quite rapidly with new capacity coming on stream. And then lastly in, surprisingly, in Germany, on the Ruhr Valley pipeline system, our main customers there are the chemical industry and that's growing high -- quite rapidly as well, and consequently we're really sold out on product and we're building a new plant there, which is going to allow us to take more customers there, to serve the customers we've got at higher levels, which are available to us. And also a significant amount of cost reduction, because as you might know we bought that system from Air Liquide and the operating efficiency of the plants that we've got there are very low and we're replacing it with a very highly efficient compression system.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  Just want to go to North America and get a little more granularity on price volume, specifically in merchant. You talked about sales up 13%.  Just wondering what the split is on price volume there and also on your -- refinery hydrogen was up 28%, what was that -- how much of that was organic, how much of that was new projects year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Let me talk about the refinery hydrogen first and some people have commented that the hydrogen volume should have a one-to-one correlation with gasoline volume. It's really not true.  The hydrogen volume is really a function of site-specific to specific customers, what equipment those customers are running and what slate of input they're taking.  If they're taking more heavy sour crude coming in, they need more hydrogen, and they're producing more clean diesel and that requires more hydrogen.  And then lastly, our cavern system is significantly helping us because as we have customers who take outages for maintenance and so forth, we just supply them right out of the cavern and that's turned out to be a good business for us.  Otherwise, on the on-site atmospheric gases, that volume is up strongly to chemicals, steel and pretty much across the board.  And then in merchant business, pretty much across the board, growth in merchant sales as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But Jim, can you be more specific on volume, for example on your 28% refinery hydrogen.  I assume that's not all organic, you've got some new plants up versus last year. Just wondering what you see as organic growth in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I really can't say. The organic growth is starting up new plants and serving new customers and new contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So -- and the volumes fluctuate from month to month and day to day.  So, if you tried to draw a chart and draw a trend line through it I wouldn't know what the slope of that trend line should be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then again on merchant, of that 13%, what was the sort of the price-volume split?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a little bit more price than volume, but pretty evenly split.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then what is going up faster? I know diesel fuel costs are up significantly, but what's been the general inflation on the power side and how much of a lag if any do you have in your surcharges on recovering those higher diesel and power costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's divide it up first.  Power costs globally are up about 20% year-over-year and they will be up even more in the third quarter year-over-year.  US is about at the same number in terms of the mill rate.  And, but we capture that through the normal contract language, in the on-site contracts and then transportation costs, our own diesel fuel is up, but it's not a hugely significant part of our cost structure.  And, we have been along the terms of contracts doing surcharges, which are specifically based on the cost of diesel fuel.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jim I guess first of all on pricing what's your confidence that you can sustain sort of the 3% real pricing -- sort of in a slowing environment?  I mean how far do you think you can push that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I guess that &#x2013; what I would just say right now is we are pretty much sold-out all over the world.  And that applies in North America, it applies in Europe, it applies in South America.  Our main constraint to volume growth right now is the capacity -- molecule capacity and we're actually operating above what you might call the optimal operating rate because we are having to ship product longer distances from the plants that do have capacity to the customers that do need product.  So with that environment, I think it's still a very positive pricing environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you look at the backlogs in the industry, I mean there is more capacity coming on stream for nitrogen and oxygen.  But do you see sort of the supply/demand balance easing for the rare gases or helium or is that a structural shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Laurence your question is, do we see any significant change in the supply/demand equation for some of the rare gases with new capacity coming on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or is this a structural shift in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well helium is different.  Helium is not taken out of the air, helium is a depleting natural resource and there is just only so much helium in the ground and most of it's controlled in three locations around the world.  And the demand for helium is just going up for scientific applications, for MRI machines, and a lot of industrial applications to the point where the price is up, and there will be fewer helium balloons around.  The rare gases we have to take out of the very large oxygen plants and we are actually in the moment doubling our capacity for rare gases right now.  And the demand for those gases is really growing fast, they are used in lasers, they're used in, a lot more in semiconductors and so forth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do these projects on a discounted cash flow over 15 years with no residual value and that's the way we talk about internal rates of return on projects.  And first of all the smallest projects, which would be projects where we've got a new customer on an adjacent pipeline or something like that, the smallest projects can have very, very high returns, sometimes 30%, 40%, maybe a one year payback that type of thing.  The very largest projects on the other hand and particularly the hydrogen projects, which are heavily competed for, you would be looking at a 12 to 14% IRR on them but, when you take the average together it's about 18%.</p>

          <p>Okay.  And then shifting gears to PDI, you referred anecdotally that while the small business owners are cognizant of the risk that the capital gains tax regime could change with the new political administration, I see you've made some small bolt-ons there. What should we look for in terms of future bolt-on activity?  Do you see sellers of small regional businesses as more receptive to acquisitions today?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet.  I understand the theory and maybe it will happen in the second half of the year.  If people expect the capital gains tax rate to go up next year they may want to sell earlier.  But we haven't seen any change in the attitude of business owners from that perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I am just curious -- on the pricing data you gave for say South America and China does that include natural gas pass throughs or not? There's 8% for South America, 12% for Asia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is not -- we don't sell &#x2013; we're not selling that much hydrogen outside of North America.  So, it's not a relevant number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, do you think that pricing gains at those levels are sustainable then?  Can you continue to get those like for next year or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so, I mean it remains to be seen, but our supply system is tight around the world and we are going to keep working to recover costs and we've kind of moved to a model, which people would say obviously you should do that.  But it's not always as easy in practice, but we moved to a model of really trying to price to the customers' next best alternative, which we call competitive pricing and away from a model of what you'd call cost plus pricing.  And I think that's part of where we are getting a lot more success in the pricing environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, I am sure you have talked about it before but on the -- when you sign new contracts for on-site projects, what do the &#x2013; the customers have any outs, once &#x2013; if they decide for some reason, business conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends, but there are often clauses in the contracts, where they have before the startup of a plant, they have an out, but they have to pay us back for the plant.  They have to reimburse us for what we've spent.  And then, after the start up of the plant, they would usually have to reimburse us for the remaining net present value of the contract.  So they can get out, but it's fairly painful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Sounds good for you, thanks.</p>

          <p>And, your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  Normally, your operating cash flow grows at a value...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I knew you were going to throw an accounting test in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Naturally your operating cash flow grows about as fast as your earnings, but your operating cash flow is down for the quarter and it was flat from the first half, sort of why is that and what do you expect the operating cash flow change to be by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  If you look at the cash flow statement the big difference is in the line called Other, which has consumed about 100 million of cash flow.  That is timing of tax payments and we've made a number of tax payments in the second quarter, particularly because our borrowing cost is only about 2.5% right now.  And so, when you pay taxes earlier you don't have to pay late payment penalties and so forth.  But, that's a one-time thing in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but that's still only 100 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me also explain it to you this way, you normally would not have cash flow growth faster than net income growth, because you have net income growth and then you have CapEx, you have depreciation growth.  Depreciation is growing at about half the rate of net income, okay.  And then, because you are growing you're consuming some working capital along the way.  So, normally you are not going to have cash flow growth as strong as net income growth.  And then, but we have done an excellent job on managing working capital.  Our working capital percent of sales is down, our DSOs is down and so forth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I mean your deprecation's in fact up 15% year-over-year, but what I can do is I can follow up.  Just lastly Jim, so you bought back 32 million in stock in the quarter which was the smallest amount that you've bought for the last couple of years.  Why is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's because we pretty much consumed our -- we had a $1 billion authorized in a year ago and then August, September of 2007 was a rocky time for the stock market.  Our stock price was low.  So we bought back a lot of stock then. Same thing happened in first quarter.  So, that by the end of the first quarter we had actually spent most of what was authorized and therefore didn't spend as much in the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's remaining on the old authorization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 60 million.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I wanted to ask a question regarding the technology business. Same kind of products were used in both silicon, flat panel displays, and now photovoltaics.  Can you kind of generally size those markets for us Jim and could photovoltaics be as big as flat panel displays is now, when are you talking about 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about solar?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, solar, I guess it's synonymous with photovoltaics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Solar, I think could be a great business for us.  We've already got about 50 customers under contract who make solar panels, and that is growing very rapidly.  Those are for the most part merchant and specialty gas contracts. They're not large on-site contracts, but we are --- we do have a technology for physical vapor deposition and what's required is to make targets big enough to be -- to coat a large solar panel and that's what we are working on right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for your help.</p>

          <p>There are no further questions.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Sawyer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd just like to thank you all for being on the call.  We are still very positive in our outlook in spite of the negative macroeconomic scenario.  And, I think our authorization of another billion dollar stock purchase program is evidence that we have confidence going forward in both earnings growth and cash flow.  So, thanks very much for attending the call.</p>
