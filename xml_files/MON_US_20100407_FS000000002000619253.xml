          <p>Greetings, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2010 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, [Rob] . Good morning to everyone on the line. Welcome to Monsanto's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; and by Carl Casale, our CFO. Also joining me today are Will McAndrew, Manny Cruz, and Ruben Mella, my colleagues in Investor Relations. I'd like to remind you this call is being webcast and can be accessed at Monsanto.com. The replay is also available at that address.</p>
          <p>We're providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures in the slides and in the earnings press release, which are both posted on our website.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-K and today's press release.</p>
          <p>So that we can save the bulk of the time for Carl and Hugh's comments on today's news about our 2010 guidance and our long-term growth plan, I will give an abbreviated summary of our quarterly and first-half results. Our financial results for the quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year are summarized on slide 4. As will be the case throughout the year, the reset of the Roundup business from 2009 to this fiscal year colors all of the comparisons to the prior year.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, ongoing EPS was $1.70. Gross profit declined 17% to 2.1 billion while overall gross margins declined 8 percentage points to 54%. The largest driver for the year-over-year change was Roundup, which also shows up particularly starkly on the gross profit line in the quarter. Practically, Roundup gross profit in the quarter was breakeven. That is primarily because of the price reductions to re-establish and maintain historical price premiums as well as the fact that the inventory that was first into the market has a pronounced COGS effect reflecting the higher production costs of last year. Additionally, our mix in the first half of the year is weighted to our lower margin supply volume so that higher cost effect is magnified.</p>
          <p>Globally, branded prices were in the 10 to $12 per gallon range except for the U.S. where pricing fell slightly below that band. Within Seeds and Traits there was an increase in gross profit of 2% over last year. Corn gross profit grew slightly in the quarter, but margins continue to be down relative to fiscal year 2009. On the positive side, results in Latin America were better than our expectation as favorable weather in Argentina and a slightly better start to the second season in Brazil resulted in fewer corn acres lost than previously thought.</p>
          <p>U.S. corn gross profit was essentially flat relative to last year. Part of that reflects a timing shift as we expect to recognize a higher percent of trait royalties from licensees in the second half of the fiscal year compared with last year. More pronounced is the fact that cost of goods dampened gross profit contribution within the corn portfolio. This reflects higher year-over-year COGS associated with our U.S. corn hedged position as well as the incremental launch year production costs for SmartStax.</p>
          <p>Soybean gross profit was slightly ahead of last year and margins were 61%, which is in line with last year. As previously discussed, the U.S. late harvest means a larger percentage of our total soybean volume will occur in the second half of the year. That was partially offset by stronger results in Brazil because of a larger soybean crop and a significant increase in the penetration of our first generation Roundup Ready trait. Additionally in the quarter, our pre-tax restructuring expense was 84 million. This included 54 million charged to our U.S. corn cost of goods as we've made the decision to exit some product lines in our U.S. branded corn business and to streamline our product SKUs across multiple brands, and to enable the strategy for new hybrids for the 2011 season.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, the Roundup reset likewise dominates the comparisons with our prior year performance. For these first six months, gross profit for the company is down 30% or $1.2 billion. The majority of that decrease came are from the Ag Productivity segment, while overall Seeds and Traits gross profit was down slightly versus last year as the second quarter effects influenced the year-to-date results. Our ongoing EPS for the first half of the year was $1.68, putting us more than half way to the lower end of our 3.10 to 3.30 target for the year.</p>
          <p>The effective tax rate for the first half of the year was 28%. As was the case in the first quarter, benefits from several tax items were recognized in the second quarter, which puts us in line with our projected tax rate of 29 to 30% for the full year.</p>
          <p>As we expected, the second quarter was a significant source of cash generation which begins to offset the use of cash we saw in the first quarter. Cumulatively, free cash flow was a use of 89 million for the first half of fiscal year 2010, compared with a source of 1.1 billion for the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn the call over to Carl so he can expand on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2010.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everyone. As we cross the midpoint of the year, we have a good view of our performance and how that instructs the remainder of the year. As many of you know, my background is in operations, so as CFO, my assessment isn't just on the financials, but how the business generates the financials. This clear linkage allows us to talk frankly about where we see the business at the midpoint of the year.</p>
          <p>Looking at both financials and the operations, the $1.70 we delivered in ongoing EPS in the second quarter is a solid quarter. However, projecting from there, it tells me that fiscal year 2010 will be more challenging throughout. That's important because how we adjust from 2010 will set us up for the longer term growth that Hugh will discuss shortly. So before we get into the detail, let me give you my view where we stand and where we're going for the remainder of 2010.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, if you go to slide 5, we remain committed to delivering ongoing EPS in the 3.10 to 3.30 range that we laid out at the beginning of the year. But at this point I expect that ongoing EPS will be at the lower end of that range. The $1.68 ongoing EPS we delivered through the first half is a solid data point to this end, reflecting a little less than 55% of the low end of our full year range.</p>
          <p>There are 3 drivers for this refinement in guidance. First, as relates to Seeds and Traits, this was a year we knew was a leg work year, and I think about progress pragmatically. In areas where we needed to cross thresholds to create the runway for growth, we're doing so. 2010 will give us the foundation we need, whether that's Latin American Traits, SmartStax or Roundup Ready 2 Yield. However while our broad portfolio in Seeds and Traits gives us flexibility to maximize gross profit, there are not enough upsides this year to reach the higher end of our guidance. Given the reduced corn acres in Latin America and the challenges to our U.S. growth that I'll speak about more, our Seeds and Traits gross profit will be more limited than we originally projected.</p>
          <p>Second, in the Roundup business the competitive dynamics within generic glyphosate remain acute resulting in systemic price competition. This has the potential to strain our full year Roundup performance and put pressure on our ability to meet our projected gross profit expectations. We now see Roundup gross profit of plus or minus $600 million for the year.</p>
          <p>Third, offsetting the two impacts I just mentioned is greater operating leverage as a result of our restructuring efforts. We have uncovered some additional operational flexibility as a result of our lower SG&amp;A run rate and that creates benefits in both 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Those are real challenges reflecting what's proven to be a transition year. But against that backdrop we are comfortable in the operational path of our 2010 guidance. It means we have a little more than 45% of our earnings to come in the second half of the fiscal year to get to the low end of our EPS range. Practically I would anticipate that third quarter EPS will be somewhat below last year. The balance of the second half growth will come in the fourth quarter as the fourth quarter transitions from a seasonal loss to a positive contributor to EPS, reflecting the full effect of our SG&amp;A leverage and supplemented by contributions from our Latin American corn and Roundup business.</p>
          <p>Let me walk you through the details of how these factors come together in our outlook for the business. I want to begin with Roundup on slide 6. As you recall, our Roundup priorities revolved around reducing branded prices to reset premiums, increasing our overall volumes and optimizing our low cost advantage.</p>
          <p>Through the first half of the year, here's the trends we see. Volume is actually trending ahead of our plan as our full year volume projection is slightly better than our 250 million-gallon target. Today world wide net selling prices are within the 10 to $12 a gallon range for branded Roundup, however in the U.S., pricing remains slightly below that range as competitive generic inventory has moved out of the system slower than we would have anticipated, depressing farm-gate prices below what we'd expect with the current Chinese acid price in the range of $3 a kilogram or higher.</p>
          <p>Just last week the other U.S. manufacturer of glyphosate filed an anti-dumping claim with the U.S. government over Chinese imports which speaks to the overall generic pressure we've observed. Further, we're starting to see early evidence of competitors using generic glyphosate as a loss leader to sell other chemical products in their portfolios, creating some margin compression in the channel that threatens to keep farm-gate prices from fully rebounding with seasonal refills. In some cases we've used further incremental volume incentives to the channel to keep our premiums in line with these lower prices.</p>
          <p>Through the first half of the year, our gross profit has been limited. In the second half of the year, we expect to sell a higher mix of branded volume at a lower realized cost per gallon which bridges our full year expectation. Throughout the year we expect to fully utilize the 100 to $150 million in planned sales incentives as well. The primary application season in our biggest market still lies ahead and by the third quarter we'll have stronger indicators whether we'll see price improvement in the U.S. Absent stronger prices for the seasonal fill, I would expect branded pricing for the year to come in below our 10 to $12 price band. If that occurs I believe we may fall shy of our original 650 to $750 million gross profit range for the year, putting us in a more probable range of plus or minus 600 million in gross profit in this transition year.</p>
          <p>As I shift to Seeds and Traits, I want to tackle both the strategic and operational factors for the year. Strategically there were 3 things that mattered for Seeds and Traits in 2010: expanding trait penetration in Latin America and establishing SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield in their launch years. Given the trait expansion in Brazil and Argentina we discussed in the first quarter, I feel good about that objective. Now that we have the bulk of the U.S. sales in hand, I feel good about where we've landed with SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide 7, here's where we stand. First, while we don't have final totals since there are a small number of acres outstanding and seed returns are yet to be determined, the acreage for SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield are in the adjusted ranges we shared with you in the last month. We expect all in acres for SmartStax to be right around 3 million acres, and Roundup Ready 2 Yield right around 6 million acres. In context, that's 3 times our historical average launch for a corn trait and the largest commercial-scale launch in soybeans.</p>
          <p>Second, and perhaps more importantly, what mattered was getting exposure on farm to facilitate adoption going forward. To that end, we have broad trial. In Roundup Ready 2 Yield we have more than 40% of our branded customers trying Roundup Ready 2 Yield this year. Likewise more than 20% of our branded customers are trying SmartStax in year one. So we're very comfortable that we have trial quantities with the right hybrids and varieties across a broad base of farmers to create the platform for adoption in 2011 and forward.</p>
          <p>If I shift to the operational look, our projected U.S. growth for the year doesn't offset the first quarter downside in Latin America. There are a couple of key reasons. Number 1, in corn, while we saw both higher volumes and pricing reflecting a mix improvement in our trade offerings, that benefit was offset by higher levels of cost of goods in the corn portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 8, you'll see that practically is we expect more than 75% of our branded U.S. corn portfolio will either be SmartStax or Triple-Stack, a positive step change from the 70% penetration in 2009. With combined SmartStax and Monsanto Triple-Stack acreage projected at 33 million acres, we are seeing a mix upgrade realized through trait penetration.</p>
          <p>The offset to this was largely driven through the cost of goods line, where increased cost of goods related to our U.S. hedged corn position and the SmartStax launch costs limited the gross profit lift in the corn portfolio. Additionally we booked a restructuring charge that hits the gross profit line. Fundamentally we're accelerating the movement from existing hybrids into new trait packages to help enable the new product strategy that Hugh will describe.</p>
          <p>Number two, in soybeans, we've previously discussed the timing shift as the late harvest in the U.S. shifted a greater percent of our full year sales into the second half of the season.</p>
          <p>Finally, that limited U.S. growth also influences our share. Given the increase in corn and soybean acreage projected last week from the USDA, our current sales volume, which indicates our DeKalb corn share will likely be flat in this highly competitive year. Our branded soybean share is likely to be down, pending a true up of acres and returns.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the year we don't expect the trajectory on the U.S. Corn and Soybean business to change significantly. So it's unlikely there's additional upside to be reflected in the second half of the season.</p>
          <p>From a practical standpoint, there are two areas to highlight related to earnings generation for the rest of the year. First, cotton and vegetables deliver a significant level of our remaining fiscal year gross profit, and both are tracking well with our expectations and may potentially present some marginal upsides.</p>
          <p>Second, we expect the positive fourth quarter this year will be driven by our SG&amp;A leverage but will also include contributions from the corn business and Roundup in Latin America. Practically we expect a repeat of approximately $40 million of gross profit related to the Mexican distribution system we highlighted in the first quarter. Additionally, we anticipate an improvement over last year's early Latin American season. That reflects the positive momentum from trait penetration as well as a better outlook for corn acres compared with the drought conditions last year, which also impact Roundup sales across corn and soybean acres.</p>
          <p>The last of the large drivers for the fiscal year performance is our operational leverage shown on slide 9. As we run the business I focus on two things. The operating margin, which yields gross profit and operating leverage, which includes SG&amp;A but not R&amp;D. Tracking that operating leverage allows us to run our business more efficiently.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we noted that SG&amp;A was running below our budget plans, and now that we've seen SG&amp;A come in below for the second straight quarter, I feel comfortable that we have a repeatable structural benefit. I expect that will continue for the rest of the year, resulting in a full year SG&amp;A in the 2.0 to $2.1 billion range, largely in line with 2009. This will result in an SG&amp;A as a percent of sales that is closer to 17.5 to 18.5% in fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Likewise we remain on track to deliver one-third of the 220 to $250 million in annual cost savings in fiscal 2010 and the full savings in 2011 at a cumulative cost of 550 to $600 million in restructuring costs Taken in combination, our SG&amp;A reduction and realized SG&amp;A savings create operational leverage that complements our operating plans in delivering on our earnings growth guidance.</p>
          <p>Finally, from an operations view our commitment to deliver on our promise for earnings per share extends to cash generation as well. If you move to slide 10, guidance for free cash flow remains in the 900 million to $1 billion range. Reflecting the fact that we expect to be at the low end of our EPS guidance, we now expect operating cash to be in the 1.9 to $2.1 billion range. Capital expenditures were $119 million below expenditures last year, and given that I expect the full year to be at the low end of our 750 to $850 million range. So even in a more challenging earnings environment, we're converting earnings to cash. That speaks to part of our ongoing opportunity as we continue to see disciplined balance sheet management supporting our growth opportunity.</p>
          <p>Likewise, cash generation paired with a strong balance sheet highlights our opportunity to repatriate cash for our owners. We continue to view that as a priority and are focused on our current $800 million share repurchase authorization. We repurchased $124 million of stock in February bringing us to the halfway point of the current authorization. Likewise we've maintained our dividend reflecting our focus on returning cash directly to our owners.</p>
          <p>When I take a step back as CFO, I've told you I focus on both the financials and the operations. That look leads me to a couple of conclusions for 2010. On the minus side, while we can get to our cash flow goal and at the lower end of our ongoing EPS range, it's been tougher than we planned even in a legwork year. On the plus side, those execution issues are largely within our control. So we are applying the lessons to make the necessary adjustments.</p>
          <p>But none of this changes the fundamentals of our business, and that's true whether we're looking at it financially or strategically. We have a strong balance sheet and the discipline to turn earnings into cash, underscoring the strength of our growth opportunity and strategically, no one is better positioned to realize the growth in agriculture than we are. We clearly have the best products today, and our unrivaled technology pipeline creates greater opportunity as we bring even greater innovation to farmers. We're clear on where we stand. We've already begun to apply the lessons learned from this year to inform our operational approach going forward.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Carl, and good morning to everybody on the line. Carl just gave you our frank assessment about what the data points this year tell us about our 2010 outlook. We expect to get to the lower end of our 3.10 to 3.30 ongoing EPS range. It will be tougher than we would have liked but there is a path. A higher priority for me is to ensure that we clear the path for more predictable and sustainable earnings in the future and that begs the question, what do these data points tell us about where we stand, what we've learned and what that means for the operational path now through 2012?</p>
          <p>Given the troubling economic climate that we've all endured for the better part of the last two years, the temptation for most companies would be to pin difficult times on that macro upheaval. We are not doing that. Rather, my focus is on the feedback and the lessons that we can apply directly to how we do business. To that end, the first half of 2010 has suffered some new market realities and has crystallized some lessons that shape our thinking, which we show in slide 11. There are three of these in particular.</p>
          <p>Number 1, we refuse to achieve our growth objectives to the detriment of our customers. In the course of the last two months my team and I have gone out to the field and personally met with more than 1,200 farmers, ranging from large to small, from some of our best customers, to some of our most critical.</p>
          <p>We heard consistently in these visits that we have the best products, and we heard consistently that the value that we create with our technology innovation is real. But we also heard that how we share that value with our customers can either be an enabler of growth or an impediment. That tells me we can either make a stubborn push for the targets that we've set for ourselves and strain those valuable customer relationships, or we can do more work with our customers and let the growth come more naturally. That's going to change some things. I'd like to say that it's pure altruism, but the reality is it's the right thing to do for the business today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>That leads me to my second point. We're operating in a very dynamic competitive environment right now. Our focus has been in bringing out new products. Some of our competitors have been less successful matching our new product innovation and have been more focused on creating bigger price gaps against us. That competitive price focus is a near term factor so we have to be as flexible and as innovative in our pricing as we already are in our product development.</p>
          <p>That's especially true now that we've entered the era of selling yield traits rather than insect and weed control ones. As the value proposition of our new products demonstrate themselves over our own first generation traits, I'm confident that we'll earn a premium price position. Likewise we believe firmly that the long-term adoption of advanced technology is economically inevitable. We just have to be more conscious of how we're getting that value to our farmer customers.</p>
          <p>My third point shifts to Roundup. As Carl described we're seeing early evidence of margin compression at multiple points leading to lower farm gate pricing. If that becomes more than an observation and it gives way to new structural norms, I believe there will be a new ceiling in the long-term pricing environment in the glyphosate industry. Given what we know right now with Roundup and with the different approach that we'll take with our seed customers, I have to be pragmatic in my outlook and state up front that we recognize it's unlikely that we will reach our goal of doubling our 2007 gross profit by 2012.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, we didn't reach this conclusion lightly. We recently confirmed the feedback that we got from farmers with a very rigorous internal evaluation. As an aggressive, competitive organization, moving away from our original set of goals is difficult for us to accept, but it's the right thing to acknowledge now. While there may be options to make an accelerated push for 2012, it's clear that achieving that objective could involve making short term choices that, to me, are not in the long range interest of this business.</p>
          <p>So our operational plan going forward is focused on two keys: greater flexibility in implementation and greater certainty in our performance. As I mentioned, we've just completed the first pass review of this plan applying the lessons that I've just described. The upshot of that analysis is very clear. We expect to deliver mid-teens annual earnings growth going forward. We'll couple that growth with the cost discipline to ensure that cash follows earnings. So we expect to deliver strong annual cash and return on capital levels. But make no mistake, as our business evolves, we expect to deliver double-digit earnings growth because of the opportunity that our technology and innovation continues to create.</p>
          <p>As always, we'll earn this right one selling season, one quarter and one year at a time. Our upcoming third quarter earnings report will be our first chance to back this with truth points. So I'll commit that by then we'll present to you the critical milestones that turn this plan into reality for 2011 and the milestones that we'll measure our progress by. There are still some critical operational elements that we'll finalize between now and then, but I do want to walk you through our planning assumptions and the core building blocks that demonstrate that we don't take these commitments lightly and that we're coming out of the gate renewed, reenergized and ready for this future growth.</p>
          <p>So here's how I see this plan set up. Firstly, we're committed to Roundup. We've already done the massive re-engineering that scaled the business for more than $1 billion that came off the gross profit peak, and even with the potential for structural changes in the industry, we still believe that this can be a sustainable, cash generating business. But perhaps more importantly, Roundup's more than just a casual complement to our seed business. It's a fundamental pillar that supports our expanding Roundup Ready trait franchise. So whatever we do, having a secure supply of Roundup is key to our future trait opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our teams are working in ways that Roundup can be deployed more directly as part of a comprehensive weed control system that helps sell the value of our Roundup Ready trait products. If you take a step back and you consider our Acceleron seed treatment platform as an example, it's fundamentally a package of commodity ingredients, but it's delivered in a way that enhances the value of the seeds that we sell. And this, I think, is a model for Roundup in the future. In an era where weed control systems and resistance management strategies are relevant to the seed purchase decision of farmers, we see a real opportunity for Roundup taking a more prominent role in helping create a total quality package of value for our customers. And as we begin to expand this total system with the inclusion of new trait platforms like dicamba-tolerance, the ability to offer a complete weed control system can be a true differentiator. So we'll be looking at the options on how to do that.</p>
          <p>Second, this is a plan built on a revitalized product strategy as shown on slide 12. I said that farmers told us that we have the best products. I am convinced that we have an unmatched tool kit. Simply put, we have more tools at our disposal than we've had at any other point in our history. And that's in stark contrast to the situation that many of our competitors now find themselves in. And frankly it should be a bigger advantage than it's been. To be clear, our confidence in our products is unwavering. I've seen the data and in particular, I believe that when farmers take stock of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax this fall, they'll see what we know; that these products work.</p>
          <p>We've an expanding yield advantage over our competitors so this platform advantage will allow us to grow our share and expand trait penetration. So over the next two seasons, we'll be more aggressive in deploying a full range of products, particularly in corn.</p>
          <p>As I'm sure you'd expect, this plan continues to revolve around SmartStax, which is the cornerstone product with an immediate fit for the core, high value, central Corn Belt area. In the future that will be complemented by our VT Double PRO and Triple PRO and we now see those three products coming together in a compelling value ladder as SmartStax and a family of refuge reduction products. If you pair that with the potential for our first refuge-in-a-bag product from 2012, there's a unique value that this family can offer to our farmer customers. When it's deployed as a family, there's a dual benefit. For us, it'll create more flexibility to promote adoption, and create the margin upgrade opportunity in new acres and more importantly for our customers, we'll be providing more options as they evaluate the right technology progression for their farm.</p>
          <p>That leads me to a third point on slide 13. Our revitalized product strategy enables us to evolve a more dynamic pricing model. As part of our listening session with those 1,200 growers we heard the feedback this year that for SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield adoption, our all-in upfront pricing made adoption decisions much tougher for the grower. We have experience with both pricing for penetration and now upfront all-in pricing that we employed with SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield and with that full data set it tells me that penetration pricing is probably the better option, both for us and for our customers.</p>
          <p>We've always focused on maximizing trait penetration and creating the upgrade opportunity for our farmer customers. So our number 1 pricing priority is to embed our product planning with an approach that brings us back to the fundamentals of penetration pricing.</p>
          <p>If you apply this thinking to corn, we can use our product portfolio in combination with our established zone-based pricing and will create more products at more price points. So in some cases, we may adjust our value spread relative to competitors. In others, we'll bring in new products at brand new price points, and in even more we'll be looking to enhance our value proposition with the inclusion of additional meaningful benefits.</p>
          <p>This pricing strategy isn't finalized today, but broadly, I see this as our tool to improve our value proposition for each farmer, invigorate adoption and grow into sustainable pricing, and with more products at more price points, we're better positioned to meet the competition in the marketplace based on mix and not pure price.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, our opportunity revolves around the incremental margin upgrade that we earn when a farmer sees the value and puts a new trait on a new acre on his farm. Make no mistake in this, we still have the premium price products, but we recognize that the art is in how we share that value that we create with the grower.</p>
          <p>Finally, and Carl mentioned this in his remarks, this is a plan that will have greater operational leverage than we've had over the past decade. Today we're a different business than we were just 3 short years ago. This is one of the areas where that's most clear. As we've grown, the SG&amp;A that we've employed has grown proportionately but if our core premise is that our opportunity is increasing the trait intensity and realized margin per acre, there's a structural efficiency that we realize, because it shouldn't take more resources to simply add another trait to a bag that's already headed to a farmer's field. That creates a structural benefit that carries forward and indicates to me that we can turn a greater percentage of our generated gross profit into earnings and hence cash.</p>
          <p>Not to be lost in that is the opportunity to use that cash more aggressively and repatriate it in ways that directly benefit our owners. Likewise, we're looking at that, and we'll be able to tell you more about our cash strategy as we lay out the stages of this plan going forward.</p>
          <p>So as I step back and look at where we are and more importantly where we're going, I can tell you two things in closing: number 1, this operational plan is something that my executive team runs, but perhaps more importantly it's a plan that ultimately I own. My top priority is doing what's right for the long-term health of this business while doing what's right for our customers.</p>
          <p>Number 2, as I think about the outcome of our planning process, the path may be somewhat varied from the prototype that we envisioned way back in 2007, but the destination is the same. This is a path that will allow us to deliver strong earnings growth consistently in an ever-changing market environment. We recognize that gross profit is a major enabler to creating growth and delivering earnings, so strong Seeds and Traits gross profit contribution is important. With gross profit as the basis, complemented by increased discipline in SG&amp;A, we see significant growth in our operating margins without compromising our critical R&amp;D investments. Quite simply that allows us to generate annual earnings growth in the mid teens, turn earnings into cash, and reach strong return on capital levels.</p>
          <p>As I conclude, there's no doubt that in the last 6 months, some things have changed, and that causes us to do some things differently going forward, but just as importantly, some things haven't changed. We're the leader in this industry with the best products, and we have the best pipeline, and those same fundamentals continue to speak to the opportunity that we believe in, in the future.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call back to Bryan and open up the lines for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my one question will be, can you help us understand what the base is for this mid-teens EPS growth? And I think in particular what I'm talking about is that &#x2013; let's just assume the number for 2010 is $3.10. You've got 150 million bucks at least of Roundup make-goods in the channel that, if I'm correct, don't reoccur next year. You've got this charge now for this SKU rationalization in corn. You've got some SG&amp;A savings coming in. And then you've got some winter production costs that it's unclear whether they're going to &#x2013; how much if any of them are going to recur next year given the So can you help us understand -- and you also have a corn hedge -- can you help us understand what the actual base is for this mid-teens growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent, good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me try and frame how we think about mid-teens at this part in our planning process, and then I'll maybe ask Carl just to talk about some of the chapters in the book that you describe.</p>
          <p>As we think about mid-teens, we're thinking about 13 to 17% as our band for growth. Some years'll be stronger, some years will be weaker, but that's the kind of spreads that we're looking at going forward. And I think it's important to call that out, so that you're not guessing what we're thinking about here. So that's the kind of spread. You're right that there's a number of moving parts in this year, some of which don't reoccur next year. I'll maybe ask Carl just to do a kind of broad dissection of some of the areas that you described.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Vincent. We're still pretty early in our planning process. Hugh mentioned the product strategy that's going be deployed, and what the ultimate mix of those products is, Vincent, and to your point, how much winter nursery we choose to do is ultimately going to impact what COGS are and obviously margins as well. We're still working our way through that. We're not in a position today to say what that's going be.</p>
          <p>On the Roundup side, one of the things that we definitely believe that we're seeing right now and we're waiting to see whether it's going to be -- persist through the course of the year is the margin compression that we're seeing in the channel as generic product is moving out slower. But also we are seeing evidence that competitors are using glyphosate as a loss leader to sell other products in their portfolio, and if that persists we might be looking at a lower level of GP target sustainably for the long term for the business. And so all of those things are going have an impact as well.</p>
          <p>The hedging impact -- that was a one-time effect that we took this year along with the cost of goods obsolescence that you mentioned from a restructuring standpoint. The obsolescence is clearly correlated to the change in product portfolio that we're affecting right now, largely driven by obsolescence predominantly of triple-stacks we're going to move out of the portfolio to make room for these new products that we're going to sell that we think bring more value.</p>
          <p>The hedging was basically a de-designation we did on some hedges. We basically hedge our corn position anywhere from 1 to 2 years in advance to basically lock in what our cost position's going be. Those hedges were basically placed against higher expectations for market share that hasn't occurred. And so basically that's the simple math on why we did that as well. But simply the 13 and 17% bandwidth that we're looking at right now where we sit is pegged off of the 3.10 that we're planning to achieve for 2010.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. With the seed selling season largely behind you now and the USDA perspective planning numbers out last week, I was wondering if you could comment on your market share expectations for U.S. corn and soybeans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the denominator continues to bounce around, Kevin, so the crop is not in the ground yet, but if we were calling it today, and I think Carl mentioned this in his call, we would think that our corn share would be around flat. And in beans we would anticipate that we have lost share this year. And that will be titrated based on the last minute shuffling on how big the crop is. But I think those would be fair calls. Not happy about it, but I would say that that would be our best estimate today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Our next question is from Don Carson with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, a question on pricing for penetration. Based on our calculations and, of course, lower corn and soy prices it seemed you're asking for about 50% of value created. Traditionally you've priced more to get a third of the value creation. Is that the kind of shift you're talking about? And what, if any, implications does this have for your previous volume targets in '11 and '12 for both SmartStax and RR 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Don, good morning. Thanks for the question. So let me try and frame this, because when you talk about penetration pricing, the immediate reaction is broad-based price cuts. So we &#x2013; and I sat through a number of these feedback sessions with growers and they're pretty clear on their feedback. Here's how we're thinking about it, and I'll maybe ask Carl to talk a little bit about volume.</p>
          <p>But in some areas geographically we'll move in price relative to our competition, and we're not going to declare that today, but directionally we'll narrow that gap. And in other areas we'll bring in a new suite of products, and that will be based in corn largely on our new Double PRO and our VT Triple PRO. And they'll work underneath the SmartStax umbrella and those will give us the opportunity to create pricing ladders and bring growers into the products at a different price point and a different experience point.</p>
          <p>And then in the last area that we've been working on in the last couple of months, we're taking a hard look at our value proposition where we can bolt on benefits and have the choice or the option of selling those at the same price. A great example of that is the migration from refuge reduction to RIB. And we had not priced RIB into our future value expectations. So that's a benefit for the grower that would not be seen as a price move but would add a great deal of incremental value to that bag.</p>
          <p>So we are looking for more products at more price points. Some of this will be straight price and some of it will be mix, and I anticipate over the next 2 seasons that we'll continue to command a premium, because we sell better performing material. It's how we present that. And I think the feedback that I heard personally from growers is if our price points were different, their adoption curves would be different. So driving that experimentation in the first 2 years is critically important off the base that was established in '10.</p>
          <p>And, Carl, maybe Don's last question on volume going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So maybe just focus on 2011. And originally we said for SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield, for both of them kind of that 16 to 18 million-acre range for 2011. As I think about those numbers, and think about demand, supply and scale, on the demand side, with the number of users that we have trying this year, Don, we have more than adequate demand to support 16 to 18 million acres in both crops.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, obviously we'll have adequate supply of very strong varieties to meet the Roundup Ready 2 Yield target. On the 16 to 18 on corn, if you think about SmartStax as a family of products, the original SmartStax concept, the VT Double PRO, for that really low pressure acre out West, and VT Triple PRO for the rotational corn rootworm acre, when you add all that together, we would still be in that same range, Don, of availability for next year.</p>
          <p>And then the last point -- we're still pretty early in planning, but from a scale standpoint, as we think about these 3 products, I would think about the core SmartStax market being that corn, on corn, high yielding environment, core Midwest and that's a 50-million acre market, Don, just to help kind of scale what our thinking is right now.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just 2 &#x2013; I guess a 2-part question of clarification. In the press release as I understand it, the gross profit target for the Ag Productivity segment as a whole is now around 600 million. And I guess what that means is that the Roundup number is somewhere in the high 2s, all things being equal. And previously you were at roughly 650. I want to know whether that's correct.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in changing your longer term target from a gross profit target to an EPS target, I guess when I try to translate it, it looks to me like you've cut your 2012 gross profit target by about 1.6 billion from maybe 8.7 to about 7.1 or &#x2013; so is that correct order of magnitude or is that not correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff. This is Carl. I'll start on the Ag Productivity piece and then turn it over to Hugh for the second part of your question. On the Ag Productivity GP, we're thinking about our Ag Roundup business being in that plus or minus $600 million of GP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other Ag Productivity of about 3.25 is additive to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not inclusive.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jeff, on the second piece, the 1.6 just in an order of magnitude approach seems high, seems very high. So we &#x2013; I think as we &#x2013; I think today's conversation is we're going to back off our commitment on doubling. We're going to have a completely different product strategy around our seed business, particularly in corn. We're going to revert to our tried and trusted approach on penetration pricing to drive earlier adoption. But your 1.6, if you take the 13 to 17 and layer it on top of 3.10, feels tough.</p>
          <p>I'll tell you from the school of hard knocks, I don't think you're going be seeing us laying out long time targets. And the wisdom of saying let me tell you where I'm going be in five years time, we're kind of re-trenching from that today. We'll give you some metrics, we'll give you some guide posts, we'll give you some of the key drivers. I think the cockpit's going to have a lot fewer dials on it going forward than what we've done in the last couple of years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, question on just guidance in general going forward. When you kind of look back at the history of guidance, how much of a competitive disadvantage do you think it's given you, kind of in certain instances, and the one that kind of comes to mind that I think about is, it might have been 3 or 4 years ago when you laid out this, we think that Roundup sustainably can be a $1.8 billion gross profit business. It's the future. And if I'm sitting in Western China I'm thinking, "Ni hao ma, let me go turn on the glyphosate plant right now."</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the "Ni hao ma," was absolutely right and it kind of ties with the previous question on how many dials do you need in the cockpit. So we've said this morning that we started our planning process a little bit more than two months early. As we are working through that, we are critically conscious of how much of our hand we have to play to give you an indication of how we're thinking about this revitalized approach. And on the flip side, how much our hand we have to show that is the playbook for our competition. And I think we're going to be much more conscious of that, Jason, going forward. Particularly as we pivot a new pricing approach and pivot a new product strategy. And I know that's going to frustrate members of your community but it's the right thing do for the long term health of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think from a long term shareholder perspective, probably I would agree that that's the right thing to do. And just on the &#x2013; you know when you spoke about institutionalizing a lower run rate for SG&amp;A. And you've also kind of cut investing activities cash flow a little bit. Can you just talk about other than the natural tailwind from kind of increased trait penetration and getting there and helping in terms of SG&amp;A, what kind of actively is being cut and what's sacrosanct for both of those buckets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jason. Hey, this is Carl. If you look at the structural benefit that we gained from restructuring a year ago, probably the most dramatic change that occurred from an SG&amp;A standpoint was the separation of our Chemical Sales organization from our Seed Sales organization and the resizing of the Chemical organization given the fact that we had a billion plus of GP come out of that business. In addition to that, the internal infrastructure from everything from Finance to Human Resources, there was some simplification and additional benefit there.</p>
          <p>Where we haven't gone, Jason, is basically looking at R&amp;D as a source of leverage. That's who we are as a company long term. So we want to maintain the discipline that we've got and the SG&amp;A run rates that we've got that we're seeing flow through on basically the Commercial side of the organization as well as what I would call the supporting infrastructure for the business and preserve the R&amp;D capability because that is our life blood and our future.</p>

          <p>So, David, I think that's one that we would reserve judgment on and we'll give you some indicative pricing on it but it kind of ties in with 2 or 3 of the previous questions. We'll get this year's &#x2013; we sold SmartStax, we saw some of the natural discount at year end through the trade as the last of that was sold out. But the focus now is getting it planted and seeing what the yield benefits are. And I think rather than me giving you an absolute price &#x2013; we've done a ton of research on this, but I'd rather lay out what our product strategy is and start coloring in the map on those value ladders than be leading with my chin in this relative to my competition right now.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Referencing your market share loss in soybeans, can you just elaborate a bit on what is really driving that share loss? I mean is it purely farmer push back on price and you holding price under the previous strategy? Or is it stronger competitive offerings? Can you just provide a little color and maybe what the lessons learned are for soy in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. This is Carl. On the soy side, I mean it's just like corn, it's a very, very competitive marketplace. And basically what happened with, when our Roundup Ready 2 Yield came in at the lower end of the range, 100% of that offset wasn't picked up by our Roundup Ready 1 and there was some competitive product that moved into that space and picked up some market share there as well.</p>
          <p>The lesson learned is it's a very, very competitive market. And as Hugh said, we're rethinking right now what our pricing strategy is in corn and soy so that we can re-invigorate the growth of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So with the new strategy, you expect to regain share next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we're still pretty early in our planning process and we're not calling market share gains right now. But strong unit volume growth, across the business, is an important metric of health just as we think about operating this business for the long term. But we're not in a position to start talking about market share targets for next year yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here's how I kind of look at it. We talked about this through the back end of the year. In the spring of 2015, Roundup Ready 1's patents will expire and the technology will be free in the market. And the competitive dynamic, if you think '11, '12, '13, '14, the competitive dynamic is proving the performance of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And it will be the performance of that versus a free technology. So as we think about '11, and we think of the gap that was created this year, we need to make sure that farmers get that choice and see the value of this technology in a meaningful way in 2011. It's as simple as that.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is David Howard sitting in for Bob. Just one question for you guys. In the new information that you gave us surrounding the 2012 time period, how much of this in seeds is derived from volume versus pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Carl. I'll take a bit of a stab at it and maybe have Hugh add. We're talking about &#x2013; where we're at right now and what do we know? We know we're resetting our product strategy going forward. We'll have 3 unique and discrete products that we'll be bringing to the marketplace. And since those products bring different value, they'll be at different price points in the marketplace. And so really as we think about 2011, the two things that are really going to drive that, and it relates to an earlier question as well, is ultimately what's our mix of those products. And we'll calculate that as we move the plan forward. And then also, what's the cost of goods impact or implications of that mix.</p>
          <p>Some of those products don't carry third-party royalty obligations. Some of those products may not have to take to winter nursery. And so that will bundle what the margin opportunity for those projects &#x2013; for our products are for 2011. But as Hugh said, we're not making any calls to 2012 at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just &#x2013; I'd only add one thing. It kind of ties back to Don's question a lot earlier, and that is, we will be driving a product strategy that's kind of back to the future. So it will tie back to our early experience on penetration pricing. And when you take a penetration pricing approach, which is more focused on rapid adoption, then I think it's fair to assume that there will be a volume driver within that. So rather than the analytics on how big is the gap between price and volume, I think as we look at this new strategy, we'll be focusing more on that volume driver effect, and we'll populate that through a broader range of product offerings, but also trying to get faster, earlier trial by growers. And that was the feedback from 1,200 growers this year. And when you get told the same thing often enough, it becomes pretty compelling.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, thanks for the additional clarity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we probably have time for one or two more questions, [Rob], if that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two quick clarifications. First, could you quantify expected price mix for corn and soy this year? And second, just to go back to Vincent's question on the basing effect, would you be shocked to have a 3.75 EPS in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; well, maybe that's &#x2013; well, the 3.75, I mean, as we mentioned earlier, we're committed to 3.10 for 2010. And as we're planning forward with what we see, and again, we're pretty early in the process for 2011, we see 3.10 as a base, and 13 to 17% growth range is kind of what we're looking at right now. So I mean that's the way that I would think about that question for 2011.</p>
          <p>Regarding the corn/soy...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Price mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, price mix; I'm sorry. Could you help clarify that question for me a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, just what do you think the total price mix contribution to sales would be in corn and in soy for this year, given that you have most of your orders in by now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that the biggest difference that we're seeing is predominantly on the mix effect, particularly in corn is where the benefits come. As we mentioned, though, that's been offset by the higher launch costs associated with SmartStax and Roundup Ready 2 Yield that we talked about previously. But also with the new news around the obsolescence that we chose to take as part of the overall strategy, and basically the hedging issue that we had as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Rob], I think we probably should wrap this up and take maybe one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Our last question is from the line of Charlie Rentschler with Morgan Joseph.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We've talked about a lot of things but not about R&amp;D, and you're spending at over a $1 billion year clip, over $3 million a day. And I wonder what your commitment is to that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is one of the first things that Carl looked at when he came in at the job as CFO, and as we talk about leverage this morning and as we talk about stepping back from our doubling in '12, there's a way you can achieve doubling in '12. You just rip out R&amp;D expense. And I think you win the battle and lose the war, quite frankly. So as we look at leverage, we look at operational leverage. Our commitment, just to answer your question directly, our commitment in continuing to invest in R&amp;D has still held true. And we will obviously look for efficiencies, but the heart of who we are is a technology-driven company.</p>
          <p>And as we spent a lot of time on this call talking about pivoting a new product strategy, about getting much more aggressive in the penetration pricing and product strategy approach. But our firm belief, and you hear this clearly from growers when you go out and sit down and talk to them in their own backyard, innovation is the trump card. Innovation that drives yields, that makes the grower more efficient, is the trump card. So as we look to the future out beyond 2012, and the long-term viability of this business, it begins and ends in our ability to deliver that innovation to growers here and around the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is this to say that you would not cut R&amp;D over the next couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll look at efficiencies, but we're not going to sacrifice &#x2013; for the sake of making our long-term doubling goal, we're not going to sacrifice R&amp;D projects.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>[Rob], with that, I think &#x2013; I hope we've left enough time here for questions, but I'd like to save the last minute for Mr. Grant to make a couple concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Hurley. I'll be really brief. I think we've covered a lot of ground this morning. I appreciate your patience. I appreciate the opportunity to walk through how we see the business today and give you the beginnings or the flavor of how we see revitalized product strategy moving forward, and rebuilding momentum in our business.</p>
          <p>So let me be really clear about this. As we apply the lessons of this transition year in 2010, nothing and it kind of ties to the previous or the last question, nothing has changed in our fundamental view of the business. We have the best products in this industry, and today we have more of them than anybody else. We're the leaders commercially and in our long-term R&amp;D pipeline and we have the experience. We have the agility to use these products and our leadership to use 2010 as a pivot point to regain momentum.</p>
          <p>Achieving our 3.10 to $3.30 in ongoing EPS this year, as Carl has described, sets us up for mid-teens earnings or 13 to 17% going forward. It enables the conversion of earnings to cash, and a strong return on capital going forward. And it puts us in a relatively elite class of companies when we increase the dependability and the certainty of doing that.</p>
          <p>So I'm resolute in that unique opportunity and I'm focused on our implementation and I'm personally committed to this business. I see what our tremendous lineup of products under development today and entering the marketplace can deliver through the next few years and beyond. And we are looking forward to the opportunity to prove that out to you when we reconvene at our third quarter call. So thanks very much for joining us this morning.</p>
