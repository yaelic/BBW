          <p>Welcome to Zurich Financial Services Nine Months Results Presentation. I am proud to report that we have again delivered strong growth in net income and a solid underlining operating performance for the first nine months of 2011 as well as the discrete third quarter. Importantly, we have maintained the quality of our capital and solvency position, which puts us in an enviable position to continually assess opportunities for profitable expansion in both mature and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>This performance is in no small part due to sound risk management actions and our continuing commitment to our strategy of diversifying into higher growth markets while maintaining our strict focus on margins and profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly highlight some of our achievements over this period. Our strict focus on managing assets relative to liabilities on a risk adjusted basis and on sound risk management has helped us generate a net return on Group investments of 3.9%, or 4.4% if you include changes in unrealized gains. Both figures are non-annualized, so over the nine months an impressive result in this low-yield environment.</p>
          <p>We also continue our disciplined approach towards Eurozone peripheral government and bank corporate debt, ensuring risk is well-balanced and diversified to protect shareholder and customer assets. In emerging markets, we were able to close two major transactions. Our long-term alliance with Banco Santander is now finalized and closed in all the five Latin American markets included in this deal. That is in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. This allows us to expand our Life and General Insurance distribution capabilities in this fast growing region.</p>
          <p>In Malaysia, we completed the acquisition of Malaysia Assurance Alliance Berhad, enhancing our presence in the region as a full service insurance provider. And we have continued to streamline our operations, kept a firm grip on expenses and maintained our underwriting discipline. Most importantly, we continued to generate solid cash flows from all areas of our business.</p>
          <p>So let's have a closer look at the numbers. Net income for the first nine months was $3.2 billion, a gain of 34%, of which $1.2 billion, or 64% more than in 2010, was earned in the discrete third quarter; also benefiting from revaluations and capital gains on hedges and bonds. An unusually high frequency and overall severity of catastrophes and significant weather related losses over the nine months led to an 8% drop in business operating profit to $3.3 billion. These losses include previously reported claims related to nature events like the flooding and earthquakes in Asia-Pacific and the tornados in the United States in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Events like Hurricane Irene, also in U.S., and hailstorms in Switzerland and Germany have weighted on the performance in the third quarter. Despite these challenges and a difficult economic environment in which we operate, we have continued to generate solid profits.</p>
          <p>In General Insurance, our sustained focus on margin enhancements has continued to improve the underlying loss ratio. Strong action has helped us to rein in costs, balancing expense management actions and investments in emerging markets, <mark type="ph" /> buy (4:04) gross written premiums and policy fees, through a focus on selective growth remained flat on a local currency basis.</p>
          <p>We also achieved average rate increases of more than 3%, while simultaneously improving cost and retention. Global Life has also continued to make excellent progress in achieving its strategic objectives with around 26% of new business value generated during the first nine months; stemming from high growth markets in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, close to our stated 2030 targets of 30%. And this is even before accounting for the Santander deal and our acquisition in Malaysia.</p>
          <p>Overall, new business volumes rose 4% on a local currency basis, despite challenging market conditions in some of our mature European markets. And at Farmers, we continue to see underlying growth momentum in the Farmers Exchanges, stable margins at our management company and progress in leveraging the exchanges' multi-channel distribution through cross-selling between 21st Century in the agency channel.</p>
          <p>The environment in which we operate remains volatile and challenging; particularly with the continuing uncertainties in the Eurozone, but these results give us confidence that we're well-positioned to continually access opportunities for expansion in both mature and emerging markets. We do this the Zurich way, with discipline and focus. We're pleased with these results. We are in a very strong position and continue to thrive in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>In closing, I would like to thank all our employees whose hard work and dedication to helping our customers manage and understand risk make these results possible. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, let me say how pleased I am to be presenting my first set results, and even more so that they are such a strong set of results. This is thanks to a robust underlying operating performance and risk management actions paying off in a challenging market environment.</p>
          <p>To put the quarter in context, the discrete Q3 business operating profit was down 11% over the prior year reflecting the poor financial markets and higher weather related losses. However, the third quarter net income attributable to shareholders increased 64% to $1.2 billion, benefiting from gains on derivative positions used for hedging economic exposures and realized profits on the bond portfolio. These capital gains reflect our risk management philosophy of protecting our balance sheet against underlying business or investment deterioration and rebalancing Group investments in order to optimize its risk return profile.</p>
          <p>Clearly, markets move. So the market value of our derivative hedging positions will also move with the impact reported in the P&amp;L. Our capital and solvency ratio quality is essentially unchanged with shareholders' equity stable at $32 billion as of September 30 and our SST ratio at 225% as of June 30.</p>
          <p>General Insurance generated a business operating profit of $1.7 billion, down 12%. However, we have seen progress on executing on the targets with continued rate increases and the results of portfolio management actions reflected in the improved underlying loss ratio.</p>
          <p>The impact of major cats particularly in Asia Pacific in the first quarter and larger losses such as the tornadoes in the U.S. in the second quarter as well as Hurricane Irene in the U.S. and hailstorms in Europe in the third quarter resulted in major cat and larger losses being about $800 million higher compared to last year. This was partially offset by the improved underlying loss and expense ratio contributing about $500 million to the underwriting result.</p>
          <p>Global Life reported business operating profit of $1 billion. Increased fee income from higher average assets under management and higher risk margins from the focus on protection were more than offset by the continuing investment in the business as well as the depressed stock market levels at the end of Q3.</p>
          <p>The business operating profit of $1.1 billion for Farmers reflects the reduced quota share to 12% since the beginning of this year. The Farmers Re results were also impacted by the weather related losses in the second quarter as well as Hurricane Irene and Texas wildfires in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>For Farmers Management Services while management fees are down compared to last year, we continue to see improvement quarter-over-quarter following the growing top line of the exchanges. Other operating businesses costs increased compared to last year reflecting the strong Swiss franc and the effect of positive one-off items in 2010.</p>
          <p>Non-core businesses reported an improved result as last year included higher loan loss provisions, while this year includes the positive revaluation of the Centre visibility portfolio as well as favorable development in certain books.</p>
          <p>On the basis of our ongoing review of the bank loan provisions, we have added $57 million in the third quarter 2011, against the backdrop of poor property market in the UK outside London and in Ireland bringing the provision for this year to $108 million year-to-date.</p>
          <p>We made very good progress on unlocking capital from the non-core operations as evidenced by the announced transfer of the Zurich's Specialties London liabilities and the sale of <mark type="ph" /> Denver (10:48) bank deposits. The approval was received from the FSA to return our UK banking license which we completed on September 30.</p>
          <p>The reported business operating profit after tax return on equity for the nine months was 10.6%. The disasters and weather related losses in Asia Pacific and the U.S. reduced the return by 3.8 percentage points at nine months. Net income after tax return on equity for the nine months was 13.5%, reflecting the strong net income results.</p>
          <p>General Insurance continues to face an unchanged macroeconomic environment that is characterized by low GDP growth in matured markets, low yields and high losses from natural disasters. Despite this environment, General Insurance delivered a strong underlying performance with rate increases earning through, supporting continued improvements in the underlying loss ratio. The reported results continue to be negatively impacted by higher levels of event and weather related losses. However, the extraordinary frequency of these loss events has triggered our global aggregate cat reinsurance cover for which we have booked an estimated recovery of about $45 million.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight at this point that the result in Germany has been affected by a number of issues in the third quarter. Hailstorms caused losses of about $35 million. We have strengthened reserves, in particular on prior years for medical malpractice and architect liabilities of about $100 million in total, where we saw further deteriorations in trends.</p>
          <p>We also changed assumptions in certain unearned premium reserve calculations, resulting in an adverse impact of about $50 million. In addition, we uncovered some areas in the conversion of our books from Germany GAAP to IFRS, affecting loss reserves, unearned premium reserves and deferred acquisition costs were some specific products, and we have restated prior periods accordingly.</p>
          <p>As these errors mostly arose in earlier years, the material adjustments is to the 2010 opening balance where equity is reduced by $80 million. The corresponding restatement adjustments to the 2010 and the half-year 2011 P&amp;L were only minor. The implementation of the General Insurance strategy, which started last fall, is continuing to show results.</p>
          <p>Our stance on pricing and underwriting discipline is unchanged and rates continue to go up with a rate increase of 3.4%, as we can see on the slide for the nine months, which is step-up over the half year at 3.2%. Portfolio management actions to ensure adequate levels of profitability continue to be implemented. Nevertheless, gross return premiums are flat in local currency at the nine months and show a small increase in the third quarter of 1%, which represents a further recovery.</p>
          <p>Our stance on underwriting discipline remains unchanged. We continue to push rates in a balanced way to drive profitability. As I said before, General Insurance rates increased on average 3.4% in the nine months. Overall, we see that the distribution of these rate increases across the different portfolios shows a similar pattern to the half year, while we see an acceleration of rate increases in North America Commercial in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the rate change and top line performance of our individual market units in more detail. Global Corporate achieved average rate increase of 3% as well as higher customer retention while gross returns premiums were up 4% in local currency. This top line growth includes a higher level of captive business for corporate customers.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. and in Europe, the continued focus on profitable customer relationships led to an increase in retention and new business. We continued our expansion in Asia and the Middle East with strong new business.</p>
          <p>North America Commercial has confirmed its strength of firming rates, increasing further to 4% in the discrete third quarter, after just below 3% at the half year. This has been driven by increases in all major lines of business led by workers' compensation with an increase of about 9% in the third quarter. Overall, we consider this to be a very good result in a very competitive market.</p>
          <p>In the discrete third quarter, premiums stayed flat, bringing the nine months top line reduction to 2% after a reduction of 3% at the half year. This decrease reflects the reshaping of the portfolio as well as the challenging conditions in the U.S., where insured exposures continue to be affected by the slow economic recovery, in particular in industries such as construction and automotive where NAC's book is strongly exposed.</p>
          <p>However, we see indications of stabilizing economic conditions in the third quarter. Adjusting for a portfolio transfer of about $100 million in the third quarter of last year, premiums increased in the third quarter this year by about 4%, while insured exposures stayed largely flat.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Europe; rate increases in European personal lines have continued to stay similarly high as in this last eight quarters driven by the UK and Italy. In the UK, personal lines <mark type="ph" /> motorbook (16:58) these rate increases continued to improve the excellent year loss ratio confirming the trend from the half year.</p>
          <p>Commercial and Corporate lines in Europe saw similar rate increases as at the half year. Overall, increases continued to be at a healthy level and help to support the profitability of these portfolios. Europe's premiums overall reduced by 3% in local currency in the nine months, even though we have achieved rate increases.</p>
          <p>Premium levels reflect the split economic environment in Europe as well as our targeted re-underwriting strategies. As such, targeted actions in our personal lines book in the UK and Italy explained about two-thirds of the decrease in the nine months. Overall, both new business and retention rates are up in Europe.</p>
          <p>Finally, international markets' premium increased 10% in local currency with growth in Latin America of 20%. This increase is driven by property and motor in Brazil as well as motor in Argentina. In the region Middle East and Africa, premiums are slightly down mainly from re-underwriting actions taken in South Africa. However, we have seen growth of 7% in local currency in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the chart on the left, the underlying loss ratio continued to improve 2 percentage points in the nine months to 64.4% consistent with our improvement of 2.2 percentage points in the half year. As quarterly underlying loss ratios can be affected by adjustments, it is important to focus on year-to-date ratios. Rate increases and portfolio management actions taken in previous quarters continue to earn into results.</p>
          <p>Looking at the components in more detail, in the second column on the left, you see prior year reserve releases, which amounted to $916 million or 4.2 percentages points. These releases emerged from various regions and lines of business across our global portfolio, such as the motor business in Switzerland and general liability in North America. The releases are net of some prior year reserve increases such as some general liability lines in Germany, which I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Next, major cat includes in the third quarter loss estimates of $105 million from Hurricane Irene, which affected the U.S. East Coast. This category also includes the three Asia Pacific events reported in Q1 and the aftershock earthquake in New Zealand in Q2. We have left our loss estimates unchanged for these events.</p>
          <p>Moving on to large claims, as already discussed, 2011 to date has been characterized by an extraordinary frequency of event and weather related losses. In the second quarter, we flagged $200 million or 0.9 percentages points of the loss ratio related to tornadoes in the U.S. And the third quarter has also been active. Severe hailstorms in Switzerland and Germany alone added about $130 million. Together, these added 1.5 percentage points to the loss ratio for the nine months.</p>
          <p>The experience over the last quarters reflect the volatility which is inherent in a global book covering large risks like ours. However, we see no specific trend for large claims in terms of loss type and location. We believe that our risk and aggregation management is effective. It is part of our business to constantly monitor the large claims experience and to make continuous improvements and refinements to our processes in underwriting and claims.</p>
          <p>In summary, the overall reserve adequacy is unchanged. The underlying loss ratio in the nine months maintained the improvement of two percentage points, and rate increases and portfolio management actions taken in previous quarters are continuing to convert into results.</p>
          <p>We are working on our overall expense base to achieve the ambitious cost cutting targets by year-end 2013 as announced at our December Investor Day. The expense ratio in the nine months decreased by 0.3 percentage points, as we continued to manage expenses tightly.</p>
          <p>The other underwriting expense ratio reduced, while net earned premiums went down in local currency. In local currency as well, other underwriting expenses decreased by about $50 million or 2% driven by lower marketing spend in our European direct operations and reduced expense levels in North America Commercial. Our continued drive to increase efficiency in the business is also reflected in a reduction of head count by 4%.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I would like to frame the Global Life results in relation to three aspects. One, Q3 was one of the most volatile quarters since 2008 for equity markets, with levels sharply down from those seen at the end of last quarter as well as compared to the end of the third quarter last year. Two, the tough competitive and economic landscape within Europe persisted. Our pricing discipline in these markets will continue focusing on profitability over volume. And thirdly, we continue to selectively invest in the business in line with our strategy.</p>
          <p>With this backdrop in mind, I will now turn to the key performance indicators. Gross written premium, policy fees and insurance deposits increased by 2% to $19.4 billion, although they decreased by 4% in local currency terms as growth, mainly generated in the UK and Asia-Pacific-Middle East, did not fully offset the reductions coming from Spain, Ireland and Germany.</p>
          <p>Net inflows to assets under management remain positive at $1.6 billion, a good result considering the aforementioned pressure on premium inflows. While reported new business value increased by 14% in local currency, it does include a refinement in our methodology for calculating new business value for corporate risk business. Excluding this change, new business value was broadly flat in local currency and new business margin was 22.4%.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in framing the quarter, the competitive landscape in Europe remains tough with increasing pockets of uneconomic pricing, particularly in Spain and Ireland. Pricing discipline and product mix management is fundamental in these markets and we are committed to continuing our discipline. This is evidenced by our success in focusing on a higher margin protections products over savings product volume in Spain.</p>
          <p>We have also observed consumer caution on investing in unit-linked products in Germany and Italy as markets remained volatile. That said, we have continued to drive value growth within Europe in areas such as Corporate Life and Pensions in the UK and Switzerland and Private Banking Client Solutions in the UK.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., growth in protection sales continued. While sales volume increased by 15% over the same period a year ago, the new business value reduced by 24% following a change in persistency assumptions at the end of 2010. New business margin is at a healthy 44%.</p>
          <p>In line with APE growth, solid margins in Latin America and Asia-Pacific Middle East enabled strong organic growth in new business value of 21% and 24% respectively. While the Corporate Life and Pensions pillar gained traction, particularly in Brazil and Mexico, Asia-Pacific Middle East growth came from corporate savings and individual protection products.</p>
          <p>Reported business operating profit decreased 8% to $1 billion or 15% in local currency terms. As mentioned when framing the quarter, the reduction is largely financial market driven combined with a continued investment in the business. While we have seen higher fee income generated from higher average assets under management levels, the sharp decline in stock markets in Europe, predominately in the UK at the end of the quarter resulted in an acceleration of DAC amortization, negatively impacting BOP by some $50 million.</p>
          <p>This effect can go up as well as down depending on where the stock market closes at the end of the quarter, creating some volatility to the underlying earnings. It is worth reminding you at this point that the impact to equity driven fees in the UK is economically mitigated by a derivative hedging program that is not revalued in business operating profit but only effect net income.</p>
          <p>Similarly, economic hedges managing interest rate risk coming from our German Life book also had a positive impact on the Group's net income. Excluding the market driven impact, earnings remained resilient as we focused on executing our strategy.</p>
          <p>Within the bank distribution pillar, solid growth in several European countries was more than offset by reduced volumes of single premium sales in Germany and significantly reduced volumes of savings product in Spain. Despite the volume pressure, the continued emphasis on protection products in Spain contributed to improving the bank distribution margin by 3.9 percentage points to 28.9%. IFA/Brokers new business value decreased by 16% in local currency as volume growth in North America and Latin America was more than offset by lower sales in the UK and the Irish domestic market.</p>
          <p>Volume decreased marginally on a local currency basis within the Agent pillar as increased sales in Switzerland and Latin America were offset by reduced sales into Italy and Germany. The change in persistency assumptions in North America was the main contributor to reducing the pillar's margin and new business value.</p>
          <p>International Expats new business volume grew by 17%, while new business value grew by 30% in local currency as the pillar secured distribution with key banks and large brokers in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Corporate Life and Pensions continue to establish itself as a core growth pillar for the Group building on quarter's momentum in delivering volume and value in most regions especially from business generated in the UK and Asia-Pacific Middle East. Excluding the corporate protection methodology of refinement, new business value still increased by 42% on a local currency basis over the same period a year ago.</p>
          <p>As with the first two quarters of the year, the appetite for world solutions in the private banking sector in the UK continued into Q3, allowing the continued placement of tranches of investment bonds through bank partners in the UK.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our third segment Farmers, which operates in the U.S. The economy there continues to face slow growth and high unemployment rates. For the US personal lines market, this translates into a stagnant environment with auto sales still far below mid-2000s levels and continued weak new home sales.</p>
          <p>In this context, Farmers Exchanges delivered very satisfying premium growth, which I will talk to later. Business operating profit of Farmers Management Services amounted to $1 billion for the first nine months, down 3% compared to the previous period. This decline was driven by lower management fees due to the run-off of the 21st Century Agency order book. In the discrete third quarter, this impact however has further reduced and being compensated by premium growth elsewhere leading management fees and other related revenues virtually unchanged.</p>
          <p>At Farmers Re, business operating profit for the first nine months was $76 million; $172 million lower than in the previous period, reflecting the reduction in the All Lines quota share treaty to 12% and the severe cat and weather related loss at the Farmers Exchanges. Cat losses added 6.9 percentage points to Farmer Re third quarter combined ratio of 101.8%, significantly less than their second quarter, but 4.5 percentage points more than in the previous year period.</p>
          <p>The additional cat losses experienced in the third quarter nearly exhausted the limit of allowable cat losses in the All Lines quota share treaty. For that reason, cat activity in the fourth quarter will have a minimal impact on Farmers Re. Gross return premiums of the Farmers Exchanges, which we manage but do not own, grew by 0.3% to $13.9 billion year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for the run-off of the 21st Century Agency auto book, growth was 1.1%. The growth momentum emerging in the second quarter continued into the third quarter with gross return premium growing by 1.8% or when adjusting for the run-off of the 21st Century Agency auto book growing 2%.</p>
          <p>In fact, all major business lines including Farmers homeowners experienced growth in the third quarter, an achievement, merit and improved retention rates across the board. The Farmers Exchanges combined ratio was 107% year-to-date and 106% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As already indicated above, there were further cat losses in excess of $300 million in the third quarter with Texas wildfires and Hurricane Irene alone contributing over $140 million. The Farmers Exchanges surplus ratio was 36.5% at the end of September, down 1.9 percentage points from the 38.4% at the end of June, mainly driven by the above mentioned cat losses. This ratio continues to be within our target range.</p>
          <p>Now turning to investments, net investment return for the first nine months was 3.9% compared to 3.2% for the previous period, primarily driven by higher net capital gains. Net investment income declined 3% in local currency due to the lower asset base and cash flows being reinvested at lower yields.</p>
          <p>Net capital gains on investments more than doubled, reaching $2.2 billion, up $1.6 billion in the third quarter alone. This reflects the significant capital gain from selling part of our stake in New China Life Insurance in Q2 and third quarter gains on derivatives, which the Group uses exclusively for economic hedging as explained before.</p>
          <p>The $1 billion of derivative gains rose from hedging interest rate and equity risk in our Life operations and run-off variable annuity risk in our non-core operations, as well as protecting our European equity portfolio from the ongoing Eurozone crisis. Furthermore, our fixed income assets managers continue to actively manage the risk profile of our portfolios in Europe and North America to ensure that risks were adequately rewarded in the current market environment. These activities led to gains of approximately $450 million in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Impairments on equity investment taken in the third quarter were relatively small at $121 million. As already mentioned, there were $57 million of additional loan loss provisions taken in our run-off banking operations.</p>
          <p>The $1.7 billion improvement in net unrealized gains in the third quarter also needs a comment. It was driven by a strong revaluation of the government bond portfolio due to the significant fold in yields, which more than compensated for the decline in equity portfolio evaluations and increase in credit spreads.</p>
          <p>We mentioned at our half year results presentations in August, the measures we were taking to balance and diversify our exposures in relation to the Eurozone debt crisis. These measures primarily contributed to a reduction of our holdings of Italian government bonds to $5.7 billion from $8 billion at half year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have increased our exposure to German bunds. Our holdings of Italian and Spanish government bonds continue to be significant in absolute amounts. However, these holdings, along with our Portuguese and Irish government bonds, are no more than 6% of our total Group investments and mostly match insurance liabilities in the same countries.</p>
          <p>Our investments in bank debt securities are of good quality and highly diversified. They include subordinated debt of $3.1 billion, of which only 39% relate to Eurozone. The total sub debt exposure is diversified across over 100 issuers with the average issuer exposure being approximately $30 million. Again, this has to be put in the context of Group investments of about $200 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, our net equity exposure at the end of September was 2.7%. This is lower than the 3.5% we reported at the end of June due to the fall in equity values as well as the purchase of euro stocks puts.</p>
          <p>In summary, our total investment result for the first nine months of 4.4%, which included the particularly challenging third quarter, is very satisfying. It reflects our disciplined investment approach and our prudent risk management.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet remains very strong. Shareholders' equity overall increased by $800 million in Q3 to $31.9 billion, largely driven by the strong net income attributable to shareholders of $1.2 billion with an effective tax rate of 22.3%.</p>
          <p>In July, we successfully issued two Swiss franc senior notes totaling $750 million at competitive prices, refinancing a senior note maturing at the end of July of CHF1 billion. In October, we successfully issued an additional CHF425 million senior note. The successful placement of these notes at attractive spreads in those volatile markets reflects the recognitions of Zurich's name and its strong capital and solvency positions. The book value per share has increased from CHF180 at half year to CHF198 recovering from a decline of 11% at half year to only 2% down compared to year end.</p>
          <p>Our Swiss Solvency Test ratio as filed for the half year was 225%, materially unchanged from the year-end 2010 filing and in line with our estimate at the half year results. We don't run a full calculation quarterly although we do monitor the development of our estimated economic solvency on a frequent basis. This allows us to give an indication of the SST ratio as of the end of Q3. We expect the ratio to have been negatively impacted primarily by the shortfall in interest rates especially in euro, although the de-risking actions outlined last quarter will have gone some way to reducing the impact. Therefore, I'm confident that the SST ratio remains above 200%.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you that the model is still subject to approval from FINMA. We've received notice that formal approval will more than likely now take place in 2012 as FINMA continues to review submissions and assess the impact that the SST will have on the industry. In the interim, we've received model approval on a provisional basis.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue to be pleased with the results for the year and our ability to withstand market volatilities. We remained focused on our underwriting discipline as evidenced by the steady underlying loss ratio improvement of General Insurance of two points, our continued strong new business margin in Global Life of 26.3%, and our consistent margin about 7% in Farmers. We saw continued growth in the third quarter supported by good progress on our emerging market strategy with strong Global Life APE organic growth in these regions.</p>
          <p>Our improved performance in the mature markets came from strong delivery by Global Life, Corporate Life and Pensions pillar within Europe, growth from Global Corporate as well as Farmers growth momentum continuing in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our shareholders' equity increased further to almost $32 billion and our strong SST ratio is maintained. We remain focused on what we can control and we'll continue to execute on our strategy towards the delivery of our announced targets. Thank you.</p>
