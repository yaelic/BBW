          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Presentation of Inditex results for the Interim Half Year 2010. This presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Deputy Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session comprising of two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the phone, followed by those questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim half year 2010. I am Pablo Isla, and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO; and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, our Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>I would like to cover a few of the highlights for the first half 2010. The results show that Inditex continues its ongoing international multiconcept growth. Sales have increased 14% in the period. Over the first half, our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control. We have also maintained our strict focus on cash flow generation and in terms of expansion, our store opening plan for the year is on track.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth, we have maintained a strong international expansion over the period. This has resulted in a higher wave of international sales, reaching 72% of total versus 68% at the same point of the previous year.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight the rapid growth we are experiencing in markets with a strong potential in Asia. As a result, Asia has grown to 15% of group sales from 12% one year ago.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers, and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the first half of 2010, all declines of the profit and loss account show significant growth as a result of our operating performance and the comparable base. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;5.5 billion. Sales in local currencies have grown 11%. In the period, we have achieved an EBITDA of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, and net income of &#x20AC;628 million.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, let me tell you that new selling space has contributed 6% to total sales growth in the first half of 2010. Like-for-like sales growth was 5%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro have added three percentage points to reported sales growth, due to higher exchange rate, that is our reporting currency.</p>
          <p>In terms of gross profit, this line has increased 22% to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. Gross margin on sales reached 59.4%. The performance of the gross margin in the first half of 2010 was driven by inventory management, the use of sourcing proximity to response to a 14% sales growth, as well as the <mark type="inaudible" /> factors, such as currency and the comparable base. We expect gross margin drivers to return to normal in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses in the first half 2010 have increased 12% <mark type="inaudible" /> mainly the growth in space and group are the startup costs for new openings. Operating expenses are tightly under control. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the trends shown at fiscal year-end 2009. The position at the end of the first half 2010 reflects the use of sourcing in proximity with short lead times to response to sales growth. Inditex continues to show a strong financial condition.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of openings, we are on track. In the first half of 2010, we have opened 173 net stores to reach a total of 4,780 in 77 countries. Given our diversified geographical presence and our capacity to select opportunities globally, we have opened stores in 37 different countries over the period.</p>
          <p>Regarding the performance by Concepts as you can see in this chart, all the Concepts have continued increasing the sales significantly over the period. I am now handing over to Pablo Isla for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. For the rest of 2010, we will continue to invest profitably in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns. Our capital allocation process remains strict. We expect capital expenditure in 2010 to be around &#x20AC;570 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding the start of the Autumn/Winter season, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of August to the 20th of September have grown 10%. On the 2nd of September, we launched Zara online in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the U.K.</p>
          <p>Zara offers a strong commercial proposition in e-commerce and is also available in mobile commerce. Customer reception has been very satisfactory. We will launch Zara online in Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg over the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we plan to rollout Zara online in the rest of the most relevant e-commerce markets in 2011 in the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Canada. This will be followed by a progressive rollout in all markets in which Zara is present.</p>
          <p>As a closing note, I would like to remind you that we plan to launch Zara stores in Australia and South Africa over 2011 confirming the global reach of our business model.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. First question please, Pablo, on your store expansion plans, could you say how are you see the outlook right now for quality new sites, particularly in Europe? And when you might consider accelerating your store expansion plans to use some of these plus cash that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we would about our store expansion plan is that for this year it's completely on track and with what we anticipated to you in the 2009 a results presentation in the month of March. Looking forward we have planning our space growth to be between 8 and &#x2013; 8 to 10% in the coming years. We'll continue seeing strong opportunities in the different markets. You know that our expansion strategies mainly based in Asia and in Europe. Asia is a very big part of our expansion, <mark type="inaudible" /> Zara 50% of the newest space added is taking place in Asia, and then in Europe a combination between Western and Eastern European countries. So, no big changes regarding this point, we're planning to maintain the same strategy that we have already anticipated to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And just one other one please on the online expansion. Obviously you've chosen to roll out online to other markets in the second half for Zara. Have you got any plans for online sales for the other concepts in the group, the other brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as you know, Zara Home is already selling online since the year 2007, and the other concepts will follow, probably some of them in the year 2011, but that in a normal way. The other concept will follow Zara and will also be available online.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. I guess my question would be around the gross margin, and I'd like to get a little bit of clarity on what you mean by gross margin normalization and the trends normalizing in the second half of this year? I mean, we're seeing now two very big beeps or improvements year-on-year in terms of the gross margin performance. Do you think that the second half can be higher than the second half of last year, is that what you mean? Put at the lower rate, is that what you mean by normalization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we mean is that as you all know we always talk about that we work for the stability of the gross margin in the first half of this year. There has been very relevant increase in the gross margin because of our inventory management, because of the evolution of sales and sourcing proximity &#x2013; in proximity to response to this evolution of sales.</p>
          <p>Also two external factors I would say, the comparable base and the currency impact. And what we're saying is that in the second half, we're expecting gross margin trends to come back to normal. And what we can anticipate at the beginning of the season is that what we're trying to do is to work for the stability of the gross margin. This is what we want, what we mean saying, what we've tried to explain when we say that we'll see gross margin going back to normal in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And do you mean stability H2 this year on H2 last year or stability H2 this year on H1 this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, compared to the second half 2009, of course, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could I just actually ask one other question in terms of margin progression? And this is with relation to your operational costs, and we're seeing growth again now accelerate above that space growth for two successive quarters. I believe the guidance to the full &#x2013; at the start of the year was the operational cost would grow online with the space, so is there still an ambition of yours for the second half and do you think it's achievable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is &#x2013; well, first of all, I would say that cost growth is clearly below sales growth, which is also something very relevant. The main driver of cost growth is space growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then you have, of course, also a currency impact regarding costs as we always say, we have a currency impact regarding sales, and we have a currency impact regarding cost. And then, of course, with 5% like-for-like sales growth, we had part of the costs, which are variable, and then this is also having an impact Normally this should assume cost growth growing very much inline with the space growth, apart from these currency impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean we've seen it accelerate ahead of space growth in the first half of the year, so do you think that that should normalize into the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This will have a lot to do with the like-for-like sales evolution, because of the variable part of the cost, you know. So, but in any case with very good like-for-like sales evolution, that's very good news. If this would be the case, and then cost growth would clearly be below this like-for-like sales growth evolution, like-for-like cost would be below like-for-like sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We now give the floor to Mr. Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Could we just talk a little bit more about sourcing and gross margins, particularly your comments on proximity? I assume in the first half that higher proximity sourcing was mainly driven by higher than expected like-for-like sales, but could you just put some numbers on that in terms of the amount that you increased year-on-year? But also looking forwards, given cost inflation in Asia, do you think you'll source more in the proximity market, particularly going into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not planning any significant change in our sourcing structure. As you know, 50% of our sourcing is in proximity, 15% is in Turkey, and then around 35% of our sourcing in Asia, and we feel comfortable with this sourcing structure. And regarding the first part of your question, when we have the strong like-for-like sales growth, then of course, the ability to react is driven by the proximity sourcing. This is what we mean. We already talked about this in the first quarter results presentation, if you remember, and this is what has continued being the case in &#x2013; until the end of the season. With a positive like-for-like sales growth evolution then, of course, the way to respond to these sales growth is through sourcing in proximity. But we are not planning any relevant change regarding our sourcing structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just give some indication of how much you think prices will have to go up in spring-summer next year given the higher cost prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what we &#x2013; as we always say, our idea regarding prices is the stability of our prices in the different markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's on an absolute basis or on a relative basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you mean?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, in stability year-on-year and kind of like-for-like product, or are you talking stability relative to where you stand in the local market? So if competitors push up prices, will you follow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got a question on Zara online. Was the response much stronger than you anticipated? And can you tell us anything about the differences you maybe saw between the six different countries? And also on the EBIT margin what's the outlook for that and for online versus the stores please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is that, as we were saying during the presentation was, first of all, what I would say is that it's too early to elaborate, because we just begun on September 2, so three weeks ago. What we can say is that customer reception has been very positive, and that we are happy with the comments received from our customers with the initial evolution of our online sales. But we think it's too early to comment about it, if it's better than what we expected or not. We prefer to wait as we have anticipated to you previously. We prefer to wait the full season at least to have one full season this autumn/winter season before elaborating little bit more about our online sales evolution.</p>
          <p>If we are doing it, expand into other European countries, also as we anticipated to you when we announced the launch on September 2, our plan was to expand our operations to other different European countries, and of course in the year 2011 to all the other major non-European markets for online sales. But really I think it's too early. We are satisfied with customers' reception, but we think it's too early to elaborate more because it's something very recent and we prefer to wait at least to this full season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, what about the EBIT margin, how much <mark type="inaudible" /> for the EBIT margin based online compared to the stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have yet even an EBIT margin, because we have just begun. So the answer would be the same. We want to wait at least this full season before elaborating on this topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes now from Mr. Fred Bjelland from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I just had, I am afraid another follow-up on the gross margin. I think remembering Q1, you gave a little bit more of a detail breakdown talking about 100 basis points from FX, 100 basis points from proximity. I was just wondering can you talk &#x2013; can you give some numbers around what you think the exceptional circumstances in the second quarter were and perhaps quantify them?</p>
          <p>And also in terms of the proximity mix impact on the gross margin, I am not sure I quite understand this point fully. Is that such a huge difference between gross margins you can achieve from proximity sourced product and those from the Far East? Or has the mix moved so tangibly that even a small difference can give you, say 100 basis points on the gross margins? Because my understanding is that you say that the mix of sourcing from proximity markets is meant to be stable. It clearly hasn't been the case in H1 by the looks of things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding your first question, Fred, we prefer to analyze the gross margin over whole season, and what we have mentioned in this first half is that we've had two factors, inventory management, and clearly sourcing in proximity taking into account a strong growth in sales and to respond to this 14% growth in sales we have used proximity, which are part of our business model, and that there are two exceptional factors, which are currency, and the second one is the comparable base.</p>
          <p>So assuming broadly similar values for all these factors, what we expect is that in the second half of the year, we will return to the normal gross margin drivers, in which obviously sales growth will be the main factor for this, because is exceptional factors, currency and the comparable. Some of them is at question mark and the other one will move in the other direction.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question about proximity sourcing is not a question whether proximity sourcing has a higher initial gross margin than Asian sourcing, is the fact that you have a lot of demand of high turning garments, and you have the capacity to react. So if you're able to provide what the customer is demanding at the right time, as we have always mentioned, is a very nice way to sustain very high gross margin. So it's not a question of the initial gross margin, it's a question about the effective gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we breakdown the 400 basis point move for the season as a whole, I mean, how much of that is exceptional factors, how much of that is inventory management, and how much of that is proximity in the mid?</p>

          <p>Okay. And does that mean that the mix of proximity sourcing has gone above the 50% in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how can you have a mix impact then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It remains more or less the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. May I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We anticipated. We don't expect any significant change in the sourcing structure for the whole future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But was there a change in the first half is &#x2013; was my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically in the first half, as we have mentioned, we have used a lot of proximity to respond to 14% sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to follow-up on that maybe, there seems to have been a slight slowdown in the sales growth in the last couple of weeks. I mean, is that driven by any region in particular, I mean, can you give a bit of comment on the VAT impact in Spain, for example, what you've seen to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that to look at sales over a short period of time is not very relevant. What is true is that we have a different comparable in like-for-likes in the first half, which was if I remember, well, minus 2% and it was positive 2% in the second half. So the comparable base is what you have to take into account for the full season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the VAT impact in Spain, have you seen anything around you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>VAT, there are many countries which are changing VAT these days. Our general policy is to try to offset any kind of VAT increases that we are not charging into prices, through efficiencies in any of the markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And were there any price increases before the VAT increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to say, I mean we have a small VAT increase we're seeing in many, many countries over time, and there are not very significant impacts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>We now give the floor to Mr. Luca Solca from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I would like to ask you about the international growth strategy that you're indicating? Are we right to assume that you have significant growth opportunity in Western and Eastern Europe as you seem to point out? And what is the logic in this context of opening new markets in Australia and South Africa? It would appear at first sight that these would be difficult markets to serve as they are Southern Hemisphere markets with inverted seasons. And as a consequence, with that complexity, and probably also modest growth opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what I would say &#x2013; well, first of all, as you were saying, we have a strong growth opportunity in the Asia market, a strong growth opportunity in Europe, Western and Eastern European markets, so why are we going to Australia and South Africa? We think they are attractive markets for us. We already have our south hemisphere collection, which is completely different from the northern hemisphere collection. We have &#x2013; because we are present in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. So from that product perspective, to have higher &#x2013; a bigger sales in our south hemisphere collection is also very good news.</p>
          <p>And from the point of view of complexity, these countries are not adding a significant additional &#x2013; they do not represent a significant additional complexity in the way we manage our business. We think they are very attractive markets. And there was a big expectation about our arrival in different &#x2013; in these two countries, and well for us, it's a something very &#x2013; I would say very attractive from every point of view, and we feel very comfortable about entering into these two important countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What profit impact do you have as you move deeper into European countries on your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I have not understood your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering what profit impact do you have as you move deeper into Europe, if that is beneficial in terms of providing better overall operating leverage for your business platform in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have said previously, our entry cost in any particular market are very low. So the evolution of our margins, of our EBIT margins, will have a lot to do with our performance in the different markets much more than with gaining critical margin in any particular markets, because our entry costs are very low. We have no logistic infrastructure, we have no advertising, we have a very small headquarters in each of the countries.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and having in mind our business model, it is for us, from a cost perspective, very efficient to be in many different end markets, because we do not have relevant structures from any point of view in any of the markets, so this is the situation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And if I may, just one last question about online. I appreciate it's very early for you to provide any trading comments on online. In your expectations and in your ambitions, what would be the contribution of the online business to your revenues going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes now from Mr. Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, the question was &#x2013; two questions really. First one on operating costs in the second quarter. It looks as though cost grew at around 13.7%, up from just under 11% in Q1, but revenue line slowed a bit. Just want to understand why the cost base accelerated in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, again, I believe that to look at the evolution of the different lines in the profit and loss account over a quarter is more difficult. It's much more accurate to look at the season, and in any case, over the full season, you see that the operating expenses growth is below revenue growth. And I believe this is a relevant factor.</p>
          <p>Part of it is &#x2013; as we've mentioned, is currency and another part is due to the variable component of chasing high growth in sales. So I believe that &#x2013; again, to look at OpEx over quarters is a bit tricky. In any case, what we anticipate and the underlying trend we're seeing is that, OpEx growth is generally in line with the space growth. And, in any case, if &#x2013; obviously if like-for-like performance of the rate as we're seeing, you should assume that there will be some additional growth in the operating expenses line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally having a go at the gross again, I didn't really pick-up what you said the currency contribution was in the half, did you have a number for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we mentioned is that the four factors; two of them were intrinsic to the business and two of them were external. Obviously, currency and the comparable, and what we mentioned is that each of these factors were more or less broadly similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all I need. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Could you tell us what the selling area, square meters, was at the end of the first half, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We tend to update this at the end of the year. What we can tell you, Robert, as we have discussed during the call, is that on the space growth and store opening plan, we are fully on track. This year, the store opening plan is 40/60, 40% in the first half, 60% second half, while last year it was 50/50, okay? So there is a slight calendar difference, but we are very, very confident on the store opening program for the year is very much on track.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to be crystal clear, your space guidance of plus 8% to 10%, is that selling area or stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that is selling area.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys and congratulations for the results. Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one on online. I know it is too early to comment for you, but do you see any milestones during this early trading, any problems with &#x2013; operationally, that you will have to tackle going online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I would say if I &#x2013; from this very early days of the experience of online experience, what I would say is that our multi-channel approach has been very successful. So this possibility of being a store delivery is something very well appreciated by our customers. This is something that comes even from the first three weeks of the operation. Besides we're combining online with stores has been very well received by our customers in the different countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Thank you very much for that. And one more, if I may. Since your cash generation has been extremely strong, would you consider increasing the dividend or giving back some more cash to the shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we could say is that our priorities in the use of cash, of course, have to &#x2013; first of all, to invest in the profitable growth of the company. At the same time, we want to maintain an attractive and predictable shareholders' remuneration policy. We have been increasing the dividend regularly. We have commitments relative with our 50% payout ratio. And what we are planning to do is to continue with these two main principles, to invest in the profitable growth of the company and to have an attractive and predictable shareholders' remuneration policy. In any case I was prepared to wait until the full year results presentation to talk more specifically about this topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But given the fact that your cash, your net cash position, has increased by more than 150% by executing your space expansion, don't you think that there is some more room there to return some more cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I was saying you before, we prefer to elaborate more deeply on this after the full year results presentation, I was having in mind the average cash position during the year, not the cash position at a particular point in time. What for us is very relevant is that the business is very healthy. From this point of view, we are &#x2013; it's a very cash generative business. We continue growing, we continue generating cash. And we will try always to combine the two principles, to invest in the long-term profitable growth of the company and to have an attractive shareholders' remuneration policy. But I wouldn't say much at this stage of the year, much more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And a very, very last one, sorry, that just crossed my mind, about the next year's gross margins. I know that you kind of guide for stable gross margin but, given the increase in the raw materials, increase in freight and so on and so forth, do you expect to see any gross margins to be any different from year-on-year for the next 12 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to talk about 2011 right now, probably it's too early. Regarding the Autumn/Winter season, what we are expecting is gross margin drivers to come back to a normal situation after the exceptional first half of the year. This is what we can anticipate right now. Of course, there is some inflation, coming mainly from Asia. According to our business model, we are more protected because of our sourcing in proximity. But having everything in mind, what we can say is that we are expecting gross margin drivers to come back to normal in this Autumn/Winter season. In any case, we are at the very beginning of the season. So it will have to do with many different factors. And we think that to talk about 2011 probably is too early right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Is gross margin, a normal gross margin, around 58%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, gross margin &#x2013; when we talk about normal, we are referring to stability of the gross margin. When we say that we work for the stability of the gross margin, this could mean plus 50, minus 50 basis points. So when &#x2013; this is what we are talking about when we say going back to normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gents, congratulations on fantastic numbers today. Just a couple of questions, first of all, could you comment on the like-for-like performance in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can is say that our sales in Spain in the period have been stable with very a few openings, as you know, they have been stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how does that then translate, I mean does the Spanish market benefited from the same overall margin trends that you've highlighted for the business as a whole. So, has there been still a healthy improvement in profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we have mentioned, Fraser, is that all the characteristics of our business in Spain remain very stable. We haven't seen any significant change over what we mentioned to you in the first quarter and fiscal year-end 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, predominantly when you say sales are stable, your like-for-like sales were down slightly in the half year, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no openings in Spain, Fraser, so the business in Spain, it remains stable both in total and like-for-like performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can I just follow-up on the points around cost growth, could you just confirm exactly that your like-for-like, your costs have grown in line with space, excluding variable costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is a normal trend and you have to add currency, because as you know costs also are a &#x2013; the translation, of course, in euro also have to be done to euros, and this mean that there is some currency translation impact that, yes, of normally. And looking forward what you might suspect is that costs grow in line with the space, because you're having all the space growth, <mark type="inaudible" /> I believe this is a very efficient mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in the first half of the year costs grew in line with today, and then you're having the currency impact on some variable costs, so anything in terms of pre-opening, stepping up year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was there an impact on pre-opening stepping-up on year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The normal one &#x2013; the normal one because we always expense the startups, and as we're incurring them so the normal ones is linked to the store opening program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in the first half of the year, excluding variable cost and currency cost grew in line with stakes, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is what you must expect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as we must expect to what happened?</p>

          <p>As we have mentioned, the main driver of OpEx growth is space growth, space growth you cannot measure it over a quarter, because as we mentioned we have a plan for the whole year. I've also mentioned that in this year, we have a calendar of openings, which is 40% first half, 60% second half. That was 50% last year, 50% -- 50-50 last year. So the underlying key, underlying trend in OpEx growth is space growth.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Congratulations on some good results. Just coming back to the issue of the selling prices next year, you mentioned that you thought they would be stable, but then you said maybe it's too early to talk about next year. I mean, clearly, I get the impression, your intention is they will be stable, but equally there is higher cotton costs and wool cost. There is half of your product comes from the Far East where there is high wages in freight. So I am just wondering whether your intention is firstly to accept the lower gross margin, or secondly to ask your suppliers to take lower profits, or thirdly whether you will be switching your sourcing to achieve stable gross margins and stable prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is that, well, of course regarding prices our idea is to maintaining our prices stable in the different market. Regarding the gross margin, as we have &#x2013; I have anticipated to you, we think it's too early to talk about 2011 gross margin. In the first half 2010, we have some exceptional factors. What I would like to transmit to you is that the gross margin has not only to do with the markups. It has to do with many different things with the markups, with the mark downs, with the sales period, with the quality of your garments, with the way they are received thereby your customers. So regarding prices, our idea is to maintain our prices stable in the different markets during the next year. Regarding the gross margin, we think it's too early to give any guidance about 2011 gross margin.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning to all of you. We have one question coming from online. I think that most of them are related to topics that we've already answered, such as the gross margin or the market environment in the different countries where we operate. We have some questions which is coming from social analyst talking about the reason behind the strong performance in terms of sales of Zara in the first half, which is pretty remarkable even versus the non-Zara concept.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we would like to do, what I would say is that, well, all the formats have very good performance in the first half. It gives you the performance by concept, they are not very strong and then in each format performance, you can have different factors from &#x2013; I'd say we are satisfied with Zara performance but all the formats have had good performance during the first half, so nothing very relevant to say about this topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. I think that what they try to cover well is the impact coming from the expansion in Asia both for Zara and non-Zara concepts over this &#x2013; this may have been a driver for this strong performance for the business as a whole over this period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is that, I mean, to take big conclusions from first half results in terms of the evolution of sales of the different brands, we think it's better to wait until the full year. I would say that for us what is more relevant is the global. If you have in mind Zara's growth has been 15% total, group's growth has been 14%. So it's very much in line with the global growth of the group. That is what is relevant in my opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine. I think that there is another question relating &#x2013; relates Zara Home, if rate &#x2013; after having seeing this strong performance as well, this was obvious, we may see that &#x2013; the expansion plans for Zara Home?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not planning any big change regarding &#x2013; I mean regarding Zara Home for the full year 2010. Zara Home will be in line with the range that we anticipated to you in the full year 2009 results presentation. So we are not planning any big change in the short-term regarding Zara Home's expansion plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I would say the very last question, we are having from online is about our impressions after the first openings in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have already talked about this, we are quite happy with the reception in India. We think it's a very promising market for us. And we are planning to continue growing to move in &#x2013; to move to different cities from Delhi and Mumbai. And we are quite happy with the initial evolution of sales, and we are planning to continue increasing our presence in the Indian market in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are covering most of questions because most of them are related about China or India about Asia in general, our impressions for the different concepts if there is any special point that we want to remark for any of them either the Zara or the non-Zara concepts in China. But most of the questions we are receiving are focused on the Asian expansion at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well probably what they'd say is that, as you all know Asia is a &#x2013; are very relevant part of our expansion strategy, of course, China is the most relevant inside all the different Asian markets. But we are also growing significantly in Japan and South Korea, and of course, we want to increase our presence in India, as I was mentioning before and in the other Asian markets. So Asia is today and will continue being in near future a very relevant area for us to continue growing in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are no more questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much to all of you for attending this conference call. I mean, any case we are ready to answer any questions you could have through our Capital Markets department. Thank you very much.</p>
