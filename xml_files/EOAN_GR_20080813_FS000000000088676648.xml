          <p>Thank you, Mia. Good afternoon, buenos dias, buongiorno, dobry vyecher (:27).  Thank you for joining us on the conference call on our first half results. As usual, we have Wulf Bernotat, CEO, and Marcus Schenck, CFO, on the conference call.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Wulf and Marcus for the presentation, I would like to remind those analysts and investors who have not yet registered but would like to attend the Capital Market in Madrid on 1st of September, please let us know as soon as possible. So far 66 people have signed up and we would like to see more people to come. We assure you that the event will be very informative and also a pleasant one.</p>
          <p>With this announced, Wulf here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on this conference call on our first half 2008 results. I am pleased to announce that adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income have grown by 6% and 8% respectively over the first six months for the year. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income to be 5 to 10% higher than last year.</p>
          <p>As usual, Marcus Schenck will present our results and outlook in further detail in a moment. I would like during today's call to touch on the following topics. First, I would like to come back on the closing of the acquisition of selected Endesa assets and of Viesgo. Second, I will discuss the signing of the definitive agreement regarding the asset swap with Statkraft. Third, I would like to review our investments in conventional power plants. And finally I would like to update you on the status of network regulation in Germany.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the closing of the acquisition of selected Endesa assets and of Viesgo. We succeeded to close a transaction on June 26 earlier than expected. The transaction price amounts to &#x20AC;11.5 billion. On July 18, A2A selected the Monfalcone plant and the Calabria hydro plant, as well as the related investments in exchange for its 20% participation in Endesa Italia. These assets represent around 20% of the capacity, production, and enterprise value of Endesa Italia. The carve-out should be finalized during the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The closing on June 26, on the agreement on the carve-out of Endesa Italia largely concludes the process. We are now focusing on the assets that we have acquired to begin with the integration into the E.ON Group. We will present to you the new market units, Spain and Italy, in more detail at our Capital Market Day on September 1 in Madrid.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss the signing of the definitive agreement regarding the assets swap with Statkraft. In exchange for its 44.6% stake in E.ON Sverige and a small hydro power plant in Sweden, Statkraft will receive about one-third of the hydro power capacity in Sweden, a mix of generation assets in Germany and the UK, and some supply contracts and district heating assets.</p>
          <p>The Robert Franck 4 gas-fired power plant, as well as Erzhausen and Weser are part of the 4.8 gigawatts that we have proposed to the EU Commission to divest. Altogether E.ON acquired 4.5 billion of assets, while Statkraft gets &#x20AC;4.3 billion of assets. The value gap will be bridged by transferring &#x20AC;2.2 billion of E.ON treasury shares over to Statkraft</p>
          <p>We expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to 2009 adjusted EPS. The reduction of minority interest will compensate the &#x20AC;200 million of adjusted EBIT that we will forgo, as well as the increase of the number of shares outstanding. The strategic rationale for this operation, is also strong. Full control of E.ON Sverige will now allow us to optimally integrate its operations into the wider group, in particular regarding Trading and Renewables.</p>
          <p>With these two transactions, the acquisition of Viesgo and selective Endesa assets as well as the Statkraft asset swap, we are achieving major steps forward in the execution of our investment plan.</p>
          <p>Another major part of our investment plan consists of our organic investments in conventional power generation. All in all these investments make up &#x20AC;13 billion out of the &#x20AC;50 billion, namely 5 out of the &#x20AC;7 billion of replacement investments, the &#x20AC;6 billion of growth investments in conventional power generation, and most of the &#x20AC;2 billion in new markets for the Russian new builds.</p>
          <p>Our 21 most advanced projects shown on Chart 3 and 4 represent &#x20AC;8 billion of investments between 2008 and 2010. The total spend for these plants amounts to &#x20AC;13 billion, including what has been invested before 2008 and what will have to come after 2010. We have so far already secured approximately three-quarter of the procurement of these plants. Total investment costs have risen by only 13% compared to the initial budgets despite the strong rise of component prices.</p>
          <p>The other projects are at various stages of preparation and are not as well secured. However, we also have much more flexibility to decide on the most appropriate course of action should the economics not work out as hoped. We can, for example, delay or cancel projects if necessary.</p>
          <p>For sure, we remain comfortable with our plans for convention power generation. I therefore want to reiterate that we have committed ourselves to deliver a return of at least 100 basis points above the cost of capital on the whole organic investment pipeline in power generation.</p>
          <p>Let me now update you on the status of network regulation in Germany. The regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, has now set the network charges for our power transmission network and for all of our gas and electricity distribution networks. Compared to last year, our power transmission networks obtained slightly higher network charges. Our electricity distribution networks saw cuts in single digits percentage range, while network charges in gas distribution are roughly flat. We estimate that the year-on-year negative impact on adjusted EBIT will amount to approximately &#x20AC;300 million for the whole of 2008.</p>
          <p>These network fees also form the starting point of the first five-year period of incentive regulation that will start next year. The Bundesnetzagentur is progressing on the benchmarking of network efficiency. This is important since less efficient networks will be imposed stronger yearly cuts in network fees. While network operators have not been informed on individual results, it appears that the spread of efficiency is more limited than many had anticipated. The consequence is that reductions of network fees necessary to match the benchmark will also be lower. All in all, we now expect that network fees will not decline in nominal terms over the next five years, as the yearly reductions provided for under incentive regulation should be offset by adjustments for inflation.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the Bundesnetzagentur recently reviewed upward the allowed return on equity. For the investments carried out after 2006, the new allowed return on equity has been set to 9.29% for both gas and electricity networks. This is not much of a change for gas, but is a clear improvement for electricity compared to the current allowed return on equity of 7.91%.</p>
          <p>Finally the Bundesnetzagentur has yet to decide whether to continue the current system of market-oriented network fees in gas transmission or whether to move to the same system as for other networks. We have no indications as to when the regulator might take a decision.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to conclude with a few remarks regarding recent speculation. E.ON has been named as a potential bidder for, amongst others, British Energy and Union Fenosa. I want to make the following very clear. First, I do not wish to comment on these specific situations. Second, I would like to point out that we will have reached our targeted capital structure by the end this year as announced on May 31 of 2007. And finally, although we do not rule out acquisitions if they meet our strategic and financial criteria, I would underline once again that for time being we are focusing on optimizing the group structure and on integrating the many newly acquired businesses.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks. Thanks for your attention. And I will remain on the call to answer your questions later on. And now, Marcus, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wulf. Good afternoon, everybody. As you have already seen in our First Half Results 2008 published earlier today, our key figures show once again a positive development. Group sales increased by 16% to &#x20AC;41.2 billion, Group adjusted EBIT rose by 6% to &#x20AC;5.8 billion, and Group adjusted net income improved by 8% to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. And Group cash flow provided by operating activities increased by 1% to &#x20AC;4.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I further refer to the main developments of the first half results, I would like to remind you, as explained to you during our Q1 Results Conference Call, that this year's figures are not fully comparable on a market unit level with last year's figures. This is mainly due to the following two factors. Firstly, all the activities of trading, renewable, and Italy have been transferred to the new market units as of beginning of this year. And secondly, the short-term commodity price risk has been transferred from the market units to Energy Trading via an internal transfer pricing mechanism. As a consequence, all EBIT volatility resulting from changes in commodity prices is now concentrated within Energy Trading and no longer included with the other market units. The overall impact on the Group's adjusted EBIT obviously remains the same.</p>
          <p>On Chart 3 we show the seasonality effects within a year. This illustrates how the imbalances between the internal transfers from generation to Energy Trading on the one hand, and sales into the wholesale market by Energy Trading on the other hand affect Energy Trading's adjusted EBIT throughout the year. The swing in the Energy Trading's adjusted EBIT from a loss of &#x20AC;89 million in the non-prop trading related part of the business in the first quarter to a gain of &#x20AC;131 million in the second quarter is a reflection of this mechanism. Thus the developments in the second quarter confirm our expectation that these seasonal mismatches should balance out over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Now let me come back to highlight the main developments of the first half results. At Group level, adjusted EBIT rose by 6% to &#x20AC;5.8 billion. This breaks down into the following developments by markets unit. Central Europe's adjusted EBIT increased by 7% to &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>CE's West Non-regulated was the major contributor with an improvement of 12% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Main items here were a positive power transfer price effect of &#x20AC;394 million; higher power sales margin in Germany of &#x20AC;70 million; a release of nuclear waste management provision after agreement with the British company NDA <mark type="inaudible" /> concerning the convergence of reprocessing contracts of &#x20AC;73 million; and the transfer of activities to the new markets units, Energy Trading, Climate and Renewables, and Italy had a positive net impact of &#x20AC;59 million. These positive effects were partially offset by the burden from the continuing outages of the jointly owned nuclear power plants Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel totaling &#x20AC;224 million, and higher fuel and power procurement costs of &#x20AC;159 million.</p>
          <p>Central Europe's West Regulated business declined by 16% to &#x20AC;460 million. This was induced by regulatory burdens in the power network business of &#x20AC;138 million. These pricing decisions by the regulator were only effective in the second quarter, and therefore is the main explanation for the flat performance of Central Europe's adjusted EBIT in the second quarter compared to the growth rate of 12% shown in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Pan-European Gas, adjusted EBIT slightly increased by 3% on a year-to-year basis to &#x20AC;1.7 billion. The impressive swing from a decline by 10% in the fourth quarter to an increase by 31% in the second quarter was mainly resulting from two effects.</p>
          <p>Firstly, our Midstream business is slightly down.  Whilst sales volumes increased due to colder weather and favorable results from storage valuation were achieved, we experienced adverse effects in particular on the purchasing side. There is a time lag between rising purchasing costs and the pass-through to the sales side, which has a temporary negative effect on our business. Additionally, the pressure on sales prices increased due to tightening competition. Furthermore, we benefited last year from market conditions that allowed optimization of our procurement costs and trading results. Last year, spot markets experienced periods of very low prices, and the UK and Continental Europe gas markets were less correlated than this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the Upstream business, higher price levels and production volumes from the expansion of oil and gas production showed an increase in our second quarter Upstream result this year compared to prior year quarter of &#x20AC;48 million. The adjusted EBIT on the market unit UK declined by 24% to &#x20AC;553 million.</p>
          <p>While the adjusted EBIT in the regulated business were stable in local currency, but lost &#x20AC;36 million on a euro basis, the non-regulated business saw a significant decline. Firstly, lower retail power and gas margins impacted negatively with &#x20AC;168 million. The announced price increase of 15% for gas and 9.7% for power effective as of February 8 could not offset the higher procurement costs as prices for power and gas continued to rise to historic record highs in the second quarter. And secondly, the further negative impact was the appreciation of the euro against British pound amounting to &#x20AC;55 million.</p>
          <p>Nordic's adjusted EBIT reported an increase of 9% to &#x20AC;517 million, resulting mainly from increased market-based transfer prices for power generation in the non-regulated business. The adjusted EBIT of U.S. Midwest decreased by 15% to &#x20AC;150 million. The decline is entirely attributable to the stronger euro. In local currency terms, the adjusted EBIT remains on par with last year's level.</p>
          <p>The new market unit Energy Trading achieved an adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;99 million. There are &#x20AC;42 million for asset optimization. As mentioned before, this is in line with our expected seasonal earnings development.</p>
          <p>Our proprietary trading contributed after &#x20AC;9 million in the first quarter 2008, with additional &#x20AC;48 million in the second quarter. This result was achieved on the basis of similar risk taking as we had in the first quarter. In particular, we continue to be well within the risk limits that have been set for this activity at levels that are lower than what we allowed in prior years. Clearly, this was positively influenced by the upward trend in the commodity markets, but I believe it is also a good sign for the quality of our trading unit.</p>
          <p>Now I'll comment on the net income attributable to shareholders of E.ON AG, which decreased by 25% to almost &#x20AC;3 billion. That main effect here were the following. Adjusted net interest income declined from minus-&#x20AC;460 million to minus-&#x20AC;811 million as a consequence of the increase in the Group's financial indebtedness. More to the financial position of the Group later when I talk about economic net debt. Net book gains recorded a significant reduction of &#x20AC;697 million to &#x20AC;266 million as a result of the divestment of securities at Central Europe in the first half 2007, which were not repeated this year.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating income posted a high negative contribution of &#x20AC;922 million coming from negative-&#x20AC;174 million in 2007. This is mainly attributable to the lower result of the mark-to-market valuation of derivatives moving from a positive effect of &#x20AC;245 million in the previous year to a loss of &#x20AC;809 million as of June 30, 2008.</p>
          <p>The UK and the German tax reform had a overall positive impact. Adjusted net income improved by 8% to &#x20AC;3.3 billion, a reflection of the strong underlying Group adjusted EBIT growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now discuss the Group cash flow. The cash flow provided by operating activities remained almost at the same level with &#x20AC;4.8 billion. As explained earlier, the main developments on a market unit level are in several cases of limited comparability that can be summarize as follows. Central Europe grew by &#x20AC;708 million to &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Higher margins in power generation and improved working capital partly due to higher payables mainly to Energy Trading were the key positive contributors. These factors were partially offset by the outages of the nuclear power plants, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Pan-European Gas declined by &#x20AC;750 million to &#x20AC;1.4 billion mainly due to a higher working capital resulting from a different operation of our storage business.</p>
          <p>The UK's increased by &#x20AC;394 million to &#x20AC;1 billion was mainly related to reduced carbon payments of &#x20AC;103 million, as well as temporary improvements in the cash flow of our retail business resulting from increased prices in last February. The higher procurement cost in retail, which has caused the decline in adjusted EBIT, will burden the cash flow primarily in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Energy Trading showed a negative cash flow of &#x20AC;781 million as a consequence of a temporary effect related to internal payments from the other market units.</p>
          <p>Investments rose from &#x20AC;2.7 billion to &#x20AC;12.4 billion. The increase is mainly related to the acquisition of the asset package from Enel and Acciona, as well as investments in our new market units. Including the debt we assumed as part of the acquisitions, our economic investments totaled &#x20AC;50.8 billion until end of June this year.</p>
          <p>Our economic net debt increased in the first half of 2008 by &#x20AC;15.6 billion to now &#x20AC;39.7 billion. Main factors were the economic value of investments of &#x20AC;15.8 billion, share buyback amounting to 1.4 billion, and dividend payments of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. These factors were partially offset by cash provided from operating activities, as I mentioned, of &#x20AC;4.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me at this stage also update you on the status of our funding program. In the second quarter of 2008, we have issued among other transactions our debut bond in the U.S. debt capital markets with an overall amount 3 billion U.S.; another Euro benchmark bond, which had a total volume of &#x20AC;2.5 billion; as well as a Euro regional targeted bond amounting to &#x20AC;1 billion. Together with a number of smaller transactions, our total issuance volume in the second quarter amounted to &#x20AC;7.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Since the start of the funding program in September 2007, we have been able to issue a total equivalent amount of &#x20AC;14.5 billion. The average interest rate of all issues together is 5.5%. We want to highlight that we have so far clearly achieved our goal to make use of a broad mix of markets, instruments, currencies, and tenor.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now discuss the outlook for the full year 2008. Our outlook for Group adjusted EBIT for this year remains unchanged. We continue to expect it to be 5 to 10% higher than in 2007. The contribution of the first-time consolidation of the Endesa/Viesgo assets, as well as in operational improvement, in particular from the power business, are the drivers behind this expected increase.</p>
          <p>With regard to our adjusted net income, we have revised our forecast for 2008 upwards. We now expect it also to be 5 to 10% above the 2007 level compared to our previous guidance of 3 to 5% above previous year's level.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like address a subject which is of major importance for us and, as we know, to many of you. We have very often been asked why we are not increasing our 2010 adjusted EBIT target of &#x20AC;12.4 billion in light of the increasing energy prices and its potential impact on our commodity EBIT, which ceteris paribus of course is positive.</p>
          <p>Our answer to this is clear. We do not update our target on a quarterly basis, but we remain committed to our adjusted EBIT target as announced on May 31 last year. The review of this target is part of our annual medium-term planning process. In this process, we take into consideration several factors going beyond power prices such as the prices for other commodities; foreign exchange rates; specific developments in all our operating activities, not just power generation; the progress of our portfolio review; the timing of already announced acquisitions and divestments; and any changes in the regulatory frame work. The outcome of this review will be announced on March 10, 2009, together with a release of our full year results 2008.</p>
          <p>This now concludes my remarks, and Wulf and I are ready to answer your questions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>First question comes from Martin Young of Lehman.</p>

          <p>Hello, Martin.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, Kiran, Wulf, and Marcus. Just the two questions. The first &#x2013; sorry to go back to the subject of the guidance. It's obviously well documented that there are some structural changes within the Group, namely the Statkraft buyout, obviously the disposals that you've agreed with the European commission, and potentially gas transmission regulation in Germany, which could be negative. Are you still willing to commit to the 12.4 billion target for 2010 in light of those structural changes?</p>
          <p>And then the second question gets back to the portfolio review. Obviously that's been going on for some time now. Maybe there was an element of expectation that we would get some announcements in that respect ahead of March 2009. Just wondered if there are any sort of initial findings that you're willing to share with us at this stage of the game. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, on the 12.4 target, our message always has been we stick to the 12.4 billion target on the basis of the portfolio that we have. Obviously changes to the portfolio can have an impact on this number. That is one of the reasons why we have decided we will come up with an update of the 2010 target in March next year, because we expect to then have more visibility on what may happen to the different transactions.</p>
          <p>As far as the second question is concerned, announcements as it relates to divestments before the March full year results, we said at the beginning of the year that people can expect first results from this portfolio review this year. And we stick to that.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Lars Slomka of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a quick one on the Russian business, could you give us roughly an idea where the numbers would be excluding purchase price, allocation, and integration costs? And the same maybe for Climate and Renewables, whether they have any kind of integration costs or something included? And secondly, what's your assumption for Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel to go online with regard to your guidance for this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the second one, Brunsb&#xFC;ttel looks like it will not come back this year. Kr&#xFC;mmel we expect to come back in the last quarter of 2008. On the first question as it a relates to Russia, if I carve out the PPA effect, i.e., the increased depreciation from the asset step-up the first part of this year and I carve out integration costs, that improves the result reported for Russia by around &#x20AC;75 million.</p>

          <p>Hi, Lueder.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yes, just two questions or two and a half really. The first on is on your hedging policy. Bearing in mind that calendar '09 forward since they're trading at some &#x20AC;80 a megawatt-hour at the moment for more than 50% above your average achieved price for '07, it's quite interesting to see that your hedging ratios haven't really changed much, if anything, for 2010 compared to H1 '07. They've gone slightly back. Is your view that prices are still not attractive enough, or is it more that <mark type="inaudible" /> still not attractive enough? Why, if anything, are you reducing hedging ratios instead of increasing them?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to the Statkraft transaction. The treasury shares you will be using in this transaction, is it correct to assume that they will revert back to normal shares, i.e., should be used for the purpose of EPS calculation? And also the value date for the treasury shares, is it the current price or is it the E.ON share price when the transaction was first announced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first one, as it relates to the hedging policy, I cannot reconcile how you derived from what we have published that we have lowered our &#x2013; or that we have taken back our hedging strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. In your backup charts, you said that of 2010 you sold 40 to 50% of the output, and H1 2007 was 50 to 60.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now I understand your point. What we have done in the last three to four months is we have clearly not taken back our hedge rates compared to what it was in the first quarter of this year. We obviously do not disclose the details of our trading strategy there. But we have been quite active in the market and have secured, to the extent we deem meaningful from a trading point of view, commodity EBIT in the years '09 and '10. But there is no change to the hedging strategy that we have applied forward. We are always moving within certain corridors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's just purely coincidence and not a reflection of <mark type="inaudible" /> that are not effective enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the second question, Statkraft, these treasury shares will be normal shares and have to be taken into sort of numbers of shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating EPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>I've got two quick questions. First of all, I was interested to know if you see any upward risk to nuclear provisions based on proposals to increase standards for final waste storage or based on recent experiences of the trials for final waste storage. And second of all, what is the target net debt for the year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. On the first one, no, we don't see a upward risk. And having analyzed our provisions, if we saw that we actually would have had to change it, and we don't see a risk there. As it relates to the economic net debt number after year end, I mean, I'm not going to give you a precise figure there. I think what I would say is our debt factor on a pro forma basis we expect to be slightly north of three times.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions from me. First of all, the change in the Corporate costs, the adjusted EBITDA of the Corporate Center and New Markets was up 331 million. I can sort of see from your presentation a fair degree of that was probably Renewables and Italy. Is there anything else in there that we should be aware of?</p>
          <p>And then second question is your commercial paper has increased a fair bit. Where was it back in September when you started your funding program? And also what kind of level of CP are you comfortable with going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question, what is in the line item Corporate Center/New Markets, as I mentioned, the three businesses, Russia, Climate/Renewables, and Italy, published the delta, actually that indeed shows a positive change compared to prior year. That change is somewhat exclusively a function of the fact that in last year, we had in the last quarter a one-off charge from Corporate Center to Central Europe, over &#x20AC;180 million. This is now -- the same charge is being applied this year, but it's spread evenly over the quarters. So there is half of that, around 90 million we said was charged to Central Europe in the first half this year, had not been charged in the first half of last year. That explains 90% of the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question as it relates to commercial paper, we currently have around 4-plus-epsilon billion outstanding. That is a level we feel very comfortable with. And we think we can take this up even higher &#x2013; I would say by a couple of billion.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Sorry. Firstly, on the gas business, you reported very strong numbers there, despite the fact that one would probably expect with rising gas prices, shrinking margins maybe driven by the Upstream business again. Can you me or us an idea about the progress you will see for the remainder of the year as you obviously benefit from new production? Has there been any impact from new production already in the second half of the previous year? And with respect to the price effect there, do you hedge any of your fuel exposure in oil and gas production, and would that be a limitation then for the growth for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And secondly, again good numbers in Trading. Propriety trading, as Mr. Schenck already pointed out, has been much stronger in the second quarter than the first. Obviously there is in from the structure rather new unit, you have strong, well, demanding targets for the medium- and longer-term figures mentioned before. Would you say that given unchanged value at risk, the second quarter is a better guidance to quarterly profitability, although obviously volatile, than the first one? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the second quarter first. The first quarter of this year is clearly not a good guidance for this business in general because it was negative, and we actually expect a positive contribution from our trading business. So in that sense, clearly half-year is a much better predictor. And in fact we've been saying that we over time expect even more value creation from that business.</p>
          <p>It is really key to us to highlight that the good result in prop trading is not a function of higher risk taking. I mean, I cannot often enough from my perspective repeat the point that we have indeed lowered the VaR limit that have been allocated to this activity. Just to put it a little bit into perspective, we are using the VaR limits we have allowed by less than 50%. So this is really not risk taking, and the usage of risk capital in the first quarter was the same in the second quarter. Clearly in the second quarter, we have seen a very special development, I would say, of commodity prices. And we, and I would expect like many others, have in a way benefited from that in the prop trading business.</p>
          <p>And as far as your first question is concerned, regarding the Pan-European gas business, a couple of points I would make there. The first one is I mentioned that we have already in the first half obviously are seeing negative effect from this sort of time lag. That effect in the second half of the year is clearly not going to come down. I mean, it may actually be higher than it was in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>As far as our Upstream business is concerned, that really had a very positive development in the first half-year. And let me even detail this a little bit because we've given you the overall increase of the number. Actually there's also a negative foreign exchange effect that sits in our Upstream business, which is almost &#x20AC;50 million. So at same exchange rates, the result would even have been 50 million higher, which is not a big surprise because we have seen this spike in oil and gas prices.</p>
          <p>Now I cannot predict the development of the prices in the second half. But I think you ask for whether we are sort of hedging more on the position that we have. The portion that we are hedging is, I would say, de minimus. But we do indeed detect a price exposure in that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi guys. So two questions. Firstly, on the outlook for this year, you've improved the net income outlook. Is that because of something from a tax perspective? Perhaps a guideline on your tax outlook for the full year might be helpful there.</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you just give us an update on how things are looking with regards to your negotiations with the government regarding nuclear plant life extensions? Have you managed to deliver the bridge, if you like, to politicians to cross yet? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I'll do the first one on net income guidance. I would say there are two reasons why we have improved the guidance on adjusted net income. The first reason you have already referred to, and that is the impact that we can now foresee on the tax side. And indeed today we see a slightly better result on the tax side than what we had anticipated in the beginning of the year. The tax rates for the Group we will be looking at the adjusted EBIT I corrected for the neutral results. We see somewhere in the range between 25 and 28% for the overall Group, and that is a slightly better number then what we have used at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>The second reason why we have improved our guidance for the full year is that I believe I mentioned in March during our conference that in a scenario where with our EBIT increase we would have been at 5% increase over last year, there was a good chance that actually the net income improvement would have been below 5%. We no longer think that we will come out at 5% EBIT increase. We will still be in the range of 5 to 10%, but not at the bottom of this range. And against those two effects, we have increased our adjusted net income guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me comment on the second question concerning the debate on nuclear in Germany. First we welcome that there is a debate. It's a public debate, politicians are talking about it, and it comes from two main reasons. One is of course increasing energy prices whilst generation costs out of nuclear are at the lower end of the spectrum. Second, of course climate concerns and some concerns whether Germany or other countries in Europe can reach their targets for 2020. And nuclear is <mark type="inaudible" /> Therefore it has to be included in that debate.</p>
          <p>And the result of all this is that there is an increasing number of the German population in favor of exiting from the exit. That means extending the life of nuclear power stations in Germany at least as this sort of bridging function to allow renewables to be developed and become more economically viable in the full package or the full energy mix going forward.</p>
          <p>What potential talks are concerned? They are not really taking place at this stage, but I think the industry is ready to enter into such talks with the government, if the government wishes to do so. And the subject as such is not really suitable for a public debate on whatever solution might be the result of such talks. Therefore it should take place behind closed doors. And quite frankly I do not expect a significant change before the next general election in September 2009. But we should be ready for that date.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. I have one question on the gas market, on the long distance gas market. I'd like to hear if you have any view when we should expect a decision from the regulator, whether there should a change in the regulatory system for the long distance gas market, and what this could mean for your competitors' position in the German gas market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we have no expectation when this may happen. I think what is fair to say today is that the earliest it could start to influence our business, if I recall it right, is with the beginning of 2010. But that would imply that in fact the regulator does very soon take a decision, which may or may not happen. We have no visibility on that. I mean, I don't know whether that answers your question, but we do indeed simply not know if and when a decision to move to cost-based regulation will come. Maybe it never comes, we don't know. As I said, if it comes very soon, then it will for the first time have an impact with the beginning of 2010. There are some press reports that talk about a decision still being taken by the Bundesnetzagentur in 2008. But again this is press speculation at this stage, not based on facts that we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everybody. I think it's one question, but it has two divisions, if you like. Just like to revisit what you were saying about margins. First of all, on Pan-European Gas where you mentioned the 241 effect from pricing the lag, and then you further said and then answered a question that that might get worse before it gets better. I mean, is it fair to assume that the bulk of that is just mechanistic, and that in 2009 as these processes unfold, you'll get all of that back? Or is the competition that you also mentioned in your talk, is that a significant part of that, the erosion margins?</p>
          <p>And the second part is just &#x2013; is this the same thing on the Central Europe where, unless I was mistaken, you talk about any margin pressure and I don't think that any of the numbers hint at you having problems passing through rising wholesale costs. Is that correct? Are you not finding it difficult to pass-through rising wholesale costs in power? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the second part of your question concerning, let's say, the passing through of higher wholesale prices to the end consumer. I think that has been possible in the past, and of course has been commented by press and politicians in the past. And that they will not go away. It is a sensitive issue. But I think there is a glowing understanding amongst the public and the politicians that we have a situation of generally higher energy prices in the world very much visible in the last two months when the crude oil price went up to almost $150 per barrel. Then it's come down, thank God, in the meantime. Therefore it is somewhat easing the situation, but I think we have to live with high energy price. And it is obvious that in the end those prices have to be paid by the consumers, whether it's industry or private households. And I assume that we will indeed, if necessary, be able to pass on those additional costs to the consumers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just to add something to that, I mean, you can see looking at the UK markets that people have to react to pressure. The companies active in retail have to react to what's happening in the wholesale market. You may refer to what I believe is shown as a part of the sources of change in our Central Europe page, where I think we are reporting a 70 million increase in our retail margins compared to prior year. That is a functional of the price increase that we have implemented with the beginning of this year. There was no change in prices in 2007. So you can see some is in fact being passed through. There can be a time lag.</p>
          <p>Now on the gas question, I think there are in the end sort of three main effects that one has to think through in our gas business. One is just this famous time lag, which results from the fact that we incur an increase in our purchase cost under the supply contracts, and then there's a time difference to when we pass-through this increase to the sales side. And sort of in times when you see oil and gas prices going up, we're always a little bit behind.</p>
          <p>But if you don't assume that the oil price will rise until eternity, there will come at some point a turning point. And that turning point we expect to come, but it may actually only kick in in 2009. It will depend a little bit on what we will see happening in the next few months. But I would not rule out that indeed the main sort of kick-back we're only coming to [indiscernible &#x2013; audio problem]</p>
          <p>There is the another effect that is important to understand when you look at this year's performance in the Gas business, and that is that last year &#x2013; and I sort of haven't assigned numbers to that, but it is actually quite a significant effect. Last year there were some remarkable opportunities in optimizing your position on the purchasing side. And let me be specific.</p>
          <p>There were many times when it was actually possible to buy gas at very attractive terms in spot markets below the cost we would have incurred had we purchased gas under the long-term supply contracts, and we were taking advantage of that. There were also periods last year when spot market in the UK was very different from the markets we were seeing in Continental Europe, and hence we were using the arbitrage opportunities resulted from that.</p>
          <p>We have seen a much higher correlation of the markets in 2008, and hence this optimization gain, which we have benefited from last year, was not repeated this year. This is one of the reasons why, we've saying that already in March, that 2007 was really an exceptional year. It was one of the reasons why we have always said, please do not simply take the Pan-European Gas number and add an inflation rate to it, and that's it.</p>

          <p>Hi, Kiran. Good afternoon, everybody. Firstly, it's regarding LNG after the postponement at Wilhelmshaven. Firstly, perhaps you can share a bit more details with us, which led to this postponement and then perhaps an upgrade, not only on your future LNG strategy in Germany, but perhaps the Group's wide strategy for LNG.</p>
          <p>And secondly, with regarding regulation, in your presentation you give average efficiency for the industry, which is some 10 percentage points worse than the benchmark. Perhaps you can share a ballpark number with us on where E.ON is standing right now.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcus, do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the LNG side and actually we have to take a decision for the supply options for the German market in the course of this summer and the situation is that we have a very strength LNG market. We have a seller's market for LNG worldwide, and I should make one thing clear. We are only planning on a Group-wide basis. There is no LNG strategy for Germany, as such, as a strategy for the whole Group. And that includes positions in Spain, in the UK, in Italy where we have now capacity for LNG terminals. That includes new options in Croatia and Czech and potentially in France and for reclassification capacity.</p>
          <p>The fact that we could not go ahead with Wilhelmshaven has basically two reasons. One is there is not sufficient demand existing in the German market. And we cannot show there's such a project ourselves because we don't need 10 billion cubic meters of capacity in Wilhelmshaven alone. And when we made respective inquiries into the market, the response was disappointingly low. And therefore we decided to take a position in the Rotterdam project, Gate, which actually is closer to some of our markets than Wilhelmshaven if you look at the whole area, for instance.</p>
          <p>The difficulty in the LNG market simply comes from the fact that there is insufficient volume in the market, and there are not sufficient new projects under development to cover all the potential demand in terms of simply taking volumes or seeking participation in such projects. And in addition to that, current market conditions are such that demand is high in the Far East. Prices are higher in the Far East than on a comparative basis in Europe, and therefore most of the LNG that is coming out of the Middle East is now going to the Far East, and in addition also to India and not to Europe.</p>
          <p>So it is difficult but we continue with our efforts. We have secured first volumes in Equatorial Guinea. We are looking at projects in Nigeria, in North Africa, and in the Middle East. But as I said, it is a very tight market, and therefore we have to work how to secure future volumes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the second question, referring to the announcements that have so far been made in relation to incentive regulation by the Bundesnetzagentur, as you rightfully quoted the Bundesnetzagentur has disclosed the results of this benchmarking. And what they have published is an efficiency rate of &#x2013; I believe it's 90.4% for all the DSO businesses in Germany on average. There have so far been no information also to us as it relates to the specific efficiency of each and every DSO that is expected during the course of, I would say, the coming months.</p>
          <p>What, however, this roughly 10% delta says is that over two regulation periods, two times five years, this 10% gap will have to be closed. I.e., on average a DSO will have to improve efficiency by 1% per annum during this 10-year period. That's all what we can say today. Again we don't have the numbers for our own businesses. All we have is what the situation is for the industry as a whole.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good afternoon. A question on your four Russian new build projects. We know there's some evolving capacity market in Russia and there's a kind of energy market capacity counting in the cost of fuel. Can you tell us under which regime these four plants will be selling? Will they be selling in the energy and the capacity market, or will they be on the turfs And also are you reasonably confident that as of '10 and '11 when these plants will be commissioned that the returns they are making or allowed to make will suffice to cover their work?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Those power plants that are now being built will I think in their first one or two years -I think the first ones will start 2011 &#x2013; be able to set into both the capacity market and into the free market, like actually all the other existing plants. That's point one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, yes, indeed assuming that the deregulation as far as industrial business is concerned &#x2013; This is always important there; people shouldn't confuse that with private households. As far as the deregulation towards industrial business is concerned, if that kicks in, indeed our confidence that the plants that are being built in Russia will beat cost of capital plus, as Wulf Bernotat has said, the minimum 100% DIP spreads that we require for any such investment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Are you reasonably confident already that this is &#x2013; Is that guaranteed that you are able to cover your cost there? Or will that indeed depend on the further implementation and development in that market?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Your question, Wulf.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in our models, all the market projections that we are using, when we assume that indeed the market will be liberalized, our models point towards the fact that we will outperform cost of capital with those plans. If for whatever reason it is being decided that market should not be liberalized, which is not what we expect, then of course the math has to be redone.</p>

          <p>Tomorrow I understand we're expecting a decision from the Bundeskartellamt and I'm just looking for confirmation on two things. One, is that the last round of appeal? So is that the final decision that you're looking for to reverse the provision if the court decides against the regulator? And the second piece of confirmation is, if you are able to reverse that provision, can you confirm that that would have not been included in your EBIT guidance for this year or any other year?</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions, one regarding the regulated business in Germany. Similar to that question that what Tanya Marklov already asked in terms of the earnings stance for the next five years. Assuming that in the gas transmission business we will have an incentive regulation by 2010, does it mean that we will have a step down in earnings in that year and then a positive trend in the years after with cost cuts on the rise there?</p>
          <p>And a second question in terms of your gas Upstream business. I guess in terms of fusion of Ruskovia, nothing happened in between. Is there a Plan B regarding sourcing other gas supplies in the near future, or is there anything out there for reasonable prices at this stage at all? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Wulf, do you want <mark type="inaudible" /> the second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Evergreen subject <mark type="inaudible" />, no news, and therefore nothing to report. And as far as gas supplies are concerned, I think we are well covered in our long-term requirements in our total gas supply portfolio. Therefore there is no need as such for a Plan B to cover any shortages in that respect. Therefore we' are not working on any Plan B in that case. But we are open to discuss of course other projects if they come up in Russia or Israel, also in the North Sea where we are also looking at projects almost at all times.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gas situation, let me just make sure that the situation is really clear enough there. The way this works is as follows. At some point potentially we will look forward, okay, we will move to cost-plus regulation. Then that will be implemented, and then subsequently we will move into incentive regulation.</p>
          <p>But I mentioned when I said, if indeed in 2008 there is a decision that has been taken, what this would imply is that in 2009 we will see cost plus, and starting from the 1st of January 2010, incentive regulation. Okay? But we have no visibility on whether this will happen this year or not. If it happens &#x2013; and we've been mentioning this. I mean, obviously we will have to see but, yes, indeed there is a certain EBIT risk on our gas transportation business. It is too early to judge what the total financial impact there might be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two quick questions, the first one on gas in Germany. I think you <mark type="inaudible" /> companies announced some price rises for gas for <mark type="inaudible" /> customers, about 15% in June. Is that enough at current gas prices, or is there a commercial dimension in this number?</p>
          <p>And the second one was on your tax rate guidance. Is the 25 to 28% for '08 only, or is it also your best guess for 2009 onwards? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the tax guidance, that's also our best guess. I would say, from where I sit today for the coming years, statutory tax rate in Germany obviously will point more towards the upper end of this range. As I mentioned today, we obviously have a better visibility on 2008. So when you look at the years forward, we are probably more at the upper end of this range.</p>
          <p>And then the second question, was that related to...</p>

We obviously have to monitor the situation in the markets as it relates to further changes in retail prices. But obviously we will not discuss those in public. And there's no decision that has been taken. And this is, I would say, good market practice that we monitor the situation. And if and when we deem it meaningful from a competitive point of view &#x2013; and these are competitive markets &#x2013; we will take action.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the return in the gas business, really given what we have seen in the wholesale markets and the fact that some of the price pressure that we have experienced in our own wholesale business, of course some of that will be passed through into the retail business.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two follow-up questions. One is just on this quite significant gap between where the forwards are trading now and your average achieved price for '07. Can you perhaps give us some idea what the average achieved price for the '09 volumes you have sold forward is? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is there was story not too long ago that you may use part of your gas from sake as payment for the never-ending story of <mark type="inaudible" />. Is that really something that is under discussion?  I'm not suggesting that we could be anywhere near a solution because this doesn't seem to be right for this project. But is this an option you are seriously looking at?</p>

          <p>Yes, hello again. Just one follow-up question. Could you tell me when you expect to get the details of your incentive-based pricing for the DSOs? You mentioned obviously the industry work seems to be done, but you haven't add your own details. Could you just perhaps &#x2013; if not an exact date, when approximately you think you might be able to update us on that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes, we expect &#x2013; I mean, the best guesses that we have is that we get the details September, October this year.</p>
