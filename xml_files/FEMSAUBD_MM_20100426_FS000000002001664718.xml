          <p>Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to FEMSA's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded and all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, we will open the conference up for question-and-answers after the presentation.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company. These forward-looking statements reflect management expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties, which can materially impact the company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's CFO. Please go ahead, Javier.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Jose Castro from Coca-Cola FEMSA and Juan Fonseca join me today. While we usually hold our quarterly conference calls in the morning, we scheduled today's call for the afternoon in order to allow for our Shareholders Meeting to take place earlier today.</p>
          <p>As a result, in addition to discussing our performance for the quarter, we are pleased to inform you that our shareholders have approved the Heineken transaction by a significant margin. Given that the shareholders of Heineken have also approved the transaction this past Thursday and our all regulatory approvals have been obtained, we are on track to close the transaction in the next few days.</p>
          <p>We have been working with Heineken for the past three months, since the transaction was signed, on an intensive and highly structured process of integration. So closing the transaction will be basically a phase already that's signed some weeks ago that will allow the new Heineken leadership to take full day-to-day responsibilities on the business.</p>
          <p>Now focusing on our operating performance, our results for the first quarter again demonstrated the strength of our diversified platform. At Coca-Cola FEMSA, flat volumes and raw material pressure in Mexico were more than offset by strong performances in Latincentro and Mercosur.</p>
          <p>At FEMSA Cerveza, volumes in Mexico contracted 6% in the face of strong pricing and a tough economic environment. However, Brazil saw a strong recovery during the quarter. And once again, FEMSA Comercio delivered margin expansion at both the gross and operating levels, as weakness in the northern region was more than offset by solid sales growth in the center and south of Mexico.</p>
          <p>In terms of FEMSA's consolidated results, operating income increased 9.8% during the first quarter. Below the operating line, we benefited from lower interest rates and reduced debt levels, as well as from the benefit of certain derivative positions returning to normalized levels after an atypical 2009.</p>
          <p>Besides, foreign exchange volatility impacted our internal cost of financing significantly in the first quarter of 2009, and now we are seeing the reversion to a more normalized level, as the Mexican peso has recovered versus the dollar.</p>
          <p>In fact, our first quarter 2010 net income doubled relative to the same period of 2009. However, when compared to the same period of 2008, it increased approximately 50% that is a little over 20% per year.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet front, our position continues to strengthen driven by cash flow generation at all our operations, particularly at Coca-Cola FEMSA. In fact, as you know, once the Heineken transaction closes, FEMSA's consolidated net debt position will be effectively zero.</p>
          <p>Now, let me elaborate on the results of each operation starting with FEMSA Cerveza. It is the last quarter we expect to report FEMSA Cerveza's results. And in fact, we have included with our press release a pro forma consolidated income statement for FEMSA without Cerveza for you to begin to see a model of the company as it will look going forward.</p>
          <p>This version only goes down to the operating income level. But of course when we publish our second quarter results in July, we will show the impact of our participation in Heineken under the equity method below the operating line.</p>
          <p>As far as the results, in Mexico, we saw significant economic and unemployment driven headwinds, accentuated by incremental taxation that continued to put pressure on the beer business, compounded by what was the tail end of a very cold and long winter in those markets. As a result, our volumes in Mexico contracted by 6%. However, pricing in Mexico was up almost 10% during the quarter, following a roll-out of a segmented increase in the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Once we factor in the incremental excise and VAT taxation that became effective on January the 1st, the impact for the consumer was closer to 12% during the quarter; hence the slowdown in volumes.</p>
          <p>In Exports, volumes increased less than 1%. However, the rates at which U.S. wholesaler inventories worked through the system was several percentage points higher than reported sales volume. Pricing was slightly up in local currency, driven by the same mix shift towards Dos Equis in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil, volumes grow more than 10% during the quarter, continuing to show an improving trend over 2009. However, pricing contracted 4% in reais. Summing it up and reflecting the benefits of diversification as I mentioned before, total revenue increased almost 4% during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, gross profit increased 5% for the quarter and gross margin expended by 70 basis points, reflecting the combined effect of the increase in cost of certain raw materials and the translation effect resulting from the depreciation of the Mexican peso against the Brazilian real.</p>
          <p>Income from operations at FEMSA Cerveza posted growth of almost 13% and a margin expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter, driven by the lower cost of sales and by operating expenses growing exactly in line with total revenues.</p>
          <p>Turning to our soft drink business, Coca-Cola FEMSA delivered a quarter of mid-single-digit revenue and EBIT growth, lapping 30% and 70% increases last year respectively. We accomplished this on the back of strong organic growth, driven mainly by volumes in both sparkling and still beverages across our operations.</p>
          <p>Gross margin contracted 100 basis points due to higher sweetener prices mainly in Mexico. However, operating income increased 6.4%, while operating margin expanded by 20 basis points on the back of tight operating expenses, particularly in Latincentro. If you were unable to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call last Friday, you can access the replay of their webcast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>Finally at FEMSA Comercio, same-store sales were up by 3% in the quarter, reflecting higher traffic on a favorable average ticket. Isolating the accounting effect of the consumer migration from prepaid cellular air-time to electronic top-ups, which has diminished over time but is still a factor, average ticket would have increased in the low single-digits.</p>
          <p>In terms of store base expansion, we added 158 net new stores during the first quarter to reach 950 net new stores over the last 12 months, on track to meet our objective for the year.</p>
          <p>On the operational front, revenues increased 14% during the quarter. Gross margin improved 90 basis points, again driven by more effective collaboration and execution with our key suppliers and partners, combined with a more efficient user promotion related marketing resources, a positive mix effect from the growth of higher margin categories, and to a lesser extent, the final stages of the consumer shift towards electronic recharges, as described before.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased 15.7%, slightly above revenues, as efficiencies achieved at the start level almost compensated for the new store openings. As a result, operating margin expanded by 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>While this is an encouraging start for the year for FEMSA Comercio, we need to keep an eye on electricity tariffs, as we will be facing tough comparisons later in the year that will pressure operating margin expansion trends.</p>
          <p>Summing up, a very encouraging first quarter overall, setting the stage for a new phase in the growth and evolution of FEMSA, we think. And before we open up the call to your questions, let me take a minute to comment on what we perceive to be some of the key questions that investors and analysts had on FEMSA this time.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead into 2010, we will keep us always working hard to deliver strong operating and financial results, in what should be another challenging year particularly in Mexico, even as macroeconomic trends improved somewhat relative to 2009. At the same time, on confidence of our significant balance sheet strength, we will move fast in our analysis of the optimal use of cash and of our balance sheet flexibility in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>We will do these as always, focused on the pursuit of value creating acquisition opportunities that leverage our distinctive set of capabilities and our existing asset base. At the same time, as we have stated in the past, if capital could not be strategically and efficiently allocated to acquisition opportunities in sensible periods of time, we maintain our belief and commitment that in the medium to long-term the company should have an adequate financial structure that maximizes shareholder value. Therefore, we will take decisions accordingly.</p>
          <p>And on this point, we can only add that you look at our track record of acquisitions made during the last decade. If you look at the evaluation discipline that we believe that we have exercised in the past and the duty for some time, these processes take time and for good reason.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to open the call now for your questions. Operator, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Javier. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll first hear from Lauren Torres with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My question is relating to the consumer environment in Mexico. I assume we're seeing some improvement in the second quarter, as weather has improved. But I'm also curious to hear about just purchasing behavior, whether it'd be at the beer business or at OXXO, if you're seeing better health returned to the consumer? And then along those lines, you mentioned taking higher pricing and the impact of pricing on your volumes, I was just curious if you could talk about the competitive environment on the pricing front and if you believe you have to take any additional pricing this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Lauren, hi. As we just mentioned, there are a number of factors that we have looked at and it's very hard to really be able to isolate each of those. But we still think that weather and consumer being impacted by gasoline and a number of factors on communications and things like beer for example and the VAT are the main drivers behind the softness that we have seen for the first three months at least. So those, I would say are the main phenomena we're looking at.</p>
          <p>We think that the &#x2013; what &#x2013; from what we have been seeing in the competitive landscape, I would say that there is a &#x2013; I would say a lot of rationality; I would say that most consumer good companies in Mexico are looking at this environment that we're facing. And I would say that as you will start to getting communications from a number of other companies, I would say that our performance will be confirmed by the performance of others. So I will say that all-in-all, the combination of a very, very hard start of the year combined with the difficult weather are basically the reasons.</p>
          <p>We are now starting to see employment figures starting to pick up. That would be, I would say, very good if that can be a trend that can be sustained, which we think it will. So I would say that in some parts of the regions, as most of you know, the insecurity effect is also taking its toll on some of these products and services that we fairly that also or sell within the beer business or Coca-Cola FEMSA.</p>
          <p>But &#x2013; and I would say that in the &#x2013; in terms of the competitive dynamics, we are looking at a market which is, I would say, basically aware of what the environment is all about and behaving accordingly, I would say in a rational way. I would say that the price increase that the company took at the beer business is, I would say, it was assumed on taking in light of what the general environment for 2010 looked like at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>So whatever decision the beer business will need to take going forward, of course will be a decision of Heineken, and I would say that it will be heavily dependent on the macro-environment, as well as the strategies that Heineken would now &#x2013; would like to follow now taking care of the beer business here in Mexico and in Brazil and in the U.S. as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But to the extent, I'm not sure if you want to comment on the second quarter yet with respect to traffic at OXXO, any signs of improvement there at the consumer level, any change sequentially quarter-over-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't tend to look at these &#x2013; when you look at these businesses, it's much better to look at them on a same-days basis against last year and then on a weekly basis. And looking at that, we've &#x2013; if you recall also, we had a benefit on the month of March, because of now Easter being half on half between the first and the second as opposed to only in the second quarter last year. So it is still in the early part of the quarter. I would say it is still too early to tell.</p>
          <p>Of course the weather has improved a lot if you compare April against March. But again, if you look at April against April, I wouldn't say that we're having much more sunnier days or higher temperatures so far. So I wouldn't say that trends in April are improving according to the trends that we just saw. But again, it's still a little bit complicated to have a good look at the performance of April, because of what I just described about the Easter being half and half this year.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Javier. My question was to &#x2013; some accounting questions actually only. Regarding depreciation and amortization, we're seeing a big reduction there in the depreciation rate of Coca-Cola FEMSA. And for the same token, we're seeing a big increase on the amortization rate. I was wondering if you could provide us some explanation for that and thank you very much. And I'm referring specifically to the income statement without Cerveza already. Thank you for providing that. Could you just tell us what will be the general guidelines in terms of how you're going to account for that 20% of Heineken below the operating line? And finally, what will be your CapEx guidance ex-Cerveza for 2010? Only those three questions please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the first one, on the depreciation of Coca-Cola FEMSA, I will ask Jose Castro to talk about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the end of my answers. And on the depreciation &#x2013; on the amortization of FEMSA Cerveza, there's really not a significant reduction there, and whatever should be happening there, Alan, has a lot to do with the diminishing of volumes. As you recall, when volumes go down, amortization also &#x2013; depending on when the reduction start taking place also can come down depending, if you're talking about exclusive markets or not. And of course, the impact of Brazil now having a big quarter growing its participation of the FEMSA Cerveza business, and in Brazil, amortization of exclusives is very, very low. Arithmetically that produced that effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but my question has to do with &#x2013; sorry to interrupt you, Javier. My question has to do with the ex-Cerveza increase that you reported. You're showing us almost 17% increase in amortization and other, excluding Cerveza, sorry to interrupt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean &#x2013; I would ask also Jose to answer that, because the increase is basically taking place in Coca-Cola.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Coca-Cola, okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And on the CapEx, the number that we're looking without is about 750. That's kind of what's been approved initially for the year. But of course, that's a moving target because we take a lot of cost and there's about managing CapEx in circumstances, sorts of the one we have in 2009 and 2010. And I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just break that down, I mean the 750, roughly 530 for Coke FEMSA, Alan, and 220 for OXXO. So it's really at Coke FEMSA as you're going to see an increase in CapEx. These are the recent periods and it has everything to do with capacity increases at a lot of the operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and on the last question before asking Jose, what we're going to do starting in June is we're going to include our 20% investment in Heineken. We're going to report on an equity method line in the P&amp;L of FEMSA in arrears. That is, we're going to be one quarter after the published reports of Heineken during the first three quarters of the year. And at the end of the year, we will have the benefit of having, I would say, similar dates for reporting both companies. So at the end of the year, we will be basically put in a 20% of the net income of Heineken on an equity method line on the P&amp;L of FEMSA; that is below the operating profit. And that is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the full 20%, not the initial stake of the shares that you're getting and accounting separately the other 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the full 20% since we have all the rights and obligations since day one after closing takes place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan. How are you? This is Jose Castro. I guess the main change that you will see on the depreciation that we've registered, that we Coca-Cola FEMSA registered during the first quarter of 2010, was mainly, given that we extended the life of the coolers in our Brazilian operations. So, yes, you will see a small figure and you will see that our depreciation de-registering going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. So the reduction of almost 10% in the depreciation of the first quarter, of Coca-Cola FEMSA is related to an extending the life of the coolers in Brazil, do you know from how many years to how many years, Jose, by any chance? And then the second question would be, does that have anything to do with the almost 17% increase &#x2013; well, now 22% increase in amortization that you're seeing were also during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are extending the life from five to seven years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's mainly related to that, Alan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And the amortization, the increase from &#x2013; of 22%, what would be the main items of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's mainly related to bottles and cases and &#x2013; that will be it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bottles and cases?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, I mean, we're basically talking about less than $5 million. I think we'll look offline and gather up with Jose and the team and if there is anything incremental, I think we can follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>We'll now hear from Lore Serra with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to try to understand better the comments you made at the beginning about the use of cash and you mentioned that it takes time to make acquisitions, but that you were working very fast to redefine what your strategy is and what return cash to shareholders. So I'm just trying to understand that, because acquisitions can take years. Can you give us a sense of what's the timetable, where you'll make a decision, whether you'll increase shareholder returns or hold on to the cash because you think the acquisition outlook is promising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Lore. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this is not something that can be subject we think to a certain date. I mean, if that the date comes, then you're going to take these or that decision. This is more going in concern that the company has always looked at very carefully. So I mean, if the company has the idea that there were not potential opportunities with a reasonable degree of probability of both taking place and being beneficial for the company, I would say that the time in which we will be taking decisions in order to manage our financial structure in an adequate way will be shorter.</p>
          <p>Or if we are convinced that we are basically still may be three, five days until we close the transaction with Heineken, and we are coming from what we might say at least on a consolidated basis reasonable levels of leverage, we think that it's fair to at least spend some time precisely looking at those alternatives, developing them in an adequate way and hopefully being able to strike them as has been the case in the past.</p>
          <p>So it is very hard for me to say, well if by certain day or month of the year, we are not in a position to really allocate capital, then we're going to start making this or that decision. Because as I said, I mean, if we have sufficient alternatives, sufficiently developed and we have good elements that in good judgment tells us, that we have a fair share or a fair chance to really be able to accompany those, then we're going to take enough patience if we're looking at shareholder value creation for the medium and long-term, which is always what we have.</p>
          <p>We would have told you that in 2003 after FEMSA got exactly in the same position of having basically zero debt in the balance sheet, we would have ended the &#x2013; lesser than 18 months after with more than five billion debt in the balance sheet because of the acquisition of Panamco and the 30% we bought from Intego. And I think that if you look back to those couple of acquisitions and the rest that we made during the decade, I think that's a story for value creation for the shareholders was good.</p>
          <p>So again, what we're saying to you and to everyone is that we're working very hard internally to come up with the best ideas in terms of how to allocate and deploy capital and that we take this very seriously. We don't like to be in leverage. We like to use the balance sheet for tapping growth opportunities and to create shareholder value. But it is very, very hard for me to really put certain timeframes. What I can really ratify is that, the moment we think that it's a better use of cash doing either share buybacks or special dividends of the sorts, we will do that as fast as we get to that conclusion.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me ask the question in a different way. I mean, you obviously have an idea right now what the potential pipeline of investment alternatives might be. So if I take, I don't know, 12 to 24 month view, would your bias be the same that you'd rather spend the time looking at some of those opportunities or do you think that they're not highly probable for the medium term? And then second, there is one issue kind of reinvestment of cash and there is also an issue of what's the right structure for FEMSA, is it the same one you have now or if it's a different one, right. Can you address the second issue before you address the first issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do. I would say that on the second one, we still do believe that the present structure of FEMSA is the right one, coming out of transaction such as the one we are still pending to close. We think this is the right structure and we've said in the past that we will be also looking at that in the future. But if for example, the question goes again to the &#x2013; I would say, very heavily commented potential IPO of FEMSA Comercio. I can tell you that we're not looking at that opportunity. We still think that FEMSA shareholders are more benefited by keeping these assets entirely for FEMSA.</p>
          <p>And for, the same case for Coca-Cola FEMSA being a public company these days, we still do believe that having this public company structure for Coca-Cola FEMSA is a right thing for the company, because it allows us to really be a much more attractive partner for some potential bottlers. And that's been, I would say the case in the past when we have explored some potential transactions with people in the Coke space. And we still think that's a very, very optimal structure that we pretend to keep in place for the time being. That's basically my comment on the second part.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that again, Lore, if I say that, if nothing happens for the next 24 months, then we're going to take this or that decision, I would be lying to you, because if on the 23rd month, it seems that we're going to be able to accomplish what we are looking for, then maybe nothing is going to happen on the 24th month. We're working as hard as we can and we're, I would say, exploring many opportunities that it makes sense for us to look at and hopefully we're &#x2013; we will be able to give you some good news much earlier than 24 months ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Well, Lore had already asked my question and I guess that, there is no other way of rephrasing it. But I guess I would ask one sort of corollary. If &#x2013; I mean, you guys are paying dividends once a year, so if in six or seven months, the likelihood of spending this cash that you have, that you're piling up already, becomes less and less probable, will you guys be looking at the share buyback mechanism as a way to return cash to shareholders before increasing the dividend significantly or is that internally &#x2013; is there an internal bias against share a buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jos&#xE9;. Again, without the exception of putting a timeframe saying six months, eight or four whatever, I would say that we don't have a bias at this point of time. We will consider both either paying special dividends, interim special dividends, or doing share buybacks. So we don't have any special bias at this point of time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on OXXO's operations. The traffic growth you reported of a little over 2% in the first quarter was similar to the second half levels, which was more, let's say, 2.5%, and that's despite the issues you mentioned about the weather and increased violence, et cetera. But the ticket at low single-digit seems low given the price increases you talked about in the year. And I understand soft drinks didn't have that kind of pricing, but I think a lot of consumer goods we've seen a lot of inflation in basic items, and I guess I would have thought that more of that would have found it's way through in terms of OXXO's same store ticket. So I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on the consumer behavior at OXXO, why the ticket isn't looking as strong as it might relative to these price increases, yet the traffic seems to be relatively stable despite some of the issues with weather et cetera? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I would say there's a number of elements there Lore. It's &#x2013; first, I would say sales per customer and sales per store are quite different on a regional basis, as you can imagine, because of again, the per capitas and degree of penetration of OXXO in different geographies. So the first effect, I would say, has a lot to do with northern Mexico having a not so good performance or not so &#x2013; as opposed to central.</p>
          <p>Number two, I would say that also down-trading from consumers from products that command higher prices also is having some effect. Number three, I would say also that at least partially during the quarter we had some, I would say, not very well agreements with some providers of air-time charge on prepaid phone from one of the suppliers in Mexico. And we were of the &#x2013; we were not selling that service for a couple of weeks maybe. And I would say those three elements can tell you the story behind, as you're saying, slightly softer tickets as opposed to fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The weakness you're mentioning in the north, I know it wasn't &#x2013; I don't know, two or three quarters ago you were saying that north was some of the fastest growing. So is that just kind of normalization of trend or is that related to security et cetera? I mean, what do you attribute to and should it be short-lived or something you think will persist in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to say if it's going to persist or not. I would say that, my own opinion is that weather balances produces higher reactions from consumers in Northern Mexico and then may be in the Central. So I would say that we saw, I would say, a performance in the quarter that, I would say, it's more related maybe to weather than anything else. So we're hopefully looking at these coming back in the coming quarters. Of course, the security situation in at least &#x2013; and particularly, northeastern and central and northern Mexico. So it's I would say, more complicated than in the rest of the north and of course of the center. So that maybe also taking a little bit of its toll the in security situation. That's maybe all my comments.</p>
