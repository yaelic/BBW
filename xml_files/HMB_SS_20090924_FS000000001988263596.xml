          <p>Good morning and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's Nine Months Report.</p>
          <p>The speakers today are Nils Vinge, Jyrki Tervonen and Kristina Stenvinkel. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to today's Chairperson, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's third quarter results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen, and our Head of Communications, Kristina Stenvinkel are with me today and we will answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let's start by commenting on the third quarter. H&amp;M delivered strong results in the third quarter given the demand in market conditions and weak sales. Sales in the quarter reached 23.5 billion, an increase of 13% in Swedish kroner and 3% in local currencies. Sales in comparable units decreased 6%.</p>
          <p>Our sales were negatively affected by restrained consumption in most markets due to continued economic recession, markdown driven competition and unusually warm weather in many parts of Europe particularly towards the end of the quarter. In August, sales decreased 3% in local currencies, while comparable unit sales were down 11%. We are clearly not satisfied with the outcome and our full focus is on improving sales.</p>
          <p>Economic recession and weak sales during the spring made it even more difficult to estimate demand for the third quarter. The markets overall have been markdown driven and H&amp;M's summer sale sold out quickly. As a result, we were left with fewer markdown items in August than the market in general.</p>
          <p>Looking back, we were too cautious on volumes in our purchases of late summer garments and that affected sales negatively especially in August. H&amp;M's custom collections however, were well received in August where the weather was less than warm.</p>
          <p>Gross profit increased 14% to 14.5 billion corresponding to gross margins of 61.6% compared to 60.8% for last year.</p>
          <p>The currency hedges of the internal flow of goods had a positive effect on the gross margin of 60 basis points. Another positive effect of 100 basis points came from the unhedged part of purchases and the time lag of a few days between order and the time of hedging.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, the gross margin has been negatively affected the strengthened U.S. dollar on the purchase price as compared to the same period last year. This has to a large extent been offset by greater spare capacity at suppliers, lower transportation costs, efficiencies in the purchasing processes, etcetera. For commercial reasons, however, H&amp;M chooses not to quantify these factors.</p>
          <p>Increased price reductions had a negative impacted on the gross margin for 100 basis points. H&amp;M maintained a good cost control in the third quarter. Selling and administration costs were 9.8 billion, up 18% in Swedish kroner and 8% in local currencies compared to the third quarter last year. The increase in local currencies was entirely related to our expansion. We successfully countered the effects of the recession by keeping a tight rein on costs and adjusted our store operations to the current market situation. Costs in comparable stores decreased from last year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the quarter rose 18 &#x2013; 8%, sorry to 4.7 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of 20%. Profit after financial items reads close to 4.8 billion, a rise of 4% from last year. Net profit increased around 3.5 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 4.18.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M continues expanding. We opened 23 stores in the third quarter. The majority of the openings took place in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., China and Spain. We closed five stores. H&amp;M is now present in 34 countries with 1,840 stores of which 31 franchise at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Germany, our by far our largest market, developed positively with sales 15% higher in Swedish kroner and 4% in Europe. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark the development was satisfying with sales increases of between three and 8% in local currencies. Further south in France and Spain the situation was considerably tougher with third quarter sales down four and 3% respectively in local currency.</p>
          <p>Demand in the U.S. was still weak and sales declined in local currency in the third quarter. Our expansion plan, however, remains intact and the U.S. is among the markets where we plan to grow the most. Our reach will soon be extended to Florida, where we'll open our first two stores later this autumn. New markets like China, Japan and Russia developed well and according to plan.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M entered Japan last autumn with the most successful openings in the company's history. A year later the interest in H&amp;M remains strong. Since the end of the third quarter we have opened three more stores in Tokyo and their reception shows that there is a great potential in Japan.</p>
          <p>We're also pleased with the development of the franchise operations in the Middle East. This autumn we will open the first H&amp;M store in Lebanon.</p>
          <p>Now a few words on some key figures. The compensation of the stock-in-trade per end of the quarter is considered satisfying. The stock-in-trade increased 29% to 10.2 billion. About half of the rise can be explained by expansion and currency translation effects. The remaining half is related to more goods in transit as a consequence of slightly increased sourcing from Asia, better delivery precision from our suppliers and weak sales towards the end of the quarter. In relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 10.2%, a good level compared to the past two years although slightly higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations was lower at approximately 10.4 billion. The decrease can be explained by lower sales than planned and more investments among other things. We increased investments to 3.7 billion mainly reflecting investments in new stores during the month period. For the full year, our estimate is for investments to reach slightly more than SEK 6 billion. This includes an upward division of the targeted number of stores this year by around 15 and translation effects taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>Our finances remained very strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments were 16.2 billion, down 1.5 billion from last year. Return on equity was 46.8% compared to 50.7. H&amp;M has a very positive view on the opportunities for future expansion. Our target remains to increase the number of stores by 10 to 15% per year with continued high profitability.</p>
          <p>The economic downturn creates business opportunities that H&amp;M has the financial strength to exploit. We have signed contracts for stores at the best locations and at favorable terms that will benefit us for a long time. Therefore, we're speeding up our expansion to 240 stores now from previously planned 225. The new plan includes nine COS stores and a net of 18 new Monki and Weekday stores meaning raised numbers also for these three formats.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we plan to open a total of 150 stores and close 12. The majority of our expansion takes place in the U.S., France, Germany, the U.K. and Italy. We're opening our first store in St. Petersburg already this autumn instead of next year as previously expected. We're opening our first two stores in Florida and four in Tokyo followed by Osaka in 2010. And we're also preparing to expand our reach in Asia to South Korea in 2010. Moreover we will expand our online sales to the U.K. in the autumn of 2010.</p>
          <p>We continue developing H&amp;M Home and tomorrow we are opening our first H&amp;M Home showroom in Stockholm to offer customers the opportunity to look at the latest of H&amp;M Home &#x2013; of our Home products, sorry.</p>
          <p>This autumn we will also open our first Weekday and Monki stores in Germany in Hamburg and Essen and the first Monki stores in Norway in the cities of Oslo and Belgium. The first COS store in Spain will open in Barcelona later this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we want to say that despite tough market conditions we delivered strong results for the third quarter. Clearly we are not happy with the sales and we're focused strongly on improving them. Our target is always to increase sales in comparable years. Based on our strong business concept we will be able to grow with continued high profitability for many, many years to come. We can take H&amp;M to several new markets and there is room to grow also in existing markets, as well as to develop our new formats across H&amp;M Home, Weekday and Monki. We continue investing in order to further improve our customer offer.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We're now happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Company name is Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in London. I just had a question to start with, just wondered if you could clarify your comments when you said that you were too cautious in planning purchasing volumes of summer garments that had a negative impact on sales particularly in August. Does that mean that you were expecting an even worse sales result for the last quarter or did you just simply have the wrong sort of garments in stores, so more of a skew towards at autumn rather than the lighter summer garments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was actually two different components. One that we mentioned was that we afterwards looking to the situation were maybe too aggressive when it comes to the markdowns. And that in connection to too cautious purchases especially for the late summer garments based on a weak sale turnover in the spring. Those two components affected the turnover especially in August.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I just wondered as well if you could comment on September trading. Last year you gave a number I think for the most of September it was 9% sales for September '08. I presume that September has gone better than August. I just wondered if you can talk about how trading in September's gone so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is still, it's one week left of September so unfortunately you will have to wait until the first week of October until we have the figures, so we don't comment on that. But you're right it has been very warm so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line Fraser Ramzan. Please go ahead with your question and announce your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hi there, it's Nomura in London. Just a couple of questions, first of all on the internal hedges, I guess it's been pretty volatile year for you guys, it swings one way then the other. What would you anticipate the trend is going to be through the remainder of the year on internal hedges and also given where currency rates are settling down right now, what is the unhedged side of things looking like, i.e. do you expect that to be less volatile in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the internal hedges as we're stating in the report, all things equal with the currency rates at least level we think it will be a positive effect from the internal hedges also in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can extend with this &#x2013; the comments at cost. Obviously your cost performance was very good in the third quarter. How repeatable do you see that? So was the 2% or so fall in like-for-like cost a function of you reacting to the sales environment and a bit of a one-off? Or do we think that's going to continue through the back end of the year and into early next year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the Group has good cost control on &#x2013; of course that is contributing to this strong report. And we feel that we have a good cost control and when it comes to SG&amp;A expenses we expect to work with that as we always have been doing to have a good hold on the cost control.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then very quickly just finally products, I mean, Nils, you've said multiple times on this call that you're not happy with the sales results and you obviously didn't answer Richard's question about September sales performance. Are we to take away from this that it's not just about whether that actually you're not very happy with the initial product lineup that you have for autumn at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I would say no, it's not at all a matter of the products, it's the other factors as we had mentioned. And actually we have seen in August in places where it was more normal weather that the autumn collections have been well received.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean to be down 20% plus like-for-like in the U.S. is a very, very large number; it does suggest people aren't responding to your product as much as anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right that the sales figures in the U.S. are not very strong, but as I said we focus to improve them, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it has been a very tough market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Robert Miller. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Redburn Partners in London. Can I ask you just to square the circle on the gross margin number that you've given? So gross margin was up 80 year-on-year in Q3, you've given that internal hedging was plus 60 and the timing issues and the unhedged bits were plus 100 and the markdown impact was minus 100. So the residual of those three factors against your reported number is plus 20. And yet the currency you're implying is negative because you've not offset all of the currency. There's a discrepancy there, I'm just wondering what the factors are that tie them all together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are so smart, Robert. No, but seriously as I stated, we think that we have in this environment delivered a very strong result. And of course we are not keen on giving all the details away to the competitors and I think our shareholders respect that we keep those secrets for ourselves a little bit. I hope you respect that, Robert.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask another question then? With regards to your CapEx, there are obviously some retailers out there who are seeing quite aggressive reductions in CapEx even though they continue to open quite a lot of space and feedback from the sort of shop-fitting communities, the retailers who have got massive pricing power at the moment. What sort of reductions on a sort of like-for-like basis for investing in space are you seeing right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the CapEx figure for this year to start with, we think that the CapEx will land somewhere slightly over SEK 6 billion. And of course when we are investing in new stores, refurbishing stores we try to do it as efficiently as possible. That is something that we are working on when we are upgrading our interior and there is a purchase market for sure in a low &#x2013; in a macro environment like this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ultimately, it doesn't appear as though you're getting a lot more value for your kroner in a market where resellers with strong covenants and big balance sheets have got great pricing power, that's really what I'm driving at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we really share the same view there, Robert. What are you basing that on, could you repeat that please, I didn't really follow you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the issue is that, and maybe we should take it offline Nils, that someone like an Inditex is delivering huge swings and it's positive swings in it's CapEx per square foot. And it's not obvious that you're repeating that trick in a environment where you've got massive leverage over the suppliers of that service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but if you look at the figures we have increased in four numbers with 30% this year so far. And the CapEx hasn't gone up that much. And we also &#x2013; as I mentioned we increased our target this year clearly because we haven't seen a lot of interesting opportunities that we have taken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the CapEx is rising, CapEx target is rising as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. But there is, first of all there is a translation effect of course, currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a currency effect of approximately 12, 13%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Okay, fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take that away from the approximately 3.6 billion...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we communicate the CapEx figures in Q4 last year it was based on the balance rate at that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indeed that's quite common, yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Hughes. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everyone. It's Andrew Hughes from UBS in London. Can I just go back to something that you said at the start that your promotions and your price investment were higher than you perhaps should have made them, and that it suggests to me that you perhaps gave margin away unnecessarily in the quarter? I'm just wondering why if you were showing signs of being short of stock you weren't less aggressive on your price investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again it's always easy looking back. But we did &#x2013; the sales in Q2 were not very strong as you remember and so that's partly why we had to increase the sales, the markdowns during the summer. And then when planning for August we were planning for a normal temperature and unfortunately it was much warmer than planned for. And then since we were at the same time cautious with new late summer garments, those two factors together were negative of our interpretation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where you had stock shortages, was it not possible to buy more product from closer to home to replenish? Or was &#x2013; it was just too sudden to be able to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lead times are getting shorter and shorter but perhaps not as that quick that you can react that quickly and we have to plan ahead. But clearly if you look at the stock in trade at the end of the quarter we had volumes to -- going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And generally your comments on the market being more promotional and the consumer being more price aware, are you certain that that is a cyclical issue or are there any structural changes in any of your major markets which may mean that this position doesn't reverse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view is that this is connected especially to this macroeconomical environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Anne Critchlow from SG. Just wondering what sort of like-for-like sales growth you actually bought for the autumn/winter and how much flexibility there is within that to either cancel stock or increase stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always plan for positive like-for-like and perhaps we don't reach that. We have the flexibility of accelerating and decelerating within the season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And what are your thoughts for the spring/summer next year? Do you see consumer demand recovering and do you think you'll be planning to buy more for that season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a stage, but as I said we always plan for positive like-for-like over a season. And we have the possibility to add and to reduce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one quick follow-up please on Andy's question. You say the lead times are getting shorter and shorter. Could you give us an idea of what the average lead time is? I know it's an average of a big range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is in general as you know, but we compare &#x2013; I mean it's from two, three weeks to six months and that's still within that range, so it's very different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the typical lead time would be say, a couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would the typical lead time be say a couple of months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; in order to understand the figures you look at the currency effects. Normally you could look at three to six months ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And naturally we can also affect the lead time depending on the way how we are transporting the goods, where we are placing the orders. Of course we have the flexibility to react.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a combination of very short and longer lead times.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Simon Irwin from Liberum Capital in London. Could you just talk about the performance of your new stores that you've been adding about 14% new space, but the amount of sales in local currency that you appear to be driving from this are kind of well below the levels you've been adding in previous years. I mean, have you got any comment on this? And what's the average size of those new stores, are they broadly in line with your average or are they actually rising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please, one question at a time. But if I remember first question space conversion that you were referring to. First there are two factor &#x2013; main factors. One is that last year we had online and catalogue sales in Germany and Austria and like in the total figures, but not with like-for-like, that's one factor.</p>
          <p>The other factor is that, of course, the bulk of the expansion is in country markets like the U.S., U.K., France, Italy and Spain where markets are very tough at the moment. But of course new stores are also affected by the market conditions. Second regarding sizes, no difference really to the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And could I just ask you a follow-up, how do you feel about cost at the moment? You're opening new stores, but not at a particularly rapid rate, I mean is it still in trial phase or &#x2013; and could you expect to accelerate the expansion at a later stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're happy with the developments, which is in line with our expectations. This year we're opening nine stores instead of eight as previously planned, taking costs to a new market, Spain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good afternoon. This is SEB Enskilda from Stockholm. I'd just like to ask you Nils on the inventory composition, you've obviously stated that you're satisfied. But would it still be a fair assumption to say that there are slightly higher share of older goods and garments in the inventory when &#x2013; as apposed to when you did the same comment coming out of fiscal Q2?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Take one at a time, please.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Can you tell us &#x2013; you talked in general terms about the composition of the inventory increase, can you tell us what the like-for-like inventory is up in local currency, that's the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In local currency, excuse me. Just a second.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's slight &#x2013; if you're referring to like-for-like stores and the inventory levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a second, we will look at that figure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's quite near flat, it's a little bit more than last year, but no dramatical.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's slightly up, yeah? Okay, right well come back to me when you've got the answer to that one. But in terms of the ordering for the balance of the autumn/winter season, it just strikes me that bearing in mind your comments about warm weather and the fact that you have got sort of inventory up in the like-for-like branches, that you might have to adjust your ordering again. I mean I'm just wondering how you're sort of gauging the type of order quantities you need to make in this part of the season which is a lot more important than the bit you've just come through. Could you give us some sort of view on that? I mean how it ties to your running the inventory now in terms of the ongoing buying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Tony. I don't really follow your question. You have the outgoing inventory, and then I lost you somewhere.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, what I'm interested in is you're going into a season with inventory which is on a like-for-like basis flat to slightly up. You've got a difficult start to this quarter probably because of the weather. And I just wondered what, bearing in mind how cautious you've been in terms of buying inventory for the last quarter, how cautious you're being on buying inventory for the forthcoming Christmas season, winter/Christmas season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I think I understand the question. Of course we are very cautious in this environment. But as I've said many times, over a season we always plan going forward for a positive like-for-like because if we don't do that we will never be able to reach it. But we have a very good flexibility. It could always be even better, of course, but in season to accelerate and decelerate the volumes. So I can't really quantify more than sell, but we are focusing a lot on this at this moment of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So at what point during the season will you have to cut back on your ordering if as looks like that you aren't going to hit positive like-for-like in this quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Paul Smiddy from HSBC in London. A couple of questions. First one, I know about the slow rollouts of the COS format. Can you give us a measure to what degree it dilutes operating margins across the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, our opinion is that it's not slow. We added nine stores this year on the base of 18. So that's actually, so we think it's a pretty good acceleration and it's really according to plan. So it's still of course compared to the total it's a very, very small part. So it &#x2013; you can't really see it diluting the figures in the total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, put another way, are its operating margins lower or higher than the core chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know we do not comment on specific concepts within the Group. But we are happy with the development and it's going according to plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, you mentioned in relation to explaining the stock movement that you'd done a little more sourcing from Asia. Can you give us a feel for what percentage that's moved from and to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that we have, as I said, we have increased sourcing in Asia but we'd prefer not to give the exact figure, and this is a figure that varies over time. But at this moment it's just slightly higher than the last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>By a couple of percentage points or so?</p>

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in London again. Just a couple of follow-ups if I may, please. Just first of all, just wondering if you can elaborate on your comment about the stock going up again in the quarter partly because of better delivery precision from suppliers. What do you exactly mean by that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, several components for the increased stock-in-trade. And as we've stated one is of course the weak selling in the late part of the quarter, but also that we have slightly increased purchases from Asia, which by the fall we will mean that the transportation, that time of delivery will be much earlier than from our market for instance in Europe. So the increased goods in transit part will of course increase the stock level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's basically is earlier shipments of product this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. With the same in shop week, it's adding slightly more in Asia that means that the time of delivery...</p>

          <p>I'm with you. And just second, can you just comment on how you're sort of doing in France, because it looks like a particularly weak market, it's now obviously much more important market for H&amp;M? I know that the market's been quite difficult, but are you happy with your offer there, how the expansion is going, any particular comments on the French market?</p>

When in fact an awful lot of companies appear to have been incredibly disciplined with supply going into the clearance period. Which markets have been most markdown driven? Because it certainly doesn't appear that it's been very negative in some of the bigger markets to gross margin elsewhere?</p>

          <p>We have a follow up question from the line of Andrew Hughes. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's UBS again from London. Just a follow-up again on Robert's question on pricing. Where you say that there's a 100 basis point impact from higher price reductions, does that include markdowns or is it just the extra promotions within the early part of the season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's also markdowns, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So given that markdowns, how you define markdowns were sharply down year-on-year, your actual price reinvestment was a lot more than the 100 basis points, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you rephrase your question so I understand it again, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm saying in the statement you say that end of season markdowns were a lot lower year-on-year. So do we take it that a lot of that price reinvestment was just your promotions partway through the season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not quite sure I understand. What we're saying is that we increased our markdowns compared to last year and they affected the gross margin with 100 basis points more this year than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, right, it was mainstream markdowns then. And there's just one final follow-up. I mean on the internal hedge, have you decided whether to continue or discontinue that internal hedging policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't decided that. We continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, but it's &#x2013; so you definitely will continue or you may decide to &#x2013; not to do it any more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As with everything as I said in the last conference call, we always look to improve things, but there are no concrete plans to change anything right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our follow-up question from the line of Tony Shiret. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company and location.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, still at Credit Suisse, still in London. I've just got a couple small questions. First of all in the past you've told us what your ASPs were, movement of ASPs during the quarter year-on-year, maybe across the whole of the sales base, but also the full price ASPs. That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My answer is then that on comparable items units it's same level, but the total ASP is slightly up due to mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's on full price, yeah? That's on full price you just commented on, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the slightly up is what, low single-digits or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Come on, you have to do something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You could just give us a number and make all this a lot easier. The second question is just to relieve this general sort of thing, but I just wonder if you could remind us where you are on the last of your Pan-European warehouses? There's one meant to be happening in Southern Europe sometime isn't there, from memory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are. We opened the German <mark type="inaudible" /> last summer. And we are preparing to open the larger one in Belgium which will be up and running 2011 something. And we're already expanding the one in Poznan in Poland.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Brilliant. Thank you for your help.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Sirs, there appear to be no further questions at this time. So I'll hand the conference back to you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for participating in this conference call. You're welcome back for our full year results in January.</p>
