        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our Q2 conference call. First, I would like to focus on the highlights of the second quarter of 2012, and then Carsten Knobel, our new CFO, will provide you with the financial detail &#x2013; financials in greater detail. After that, I'll comment on the outlook for 2012, and finally, we'll take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by reminding everyone that the presentation which contains the usual formal disclaimer for forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation can be accessed via our website at henkel.com\ir. The presentation and discussion are conducted subject to the disclaimer. We will not the read the disclaimer but propose we take it as it's read into the records and for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Now let me get on. I will start with the key developments in the second quarter of 2012. Overall, we are well on track to hit our targets for the full year. Following organic growth of 4.7% in the first quarter, we came in at 4.0% in the second, making first half at 4.3%, at the upper range of our guidance of 3% to 5%. Following adjusted EBIT of 13.7%, we came in very strongly at 14.5% on the margin side in the second, making our year-to-date performance in 2012 at 14.1%. For the first time, we're now running above the target that we set ourselves for 2012 and we remain our guidance on the margin side for 2012 at 14%.</p>
          <p>After strong performance on EPS, we've taken the EPS guidance up from 10% to approximately 15% for the year. So overall, a very good quarter that puts us right in the middle of our fall targets.</p>
          <p>What do we believe went well? We saw a significant increase in our gross margin. The adjusted EBIT margin came in very strongly at 14.5%. The emerging markets continues to be strong. Eastern Europe with reinforced growth momentum and we're also seeing a strong Middle East. However, I just do want to reiterate that while we see double-digit growth in the Middle East, it was slightly impacted in the second quarter last year due to the political unrest. But still very strong performance.</p>
          <p>We continued to make progress on our net working capital driving free cash into the company. And we continued our optimization of our portfolio which I'll speak a bit about later in my presentation.</p>
          <p>What did not go quite as well ahead as expectations? We saw further intensified headwind in Southern Europe making the overall Europe number flat but negative in Southern Europe. Our Electronics business continued to be negative but with very strong margin performance. And growth in Latin America is slowing and Carsten will be addressing in his presentation.</p>
          <p>How did it go from the business groups? We saw strong organic sales growth in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business and our adjusted EBIT margin strongly increased. Just to be clear on this, it was best ever top line and the best ever bottom line quarter for our Laundry &amp; Home Care business.</p>
          <p>We saw double-digit growth in the emerging markets supported by solid mature markets. We continue despite or because of the increase in margin to see market share gains, and the driver for growth and for profitability with our innovation portfolio. So overall, strong sales and earnings performance from our Laundry &amp; Home Care business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our Cosmetics business, we saw solid organic growth and adjusted margin was further improved. Again, similar to our detergents business, best ever top line and best ever bottom line for our Cosmetics and Toiletries business this quarter.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets were very strong. Mature markets were flat. We saw further market share gains. And again, as was with our detergents business, our key innovations helped drive the improvements on the top line and the bottom line which continued our strong profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Coming to our Adhesives division. We saw solid organic sales growth and adjusted EBIT margin strongly increased. I'm happy to be able to repeat for the third time today, best ever top line, best ever bottom line. What I want to do want to reiterate around this is with our revenue growth slightly lower than the first quarter, we hit a 15.7% margin. That does show the quality of earnings we now have in our Adhesive business. We are much more focused on value versus volume.</p>
          <p>We saw strong growth in our emerging markets supported by continuous good performance of our North American business. Our Electronic Adhesives business on the growth side is negative, on the bottom line very positive. Again, further market share gains. And I'm repeating myself for the first two, our focus on innovation is helping value improvements on both top and bottom line. So overall solid sales growth and strong increase in profitability.</p>
          <p>I believe, and that's why we're reiterating it, our increased focus on innovation over the last number of years and with our high innovation rates, it does help us push pricing through in a market that is increasingly difficult. So that's why it is very important for us that we continue to bring consumer relevant innovation into the market every quarter to ensure that the appropriate pricing takes place. And at the same time we can defend and expand our market share positions.</p>
          <p>On our portfolio, we will have and will continue in the future to optimize our portfolio and clean up our non-strategic or highly dilutive businesses. We have exited a number of selected businesses in our Adhesive business. Among those are our emulsion business and our PVC business. We've divested seven non-core brands in our Cosmetics and Toiletries business in the U.S. Some of these have impact on our organic growth where Carsten will continue &#x2013; will comment on.</p>
          <p>And as we announced earlier in the second quarter, the acquisition of the high-performance pressure sensitive adhesives from Cytec was agreed in the second quarter and was closed last night. That deal is now formalized and will be in our numbers for the third quarter. So we are focusing ongoing on the quality of our portfolio to drive up the <mark type="ph" /> quarter (6:55) earnings. It might have over time also top line indications but we believe that we need to get the right balance between top and bottom line, and that's why you're seeing the tremendous progress we are now seeing in the profitability of our company.</p>
          <p>What does the numbers look like? We came out at &#x20AC;4.206 billion versus &#x20AC;3.953 billion in the same quarter last year. Reported growth of 6.4%, organic so cleaned for, or adjusted for acquisitions, divestments; and currency came in at 4% growth. Our adjusted margin went from 46.1% to 47.6%, up 150 basis points, very strong margin improvement due to a number of points that Carsten also will be addressing.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted EBIT went up 18.6% from &#x20AC;514 million to &#x20AC;609 million. Adjusted EBIT margin went from 13.0% to 14.5%, up another 150 basis points. Our adjusted EPS, the performance per share went up almost 23% and our net working capital went from 8.4% to 7.5%, down 90 basis points. So we're well on track for reaching our fiscal year 2012 guidance with a strong performance in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Carsten to comment more on the quarter in detail.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Kasper. I will take over from here and guide you now through the financials for Q2 2012. Let's start with an overview of our sales growth figures on the second quarter of this year and first looking at Henkel. We have seen a total organic growth of 4.0% mainly driven by price of 3.7% but also volumes were up by 0.3%. Please keep in mind that we have changed our definition concerning innovation effects, which from Q1 2012 accounted as a price effect, as a volume effect before.</p>
          <p>To give you a snapshot on our three divisions. Laundry &amp; Homecare came in with a strong organic growth of 5.1%, Cosmetics and Toiletries with a solid performance of 2.8% and Adhesive Technologies once again with a solid performance of 3.6%.</p>
          <p>Let's go a little bit more into the details of the divisions and looking first at our Laundry &amp; Homecare business. 5.1% is the organic sales growth with a healthy split of 3.9% up in price and 1.2% in rising volumes. All regions were contributing to this strong performance. The emerging markets here again after Q1 contributing with a double-digit growth. And Western Europe, despite the ongoing weaknesses, especially in Southern Europe as well as North America, have been positive. If you look on the two segments, Laundry came in with a solid growth and Home Care even stronger with a strong development.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Cosmetics and Toiletries, we witnessed another solid sales performance with an organic growth of 2.8%. And especially if you keep in mind that we have high comparables in the Q2 of last year with more than 5%. It was mainly driven by price with an effect of 2.5% and also volumes were positive with 0.3%.</p>
          <p>Also in Cosmetics, all regions contributed to the solid performance. Our emerging markets showed the strongest performance and here especially our business in China came up with a high organic growth rate. In our mature markets, as in Laundry &amp; Home Care, Western Europe and North America showed the positive development throughout the last quarter. In terms of the segments, retail showed a solid growth where the hair salon business was flat.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies delivered a solid organic growth of 3.6%, which is composed of 4.1% regarding pricing and the slightly negative effect regarding volume of 0.5%. Here, it is important to note and Kasper already did mention it before and we also communicated it in our Q1 call that we continue to optimize our portfolio mix by expanding high margin segments where there is high volume.</p>
          <p>And following this path, we conducted selected exits in certain businesses in Asia. For example, we mentioned the emulsion business in China to strengthen our profitability. Excluding these strategic moves, our organic sales growth would be more higher and therefore also our volume figures would have been positive. To be a little bit more precise, this accounts for around 100 basis points in terms of growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, from a regional perspective, we have seen strong sales performance in our emerging markets mainly driven by double-digit growth in Middle East and Africa and also in Eastern Europe. Concerning our mature markets, North America contributed with a strong growth.</p>
          <p>If you look &#x2013; or have a look under segments, Transport and Metal were the strongest growth, also all other segments with a positive growth. However, as Kasper said, Electronic Adhesives were below the prior year.</p>
          <p>So looking back at Henkel, we have seen a total in positive sales growth of 6.4%. This development has been positively influenced by FX effect here in all three divisions, and the main contributors to that are the U.S. dollar, the Chinese renminbi and the Japanese yen. And with that we delivered a 2.9% growth without the FX effect. Adjusted for A&amp;D effects, which are amounting 110 basis points, our organic sales growth came in as alluded before with 4.0%.</p>
          <p>Once again, to this organic sales performance, all businesses contributed mainly driven by our emerging markets with a very strong growth. And despite ongoing market challenges, this growth has been supported also by our mature markets in the positive sense.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to our development in terms of sales growth by region. We have seen that all regions besides Western Europe contributed to that growth. Western Europe with a share of around one-third of our total sales showed flat development despite the increasing weakness in Southern Europe. To be a little bit more specific, the headwinds in Southern Europe intensified throughout the last quarter, affecting our Industrial businesses stronger than our HPC businesses. Again, Eastern Europe showed strong sales performance with 7.9% organic growth, whereas Africa/Middle East with 14.1% came in stronger with a double digit growth.</p>
          <p>Our North American business was contributing with a solid growth within the sluggish consumer client. And finally, let me comment on Asia, 4.5%, solid sales performance with double digit contribution from our Cosmetics and Toiletries business as mentioned before.</p>
          <p>So with that, we have in total our emerging markets where we have a satisfied &#x2013; very satisfied development with 8.1% organic growth, and leading to 43% as a share of total sales. All in all, we recognized very strong growth in our emerging markets and particularly, Laundry &amp; Home Care came in with a double digit growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now come back to Latin America. In this respect, we did not meet our expectations. We have a very heterogeneous picture, on the one side, Mexico with a very strong sales performance and here it's supported in all three business divisions.</p>
          <p>Negatively, Cosmetics and Toiletries, which was impacted negatively by political instability in Venezuela. Being more specific, we have here restrictions in order to increase our prices. And the other point where we're still not satisfied is our Adhesives business in Brazil, where we are below the previous year due to two reasons, on the one side, slowing industrial demand and on the other side, we are also not happy with our development in our consumer business within Brazil.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Europe, we saw organic strong sales performance and good momentum compared to Q1. And here particularly, to be mentioned Russia, a double-digit growth supported in this quarter by all business divisions. And to close in Asia emerging markets business especially China, showed the strong growth compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>By that, I would like to move our adjusted EBIT by business sector. And here first of all, the return on sales, adjusted return on sales of our Laundry &amp; Home Care business increased significantly by 150 basis points, now to a level of 14.5%. Our Cosmetics and Toiletry business once again further improved their margin by 30 basis points, now reaching 14.4% in Q2.</p>
          <p>And also, the Adhesives business as the Laundry &amp; Home Care business have been able to increase their adjusted EBIT margin by 150 basis points, reaching now an all-time high of 15.7% in terms of adjusted EBIT margin. This leads for total Henkel, a strong improvement, our adjusted &#x2013; of our adjusted return on sales, up by 150 basis points and now being at 14.5% for the quarter. We counterattacked higher input costs by pricing. And as Kasper alluded to that, especially by ongoing innovation initiatives. Another impact has been the shift in our portfolio, especially to be mentioned Adhesives business but also the divestment of our non-core brands in the U.S. towards higher margin segments and to higher margins in total. Furthermore, ongoing measures to avoid and to reduce costs and enhancing efficiency contributed to this performance of 14.5% for Henkel in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now on the income statement adjustment and here, sales to gross profit. In particular and noteworthy, was our continued improvement in gross margins by 150 basis points now to a level of 47.6%. This was also up compared to Q1 of this year where we had 47.1% so up by 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>Going a little bit into the details, this was achieved despite a negative impact of incoming costs of around approximately 200 basis points versus the previous year quarter. Maybe I'll remind you, in Q1 we faced 400 basis points increase, now with 200 basis points.</p>
          <p>All in all, we have seen by that a deceleration concerning the input cost inflation compared to 11% and also to the Q1 of year 2012. The implementation of strong countermeasures and the disciplined execution allowed us to overachieve and support the margin increase in Q2.</p>
          <p>As the speed of rising, direct material has decelerated as I pointed out, in Q2 over the peak that we have faced in Q3 of last year, we now foresee an increase in the low-single digits for the whole year. With this, while we also updated our guidance of the direct materials from mid-single digits which we had until now. But on the other side, we continue to remain vigilant on the development of direct material prices.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now to sales to adjusted EBIT. Here I would like &#x2013; well we have several improvements here but I would like to highlight and point out two; one is marketing, selling and distribution expenses and the other is the administrative expenses.</p>
          <p>Let's have a first look on marketing, selling and distribution expenses. Here, we saw a slight decrease in relative terms by 20 basis points. <mark type="ph" /> We marked it (20:34) that the marketing investment increased compared to the previous year quarter but also compared to Q1 2012 in absolute terms as well as in relative terms. With that, we keep on investing strongly in our brands and as well as our launches of innovations to secure on the one side our sustainable top line growth but also on the other hand, to expand our market positions.</p>
          <p>In parallel, our selling and distribution costs went down in relative terms. And thereby you see a slight decrease as I pointed out before of the 20 basis points in total for marketing, selling and distribution expenses.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the administrative expenses, here we saw it further went down of 30 basis points, main contributor to that is our development in our shared services, the expansion of that and by that also having high cost discipline throughout the whole company.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our reported to adjusted EBIT development. We saw a very satisfying reported EBIT of &#x20AC;583 million in total being up by 8.5% compared to the previous year quarter. Our adjusted EBIT was even up further with an improvement of 18.6% now reaching &#x20AC;609 million compared to the &#x20AC;514 million which we reached in Q2 2011.</p>
          <p>In total as you see, there is not a significant number of adjustments that we have experienced this quarter. The restructuring volume of &#x20AC;26 million which is mentioned here, as we note the previous year quarter of &#x20AC;34 million is in line with our expectations for the full year. After the half year, we have &#x20AC;39 million and we expect as guided before around &#x20AC;100 million for the full year. And the main part of the &#x20AC;26 million is our &#x2013; or the biggest portion of that are investments to facilitate our shared services development.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we are continuously pursuing the strategy to adapt our structures to the market and as we further optimize our manufacturing footprint to be close to our customers and also to increase our share of &#x2013; of our share in our emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Now next, I would like to turn to our development of net working capital. Kasper alluded to that, it is another highlight in this quarter as we reached 7.5%. But as you can see from the chart, I think it's very important for us also to look into the individual divisions due to the fact we have also slightly different business models. And if you look at that performance, we are very satisfied with the development in all three businesses who are contributing to the performance of our quarter, and all the three divisions are best-in-class compared to their peers.</p>
          <p>Laundry &amp; Home Care in that respect showed another very good performance reaching minus 1.5%; Cosmetics and Toiletries further improved their net working capital now to a level of 3.5% and also Adhesives lowered their figures and came in with 14.5%</p>
          <p>Moving now to our net debt development. It is our capability here to generate cash and this is also shown in the net debt development. And before giving you the figures, please keep in mind that we adapted our net debt definition as alluded in Q1 also now including marketable securities and term deposits beside cash and cash equivalents.</p>
          <p>With this pretext we saw that compared to the previous year we have been able to reduce our net debt by &#x20AC;690 million now to a level of &#x20AC;1.269 billion. And there's a slight increase compared to Q1 as you can see that on the chart, but as you know, we have made the dividend payment in Q2 of &#x20AC;342 million impacting for sure this development.</p>
          <p>By that, as you can see, the main driver to lower our net debt is our cash flow generation. And I would like to highlight again that we are very focused on our cash generation which you can see from the table. We improved the cash flow from operating activities significantly now to a level of &#x20AC;444 million, up by &#x20AC;171 million compared to the Q2 of 2011. But also our development in free cash flow now more than doubling to &#x20AC;330 million shows our ability to generate cash and this is something where we will also focus in the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I'm at the end of the details of the financials of Q2 2012 and thereby, I would like to hand over again to Kasper.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carsten and let me just summarize the second quarter, maybe just spend a couple of minutes on the trading environment because I know the questions will come up.</p>
          <p>Overall, we continued a very positive development, despite the current macroeconomic challenges. And the challenges that we're seeing were and will remain at this stage within the Euro zone. You can see that in our numbers. So we had a flat business in our Western European business with a negative business in Southern Europe for our Industrial business, similar to what we've seen in previous crisis years, and we do not expect that situation to substantially improve for the second half of the year. That is not part of our assumption.</p>
          <p>Besides that, we see solid performance and solid business environments across the board. North America remain unchanged, strong. South America, Carsten alluded to it with the restrictions we have in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>But Brazil was partially market driven and partially performance driven. And as in the previous past, we're very open about, where we're not happy, we're not content with our performance in our Adhesives business, more particularly in the consumer part of our Adhesives business in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe remains strong, Middle East strong, Asia also strong with very slight decline in China, a marginal decline, but still very strong business environment in China and in Indonesia, in Vietnam, et cetera. However, we do not expect that the market environment will improve in the second half and we expect it would further deteriorate. It is under those conditions we've also changed the outlook "upwards".</p>
          <p>We continue to see a successful performance driven by our emerging markets both on top and bottom line and supported by our mature markets, particularly North America in this context. All our financial KPIs are on track to reach our FY guidance and our adjusted EBIT margin of 14.5% came in despite the market environment and not because of the market environment. We believe that the market environment deteriorated further in the second quarter versus the first quarter and so it was despite that.</p>
          <p>For Henkel as a total, we are running now at 14.1% for the first half, right at the guidance we have given for the full year. We'll continue the exit portfolio management to ensure that we improve the quality not only of the business and the earnings. That was very clear to see on our adhesives business with a growth rate of 3.6% and a margin of 15.7%. Had we looked upon this three to four years ago, we would have been substantially more exposed on the bottom line with a lower growth rate. Now we were able to substantially improve our bottom line with 150 basis points.</p>
          <p>We will, as Kasper said, continue to adapt the structures to the market. We've done that in the first &#x2013; in the past number of years and if you go ahead and look upon, one of the numbers that we look very carefully at is our overall population within the group. And that is almost 1,000 people less in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. That is the primary driver of cost and we manage that line very, very diligently.</p>
          <p>We believe we can continue to scale the business with a very tight focus on our cost. We're fully committed to reach our 2012 targets, which gets me to the guidance; top line 3% to 5% unchanged, adjusted margin of 14% unchanged, adjusted EPS up from above 10% to approximately 15% at this stage. So we're confirming our guidance for our financial targets. However, we're taking our EPS guidance up from 10% growth to 15% growth.</p>
          <p>We believe we're well prepared for delivering a successful 2012 and beyond. We continue to shift our business to the emerging markets that now contribute to 43% of our business. We have strong mature markets. We're making substantial progress in shared services. You see that in our P&amp;L. Carsten articulated that, and you will see that when we report also, it's something that will accompany us for the next three years.</p>
          <p>We continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint. By the end of the year, we'll be opening the largest manufacturing plant for adhesives in China. And we're just in the process of significantly expanding our manufacturing capacity for our detergents business in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>We continue to strengthen our top brands and reduce our brands. Strengthening our top brands drives our capability to drive pricing into the marketplace and defend our market positions. And the reduction of our brands allows us to spend more per brand because each brands get that higher absolute and relative spend. And you saw that in our Cosmetics business where we will continue to reduce the number of brands and sell off brands that are either non-strategic or significantly margin dilutive to our business.</p>
          <p>The current management plays a big role within Henkel. Carsten sitting at the first time at the table, we have now changed our management team completely since 2008 with the exception of Hans, who runs our Cosmetics business, and myself. We have a vision and value statement we <mark type="ph" /> defined and changed (31:07) that we're very focused on.</p>
          <p>We have a new sustainability strategy put in place by the end of last year that ensures that we will maintain and defend our leadership position we have in sustainability. And while executing very diligently in 2012, we're spending the appropriate time in putting the right strategy in place for the company beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>Which brings me to the upcoming events, we'll have the Investor Day for our Laundry &amp; Home Care business on September 4 here in D&#xFC;sseldorf and along with the communication of our third quarter results, we will also, as you know, reveal our strategy and targets beyond 2012. That will take place on November 16 and similar to our disclosure of our strategy in 2008, that will take place in London, similar to that.</p>
          <p>I hope many of you will not only join us here in D&#xFC;sseldorf for our Investor Day for Laundry &amp; Home Care, but also for our strategy day in London, November 16, accompanied with the third quarter numbers. For this, we'll come to the end and Carsten and I will be happy to take the details of your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Rorsted. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. My first question is on pricing. We've seen a slight deceleration in Q2 versus Q1. And you started to raise your pricing in the third quarter of last year. Now, you show in your presentation that you are lowering your input cost guidance from mid-single digit to low-single digits. So I am expecting that probably, your input cost is becoming a tailwind in the second half. And my question is therefore, should we expect pricing to further slowdown in the next quarter potentially becoming negative?</p>
          <p>Second question is on China, could you please tell us what was the like-for-like in China in Q1 and in Q2? I understood that you said slightly negative and wasn't sure whether that included your slight disposal there. How do you feel the market growth is in China and do you feel &#x2013; is this appropriate versus the plant that you will be opening later this year? You said it's the biggest plant you have in the group. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On pricing, while we expect a slight still in the second half, we're not expecting pricing to be negative in the short term. On China, while we are seeing &#x2013; continue to see growth in China, my point was more that we've seen a slight deterioration or de-acceleration on the GDP side. So we continue to see substantial growth in China. It is down &#x2013; the growth rates are down, from the previous quarter to be very clear, but we still continue to see very strong growth rates. We are opening the largest manufacturing plant as I said in China by the end of the year. That will serve predominantly to 80% to 90% share of the Chinese market and we've already approved the second phase investment that will take another year to put in place.</p>
          <p>So you can see our confidence in China remains and is still very high. Depending on different sources, GDP growth goes between 7.5% to 8.5%. It is down from the previous year but we remain quite confident on our position in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible to have your like-for-like in China? Because I saw that your Asia-Pac went from more than 8% in Q1 to 4.5% in Q2? And I was wondering whether that was China driven?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not possible to get like-for-like.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Harold Thompson from Deutsche Bank AG. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just got two questions. The first one is also on Adhesives, you basically stated that you're exiting kind of lower margin businesses there and that has hurt your organic growth in the Adhesives business by about 100 basis points. I'd guess that's all a volume impact. How long have you been, I guess, doing that and therefore kind of keeping the growth rate of that division slightly lower than we would have thought? And should we expect that trend to continue, and I guess therefore for volumes to remain impacted by that strategy?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the Cosmetics business. Well, it has slowed quite a bit, and you're right to point out that the comp was quite high, but it was no different really to the first quarter. And I can't quite see which area or region has slowed. From your text, it appears it's Eastern Europe, but I just want to know what's really driving the slower growth there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding adhesives, the 100 basis points which I mentioned are as you're indicating 100% related to volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we started with the portfolio topics which I mentioned in Q1 2012, and this will for sure continue through the whole year of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the Cosmetics and the slowdown. Once again, the 3.8% is a solid growth and it's also impacted by the reducing growth in the market. But in terms of, as you pointed, while we are not 100% satisfied. We want to get in on the one side, the Latin America topic which I alluded regarding Venezuela and also our professional hair salon business which I pointed out, it's not in line with what our expectations are. And these are the main drivers why our business is not in the magnitude in terms of growth  as you have seen it before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, excellent. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just an expansion on the U.S. side, it's correct that our Adhesives, it's correct what Carsten was saying. But what you will be looking upon, the one year that Carsten alluded to is correct for the businesses we reported here. But we will continue to do an ongoing "adjustment" in our portfolio and you should continue &#x2013; you should expect to see that on an ongoing basis. It's very important for us because part of our strategy is managing the value and not necessarily volume.</p>
          <p>But we want to make certain that we continue to deliver a sustainable improvement, not only in absolute EBIT but also relative EBIT. So we'll do that in a balanced way but we'll continue to separate ourselves from businesses that over time have no strategic fit or have substantial dilution to our profitability. We will disclose that as it comes here. We will guide for what is the impact. We believe it's the right thing to do and I think you can see that in the quality of the earnings with 15.7% margin on a 3.6% growth rate. And that is what we will continue to focus on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the same also, by the way in the Cosmetics side where we got rid of seven brands in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on your Adhesives, just &#x2013; because I didn't quite understand your answer to Celine. I seem to think that you're basically saying that input costs will be easier in the second half clearly than the first half. But do I correctly interpret that you expect pricing in Adhesives to stay high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I said, I do &#x2013; it's not expected to go negative. That's what I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it will slow but it will just not go negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But of course, we don't &#x2013; we're living actually in the world but our current expectation is that it will not go negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Martin R&#xF6;diger from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. First is on the impressive improvement on the gross margin by 150 basis points. Can you quantify how much of that came from cost savings, how much from efficiency improvement, how much from higher selling price increase versus raw material cost inflation and how much from mix effects on the back of innovations?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on currency impact. Obviously according to your report, the impact on EBIT was also similar to the impact on sales it was 3.5%. Did your rule of thumb for the U.S. <mark type="ph" /> store (40:16) impact change because obviously besides the dollar there were also renminbi and yen, the reasons for the positive impact on the EBIT? And have you any currency hedgings in place which implies that the bigger impact from the currencies on the EBIT level is to come on later when these hedgings are running out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Martin, I'll take the first question and Carsten will clarify to the extent that we can on the second question. We don't specify and breakdown the improvement that we've had in our margin improvement neither the EBIT or on the <mark type="ph" /> GB1 (40:56) side. But basically what you can look upon it's a mix of many. We've had increased raw material pricing as we indicated but pricing is going up, so pricing is clearly one driver. Manufacturing footprint is the second driver, third overall cost structure, the 1,000 people I alluded to was the third driver.</p>
          <p>So it is a mix of the many. And then of course innovation, while we continue to innovate and strive more value versus volume and that's why it's not looking upon particularly on the U-A side where it is much more attractive for us to sell tons of Loctite products with a very, very high price instead of 10 tons of some other products with a very low price. So it's a mix of the many. We don't break them down and we continue to manage of course the different elements. And each of the elements have their position. Right now, of course raw materials does play one but it's a mix of the many.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding your second question, regarding currencies. First of all, our transaction risk is relatively low and therefore we have no major currency hedges which we execute. And regarding the FX effect which I pointed out, the main deviations are, as I've said, USA, that means dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, but also in a negative way Venezuelan Bolivar, the Brazilian real, and the Polish zloty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your rule of thumb for the dollar impact is unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I was just &#x2013; firstly, on Adhesives, it would be helpful if you could give some color over the performance of Adhesives in Asia Pacific in the second quarter and how that compares to the first quarter and the sort of trend that you're expecting in the second half?</p>
          <p>Second question if I may which was that you, you've talked about how you're not happy with your performance in various sort of sub-segments of your Latin American business. It would be interesting to hear about any sort of actions that you either have to take and or expect to be taking in the near future, to try to improve performance there. And just lastly, if I may, in sort of Cosmetics, personal care, obviously innovation has been a helpful driver recently. Just some sort of comments over your innovation pipeline, and what sort of shape that's in for the second half relative to the first half? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the two last questions and Carsten will take the other question, starting with the very last question. As Carsten indicated, we believe on the U.K. side, I'll start with our Cosmetics business. The primary driver of slow down  has been our professional business, which is particularly very impacted when you have volatile economic environments. And our professional businesses at this stage frankly don't expect any real difference in that business in the second quarter. Now we are moving forward , because it's very closely related to the economic climate.</p>
          <p>Venezuela, as Venezuela I believe you've seen other companies with that scenario so we actually don't believe our growth rate at this stage is very much related to the portfolio that we have or the innovation rate. <mark type="ph" /> At this range of portfolio and (44:32) our innovation rate is related to professional. And to Venezuela.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Brazil, we are in &#x2013; we did participate in this growth, we try to be very transparent about when we believe market is the reason and when we believe we are the reason. We will as is very similar to other areas, take appropriate management action and we have to report back in our next call. But rest assured that we will take similar actions in the markets that don't perform as we've done in the past in order to fix it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, regarding your question regarding U-A Adhesives in Asia Pacific. As I pointed out the portfolio impacts which we had are for sure, especially the margin business impacting Asia and therefore, also impacting our growth. Because as I pointed out, it's an exit and therefore, it's a part of our organic development. We are, independent of that, we are satisfied and the Q2 results are only moderately slower than or slowing down compared to Q1 but in all in all a satisfying development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And the trend for the second half based on what you see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unchanged in that respect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify something on the Adhesives business please. You're explaining that the pricing effect will be less positive in the second half. And you also have the ongoing impact of the disposal on volume, yet you stepped up your guidance to mid-single digit organic sales growth. And I was just wondering if you could just help us understand what's accelerating in this current environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what we are seeing is that we continue to make our costs very, very tight. We're getting a bit leeway on our raw materials as Carsten indicated. And if you just do the share calculation it's coming out early on with a stronger P&amp;L and that's why we think that we'll get the EPS upside.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Robert Waldschmidt from Bank of America ML. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions if I may. In terms of the price volume, the definitional switch, can you just clarify whether you've also restated the base? And if there's anything we should be aware of there? And then within the volumes, I know you've said that you're halfway through the year, you've had only two quarters now of exit impact from these low margin/high volume Adhesives contracts. Can you quantify the impact we can expect for the full year? Is it circa 100 basis points in that regard?</p>
          <p>And then second question, the margin's running around 14.1% at the first half stage, target's 14% for the year, is there anything in second half other than the aforementioned economic situation that would lead us to believe that it should be anything lower than 14.1%? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be 14.0% because that's the guidance at this stage. Right now, we know we work very hard on where we are today. I think that if you look upon the current economic climate, it is so volatile and so difficult to predict. And you have changes not only in the Euro zone but also the Middle East. We are focusing very, very seriously on the 14.0%. If 14.1% comes out, then 14.1% comes out. But right now it's the 14.0% that we're focusing on.</p>
          <p>And that is under the current market trading divisions. They have significantly deteriorated over the last four to six quarters. And in spite of that, so right now we're not focusing on the upside. We're focusing on being predictable in the marketplace and delivering 3% to 5%, and 14% growth on the --14% market.</p>
          <p>Let me just before Carsten goes to the price/volume, just be very clear on the volume part of the U-A business. The U-A business is almost misleading when you start looking upon the volume because we compare things that were shipped in tons and we compare things we're shipping in drops.</p>
          <p>And the more volume you get, the more volume intensity you get, the more commodity-like you get. We are very, very deliberately for the last couple of years focusing more and more, on products that have a technology differentiation. And technology differentiation means in almost all aspects, less volume. So what you will see &#x2013; or would you should expect to see that in the market segments we're operating in, we will grow market share, we're aiming at growing top line but at growing bottom line. On the price volume which is the misleading indicator on U-A, in our Adhesives business. We can expect to over time to see negative volume because frankly, strategically, we are focusing in all these segments that are driving higher margins. That's why you look upon when we exit businesses like we've done as Carsten indicated as we did last year, it is almost all of the time volume-focused businesses.</p>
          <p>So that's why in next year, we will probably most likely stop delivering a price volume stat for U-A because it is a misleading indicator. It is a misleading indicator when we're focused more and more on market share and top line growth and bottom line growth. And as long as we grow the top line faster than we're growing market share in all the segments we're participating in. And we believe that it is becoming a misleading with our increased focus on our quality of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And again to the price volume concept, as we said we changed it with the Q1. And to remind you, the new concept is in the term that we in determining the price effect, we do account for the positive structure effect arising from launches of new products within pricing which was before done in volume. And to be more specific, as we said it, we are doing that for our HPC businesses and not for our Adhesives business. And lastly, yes, we have recalculated the 2011 figures.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions if I could. The first one is on the Cosmetics and Toiletries business. My question is regarding the closure of the Schlecker stores in Germany whether you have seen or you expect to see any kind of impact there. And the second question is on the Adhesives business, if you could even just directionally quantify to some extent the impact of the line exits that you mentioned before?</p>

          <p>Regarding your first question regarding the relevance of Schlecker. The impact of Schlecker is not significant for other the Henkel in total and also not for Cosmetics and Toiletries. The sales we are generating with Schlecker are relatively small and we have said we expect the majority of the shortfall that either will see there will be compensated by the increased revenues we generate with other customers.</p>

          <p>On the Adhesives side, the impact of divestments if I understand your question correctly as the exits had an impact of approximately 100 basis point of growth throughout the remainder of this year. And when we do the ongoing optimization of portfolio, we will guide on the quarterly calls what the impact of this is. But at this stage with the current decisions we've taken in executed approximately 100 basis points.</p>
