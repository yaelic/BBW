        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Sales for the third quarter were $17.3 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.2%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.60. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.8%. From a geographic perspective, we saw positive comps in all but five of our top 40 markets, with particular strength in areas such as our New Jersey and South Atlantic regions, where there were significant storm impacts.</p>
          <p>As Craig will detail, we saw growth not only in storm related product categories but also in our core categories. An interesting broad indicator of this is that our strongest division for the quarter was our Western division, which was obviously not affected by Hurricane Irene. We're also pleased that the growth in our overall transaction count has improved sequentially each quarter this year.</p>
          <p>On the international front, our Canadian business had essentially flat comps in the quarter. And our Mexican business had another quarter of positive comps, making it 32 quarters in a row of positive comp growth, sustained positive performance quarter over quarter for eight years in a row, a testament to the great job that Ricardo Sald&#xED;var and the team in Mexico are doing.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we still don't see and we don't expect to see in the near term any meaningful tailwind from the housing market. Inventories remain high. Pricing is under pressure, and credit is still difficult. Private fixed residential investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP is still at a historic low. In this type of environment, it is critical that we effectively invest in our business and keep focused on customer service.</p>
          <p>To that end, Marvin and his team rolled out three major initiatives during the third quarter: buy online, pick up in store; a new scheduling system for our associates; and a new centralized return-to-vendor process. These have involved significant operational changes in our stores of over a compressed period of time. It's an indication of the effectiveness of our field leadership team that we could execute these initiatives without significant store disruption. Both the new scheduling system and the new return-to-vendor process are allowing us to increase customer-facing hours in our stores at the same time that we're improving overall labor productivity.</p>
          <p>Our supply chain investments are also delivering significant benefits for the business. As Carol will discuss, we leveraged supply chain expenses in the quarter. As you know, last year we completed the build-out of our Rapid Deployment Centers, RDCs. Not all of those facilities were mechanized from the start. This was a conscious decision to gain speed in the rollout and to learn about the processes within the RDCs before committing to mechanization.</p>
          <p>As we've added mechanization, we're seeing benefits in capacity, efficiency, and accuracy. We're now underway with mechanizing three more facilities. And by the end of fiscal 2012, eighteen of the nineteen facilities will be mechanized. Year to date in the U.S., we've handled approximately 65% of our cost of goods through centralized distribution compared to approximately 25% for all of 2007. We have a goal of 75% by 2015.</p>
          <p>On the merchandising front, Craig and his team along with Matt and the IT team continued to make significant progress on developing tools for our merchandising transformation. If you followed Home Depot for a while, you know that one of our major areas of opportunity is in upgrading our legacy special order systems. We're now in the midst of a multiyear initiative to replace the legacy system, not with one major change-out but with a series of incremental releases. We're about a third of the way through this effort and are very pleased with the success to date. We've digitized our catalogs and are putting the building blocks of the new order management system in place.</p>
          <p>We're also in the midst of a major upgrade of our dot-com platform, which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>But this is not only about technology. There are underlying improvements in our merchandising processes that owe more to business alignment than technology. We now have a process for developing and executing our off-shelf and cross-merchandising strategy across the company. This may seem straightforward, but it has involved some trial-and-error blending of centralized merchandising direction with local entrepreneurial activity. As we've gained alignment, we're now seeing steady improvement in sales and unit growth from our off-shelf activity as we add more merchandising excitement and value to our stores.</p>
          <p>We will continue to invest in our business to improve customer service and productivity. Along with that, we believe it's also critical to continue to invest in our associates. Approximately 81% of our stores would qualify for Success Sharing based on our third quarter results. And our objective is to maintain record levels of Success Sharing payouts to our hourly associates.</p>
          <p>Finally, today our Board and announced a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share. Carol will discuss our updated capital allocation principles in a few minutes. Our guiding philosophy has been and will continue to be to maintain discipline on our capital allocation, focus on creating value for our shareholders, and maintain a solid financial footing for our business on a sustaining basis.</p>
          <p>Let me close by thanking our associates for all their hard work and dedication in the third quarter. And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Sales in the third quarter were driven by continued strength in the core of the store as well as storm recovery. We saw growth in both average ticket and transactions during the quarter. Ten of our departments posted positive comps for the quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were tools, electrical, indoor garden, building materials, plumbing, and hardware. Paint, flooring, lighting, and kitchen showed positive comps. Comps in lumber, outdoor garden, bath, and millwork were negative for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Cleanup activity from the impacts of Hurricane Irene and the resulting flooding led to strength in storm related products such as generators, pumps, extension cords, and wet/dry vacs. We also saw continued strength in roofing and gutters as customers repaired damage from early harsh winter weather. We estimate that the impact of storm related sales to be approximately a point of comp.</p>
          <p>But temperatures normalized after a hot August and we saw customers return to simple outdoor projects and outdoor living categories. We were particularly pleased to have posted positive comps in categories such as patio furniture, fireplace, walk-behind mowers, grills, and lawn accessories given the strong performance we saw in outdoor living categories during the third quarter of 2010. Outdoor projects such as fencing, exterior stains, exterior paint, and irrigation also performed well in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We did see some regional variances. For example, with drought-like conditions in parts of the Southern division, we saw tough sales of riding mowers and live goods partially offset by strong sales of watering.</p>
          <p>The maintenance and repair categories that make up the core of our store continued to perform well. Project basics such as pipe and fitting, fasteners, air circulation, hand tools, chemicals, caulks, and appliance parts were positive. And as customers prepared for winter, small maintenance projects like insulation and waterproofing also sold well.</p>
          <p>Great brands and innovative products led to positive performance in portable power, power tool accessories, and hand tools during the third quarter. We offered outstanding values in power tools from brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, Makita, RIDGID, and DeWalt. And we are seeing consistent response to these brands from our customers. We have also seen positive response from our pro customers in hand tools from the Milwaukee and DeWalt lines that are exclusive to The Home Depot.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver innovation through the extension of our LED light bulb offering for the home. At the beginning of the third quarter, we added the first two LED bulbs that will fit most customers' recessed cans. Additionally, we just added the first commercially available 75-watt equivalent LED A-line replacement.</p>
          <p>We saw our total transactions grow by 1.2% while average ticket also increased 3% for the quarter. The transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were flat for the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we were pleased with our ability to manage effectively against categories that were significant transaction drivers in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Transactions for tickets over $900, which also represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.6% in the third quarter. Strength in roofing and generators contributed to the growth in our average ticket.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, lumber prices were essentially flat to last year. Copper pricing was elevated but began to come down at the end of the third quarter. The total impact to comp from commodity inflation during the quarter was approximately 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we're facing the anniversary of the expiration of an energy efficient tax credit in the U.S. that increased sales in millwork and home services during the fourth quarter of 2010. We're also lapping strong performance from our gift centers as well as our Black Friday lineup last year. We planned for this and we're projecting to deliver positive comps in the quarter. We're excited about our decorative holiday and gift center offerings as well as our Black Friday lineup. We have expanded our LED Christmas lights selection to over 70 different options. And earlier this month we gave customers rebates for trading in old incandescent strands.</p>
          <p>We also have added several new holiday decoration offerings from Martha Stewart. Our gift center offers outstanding values with strong lineups of hand tools, power tools, safety items, tool storage, and special buys. And finally, we have a strong lineup of special buys for Black Friday, including appliance offers.</p>
          <p>We are excited about the products and values that we have to offer our customers in the fourth quarter. And we invite you to visit us in store, online, or through our mobile apps to check them out.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, sales were $17.3 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 4.2% for the quarter, with comps up 5.2% in August, 4.1% in September, and 3.5% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 3.8% for the quarter, with U.S. comps up 4.5% in August, 3.4% in September, and 3.4% in October.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 15 basis points from last year, of which 13 basis points came from our U.S. business. The gross margin expansion in the U.S. was driven by 26 basis points of benefit arising from our supply chain transformation, offset in part by a change in the mix of products and services sold as well as higher shrink compared to last year. For the year, we expect moderate gross margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 45 basis points to 25.1%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive sales growth as well as continuing cost control. While we had $26 million of natural disaster expense arising from storm damage, we leveraged every major expense line in the quarter. For the year, we now expect total expenses to grow at approximately 20% of our sales growth rate.</p>
          <p>Interest and other expense for the third quarter totaled $158 million, slightly higher than last year due to higher debt levels.</p>
          <p>Our income tax provision rate was 35.9% in the third quarter. And earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.60, up 17.6% from last year.</p>
          <p>Now moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarter we opened one new store in Mexico and one new store in St. Croix. We temporarily closed one store in Binghamton, New York due to flooding damage, and we expect this store to reopen during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 2,246 stores, and selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $293, up 4.3% year over year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $10.7 billion, down approximately $300 million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.3 times, a modest improvement from last year. We ended the quarter with $41.5 billion in assets, including $2.2 billion in cash.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we repurchased $800 million or 23.6 million shares of outstanding stock. Year to date we have repurchased $3.1 billion or 87 million shares. It is our intent to continue using excess cash to repurchase shares. And we plan to repurchase approximately $400 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 14.1%, 210 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>On the capital allocation front, we continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In this regard, we have a few items to call out. First, year to date we've spent roughly $820 million in capital expenditures, and anticipate that our total capital spending for fiscal 2011 will approximate $1.250 billion. Second, as Frank mentioned, we just announced a 16% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.29 per share. With this, we are lifting our targeted dividend payout ratio to 50%, up from our previous target of 40%. Third, as of the end of the third quarter, we have $6.8 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares and complete the authorization by the end of fiscal 2014.</p>
          <p>And finally, we're assuming a slightly more conservative financial risk profile and are targeting to maintain an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of approximately two times. Our updated shareholder principal guidelines reflect our view that a solid dividend coupled with prudent use of cash will create the most value for all stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. Our sales performance continues to outpace real GDP growth, driven by strength in the core of our store as well as certain weather related sales and merchandising events. Year to date, our sales have grown by 2.9%. We face a tough sales comparison in the fourth quarter. But consistent with earlier guidance, we continue to project that our fiscal 2011 sales will grow by approximately 2.5%. Our business continues to perform to our expectations, and we're seeing positive comps thus far in November.</p>
          <p>Based on our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now project fiscal 2011 earnings per share to increase approximately 18% to $2.38. While we intend to repurchase $400 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, given the timing of the repurchases, they won't have a meaningful impact to our full-year EPS guidance. Now we'll share our 2012 guidance with you during our fourth quarter earnings call, which is scheduled for February 21.</p>
          <p>We thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Vicki, we are now ready for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, just delving into the 2.0 debt-to-EBITDAR target, down previously from 2.5%, so I just was curious if you could just spend a little more time talking about that decision. I think the dividend, after raising the dividend, you get back to a similar capital distribution level in either situation. But I was just curious what the conversation was among senior management and the Board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Chris, let me make a general comment and then turn it over to Carol. First, I agree with your comment in terms of the return of the money to our shareholders. We also looked at the fact that while we've had the 2.5 times guard rail that we described, actually for the last several years we've been running at about two times. So we thought that it was better just in terms of transparency to say here's what we think is the right target for us going forward. And obviously, as our earnings improve that we'll have capacity for additional debt. Carol?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and you've seen that this year. We raised $1 billion of incremental debt earlier in the year while maintaining that two times ratio. So looking ahead as our earnings grow, it gives us more borrowing capacity and financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>We also think in this low growth economic environment, a solid financial condition is a competitive advantage, and we're really pleased with where we are. Now you might say gosh, interest rates are low. Don't you have an opportunity to borrow? Our perspective is interest rates will remain low for a while, so there's no hurry to rush out to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as a follow-up on the expense side, if you backed out that $23 million or $26 million, it looks like you would have leveraged SG&amp;A about 60 basis points, so I was just curious if there was any incentive comp drag in there. And also, should we think about 20 basis points of SG&amp;A leverage per point of comp? It was a bit lower, so I was just trying to figure it out there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In the third quarter our expenses grew at about 59% of our sales growth rate, and there are a couple of factors you need to keep in mind. First, we did have $26 million of natural disaster expense arising from flooding. And then last year, as you may recall, we had a $20 million gain on the sale of real estate that didn't repeat this year, so there is a little bit of year-over-year distortion. For the full year, we're expecting our expenses to grow at about 20% of our sales growth rate. And that's a real tribute to just the great work that the team is doing in driving productivity in all expense lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we'll hear from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wanted to actually follow up on the capital allocation first. Carol, you said that you thought 2.0 was "the right leverage ratio." I think the academic work would suggest that that's probably not the optimal cost of capital for a company like you. So how are you arriving at 2.0 as the right?</p>
          <p>And then just to follow up on that, is there any sense here that you want to keep a more conservative ratio for either economic reasons because you're uncertain about the future or a more conservative ratio so that you have maybe some dry powder for expansion outside the U.S. outside of North America? I know you've talked about potentially acquisitions down the road so you have capacity if you wanted to do something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's such a great question in terms of the right ratio because all day long from an academic perspective, we should say that really we should put a lot more leverage into our capital structure, perhaps go down to a BBB rating or less to optimize the weighted average cost of capital. And yet when you look at it, you really believe that you can create shareholder value that way. We think that by maintaining an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of two times, we're projecting growth in 2012 and beyond. That's going to add additional borrowing capacity into our capital structure, afford us a tremendous amount of financial flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is that financial flexibility for? I guess that was my second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we're investing our capital in our existing business. And as we think about financial flexibility, what our actions have shown us is that we use it for the shareholders. So when we borrowed $1 billion this year, we returned that to the shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also say, Colin, this is not a signal that there's something different in our minds internationally or anything like that. In fact, this is really just a slight move from what we've previously said and no move at all from what we've been doing over the last three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm still not sure I'm certain of the thinking there, but a second quick follow-up. Just in terms of your comments around the tough sales compare, are you seeing any impact yet from anniversarying the tax credits in some of those categories?</p>

          <p>If I could just jump in and then Craig will comment, November is our toughest comparison, as you know, and we're positive comping thus far this month. If you look at the performance by category, millwork is one of our softest categories.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're definitely seeing the pressure from the growth in millwork last year versus this year. It was one of the areas that we negative comped in, in the third quarter. And we anticipate that it will be a very tough comp in the fourth quarter based on the overlap of the tax credit.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First just a question on the comp progression for the quarter. So you indicated that weather &#x2013; and I'm assuming you're mostly talking about the hurricane. So as you look at the comp progression for the quarter, was the majority of that weather benefit then in the month of August early in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so basically the comps have progressed evenly through the quarter. The second question, I just wanted to ask a question on the capital allocation discussion today. The timing, you made the announcement today on the dividend and the targeted debt ratios. As you decide to do this, is this more a reflection of what you're seeing inside your business, inside The Home Depot enterprise, or is it more a reflection of external factors that you decided this now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally, we've been on a cadence of lifting the dividend every year in the January &#x2013; February timeframe. As we sat back and looked at the performance of the business, the confidence that we have in all the initiatives that we've got underway and our prospects for the future, we said there's no better time then to lift the dividend. Now, you shouldn't expect us to lift the dividend again in January or February of 2012. You should expect us to come back at the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013 to look to lift the dividend again. We thought there was no better time.</p>
          <p>We also just wanted to add a little bit more definition around the targeted adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio. I can't tell you the number of times we get asked when are you going to lever up to 2.5 times. We set 2.5 times as a cap, not a target. We are now setting two as the target and we will maintain the target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, you set me up. When are you going to lever up to 2.5 times lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR, I guess? The strategy makes sense. You weren't getting credit for keeping it at or below two times, so now you're merely signaling that that's what you're going to do. But are there certain triggers for &#x2013; so if you started to see 4% comp growth for an extended period of time like you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Michael, that's a great question, a great comment. These things are situational. So as the situation changes, we could obviously change what our target is. But as Carol said, we thought for the purposes of transparency, it was better to say this is what we've been doing for the last three years. We don't see this changing going forward, but we do see if circumstances change and growth starts to accelerate a lot more, then you might have a different answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, understood. And then on the promotional side, is there a philosophy to promote to the comp? And by that I mean do you anticipate that you &#x2013; you anticipated that you have a difficult fourth quarter comparison. So does that mean that you're intentionally planning some activities to comp the comp, and is that different than how you've been in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, we're always trying to build the business to drive comp performance year over year. And I think the key focus that we've been trying to have for the past several years is to drive everyday great value for our customers, to build our business bay by bay so that we're driving consistent performance. Certainly, we go in and we create events. We're conscious of the fact that we need to in total cover that volume, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to cover in that category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me sneak one last one in here. Of the three initiatives that were completed or near completion during the third quarter, have there been incremental costs associated with those activities such that we should see some benefit to the cost structure moving forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Marvin. From a cost standpoint, the answer is no real incremental costs. These are big initiatives, and the goal is to hit our 60:40 ratio of service and task, so the goal primarily is to drive productivity. We believe that we're going to see productivity improvements in the short term, but more productivity improvements will be in 2012 and going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just jump in, some of the cost that we did experience was capitalized cost associated with new technology. So if you look at our capital spending, it's up year on year, and most of that delta is in the area of technology.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at the world is the broad answer. It's hard to look at a retailer to say aha, this is the company that we want to emulate.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, exactly. One other, if you mentioned it I missed it. Talking about appliances, it seems to have been a very volatile category in the third quarter in that there seems to have been winners and losers throughout the industry. I'm just trying to get a sense where you guys &#x2013; how you guys did in that area.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you're losing share there, do you think it's because of just an unwillingness to match on price? Do you think there's anything structural there, or do you think it was just around near-term pricing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's anything structural there. I think it's just there's activity in the marketplace. We have a portfolio strategy. We're comfortable with the position that we take in appliances, not looking to be the leader in that business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, guys. So I'll ask one question and a follow-up. The question just on the cadence of the buybacks, so I think you're saying about $3.5 billion this year. And then the $6.8 billion through 2014 equates to something in the $2.3 billion range, so a significant slowdown. I guess the question is, is there upside to that number, or is it really just a signal that you're just going to be buying back less annually?</p>
          <p>And then I'll ask my follow-up up front. It would relate again to the appliance business. So I think H.H. Gregg and Sears were pretty aggressive in the quarter. What are you seeing in November, particularly from your biggest competitor, in terms of pricing in general, but specifically on appliances as they seem to be signaling a more aggressive posture? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start with the cadence on the buybacks. We gave some color today hoping it would help you build your models. The way I would think about it is we're spending $2.5 billion with cash generated from the business to buy back shares this year. So you should assume at least $2.5 billion next year. That would mean $2.5 billion in 2013, the remaining $1.4 billion in 2014. However, as we just talked about, with increased earnings we will have borrowing capacity, just like we did this year. We raised $1 billion that takes us to the full $3.5 billion. So as we look at next year, we'll have borrowing capacity, which would allow us to accelerate some of the share repurchases.</p>
          <p>I don't want to tell you the day, the time as we sit here in November because we want to be opportunistic in terms of debt capital raising. But there is clearly an opportunity to accelerate it, but hopefully this is helpful from a modeling perspective.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the appliance front, we've seen the market be fairly aggressive in this category. We see that it's off to a strong start in terms of the promotional activity, if you will, in the business as we head into the holiday season here. We're candidly pretty comfortable with the plans that we've put together for the business in the fourth quarter. So again, it fits within &#x2013; our plans fit within our portfolio strategy overall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you. Carol, I guess just first question would be around inventory. Can you maybe talk about the decline in the quarter and how you guys are viewing inventory overall, and then maybe highlight some categories where you're being either more conservative or more opportunistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're thrilled with our inventory performance, and we've just spent a lot of money transforming our supply chain, so we're hoping to see this come through. As you know, we have committed to get a full turn of improvement over the next several years. If you look at where we are seeing it, part of it is really just in terms of the quality of the inventory. Our clearance levels are as low as they have ever been in our company history. And then, Craig, you might want to give some color on just how we're going about forecasting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, all of the tools that we've been building and putting in place, the new forecasting system that was put into place has helped us better manage the inventory on a day-in day-out basis. We've obviously worked hard over the past several years to do a much better job of managing our seasonal inventory. But now we're seeing benefits come through in our basic categories as a result of these tools that we've put into play. Obviously, the RDC allows us to effectively put inventory where it's needed with the last-minute allocation that's put into place. So it's all of these elements that are coming together that are helping us leverage the inventory investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if I could just jump in, I would say in-store execution is also helping. So Marvin, you might want to give a couple comments about Power Pack Down and what we do there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dennis, as a little bit of perspective, when product comes from the RDC, over 80% goes directly from receiving to the sales floor. I've been here over nine years, and that's a big difference from what we've seen in the past. If you walk our stores today, as Carol mentioned, you will see less product in the overhead than in the history of the company. It's not because we are doing anything other than getting the right product to the right place at the right time, and we have some very fundamental things that we're doing in the store just to keep the product on the shelf, stay in stock so we can limit the amount of inventory and have product on the shelf for the customers to buy. It's a very fundamental approach, but the RDC and the technology Craig mentioned allows us to do this much better than we ever have before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dennis, the most important thing is the fact that when we look at inventory productivity, that is always measured against in-stock. And so we're constantly making sure that as we look at the investments we're making in the inventory that that is balanced by the fact that we have to continue to improve our in-stock position for our customers, which we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so the follow-up on that would be I guess, Carol, do you have a target of where you'd like to end this year on inventory? And then bigger picture as you continue to refine the distribution network, working capital was a nice swing this year versus last. Any general thoughts on how we could think about that in 2012, can you continue to strip working capital out of the business in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so we should show some modest improvement in inventory turns year on year by the end of the year. That certainly is our target and we're on path to deliver that. As we look to 2012, we'll give you more color in February, but I can tell you we're building our plans right now and we're building working capital as a source of cash for 2012.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the different size buckets that you guys lay out for us, I think it's interesting that you've had actually a pretty nice gain in three of the last four quarters. Not necessarily intuitive given what we're seeing in the broader housing market, and I get the fact that stuff like storms can certainly help and skew the data a little bit. But are you guys seeing or do you sense there's a little bit of change in consumer appetite for bigger projects, or have three of the last four quarters just had its own unique aspects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what's happening is, as you mentioned, certainly as I called out, roofing, generators, those type of things that are storm related certainly help. But the fact that we had a positive comp growth in our kitchen business again is an indication of the work that we've done to really develop the business, give value to the customer across any way they want to buy a kitchen, whether that's in stock, take it home today; special order; have their cabinets refaced. All those being positive, being a bigger ticket sale has contributed to the past few quarters in terms of the big-ticket growth. And candidly there, that's an area where we're taking share because the industry itself isn't growing from everything we can gather from our supply base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing, we've just stood up a new consumer insights team, and we're getting some very interesting data. If you look at the third quarter, both our transactions and our ticket grew, as you know. But when you break it down between consumers and pro, we saw an increase in transactions and ticket for the consumer. But in the pro, transactions were down but the ticket was way up. So the pro who's shopping with us is more sticky and is buying more with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Interesting, and then just any thoughts or color regarding year-over-year comparisons for that big-ticket bucket? Obviously, you were up I think it was north of a 9% increase last year in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>And again, as I mentioned, we were aware that we have to deliver upon those comps. We've built programs across the store to be able to do that. There are businesses, for example, where the continued development of LED helps drive increase in ticket inside of that category. Lithium tools, for example, carry a higher ticket than NiCad power tools. So there are elements across the store that we're driving to continue to build the ticket in our business.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Dan Binder. I just wanted to jump back to the competitive landscape for a minute. Your main competitor is shifting more towards EDLP. I'm just curious if you're feeling compelled or seeing any need to price-match in certain areas of the store. And there also seems to be a little bit more of an emerging online growth by some other players, and I'm just curious how you're viewing the online opportunity longer term. I know you're investing a lot in that currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first and foremost from a go-to-market strategy, ground zero for us is our portfolio strategy. We always go back to our portfolio strategy. What is it we want to stand for? How do we drive the business? That determines both assortment strategy as well as our go-to-market pricing strategy in the business. We've been focused for a number of years on driving to everyday great value for our customer. That remains our focus. Certainly, we have categories like appliances where the industry still remains promotional. It's difficult to break those businesses, as hard as we're trying. But our focus is really on trying to drive great value for our customers every day.</p>
          <p>When we look at competition, we look at competition across a broad segment. It's not just our largest competitor in this space. We compete against multiple people, independents as well as online competitors. And we're constantly looking at how we react to the market. Again, our portfolio strategy guides where we react and how we react and to what depth we react in a given category. But that's a constant monitoring, both brick-and-mortar retail as well as online retail, and making adjustments in our business to make sure that we're delivering value for our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess with that said, are you finding that you're having to do any material price matching activity? Is that seeing any kind of increases, or are you doing it in the aisles before the customer approaches you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I haven't seen in our numbers any dramatic change in competitive price-match data. We are constantly monitoring the market on a weekly basis, proactively making adjustments in our business as we need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We view broad discounting with a great deal of caution. And we have competitors who do offer broad discounts like with their private label cards or something like that, and we aren't seeing that we have to match that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, this is Marvin. There's really great alignment between the store operators and Craig's field merchandising team. We're keenly aware of all of our competitors, but we have not seen any major changes in price match, not in the near term or even in the past. We're just very consistent with how we run our business. And as Craig mentioned, the portfolio strategy is the cornerstone, and we provide input into that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. This is Greg Hessler standing in for Todd Duvick. Do you have a targeted credit rating? With the announcement this morning as well as how your leverage has been creeping lower over the past several years, I wanted to see if you have a target there. And was that a factor at all for the rationale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today we have a split rating. We've got a BBB+ rating from S&amp;P and a weak single-A from Moody's. We think having an unsplit rating would be good, so a weak single-A would be a good target for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You've shown I think what you characterized as a little bit better sales growth than the market. You've done better on expenses and better on gross margin. I guess I'm curious as you think about 2012, the sustainability of what looks to have been some outperformance relative to the market, maybe even relative to your targets across those three areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, our job is to continue to invest in the business so that we position ourselves to continue to gain market share. We don't stop. It wasn't like 2010 or 2011 we look at as one-off years. It's a sustaining effort, and that's really the purpose behind our investments on the supply chain, merchandising tools, and on the operational side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're on a path to reach a 10% operating margin by 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you think about 4Q, you have characterized it as a tougher comparison and seem to be framing that the market share gains or the upside sales performance may take a pause in the fourth quarter. I guess I'd be interested if you could broaden your thoughts on that, if that's a one-quarter event. Or if not, the comparisons are tougher, so we're going to see more in line with the market type of sales performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2010, it was a significant outperformance in 2010 and, as we called out at the time, around our seasonal and appliance offerings. We know, as Craig said, that's in our plans for how we approach the fourth quarter, but that delta performance was probably a one-off in that quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's also the impact of the energy tax credit. In the fourth quarter of last year, we estimated it drove about 40 to 50 basis points of comp in the fourth quarter. As we've reflected on it and done additional work, we think it was even a bigger contribution. So that's not repeating this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one other follow-up, on the gross margin line, impact of inflation, did you see any negative impact or notable impact on profitability from inflation in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't. We would have called it out had we seen that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is actually TJ McConville filling in for Budd. Thanks for taking my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, TJ. Good morning</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Carol, you mentioned quickly in passing the consumer insights team and what you're finding with your pro customer in reference to ticket and traffic. I would love to hear any of the other findings that you've had so far with that program as to maybe within the pro, what the category changes have been, maybe if you're gaining share there or anything that you've found early days so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So TJ, as Carol referenced and if you take a step back, we have had an outside third-party firm that was helping us do consumer insights. We've now shifted and have that capacity in-house. And some of the very basic data is what we're just getting now, but it is just starting now; so around the very broad, hey, here's what your pros are doing, here's what your consumers are doing. So we really don't have additional items to share with you all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. We'll look forward to hearing those data. And then secondly, Marvin, you mentioned earlier you're still looking towards 60:40 customer-facing to task. Where do you stand today? And how much more of these three initiatives do you have to roll out in the next quarter, and where do you think you'll stand after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>TJ, we're going to end the year at roughly 55%, and we're very pleased with that. The reason we started this a few years back, we were at 47% service to task, so we'll end this year at 55%. We think that we'll get north of 60% within the next 16 months.</p>
          <p>My team is responsible for working cross-functionally with Matt Carey's IT team, with Craig's team to lay out initiatives for the upcoming years to keep this process going. We don't see it as an endpoint. We see it as a continuous point of improvement, so we have initiatives that actually go through 2015. We're going to continue to drive productivity. We have a very simple philosophy of trying to take task out of the store while driving productivity concurrently.</p>
          <p>And we've been very pleased with our payroll leverage and our ability to reduce overall payroll yet add hours to the sales force. So we're increasing coverage for service while reducing overall payroll because we're eliminating some of the tasks that in the past dominated all of our payroll spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks much, best of luck on the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if we could build on that, if you look at all the work you've done on the RDCs and distribution in general, but then combining it with what Marvin just talked about holistically on the efficiency of hours and tasking in the store, given the stage of all the work that you've done over several years, how should we think about the rate of change for both gross and leverage or just operating margin benefits of all that efficiency work in aggregate the last couple years versus the next couple going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll recall when we had our Investor Day back in 2010, we said we'd get 40 basis points of margin expansion off of the supply chain. I think there is more upside opportunity to this than down just looking at the performance for the past two quarters, which gives us just a tremendous amount of confidence and our trek towards that 10% operating margin that we really believe we'll deliver by 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is the efficiency more targeted at just pure flow-through of gross, or is it what it allows you to do labor-wise in the store, or is that changing at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I commented on the gross margin aspect on the labor productivity. You're seeing it today. We leveraged hourly payroll in the quarter by about 38 basis points, so it was the key driver of the leverage that we experienced. And supply chain is a piece of this. All the new tools that Marvin and the team have introduced is another piece of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, two quick questions. One, could you just give us the actual numbers for the comp traffic and ticket in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The actual numbers for the comp in the U.S., the comp ticket was up 2.7%, and the transactions up 1.1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On a comp basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second is on SG&amp;A. Carol, if I take the guidance of growing 20% of sales and just use your 2.5% for the year, I get deleverage in the fourth quarter. Is that because last year was so strong and that's just the flow-through to the SG&amp;A side, or is there something else that we're missing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are probably some modeling nuances going on because we're showing that we will leverage expenses in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then quickly then, credit, do you have the update on the credit penetration, particularly given the strength in large ticket transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're very pleased with how our private label credit card is performing in this environment. We saw a slight tick down in penetration, about 17 basis points, to 22.7%. But the reason why I say we're very encouraged and pleased with the performance is simply when we look at new accounts.</p>
          <p>As you may recall, we have a consumer card and a pro card, and 70% of the penetration is on the consumer, 30% on the pro. If we look at approval rates for our professional contractors, they're up 300 basis points year over year. That's great news because you know how important the pro is to us. It's great.</p>
          <p>If we look at approval rates for the consumer, however, they're down about 400 basis points. And the reason why they're down is because of the requirements pursuant to the CARD Act and the ability to pay. It's very cumbersome to apply for a consumer card in our stores. And it's cumbersome on our part. It's cumbersome on the part of our underwriter.</p>
          <p>So we have a number of changes underway to make it less cumbersome, and we believe that will help increase the approval rates. It's not that the quality of the applicants is bad. It's just that they don't have all the information necessary to get approved. Now, our approval rates are still pretty good. They're 71%, so that's still pretty good. But we think if we simplify it, we'll get it even better.</p>

We continue to add SKUs to our business overall. We're north of roughly 300,000 SKUs at year end. And we made a number of changes to our site, as you probably have seen. So we're very pleased with the progress. We're obviously making an investment in our operating system right now, but our business hasn't reached $1 billion in total yet.</p>

With the IT team, with Craig's team, with the dot-com team, we have spent a lot of time ensuring that we benchmark really good retailers not only in the U.S. but in Europe on how this process should work. The rollout was very smooth. The reception from our associates and customers have been very good, and we're excited about how well the stores are executing and how well the customer service feedback is coming back to us on how easy the process is and how transparent it is. So, so far, we're very pleased.</p>
