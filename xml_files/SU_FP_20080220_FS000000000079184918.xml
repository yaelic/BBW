        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for being here. I think we can start the presentation. So we're going to be back on the results of Schneider Electric in 2007. I would like to start by an overview of &#x2013; so we're going to be having an overview of the results. We're going to be scoring &#x2013; I'm going to be scoring some strategy on business update. Pierre will be talking about 2007 financial results. I'll be focusing on the critical power performance, as you know, this has been a key year for us in welcoming Schneider Electric, the biggest acquisition we have done since Square D, that's back in '91. And feed you back about the results of this integration inside Schneider, and then come back and finish with an outlook about 2008.</p>
          <p>An overview -- so let's start with the main events of 2007. I consider that 2007 has been a key year for Schneider Electric. First, we've scored again new records in organic growth on an EBITA for Schneider Electric. So we finish the year with 13.9% of organic growth and far outperforming the end markets. When we look at competitive bench around the world, we are certainly a part of the companies, which are growing the fastest today in our industry.</p>
          <p>The second record that we spoke is an EBITA at 14.8%, improving by 1.2%, and that is the first time in the history of Schneider Electric that we reach these levels. What is even more pleasing is that it accelerated in H2. Clearly, our second half was far better than the first half, and is putting us in a very good position to start the year 2008.</p>
          <p>Other things I'd like to mention about this year, there was very strong contribution of what we call our new businesses. That once upon a time we called the new growth platforms, and I'm going to be back about that. But particularly, many of those new activities are participating into our positioning into energy efficiency and energy efficiency has clearly accelerated in our performance in 2007.</p>
          <p>Another very positive point has been the acceleration in pricing plus 2.2 points in net. This is variable by geographies. The most brilliant geography for that has been the US where we increased our net price by more than 4%. And it's clearly more than offset our raw material increases. Pierre will be back on that one.</p>
          <p>Rebalancing is not only well on track, but it's in advance of one year on our new2 target. That's good for our capacity to tap the cost potential of low cost countries. But the other pleasing news that we can announce today, that at the end of 2007, the company is rebalanced in terms of currency. Remember that when we started new2 in 2004, 10% of drift of the US to the euro was costing us 100 basis points of EBIT. Today, we can say that the drift is neutral globally on our company's account.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, very important because we really put more emphasis after &#x2013; from the second half on that, we've always been attentive to it but we've put really a strong incentive on it &#x2013; was the cash flow generation, up to 1.5 billion on an increase respect to last year of 38%. And we still think there is potential of improvement on that price.</p>
          <p>So that is for the operations of Schneider, but clearly the big thing in 2007 for us, the big part of our time of high cost was about the integration of APC, its merger with our existing unit in that sector MG, on the turnaround of the results of APC, and we are above the plan that we had presented in times of acquisition on that subject. So a record year in terms of operational performance, and an integration on turnaround of APC, which is in advance of the plan and beyond the target of the time.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the figures in summary, in a nutshell, it gives sales an increase of 26%, the organic growth is 14%, the total sales increase is 26%. EBITDA, an improvement of 24%; EBITA an improvement of 27%; net income, 21%, is a significant change anyway of debt structure in the middle. EPS, plus 14% following the capital increase that we had in the middle of the year; dividend plus 10%, 50% of the net as defined in new2 and free cash flow at 1.5 billion, an increase of 38%.</p>
          <p>Now if we want to complete this overview, I'd like to take a perspective on 2008, because I know that most of the people in this room are probably more interested already by 2008 than by 2007. The first thing is that we do not see today the impact of the financial crisis in our figures. You've seen that our Q4 2007 was an acceleration respect to the average of the year, it was rather strong, especially in the US ironically.</p>
          <p>So today in our figures we don't see much effect of the financial crisis. We certainly have seen some softening since two years in the rigid more than softening. Tumbling of the residential in the US since now two years, but this has been total integrated in our performance. And in the meantime, we've kept on accelerating, repositioning ourselves in other segments.</p>
          <p>We've seen some start of softening in residential in Europe, but again it is not a major market for us. So today, we don't see in our figures. We start 2008 with a solid backlog, and as I have explained several times, we are in a business where even if we sell products in 70% of the cases, we follow 80% of the business by project. We know where the products are going. We follow the people who design. We follow the people who contract. We follow the people who install. And today the pipe of our project is rather strong.</p>
          <p>But we understand very clearly that there is a high risk of slowdown in mature countries, in western countries, especially in the US. We read the same papers as you do and we listen to same radios. So we've really looked into the detail of our end market exposure in the past six months and we have structured our initiatives in two directions.</p>
          <p>On one side, we've allocated our resources and our forces to grow in markets with strong fundamentals. Emerging markets is certainly one. I'll come back on that. We have very strong position there. Energy efficiency is a strong growing, standard pushed market. And we focus our important key verticals like datacenters, which are in a problem of capacity today, where capacity is needed. Everything which is related to natural resources, oil and gas, mining and minerals, these are very strong demanding segments.</p>
          <p>On the utilities, equipping the grid in emerging countries, revamping the grid in mature countries. So on one side we've put more of our efforts on segments, on markets, which have strong dynamics. On the other side, we have taken conservative hypothesis in our guidance and in our targets, and other markets, and especially from H2, because again, the visibility that we have on H1 is rather good and rather positive. And in consequence, we've diminished our resources on residential since a long time in the US, but we are prepared in major countries in case of to reduce our costs and reduce our exposure.</p>
          <p>So really we have had a kind of very segmented and differentiated approach to our markets. And let's not forget that if I look at the markets, which are more under the suspicion of having problems in 2008, if you take residential and commercial construction, they just make 30% of our sales today. The rest is infrastructure, the rest is industry, the rest is datacenters, the rest is position on markets, which have much better dynamics.</p>
          <p>These two actions on this segmentation make that we confirm with a good degree of confidence, a guideline of 6 to 8% on the topline for 2008. The other point that I'd like to mention in the meantime, we've worked since four years &#x2013; since three years along new2 to our resilience, or in the direction of our resilience and our flexibility, and we are certainly far more resilient that we were five or six years ago.</p>
          <p>Take a few examples. We have a much more solid, much more anchored exposure to emerging countries. Now the presence that we have in emerging countries is very, very significant. We have rebalanced a big part of our industrial base to emerging countries, which means it is a manual base and not an automated base, therefore, this is very, very highly flexible. 55% of our industrial head count today is in low cost countries and in manual assembly type of configuration.</p>
          <p>We've kept in Schneider since the origin a very outsourced model. I remind you that 50% of our P&amp;L is purchased from external suppliers. 70% of our cost of goods sold is purchased from suppliers, and this has increased in the past three or four years. We are a lean and simple company. We've decreased our base costs to the turnover again this year. And, as you've seen, our cash generation has improved.</p>
          <p>So all this considered, in consequence, we confirm that this hypothesis of top line, the EBITDA of Schneider Electric should be around 15% in 2008, and it has improved in respect to where it was in 2007. This as an introduction and this as an overview. Now let's go into the details and try to substantiate more of what I've said right now in this summary overview.</p>
          <p>Well, the first thing I come back on, on the record, was that we've had last year -- well, certainly we've benefited from the diversification of our end market exposure. If I take a worldwide view of Schneider end market exposure, today we are exposed 12% to the residential, we are exposed 16% to infrastructure and utilities, we're exposed 17% to datacenters and the high tech market, very linked to critical power kind of application. We are working at 25% in industry and 29% in the building, but one third of it is industrial, so it's back to a logic of industry.</p>
          <p>There has been -- there is for me four major reasons for our increase of gross profile, which are really well exemplified in 2007. The first one is the very strong investment and our very strong exposure to emerging countries; that's one. The second one is that we have developed a unique position in energy management and energy efficiency. And this we can clearly see a very strong dynamic in our sales today, so emerging countries and energy efficiency are certainly the core reasons for our very strong growth.</p>
          <p>We have positioned ourselves in attractive verticals, and I'm going to back on that; I touched the subject in my introduction. And we've developed very strongly our services on our install base. Remember that we used to be five years ago a company that was selling things and running away. Now we've gone back on our install base which is huge, because we have big leadership in the countries we are speaking about, and we are, piece by piece, getting back the install base for high added value services.</p>
          <p>For emerging countries, energy efficiency are the main drivers; focus on key verticals and services of our install base. The results in 2007 are showing this -- are exemplifying the result of this strategy. A growth in Europe at 12%, which is quite strong. North America 13%; again the fourth quarter was in acceleration. Asia-Pac at 16%, and Rest of the World at 23%.</p>
          <p>Now if you take a transversal view to that, and you separate emerging countries from mature countries, emerging countries are growing by 20% while mature countries are growing by 11%. Clearly, in emerging countries we are more on an equipment base kind of logic. In mature countries it's the energy efficiency, services and new activities which are driving the growth.</p>
          <p>Now the other very good thing is that we've assembled inside Schneider a series of new activities to create a capacity of energy management, but those new activities are benefiting fully from the synergies with the rest of the Group. So critical power growing 14%, building automation in orders plus 17% which they are taking markets; ultra terminals plus 9% growing excessively and services plus 22%. And again, all of those activities, plus some of our traditional activities, are participating to energy efficiency, but when we look at the global of energy efficiency, this is growing on total of 2007 by 15%.</p>
          <p>Move to the next slide and make a zoom on the emerging countries, well, what is clear is that we've really reinforced and structured massively our presence in emerging countries in the past year. While this has costed us [base cost] on investment, and this is very true at the beginning of 2007, I told you that we were doing at the beginning of 2007, this investment is going into those emerging countries. We have not only it's a good commercial presence, but now we have shouldered, we have created, a foundation on the back of it, on a supply chain which it's really solid in those countries.</p>
          <p>Take a country like China, we've got now 14,000 people in China. We sourced more than &#x20AC;1 billion of goods in China from Chinese suppliers. Actually, we buy in China more, or almost as much, as we sell in China today.</p>
          <p>So based on this strong platform, what you've seen is two things. First, is that our presence in emerging countries has increased over 5 billion in 2007. We are a company of &#x20AC;5.5 billion in emerging countries and the second point is that the solidity of this platform has made our growth accelerating in the past year.</p>
          <p>So if you look at last year it was 20% growth all compounded in those geographies. If you take some three years distance, it's 17%, ten years it's plus 13% and we see that with the markets where we are positioned in those markets, this is a dynamic which is here to stay, because we don't see very much what is going to slow down that kind of development.</p>
          <p>So this is certainly a very strong point where we want to keep on investing, and we want to keep on consolidating this platform in those countries, which used to be a bit of production which is now a full fledged supply chain, plus R&amp;D, plus marketing, plus decision centers.</p>
          <p>Now the next big driver, or the other big driver of our growth is definitely energy management. Over the past years, we have developed a unique leadership position in solutions for total energy management.</p>
          <p>What does energy management mean for us? For us it means making energy safe, and this is basically what we've done all our lives. Energy management was to deliver, in a very safe way, energy to our customers. Where we've developed is that we believe that energy management is not only making energy safe, it is also making energy reliable and available, and this is a core of the leadership we have acquired with APC and MGE. Making sure that we deliver to you, that we deliver to critical applications, which are more and more numerous, no fault, no interruption, high quality energy; not only safe, but it is reliable.</p>
          <p>The third point of energy efficiency is to make energy efficient and make sure that, well, we decrease for the same time of use, for the same kind of result, the amount of energy consumed. And the first point of energy management is to make energy quality and we invest more of the energy that we are consuming and this is what we deliver to all organization.</p>
          <p>Our job is to help our people -- is it okay? Hello? Our job is to help our customers to make the most of our energy. Is this good with the sound or...? Yes? I had the impression there is an echo. So our job is to help our customers to make the most of their energy, and among those formations, safety, reliability, efficiency and productivity, certainly the two which are growing the fastest are energy efficiency and critical power.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to focus now on this part of energy efficiency, which is one part of what we do in energy management. What do we put in energy efficiency? We put power monitoring and control, and this is a fact of the European activity, 20%. So it's metering, software, that controls the consumption, the quality of your power. It's the part of critical power and cooling which is going into energy efficient systems, and this is mainly the infrastructure architecture of APC.</p>
          <p>If you remember, that architecture respect to traditional systems, it's saving 40% energy by integrating racks, coolings, UPS and service. It's the part of HVAC which is inside building automation. Make no mistake, today it's mostly linked to energy efficiency, on energy optimization. We don't do microphones yet. I don't plan to do any. Is that better, or...? Yeah. I was speaking in the mike probably; speaking too loud.</p>
          <p>Then an activity of lighting and home control, but most of it is around lighting control, speed drives, for the control of motor. I remind you that motors are making 60% of the energy consumption in industry. There are also significant parts of the energy consumption in whatever building, infrastructure building and commercial buildings. And the thing which is growing very fast, are the services associated. Because the thing that our customers are looking for is not products for energy efficiency, they are looking for diagnostic, a solution and the monitoring of other solutions.</p>
          <p>So today, if you assemble all this, if you remember, in some way we have told you that we have finished debating if it was an activity of 3 billion or &#x20AC;4 billion. That's because we are reviewing in detail the use of those parts of our activities. At the end of 2007, we are speaking of an activity of &#x20AC;3.6 billion. It's 20% of the Group orders, and it's 15% of growth in 2007. So when we look today at the drivers of this market, this is clear that market we see accelerating, and there are several reasons to that. If you look at the main reasons, the first thing is that you've got emerging countries emerging, and they are putting pressure, and it's legitimate, on the natural resources of the world. So one new fact which was not very much a case before is that energy is scarce.</p>
          <p>So energy is scarce. The second one is that energy is very expensive, and you've seen all this morning closing at more than US100, which more than ever of actuality. And the third point is that in many places of the world, I was in Japan last week, Japan is one, but also Western Europe, there is now a real awareness about carbon dioxide emission and the need to go by the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p>So now, if you look at the solution of this problem, you can take any study done on it, but we need two things to solve the issue. The first thing is a cleaner generation, and the second thing is energy saving. A big part of the focus of investors has been on generation needs but, at the end of the day, we need both, because we won't make it if you take most of the prospective on the subject. If we want to make it in terms of climate change, and in terms of resources, 50% of the problem is in generating in a cleaner way, 50% of the solution is in saving energy.</p>
          <p>And there is a difference if you take those two actions. Some people talk to me about, yes, energy saving, but it's a big -- there is an investment to do with the customer's making. Now you can just compare the difference between installing a new clean generation plant and into starting energy savings. And when you look at the two things, go into generation, the expected payback will be over 10 years. You know that any kind of electricity generation, whatever good it is, there is losses between the energy you burn and the electricity that you produce, and this ratio is one to three. And in most of the emerging countries, it's far worse than this. So that means when you save one kilowatt hour at the level, at the point of use, you save at least three in terms of pollution and CO2 emission at the point of generation.</p>
          <p>Now the implementation delay between the generation plant and savings is obvious. I mean, it takes you a long time to start up, to fire up a generation plant, and its immediate, its six months, to start energy savings. And finally, there is a high investment threshold on one side, and energy savings are not generating, or are not asking for, high investment. So that's one. I mean, we need to do both, make no mistake. We are not preaching one against the other one. What we are seeing that when people are speaking about energy efficiency, on dealing with their energy bill, the first thing to do is energy savings, and any manager should be easily convinced of that reasoning. Now the payback that we see today with the number of cases that we have documented is 2 to 5 years, again any kilowatt hour that you save as a point of use is equivalent to three that you generate at the point of generation. The solution is rapidly implemented and the investment is rather low.</p>
          <p>And what we've seen with the price of energy increasing is that the payback has increased by 30% in five years, so it's becoming for our customers more and more convincing to go into an energy efficiency approach. That's about the economic driver to it. Now there are many countries in Western Europe where it's becoming regulatory; I mean, where the regulations are coming out that will ask any new building to be more energy efficient, any industry to be more energy efficient. So this is something that we see very strongly growing.</p>
          <p>Third point driving our growth is our focus on segments with very solid fundamentals of growth. The first one without going into too many details, because we've spoken a lot in the past two years about it, is data centers and network. The big driver for growth that we have here is the fact that most of the collocation we see have exhausted their maximum capacity, and there is a limit, there is a problem here, so there is investment taking place everywhere in the world. The second point is that there is an acceleration of transactions. There is an acceleration of transactions in business. Even the banking I mean, which has been struck by a form of crisis, strong crisis in the past six months, with the volatility on the speed of the transactions, all of those banks are looking for more computing capacity, therefore, more storage capacity.</p>
          <p>You take companies like ours, we are digitizing our company. I mean, we are doing less catalogues. We are going more on the Internet. Everything is getting more digital. On the very simple things like the iPods and the Blackberries, are creating a lot of traffic on the Internet supplementary that needs more storage today. So what we've seen here is an equipment which is increasing; a demand for equipment which is increasing quite strongly. This is still win for Schneider, and as we say during the acquisition of APC which is a market of which the fundamentals are growing at least at 8%, and today we would say between 8 to 12%.</p>
          <p>The second market that we are not speaking of too much in Schneider, but where we are historically positioned, and where we have focused, and where we are developing our presence, is natural resources, specifically oil and gas, mining and minerals. This is 1 billion. This is growing 8%. We are very well placed in geographies, very relevant to those kind of industries. I will just mention Australia where we have a real leadership position, South Africa, Brazil, Chile -- there is also Canada. These are places where we can capture and we are capturing the opportunities. On the place where we've always been, especially in medium voltage and in automation systems, is utilities, which is representing 1 billion, and we know the logic of that sector, equipment in emerging countries and on revamping in major countries.</p>
          <p>So if you take emerging countries, they are making 35% of our turnover in 2008. You take energy efficiency, which is just one part of energy management it's making 20% of our business in 2007. And you are taking those verticals, we are coming with let's say 50 to 60, or 55 to 65% of our turnover, where we see very strong dynamics as we enter the year. And that's about growth.</p>
          <p>Second part of our strategy is we want our company to be leading at the level of responsibility on sustainable development. So I've spoken several times about that, so I may be a bit faster on that part. But it's a very simple frame; we want to be leading in the environment responsibility. We want our products to be the cleanest of our industry. And we are certainly in advance of the RoHS, R-O-H-S, on rich regulations in that field. We want to have the cleanest processes of our industry and our plans are all ISO 14001, and we've got a very intensive plan inside Schneider that we call Schneider Energy Action of energy consumption reduction, aiming at reducing the consumption of our site by at least 10% and we are coming from already a favorable point.</p>
          <p>I am going to make a very simple example. The new building that we are going to be in Paris at the end of the year is corresponding to the new regulation coming up in France in two or three years time and it reduces the energy consumption by a factor of four to five. We are going to be targeting five; we're going to have at least four. On most of the buildings, the new buildings that will be built in Western Europe in the next coming years, we'll have to go through that kind of new regulation and that kind of new performance. So environmental responsibility.</p>
          <p>The second one is social responsibility. We have big plans around diversity; we've spoken about that in the past. Health and safety, we are certainly one of the safest workforce, if not the safest workforce in our industry, and we are -- we monitor that in every of our meeting, and this has improved drastically inside new2. And we have a plan for talent management. We've increased the pool of our talents by a factor of two in the year 2007 by recruitment detection, and an organized plan of promotion.</p>
          <p>Governance, number three; we have, obviously, principle of responsibility which have been published. We are at the moment -- by choosing inside the company a chart about ethics, we had one, but we want people to be educated about it and to understand every ramification of it. And we happen to be rated in some sustainable development, or sustainable rating index, now more and more DJ World, ASPI, Eurozone and Ethibel.</p>
          <p>You remember that in new2, we have a composite indicator of giving an idea about the progress of our company in the field of sustainable responsibility. And we came from a composite indicator of 3.6 and our KPI is now reaching a level of 7.2, with a target at the end of 2008 of reaching a level of 8.</p>
          <p>We are also creating this year a new foundation Schneider Electric foundation, which vocation will be four-fold. One will be to electrify emerging countries, giving electricity to people who don't have electricity, one third of the world population. Inserting underprivileged youngsters through our businesses, the world is missing electricians. The world can't find enough electricians to respond to their needs, and people need a job, so we want to take some people and educate them to the work of electrician.</p>
          <p>We want to contribute to start up companies to create an ecosystem around Schneider, and as we've d during the Tsunami or during Katrina, participate to reconstructions around the world.</p>
          <p>And moving to the third point of our strategy, which is about streamlining and globalizing our company to become more efficient. Our plans here, as I said last time we met at the end of H1, is articulated around three priorities. Rebalancing, we've spoken a bit about that; globalization and simplification.</p>
          <p>Face the reality, Schneider is a company that has grown organically in a pretty spectacular way in the past four years, but at the same time, half of our growth, if you exclude APC, was done of many acquisitions. Every time we've integrated in an acquisition we've integrated it, we've cut costs, we've rationalized things. But it's time for us at this -- at the end of this phase of redeployment where we've doubled size, we've exactly doubled size in four years, to look to streamline and simplify our Group.</p>
          <p>So I've put to my management team the priority in the next coming years to be really globalizing Schneider. And if you take those three dimension, rebalancing, globalization and simplification, we know where we come from; we coming from a country based Group with many acquisitions, with -- we are a country -- and we are also a mature country based company. This is where we come from. Mature based, country based kind of organization on many acquisitions.</p>
          <p>What we've done during year two is to rebalance our production in emerging countries. It has been to establish regional logistics instead of country-by-country logistics, and we've accelerated the integration of our acquisitions. If you remember our previous acquisition, it would take us many years to integrate them. We integrated APC in ten months directly inside Schneider.</p>
          <p>Where we want to go now is a next phase where we have to operate on a worldwide basis, and seamlessly and without -- and the country will be mainly related to the business, the rest will be global. We want to get the full benefit of our scale. We've double size, now we want to see the benefits of that doubling of size. That's through purchasing, that's through IT systems, that's through back offices. And we want to have structures which are leaner and processes which are unified and simplified.</p>
          <p>So let's start by the first point, which is rebalancing. If we look at what we've done today in rebalancing, well, we can say that at the end of 2007, 40% of our cost of goods sold, of our industrial costs, is in low cost countries. We're coming from 18% in 2004. We aim next year to be at 44%, and if we are good maybe, we're going to be at 45%. This measures to a sales proportion in low cost countries of 32% of our sales. So we are now producing more in low cost countries than we are selling in low cost countries.</p>
          <p>How did we do that? You have a graph on the right side which explains two variations. One is a displacement of headcounts, manufacturing headcounts in the low cost countries. We have today 55% of our industrial head count in low cost countries. And the most spectacular rebalancing that we've done is sourcing. You remember that 70% of our industrial cost is done with external suppliers. We've moved from 13% of our sourcing in 2001 coming from low cost countries, to 50% in 2007.</p>
          <p>So this is something that we are going to keep on doing because clearly we're going to grow faster and faster in emerging countries. A collateral benefit on that is what you see on the last line, is that doing that we've rebalanced the company. I think the company is not vulnerable any more to the drift of the euro to the dollar, or marginally in respect to what it was four years ago. So that's about rebalancing.</p>
          <p>Now without entering into each and every detail, when we look at globalization and simplification, again we know where we come from. And it's coming in the field of purchasing, logistics, IT, back offices and R&amp;D. We come from a very fragmented country-based kind, is country-based or country-integrated kind of organization.</p>
          <p>What we've done in new2 was to internationalize and globalize our purchasing, to close 60 logistics centers, to develop a core system for IT that we can deploy inside the company. We've start to establish our first shared services today in the company only just starting. And we've ramped up our emerging countries and consolidated our R&amp;D centers in the mature countries.</p>
          <p>By the way, in 2007, our R&amp;D is not representing any more 5% of our turnover in terms of costs, it's representing 4%. The plans of productivity that we've done, which is to restructure what we had in mature countries and to implement more of our forces into emerging countries, has carried a reduction of cost of 1 point of the turnover.</p>
          <p>Where we want to go tomorrow, I said it already, the full leverage of size and rationalization for purchasing is going from individual logistics centers to regional territories, 20 in the world. That would simplify a lot our logistics set up. To deploy our core system of IT and get the productivity that we need from the consistency, generalize the shared service center, which will take us through the next three years, and globalize on a worldwide basis our R&amp;D, which is pretty much advanced today.</p>
          <p>Without wanting to go into too many details, these are the benefits that we've had in the past years in those sectors. We've -- you've followed them semester-by-semester, so I don't think there's any big surprise here, but what it has enabled us to do is to increase our EBITA by more than 2 points.</p>
          <p>But in the mean time, we've offset raw material increases that were very significant, and we've offset, thanks to that, the currency impact which was very significant in the past years of Schneider. So we've increase our EBITA while facing the headwinds of currency and raw materials. And we did that because we had those efficiency plans.</p>
          <p>Now also another point which I consider is very positive, and where we shall keep on working in the next coming months and years, is our cash generation. While this is certainly the result of many factors that I've spoken about during my introduction, a non-integrated model, the benefits of rebalancing, especially reducing the inventory, we tended to have a lot of products going from mature countries to emerging countries, the simplification of the supply chain that has also carried a lot of benefits at the level of the inventory. And we've decrease our CapEx because we rebalanced to manual countries, less automated, less CapEx. And we developed services too.</p>
          <p>So if we look at what we've done here and we take an average '98 to 2002, which were not bad years in terms of growth or in terms of development, and we look at the past four years, we've increased the cash flow generation reported to sales, we've nearly doubled this -- not doubled, but we've improved significantly the ratio of cash generation, and we believe there is still improvement to be done in that field.</p>
          <p>This being said, I'm giving the mic to Pierre.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, good morning. As you can see it on this following chart and as you understand it already, 2007 is for Schneider another year of strong progression of its results. Our sales have grown by 26.1% up to &#x20AC;17.3 billion. The organic growth rate is close to 14%. The impact of acquisition is of 15.7%, while the foreign exchange evolution, and in particular the US depreciation -- the US dollar depreciation versus the euro, had a negative impact of 3.5% on our sales evolution.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin slightly eroded by 0.4 points down to 41%, and our EBITDA grew by 24.3% and exceeds &#x20AC;3.1 billion. After the deduction of the &#x20AC;138 million of restructuration costs and asset impairment, our EBITA reaches &#x20AC;2,562 million. Its progression is close to 27%, and our EBITA margin reaches an all-time high, 14.8%.</p>
          <p>A few elements are worth noting. First of all, the amount of restructuring costs and asset impairment at 138 million in 2007 compares with &#x20AC;116 million in 2006. Second, the divestiture of MGE Small Systems generated a net gain of &#x20AC;60 million before tax and after an MGE trademark impairment of &#x20AC;100 million. And three, other operating expenses include the &#x20AC;72 million provision in view of our planned IT systems upgrade, and because of the cost of reinforcing following the amendment of our agreement with Capgemini as announced in -- early this year.</p>
          <p>Despite the 3.1 billion increase of our net debt from one year to another, but owing to a tight control of our interest expenses, but also to a reduction of our effective tax rate from 28.5% in 2006 down to 27.1% in 2007, our net income increased by 20.9% up to &#x20AC;1,583 million. At &#x20AC;6.78, and taking into consideration our capital increase in early 2007, our EPS increased by almost 14% from one year to another.</p>
          <p>As you can realize it now on this following slide, our 2007 second half results were particularly solid, with mainly an improvement of our gross margin by 0.2 points from one semester to another. Second, a reduction of our sales and marketing investments resulting in lower support function costs at less than 25% of our sales, and as we were committed to. And three, at the end, a record 15.3% EBITA margin for the 2007 second half.</p>
          <p>The following chart is the evolution of our performances, of our results, from 2006 to 2007 on a comparable basis, i.e. including APC in our 2006 results on a pro forma basis. Thanks to its successful turnaround, APC EBITA margin stands at 14.3% over the 10.5 months of consolidation in 2007, almost at the Group profitability level over this period. And, obviously, such a performance largely explains the sharp progression of our EBITA margin from 13.6% of sales in 2006 to 14.8% in 2007 on a comparable basis.</p>
          <p>This is now our henceforth traditional analysis of the increase of our EBITA change from &#x20AC;2,019 million in 2006 up to &#x20AC;2,562 million in 2007. As you can note, out of the 27 points of EBITA progression, this is in the bottom part of the slide, 18 points are explained by organic growth, 14 points by acquisition, while the foreign exchange evolution had a negative 5 point impact.</p>
          <p>With &#x20AC;620 million the volume impact is very significant. While the change in our mix of activities had a negative &#x20AC;191 million impact, mainly due to first of all the growing importance as you know of all services, project and solutions with lower gross margin, but also to the sharp increase in particular in North America of all sales in ETO, engineering to order, we've lowered gross margin as well.</p>
          <p>The combined effect of &#x20AC;199 million of raw material price increases, and of &#x20AC;307 million of sales price increases, is a significant &#x20AC;108 million positive impact for the first time over the last years. In particular, let me stress that in the second half of 2007, &#x20AC;452 million of sales price increases largely exceeds the negative &#x20AC;67 million of raw material price increases.</p>
          <p>Our continued works, or continued efforts to improve our industrial productivity, have generated &#x20AC;295 million of savings, exactly in line with new2 targets, while our other operating costs, production labor, SG&amp;A and R&amp;D, have increased by &#x20AC;437 million in line obviously with our continuous sales marketing and R&amp;D investments in emerging countries, but also in new businesses with high growth potential as largely commented by Jean-Pascal.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting that the &#x20AC;103 million negative impact from currency effect is broken down into a &#x20AC;63 million transaction impact -- I'm sorry, a &#x20AC;63 million translation impact, and a limited &#x20AC;40 million transaction impact. With the consolidation of APC and Pelco on a full year basis, we expect such a transaction impact to be henceforth very minimum from 2008 onwards.</p>
          <p>The objective of this following slide is to illustrate our pricing power capacity. As you can see, at the end of 2007, our successive sales price increases have absorbed almost 100% of the combined 400 -- of the combined &#x20AC;544 million of raw material price increases over the last three years. You will note in particular the doubling of this pricing effect in 2007 as compared to 2006. Obviously, such a trend in 2007, and its recent accelerations, is of good omen, and make us confident for 2008 and afterwards.</p>
          <p>As indicated, our productivity plans generated &#x20AC;295 million savings, an amount equivalent to the 2006 &#x20AC;292 million savings. Those 2007 savings are broken down into first, &#x20AC;124 million savings through improved purchasing conditions owing to better negotiations, but also to the value engineering of our products. And you can note, or you will note that over the last three years, we have transferred more than &#x20AC;800 million of industrial purchases from high cost to low cost countries.</p>
          <p>Broken down also into &#x20AC;55 million of savings through lean manufacturings, to &#x20AC;72 million of gains from manufacturing rebalancing to low cost countries, and to &#x20AC;44 million generated by industrial rationalization through the closing down and combination of 14 manufacturing plants in 2007, such a productivity improvement represent 4% of our product cost in 2007, and is exactly in line with our new2 targets.</p>
          <p>It is worth indicating again that at the end of 2007, and taking into account APC, we realize henceforth 40% of our COGS, cost of goods sold in emerging countries, as compared to 32% of our sales.</p>
          <p>This following slide presents our profitability across region, and before of allocation of our corporate cost, and including APC on a pro forma basis in 2006. First of all, as already mentioned, and as not assuring showing on the slide, our sales in Europe continues to decline from 47% in 2006 to 45% in 2007, at the benefit of North America and Asia. And Western Europe is even a smaller 40%. If we take into account Eastern Europe sales were about 5%.</p>
          <p>Moreover, all our geographic operations post a solid and rather homogenous EBITDA, profitability and progression. In Europe, our EBITDA margin increases from 16.8% up to 17.2%, owing to more dynamic pricing power to a significant volume impact, to sustain productivity improvements, but also to a development on the very attractive energy efficient markets.</p>
          <p>In North America, our EBITDA increases from 13.5% to 16.5%, despite the residential market turn down, but owing to a very strong pricing power obviously to the APC turnaround, but also towards developments on attractive market segments such as better centers, water treatment, hospital and energy efficiency market as explained by Jean-Pascal.</p>
          <p>In Asia, our EBITDA margin progression up to 13.6% reflects the significant volume impact, in particular in construction and infrastructure, but also the ongoing turnaround of Clipsal Asia and our operation North-East Asia, but also our continued significant investments in our manufacturing plants or sales and R&amp;D structure. At last in Middle-East Africa and Latin America, the posted 15.9% EBITDA is explained by a tight management control of a rapid, but solid expansion in Bulgaria.</p>
          <p>In the same way, the following chart presents our profitability across our different business units before the allocation of our corporate costs. One may note the 20% progression of our electrical distribution EBITDA -- EBITA, I am sorry, which represent 57% now this electrical distribution of our total Group sales, clearly its improved profitability is largely explained by the volume impact and the productivity gains. One may note as well the erosion of our automation and control profitability because of its ongoing sustained developments, investments to develop new products, but also new position or new markets, and because also of an erosion of 2007 digital results in the complex of a tough Japanese industrial market. One may note as well the satisfactory 12.7% EBITDA profitability of our critical power and cooling service business unit, with the turnaround of APC and despite significant restructuring cost a negative purchase accounting impacts at the occasion of this first year of consolidation of APC.</p>
          <p>As indicated in this following chart, our EPS has reached &#x20AC;6.78 and we'll propose a &#x20AC;3.30 dividend at our next shareholder meeting. On that basis, it is worth highlighting that both our EPS and our dividend have grown by 22% per annum over the last three years.</p>
          <p>Our 2007 sources and uses of funds is now presented. The main flow of funds were the following, a 22.2 billion operating cash flow, a 1.3 billion also capital increase, and an additional 3.1 billion net debt of finance, &#x20AC;560 million capital expenditures, &#x20AC;260 million additional working capital needs, and &#x20AC;670 million dividends, and at last &#x20AC;5.291 billion of acquisition. This figure is net of the &#x20AC;425 million divestiture of MGE Small Systems, and such acquisitions include APC for &#x20AC;4.3 billion, Pelco for &#x20AC;1.1 billion, <mark type="inaudible" /> for &#x20AC;160 million and other acquisitions for a total consideration of &#x20AC;156 million.</p>
          <p>As you probably have noted it in the slide before, our free cash flow has reached &#x20AC;1.530 billion and plus a sharp 38% progression from one year to another. In this respect, our cash conversion rate improved significantly from 44% in 2006 to 49% in 2007 when measured by the ratio of our free cash flow over our EBITDA, or from 85% in 2006 to 97% in 2007 when measured by the ratio of our free cash flow over net income. Such an improvement of our free cash flow is explained to a large extent, by the achieved control of our working capital needs and our capital expenditures. This following slides explain the evolution of the capital employed of our activities excluding APC.</p>
          <p>As you can see, and despite a context of the high demand for our products, we are in particular succeeded to reduce our inventory level by five days of sales, five days of sales and therefore to reduce our working capital needs by 0.6 points to 20.8% of our sales, while containing in the same time our CapEx to 3.4% of our sales.</p>
          <p>As a result, our capital employed at &#x20AC;12.7 billion, only increased by 7% at a time when our organic growth rate was twice bigger. As a result of the progression of our EBITDA and EBITA on one hand, and of the control of our capital employed on the other hand, and as it is exposed on this new slide, our ROCE first significant improvement.</p>
          <p>First of all, for activities excluding APC, our cash ROCE measured by the ratio of our EBITDA after tax of our capital employed, improved from 14.6% in 2006 up to 16.2% in 2007. And for the Group level, the Group as a whole, and when including APC on a pro forma basis in our 2006 EBTIDA and our 2006 capital employed, our cash ROCE improved even more sharply from 11.5% in 2006 up to 13.4% in 2007, with obviously the additional benefit of the APC turnaround. Naturally, the same factors explain the progression of our ROCE measured by the after tax EBITDA of our capital employed.</p>
          <p>The following slide gives key information on our gross debt structure. As you can see it as of December 2007, December 31, 2007, 66% of our gross debt is at fixed rate; 34% at floating rate; 61% is in euro; 31% in US dollar; and 8% in other currencies including yen and Australian dollars, in Australian dollars, yes. 41% mature within two years, 25% mature between year three and five and 34% mature beyond year five.</p>
          <p>The average maturity of our outstanding debt is four and half years, while the average interest rate at the end of 2007 was 4.4%. In addition, we benefit from &#x20AC;2.5 billion of unused available banking credit facilities and committed credit facilities.</p>
          <p>Owning to those good results and owing to a strong cash generation and also owing to a 1.2 billion capital increase in early 2007. Our financial structure as of end 2007 is solid with 13 times interest coverage by EBITDA, a 48% debt-to-equity ratio and with funds from operation to net debt ratio, as per rating agencies definition at 38%, comfortably in line with our BBB plus rating.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to go now very quickly through the critical power documents, because many people went in <mark type="inaudible" />, and we made an extensive communication during the Investor Day about this operation. If I would summarize the main elements of this year is a confirmed strong growth of 14%. This including anyway the termination of non-profitable lines of products or actually the factual growth that you see here should have been higher, if you wouldn't take into consideration the brutal termination of non-profit making lines of product. So that's very strong dynamics of growth.</p>
          <p>And actually the EBITDA that we produced is above what we announced in Investor Day at the November -- in November, because we had a pretty strong closing of the year. We had announced 426, actually we've reached &#x20AC;440 million -- of dollars sorry of EBITDA. We report those figures in dollars because since inception of this merger every figure is in dollar and we want to stay consistent with vis-&#xE0;-vis -- by the way we followed the operation and vis-&#xE0;-vis we presented the operation in the first day.</p>
          <p>This is a multiplication by two of the EBITA well in advance on our integration plan in our result plan. And we had non-recurrent elements driving to an EBITA of 11.4, many restructuring which was quite intensive in year 2007, and asset value adjustment during the acquisition integration.</p>
          <p>Now if we look forward, the good thing is that, 2007 the teams have done tremendous job. It has been huge work in all angles of the company and well, the good thing is that we are starting 2008 in order of execution. I mean, this time we don't have many meetings with many people to make them know each other. We don't have big meetings about the product formats. We don't have many meetings about HKUs elimination, on termination of products. We start with a very clean sheet of paper and with a company which is totally geared for execution.</p>
          <p>So what we are aiming is that we said in the business plan, 11 to 13% CAGR over the next two years. Strongly pushed or pulled by the trend on the data centers, on the larger systems which are -- have been turned around in 10 months and not three years. On the -- with a target to ramp our EBITA -- I'm sorry, to ramp our EBITA from 12.5, if you will take away the non-recurrent charges to 15 on -- to 17% EBITA.</p>
          <p>Now the slide that reminds you the potential of this acquisition, it's really again change acquisition in the field of power, power distribution, energy distribution process for Schneider. We are missing that ball of energy reliability that's really complementing a lot of pool of energy safety that we had historically. Also the mode of execution of APC are extremely global and streamlined, and it's changing also the culture of Schneider. So, we've extended our portfolio on our innovation capabilities. The team that we've got inside APC are extremely disruptive in terms of innovation. We have global footprint on -- to complement each other on sell complete solutions. The integration process we spoke about it did turn around two. The name of the game is here when MGE and APC are going to data centers, they address only one-third of the portfolio that Schneider can address, on put together.</p>
          <p>And especially when you speak about energy management and energy efficiency you've got to assemble those two-thirds more of the solution to make -- to give it a value -- to create the value to the customers. We are in a unique position to deliver complete solutions for the fast growing market of large datacenters. We are deploying Home &amp; Distributed ranges which is what we called in the past, small systems, into new applications, typically in the field of renewables which is a very exciting field of extension for those products.</p>
          <p>APC tended to be good in Russia, but relatively poor in Brazil and in China, and we are pretty good in India. So, there is a high potential of deployment and development in the BRICs in -- on emerging countries based on the platform of Schneider Electric.</p>
          <p>With that and as a conclusion, but it was already encapsulated in my introduction, confirm with confidence the organic sales growth between 6 and 8% on an EBITA margin at 15%. And with that we thank you for your attention for that long explanation, and we are ready to take any kind of questions you would have.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Simon Smith from Citigroup. I have three questions. The first, on your outlook for '08, you make a comment that you've made conservative assumptions on the developed markets in the second half. I wondered if you could give us a bit more of a detailed split between the sort of the emerging market, Western Europe and US growth rates that you think you may see in 2008.</p>
          <p>The second question was on the balance sheet. You gave a very detailed breakdown of what your debt exposures are and though you have an average of four years, you obviously have a very large chunk of short-term financing. I think, it's about sort of 2.4 billion. I wondered, if you could give us any view as to what you plan to do in terms of maybe extending the duration of some of that, and whether that will lead to potential issues through the year.</p>
          <p>And my third question was in terms of cost. Obviously, you had a very tough year last year in terms of raw materials, and you've done exceptionally well in terms of pricing; maybe the feeling that pricing will be slightly tougher going into this year. And against that, are you now starting to see more of an aggressive pickup in some areas of labor cost? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, I will start by the speed of growth sales for 2008. I won't go into each and every detail because it's also internal figures, but when we look at 2008, as I said, we are entering 2008 with a pretty solid backlog; with a rather good visibility on our project pipeline. Certainly, there has been a lot of reorientation of our sales forces in the past year, two verticals that I've mentioned especially. So it has changed also quite significantly the exposure that we are forecasting for 2008.</p>
          <p>So our vision of the year is that each one seems to be, well, maybe mature countries softer than what it was in 2007. Because look at 2007, 12% in Europe, and 13% in the US, 14% last quarter in the US, is a very high level of activity, even if we've ramped up our growth profile, changed the profile of activity, but it was a very strong year. So we certainly didn't make those kinds of assumptions. We've taken a softer approach to it. And anyway, we've pushed, I've pushed, we've pushed with the management team, conservative hypothesis for the mature countries in 2008, just to test our resilience to that kind of hypothesis.</p>
          <p>Now at the beginning of the year, I would consider them as probably too conservative, but I read your papers, and you tend to be not optimistic at all about the future. You know that we pay a lot of attention to what you say, so we integrate your opinion into our hypothesis, even if we don't feel that on our segments, on specific segments we've targeted, it will be as bad as what you forecast. But we've taken in Western Europe and North America rather conservative hypothesis in building our structure of P&amp;L and cost. I'm much more bullish anyway.</p>
          <p>I remain extremely bullish on emerging countries, because I said to you at the end of, mid of 2006, that we would be restarting investment as we had reached at the end of 2006 the upper limit of our bracket in EBITA that we had fixed for ourselves and you too And we have reinvested most of this money into emerging countries into strengthening our position on the portfolio of activities into emerging countries, and we see very strong dynamics in emerging countries. Sometimes very much pushed by the domestic dynamics of it, the equipment of India, the equipment of China, the equipment of many other smaller countries, we never speak of them. But Schneider has an historical on reinforcing our presence in those many countries, but also pushed by the fantastic amount of money going or deriving from oil and gas, and deriving from mining and minerals. Many of those countries have huge resources in those two things, and this creates a wealth of money which is invested directly in those sectors, or aside of those sectors into reinvestment. And we are extremely well-positioned to capture those investments. So that's about the sales.</p>
          <p>I can answer also about pricing. I've taken, we've taken as a team, a very conservative approach to our raw material again this year. And we've started our price increases. I remind you that two years ago I was, we were collectively blunt by a wrong appreciation of the raw material increase. We missed one semester of price increases. Since then we've struck between 140 to &#x20AC;155 million of price increases every semester, and we are starting this semester taking assumptions against the assumption of the specialists on saying that there will be new raw material increases. And what I saw in silicon city yesterday makes me think that we are right to do so.</p>
          <p>Now what I like is that pricing is not only -- when people say pricing they see it as a least price increase. That's not at all what we do. It's control of the refined control of the way you price your products and market your products. And sometimes you can decrease your prices on high volume, attractive products, while you will get higher prices on some parts, other parts of the offer. And in many other cases, it's the way you manage your pricing on projects on bigger deals, which has been really controlled in the past year and a half inside Schneider on where we can see improvement. So we're going to keep on working on that.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just add a word maybe on raw materials. There has been a slowdown, a reduction in raw material prices between, let's say, September and January. But in the course of last week, we have a sort of an index, a composite index, made of silver, copper, steel, the raw materials that we are actually buying on the market. And this composite index was slightly less than 10% higher than the average cost of our raw material over 2007. So the situation is not as striking as it used to be in 2006 and 2007, but there is still a potential for raw material price increases. That's why we have been very -- Jean-Pascal and the commercial team have been very determined to continue to push prices, sales prices, upward.</p>
          <p>Regarding the liquidity structure, because this is your question, you're right in saying that we have about &#x20AC;2.5 billion of facilities maturing by the end of 2009. Therefore, we have a very good liquidity for the coming two years. What are we planning to do? Well, we have several options. First of all this &#x20AC;2.5 billion only represents, I would say, two-thirds or so of our generated free cash flow over two years. Second, we may go on the bull market. Three, we may also renew some existing banking facility, or do private placements. So we have a large range of solutions that we are going to assess in the coming two years, and we'll decide in due time, that is, of course, on the market opportunities.</p>

          <p>There is a part of the rebalancing which is driving relative, immediate relative advantage in terms of cable cost cost but the year-to-year increase in terms of inflation is higher. So we used to measure our pricing performance in respect to the raw material, but now we are now more and more measuring it to the raw material plus the labor inflation in production. James? Sorry, Nick. I didn't see you at the mic, so it will cross over.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a few questions. If you look at emerging markets growing at about 20%, that implies that you're essentially looking for zero growth in mature markets, is that correct? And then in terms of services, how much do they represent now in terms of revenues? And, obviously, you had a slight negative mix in 2007. How do you see that mix going forward? Thirdly, in terms of acquisitions, I mean, you're 48% leveraged your targets about 40%. Can we expect to see any deals? Any medium size to larger deal in the current year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. On your first question, so emerging countries will represent probably 35% of our sales next year, and we've taken hypothesis for 2008 at this stage which are lower than 20%. 20% is what we did so we've come to lower hypothesis. Now, do we see signs that where it should slow down? Probably not today. But okay, right, we've taken anyway more because, again, reading at your stories, there might be a spill-over. I don't see that in what we do because most of what we do is linked to domestic market; it's linked to domestic logics of those countries plus the production they do and the money they get from their natural resources. So that's two very powerful motives of the demand in energy, but clearly we've taken our efforts, which is always on the result of this year and, hopefully, I hope that we can get that hypothesis formed and get better than what we have taken as a first hypothesis.</p>
          <p>Services; with the introduction of APC, which had the strong production component, the value of the total services, and we just, if we focused on installed based services, I'm speaking about installed base services, that was in the accounts of 2007 roughly &#x20AC;1.4 billion. So that's below the 10% that we used to be speaking about.</p>
          <p>But the fact is that APC had a lower component of services and Pelco doesn't have any. So this is something that we are developing in APC. By the way, you remember, it was one of the classical problem of APC, the large systems, that they went into the large systems as if it was a small system, on a transactional basis, while the customer anyway was needing services. So this is where we are, and this has been growing close to 20% again last year. So it has been a good ride again on services.</p>
          <p>We are mapping our installed base. We are cultivating forming our installed base, which is a thing we are not used to do. And if there is one thing where we have invested in mature countries, actually, it has been the bulk of the new investment we've done in -- or the small investment we've done in 2007, it was in the services to form and develop that installed base together with energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>Acquisitions; well, the priority is definitely to, as I said, consolidation, streamlining, globalization. If there are still small, medium bolt-on acquisitions, this is what we are looking at, around us when there are opportunities but really, most of our focus today has been on working on our operations. But, obviously, we've done a few also last year, but they are rather small or medium, and they complement the strategic plan that we've explained in the past four years. Nick, I was not trying to skip you, I tell you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Nick Paton at JPMorgan. First question is on the corporate costs. You've done a new split now by geography. Could you give us a rough idea of the <mark type="inaudible" />? And second question is for 2009 we have some quite detailed forecasts for the critical power business, but for the other 86% of your business will, obviously, will have the Group targets. Could you maybe give us a feel for how the margin is going to move in the automation control business and the electrical distribution and also make a comment on what's going on in automation to see the margin fall like that year-over-year? And on the third question, you've talked about streamlining the business. Where do you see that there might be some potential for making divestments or spilling out small businesses that you've perhaps acquired and found surplus to requirements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For corporate cost, I mean, you can use a very simple rule of thumb by locating it on the basis of sales. I mean, there is no reason to have a different allocation rule, which was done in the years before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the profitabilities by our main lines of business, what we call the business units, as you know, the daily life in Schneider Electric is more by countries, it's actually a bit more diverse than this, but I would say 80% of the daily life is by geographies, and this is why we report more precisely the P&amp;L evolution by country. So I won't make a speech. CPCS, we have a very specific attention, the capacity to have a vertical opportunity because we've taken a vertical organization to it, which is not so much a case with power and automation. So I don't want to get into a detailed perspective for next year. Concerning automation, on your possible concern or worry about the decrease, I wouldn't say the fall, but the decrease of profitability, which is arriving here, it's coming from two points. One, our basis of production is still too European, and we've suffered with developments in non-euro countries of the imbalance. This is a place where we have suffered while in other places we've benefited of our rebalancing. The second thing is that this is a place where we have invested, and especially in emerging countries because this activity is still not enough developed in emerging countries, and this is something that you find in the decrease of profitability. But otherwise we see an activity, which is big for us. The total is 5 billion. Everything we do in controls, and it has a very good profitability, and you realize that, strategically, it is the earth of intelligence of the system, it is accord the intelligence, and this is where you really control your energy management and your energy efficiency, would it be in terms of productivity, or would it be in terms of energy consumption. So for us, it's not a separate activity, this is embedded in what we do in power, and this is really the tower of control of what we do in energy distribution. And actually this is benefiting, especially in the key verticals where -- that we mentioned, there is a very strong interaction between automation and power because power by itself is a big component of the P&amp;L of our customers. Concerning your last question, we have a permanent scrutiny or review of our portfolio, and normally we inform you in due time when we consider to do something, but it's something that we are reviewing internally. Now, face the reality, we've optimized quite a lot our portfolio in the past years. Actually, we did a few divestments that we didn't even communicate too much, like Amume but it was very small. I think we have most of it. Anyway, we are always reviewing our portfolio and making considerations. Where do I start? There.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. First of all, on your IT program, you took a provision of722 million related to, I think, the Capgemini contract. You have been targeting, I think, about 100 basis points of margin improvement from IT cost savings as part of the new2 plan. Could you let us know, is that -- I assume some of that is, clearly, already in the P&amp;L, but is there still more of that yet to come, or should we assume that there are no further cost savings to come from the IT part of the new2 plan? And then secondly, just going back to the industrial automation part of the portfolio, you talk about the either synergies with the power business, but obviously, many of your competitors are also moving more into software and selling their automation products through, perhaps, their process automation industries. Do you think that there is a more strategic question to be had about your industrial automation business, and do you think you have to invest a lot more to shift effectively where you can compete with your industrial automation portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want answer the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding our IT cost, several considerations. First of all, it is true that we have a global program aiming at reducing over time our IT cost, and this was a part of new2. In this respect, you know that the building up of our global core system and its deployment has been delayed, we have indicated that at several occasions, by about two years, to be fair with you. So we'll get the fruits of it, with some delay, but we are still aiming over time at getting the benefit of it with a magnitude, which is close to what we indicate. And probably, even higher over time when we'll be in a position to deploy, let's say, all support function costs through shared service centers, and therefore, reducing sharply a dislocation of support function costs. This is the first element of answer. The second element of answer, it is true that the renegotiation of our agreement with Capgemini will result in four portions, and in particular, for Eastern Europe, Schneider Electric reinforcing its information system. And we have been prudent in writing down the provision, because we suspect there will be, at this occasion, some additional operating costs to do that, and this is the reason for which we have provisioned &#x20AC;72 million. So our guess is that for, let's say, the coming two or three years, which will be the needed time to finalize the building up of our core system and deployment, our information system costs should increase per annum of the magnitude of, let's say, 20 to &#x20AC;30 million. This is our best guess as of today, and this is for 2008, '09 and '10, if you like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then bring a lot of productivity benefits inside the company, because again 100 IT systems, 200 more factories, 100 logistic centers, plus the new ones for acquisitions, we are back to -- in the magnitude of 400 plus. 800,000 references; actually, the more we dig, the more we find more -- the more we find, so it's probably more close to 1 million on managing that kind of complexity with a totally inconsistent IT. It's costing us a lot in this cost because this means a lot of people making translations, taking datas from one place and introducing it to the other system, and any consolidation means people, people, people, so at the end of the deployment of which all of this is coming transparently inside the company and it will be major productivity transparency on reactivity gains inside the company. And 2008 will be quite key because it's really the start of the deployment of the full system. Right, so that was -- you are speaking then about automation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Automation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Automation, so I guess your question is more referring to industrial automation, because we believe that if we want to be the energy manager, in its form of efficiency, in its form of productivity, we have to get the intelligence of the system in every kind of application, which is in the home, in the building, in an infrastructure and in industry. So now if we focus about infrastructure on industrial automation, you referred to process automation.</p>
          <p>Historically, there have always been two sectors of automation in that field. One is process automation, which people are doing this year, and discreet automation, which people are doing machine-by-machine kind of processes. It's clear that Schneider has never been on the DCS side. And if you look at the history, whatever the prospective guy and the scientists have said, there have been very little crossovers from the PLC, which is the world of the discreet, to the field of the DCS. Probably only Siemens has really done that kind of crossover with a form of success. What we've seen is the PLC getting into the DCS application, that's clear. I mean in many cases, the PLC is creeping up in the historical side of the DCS.</p>
          <p>So I don't think the history in automation -- this is a sector where the story of product, volume doesn't make much sense. What makes sense is your knowledge of application. And actually it's a field where you've seen recently, some small actors taking market shares. Taking market shares because they have not the volume of the product and the systems, but they have the most or more consistent product or competitive products for that form of application. We have one example, for instance, it's a group, it's a company called Elau based in Germany, specialized in packaging machines. When you speak to those guys, they don't say, I'm doing automation, they say, I'm doing packaging. And those guys are having a tremendous EBIT, tremendous growth on the tech market share from the historical guys.</p>
          <p>So our position in automation has been to refocus our effort of one map of delivery to the customer, to solutions; to optimize our roadmap completely around some key -- on target applications. This is being done. If I look at just industrial automation, last -- in 2007, it grew by 9%, which is better than some of our competitors -- big competitors. And if you take our global size in industrial automation and you exclude the electro-mechanicals where we are leaders, we are bigger, but you just focus on software like Scada, a collaborative platform of automation design, which is Scada plus Unity plus UAG, has been a suite of software to design a complete application, plus the PLC, plus the drives, plus the motion, plus the touch screen. We have the volume activity here which is as big in this field as our American colleague. So this is an activity which is strategically important because it mixes more and more with electrical distribution, especially when you target mining minerals, when you target oil and gas with the energy intensive applications. And we see more and more benefits to be able to mix our power activities together with our automation activities.</p>
          <p>On the power activities, on especially intelligent power activities, automated power activities, we've got to hedge our competition. So the name of the game is not strictly the same. We won't deliver the most complicated system that can go for the most sophisticated automotive manufacturing, but we deliver simply rugedized and integrated automation systems with the power management to be able to manage all productivity on efficiency equation of focus. And frankly, we find more and more customers who are fed up with the growing complexity of some of the usual industrial systems. And they are more interested by TCO and the upside, because at the end of day, you find less and less qualified engineers to startup rocket science kind of systems. So our focus is to go for simplicity, time to the market, pragmatic approach to automation. It seems to get some good resonance on the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one final question. Given you've got obviously APC or critical power margin targets extending beyond '08 and now the IT cost savings coming in beyond '08. Will you be unveiling a new three plant for margin targets beyond 2008 sometime later this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will finish first year 2, which is end 2008. We have kind of integrated in our culture in the company, that's we don't start something if we've not finished the first half. And we have still things we do in year 2 and we finish year 2, and we're going to be speaking to you at the end of the year or beginning of the next year, but expect something in continuity that will be the next step in our evolution. And by the way in the presentation of today, you already got some flavor of where we want to go for the next step of our evolution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. James Moore, Goldman Sachs. Could you just talk a little more about the IT issue? I know CAPGEMINI have lost a couple of hundred million euros on this over the last few years. And you talk about insourcing. What's the balance of risk on the remaining two years of the core program, and what happens if that continues to be late? Do you face further risk on provisions?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you were commented Jean-Pascal in Le Figaro of talking about maybe consolidating some of your growth and focusing more on margin. I know last time, we had a downturn, Schneider protected margins much better than all of the other players in the market, but you were perhaps prepared to lose a little more market share than Cutler-Hammer and other players in the electrical distribution market. Is that what you're referring to in the article in Le Figaro when you talk about consolidating the position?</p>
          <p>And also, you talked about pricing and raw materials. Your raw material headwind was 132 million in the first half, dropped to 67. Given what we know about raw material prices staying high, is that sustainable that lower headwind on the raw materials side? Also, you talked about prices being up in project versus perhaps some of your commoditized products. You talked last year about project installations being a third of your business and being a 9% margin and being one of the potential upsides of the Group. Could you talk a bit about where margins are today in service installation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not installations. We never spoke about installations. We spoke about projects. We spoke about solutions. We didn't speak about installations. It's very different and we can spend some time on that. Well, not today, but <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to elaborate on the IT situation, we &#x2013; I think we are in a much better situation because we have a much better visibility. We have a much better visibility for basically three reasons. First of all, our global cost system has already been tested in India, in its first version. And the second version is being tested, so we'll have normally a deployable global core system, let's say, at the end of this first half. And this of course, obviously, makes us confident for its deployment, because it would have been tested twice.</p>
          <p>Second, as you know, we have had a complex and difficult relationship with CAPGEMINI and we signed a revised revisited agreement, which I think may make both parties confident about the sustainability of this agreement. And a part of this agreement, and this is the third reason, it's the reinforcing of a part of our information system in particular for Eastern Europe, as I said it. So for those three reasons, we have a better visibility. We have better agreements. We have a more balanced agreement. We have a call system, which is being deployable as of the end of May, and therefore, we have a better &#x2013; we are confident about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fact is that we re-insource because we feel that on those geographies, which is <mark type="inaudible" />, Cap couldn't deliver, and we're going to be delivering more efficiently, and at a lower cost. And that's it. So Antoine said we'd cut, we cut the situation and went back to primitive things. They promised something they absolutely were not able to deliver. Now 60% of the system has been tested, up and running and the next one is an upgrade of the system which has been tested.</p>
          <p>About the profitability on the article in <mark type="inaudible" /> I guess you are referring to. Well, this is an interview that was given. It was balanced between growth and profitability and they kept on with the profitability side of it. So that's a -- but I believe that running a company is managing your growth profile on the profitability equation at the same time, I spend a lot of my time to explain the strategic kind of changing the growth profile, and I would say the even the mission of Schneider Electric to do well in the past three or four years. And we still need to do something because some of the people still see circuit breakers on construction market on that set. But we are clearly moving very heavily to energy management on all of its components, safety, reliability, efficiency and productivity, with all of its components on clearly more caring on growing segments. I think we've done our job. We need to keep on talking, exemplifying, and results have to show the pertinence of this repositioning.</p>
          <p>But at the same time we've not spoken that much about what we are doing in profitability, well we've done already a lot. But I believe that a round of major acquisitions, or numerous acquisitions. We are going to be spending more of our managerial times in simplifying, de-complexifying on streamlining the company, therefore, more emphasis on cash conversion and on costs reduction. That was the point of that article.</p>
          <p>On the raw material increase, I don't want to substitute myself to Pierre, but basically, we don't know as many of the people in this room. So we take a pessimistic view and we price. And we price as much as we can. At the end of the day, the markets are such, and the law of the markets are such that probably the final pricing hedge will be corresponding to the raw material increase because of competitive pressures will be probably balanced. But the fact is that over the past semesters we've developed a capacity to other price respect to the raw material, and that is very positive.</p>
          <p>You spoke about the resilience also. Our last point of reference for resilience test is 2001, 2003 which was a very heavy through, especially in the US. At that time clearly Schneider resisted much better than many of our competitors. I think we are in much better shape today, far better shape than we were at that time, for many reasons. First, our exposition, at that time was on the industry on construction, and today we've diversified dramatically our exposure. I mean infrastructure, high tech datacenters. We've really -- utilities, we've developed our position on many places. Residential, yes, residential may not be sexy in the US, may be a bit tougher in the Europe this time. But our strong sweet spot is in Asia. And in Asia they need houses, and luxury houses from the talk of it, so that's one.</p>
          <p>Second thing, is that at that time we are making and I was heard of international at that time, and I know I was treated in the company, I was like the exotic, do what you can kind of zone. Today its 35% of our exposure, and this is place where we as a management team are putting our money, that's point two.</p>
          <p>Point three, the model of the company has not changed. It's always very not integrated. It has even improved in that side. We've de-integrated a part of the upstream chain, and we've worked even more with integrators down of the chain. So, we are more resilient than ever in terms of capacity, to adjust our capacity.</p>
          <p>And the final point is that at that time, we had a lot of our factories that were in automated kind of setup in major countries. We've moved massively that into low cost countries, manual, which are much easier to run up and down according to the demand. So one last point is that I feel that I have a management team, which has been through all this because most of us have been in the company for years. And we've been through the last trough, and the people I have onboard are people who know how to make decisions in front of those events. So I don't wish it. I don't see it in my figures. But those things are ready, if it has to happen in major countries.</p>

Firstly, just on Pelco, could you give us pro forma sales growth in '07 and its EBITA margin please on the integration so as far as that this? And then the second question is just on pricing. Could you explain to us why pricing has been so much stronger in North America, or the push through of pricing has been so much stronger in North America in '07? Is it structural, and is that something we can understand that can continue going forward? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Pelco is just on the acquisition side, the end of the year, just where we had said it would be, so to the cent. So there is no surprise, no up surprise or down surprise. Just at the end of the day we are -- we closed in October, so it a was very short story for us in 2007. Now we've done the first announcement of restructuring last week, or two weeks ago with the closing of a few two sides from restructuring. So that has started on the CEO or is being them who use to be the CEO of building automation in the US, and so he's taken over the direction of this entity and is doing very well. On pricing, I just have an answer that when our North America division is taking one problem, it's making it in a very, very structured way, and they are far better than any other on -- in doing that. So I am just asking to all the other divisions to go there, copy and paste, as simple as this.</p>
