          <p>I am very, very glad to say welcome to this presentation on Nordea's Third Quarter Report of this year. The plan for the day is that Christian Clausen, CEO and Group President will start with the presentation of the report. And after that you're welcome to stay in your seat and ask questions to Christian, Fredrik Rystedt and Carl-Johan Granvik, who is the CFO and CRO of Nordea.</p>
          <p>And after couple of questions, analysts are invited to stay seated here to continue asking questions to Fredrik and Carl-Johan, whereas journalists can move over in that direction to the corner and ask individual questions to Christian. The press conference will be webcasted, so please when you ask questions state your name and who you represent, so that everyone can follow.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I welcome Christian to take the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to this meeting. I am proud to be able to present another very strong quarter from Nordea. I will start by giving highlights, net interest income is up 1% on the quarter commission income is up 6%, expenses are down 3%, loan losses are in line with our expectations at 54 basis points, operating profit is actually up 2% on the quarter and risk-adjusted profit is down 6% on the quarter, but it's up 30% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And in a bit more detailed fashion &#x2013; I know you can not read all the figures here, but if we also look at the year-on-year results, year-to-date you can see that the total income is up 16%, profit before loan losses is up 31%, and risk-adjusted profit is up 36%.</p>
          <p>And let's dive a bit more into the various issues. First of all, net interest income. Net interest income is up 1%. We continue to increase our margins and reprice our book towards our corporate customers. We are repricing because of the increased credit risk and the increased liquidity premiums, lending to the public is up 2% and it's mainly the household lending that is driving this, corporate lending is slightly down, I'll come back to that, but household lending is up 5%.</p>
          <p>The pressure on deposit margins is still high, but it's leveling off. The impact in Q3 is 50 million and with this very low interest rate level it's not going to be significant in the quarters going forward.</p>
          <p>Net commission income is up 6%, very positive trend, savings commissions is up 7%, cards and payments is up, lending commissions is actually up 20%, very much because we have lead managed a number of big bond issues for our Nordic customers. And the difference between Q3 last year and this quarter is mainly the expense &#x2013; commission expense for the state guarantee schemes of &#x20AC;52 million.</p>
          <p>Net gains/losses remains at a high level, it's mainly the customer driven activity towards our customers in the corporate segment that continue to perform, life and pension also delivers in this quarter a very good result and the contribution from Group Treasury is lower.</p>
          <p>Cost management remains in focus. Expenses, is actually down 3% on the quarter, but compared to the same quarter last year costs are up 3% and it's up 7% in local currencies. This means that the cost-to-income ratio is down to 48% from 53 one year ago. We have reduced the number of employees by nearly 1,000 an increase &#x2013; decrease of 3%.</p>
          <p>Loan losses are stabilizing. They are in line with our outlook and an increasing share of the loan losses are now collective provisions. It's a 140 million (sic) [114 million] out of the 358 million. So the total 54 basis point can be decomposed, so 37 basis points are individual provisions, 17 basis points are collective and 50 basis points is number, if we exclude the government guarantee schemes, the Danish one. The number is significantly higher in the Baltics and I'll get back to that.</p>
          <p>So this means that the loan losses are still developing according to our expectation and this graph, I also showed you last time. Our risk profile and our risk management systems expect to deliver a 25 basis points loan loss over the total cycle. And as you can see here, we've had several quarters with no loan losses or actually reversals and now we have some quarters with loan losses in the level of 50 basis points. Everything still points to the rationale that this risk profile will hold, that we will stay around this 25 basis points or it maybe even below over the cycle. So that is actually encouraging.</p>
          <p>The operating profit is at a very high level, and as you can see from this graph the blue bars, we have actually managed to keep the operating profit throughout the crisis at a very high level. So the increased revenues have nearly compensated &#x2013; or very closely compensated for the loan losses. This is a very unique result among European banks to actually be able to go through the crisis with not one single quarter of decreased result.</p>
          <p>The macro pressure on the economy is easing, impaired loans increase at a lower pace. Impaired loans now up 9% in the quarter. 57% of the impaired loans are still performing, meaning that its early indications of maybe potential future problems. The total allowances are up 15%. We have now a coverage ratio of 51%, which is very healthy, and the collective provisions, which have not been identified is now 40% of total allowances.</p>
          <p>On the Baltics, we still have a well-diversified Baltic portfolio. The majority of the corporate lending in Baltics is to very solid segments and as you can see from the three first lines, large local companies, Nordic and international companies and state exposures together is the majority of the corporate exposure. Here the impaired loans are low and reservations are low. And if you move to the bottom line, we have the area, which are experiencing problems, is the mid-sized local companies where our lending exposures are only 1.9 billion. But here we also see the impaired loans being fairly high, just as we see in the economies at large. We will still like to repeat that we still have a stable credit situation in the Baltics and we are in a good way, in a well-structured way working our way through the downturn there.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong capital position. We have one of the strongest core capital positions in Europe, and they're even going up, because we continue to produce strong net earnings. We also issued a Tier 1 hybrid during the quarter, and we have lower risk weighted assets. The risk weighted assets as you can see on the bottom part of the graph is gradually managed down, due to lower corporate exposures, but also to smaller impact from the rating migration.</p>
          <p>We have a very strong liquidity position and it's very much in line or even better than the upcoming regulation we are going to see. We expect the regulation to introduce these three metrics mentioned here going forward, implemented throughout 2010. The first one is the core funding ratio. The ratio between retail deposits and wholesale funding, and here we are very well in line with the levels being discussed.</p>
          <p>Another metric is the survival period, which is a measure to withstand liquidity stress. Here the regulators, European regulators, are talking about a survival period of one month. We have increased our <mark type="inaudible" /> and today we have a survival period of around two years, which is clearly above one month obviously.</p>
          <p>The third metric is net stable funding, which is a new one introduced in regulation. But we actually had a similar one in Nordea for several years; we call it net balance of stable funding. I have actually been presenting this several times. And it shows how well we are funded on the longer horizon, and here we can say that we are very comfortable within the levels being discussed. So, all the new regulation are clearly met by Nordea, even though it's not in force yet.</p>
          <p>We set up three very ambitious targets for Nordea, for creating a great Nordea three years ago &#x2013; total shareholder return, risk adjusted profit, and return on equity. And if we follow up on that, we can say we are clearly above actually all three targets.</p>
          <p>On risk-adjusted profit, as you can see here, we are clearly above the red line, which represents the 10% annual growth on risk-adjusted profit, which we set out as very ambitious targets and which many analysts thought was very ambitious but we are actually quite well ahead as you can see. We started well ahead of the line. We had a few quarters just below the line, exactly as expected, during the downturn, but now recent quarters have delivered very strongly and now we are well ahead of that target.</p>
          <p>The other target was to be in top quartile on total shareholder return, and this is the whole period from 1st of January, '07, when we set the target. And as you can see, we are clearly in top quartile. We are still slightly below minus 2.9, but, of course, it's clearly better than a lot of banks who have lost more than half of their value.</p>
          <p>The third metric is return on equity where we wanted to be in line with the top Nordic peers, and as you can see the average for the period, we are ahead of all the peers and also the average of the peers. We still need one or two more to report, so it may change slightly, but I don't think it will change the overall picture. So, well ahead of our long-term targets.</p>
          <p>Let me also give a few comments as to the business development in Nordea, and it's important for us to stress and underline exactly how we execute on our growth strategy very much &#x2013; very importantly in these times. First of all, I'd like to say that our strong brand continues to work very well. On the household segment, we have a huge number of customer meetings, the so-called 360-degree meetings, where we advise customers. We have moved very much closer to the customers in this period, and this has served us well. It serves the customers very well. They are uncertain about the future and the economic position, and it serves us very well because we have a possibility very early to detect problems.</p>
          <p>So we have large inflow of new customers, 30,000 new Gold customers in the quarter. Also private banking &#x2013; the number of private banking customers is up in a very healthy way, and this means that we have a growth in lending in the segment. We have increased the market share on the household lending, and we have increased number of transactions both on funds and equities and others. In general, I would say, this whole strategy on the household segment is extremely important. And we have been very happy to see how well it has been working in this period.</p>
          <p>This also goes for the corporate segment. The corporate strategy is to be a house-bank for our corporate customers has worked well. We have continued to support our customers throughout the crisis and this has been rewarded. The customers, of course, like to see their banks stand by them, when they are having liquidity issues. The strongest trend we see among the largest and international corporates. And as you can see the total income is developing very nicely and our income for corporate lending is up significantly.</p>
          <p>Our capital market strategy keeps to be executed. We keep servicing our customers with these risk-management products, which are so important. I think all corporate customers have realized, those who did not do it already, that managing risk is key and this crisis have shown that. So the activity level here is still very high. We see some normalization of the margins in the area, which were a very high level in the early parts of the year. It was still a very strong execution. We also see that our activity on the debt capital markets has increased significantly. So we are providing our corporate customers with increasing and significant financing during this period.</p>
          <p>And this is also reflected in these league tables. The first one here to your left is the league table on the Eurobond issues. You all know that the Eurobond market has taken off &#x2013; taken on a significant part of the financing of European industries. And here we have the league table for the Nordic issues from Nordic corporate customers. And as you can see, we're competing head-to-head with large European and global banks and we're actually doing very well. We have very strong market share here and are clearly competing head-to-head on this very important area.</p>
          <p>The other table is the equity market league table on the Nordic equities issued for Nordic corporates and also here we're doing well, at the first place. All showing that this whole area of providing capital and debt financing to our corporates is actually at a very high level. So maybe our corporate lending is down 1% that's the lending we take on the books, but the lending we actually provide to the corporate customers is up significantly. And we're gaining significant market share in this environment where our main competitors are the global banks.</p>
          <p>We also have a strong inflow in our savings area. Assets under management, is up 12%, we've now reached &#x2013; &#x20AC;12.7 billion and we've now reached &#x20AC;149 billion in assets under management. Strong inflows of 2.9 billion, both in the institutional, private banking and very much on retail funds where we see the strongest increase in three years and here we are leading in several countries including Sweden for the highest inflow of all providers. We also have a very strong performance. Since the beginning of the year, 79% of our funds have beaten their benchmark and in Q3, the figure is actually 90%, which is uniquely high.</p>
          <p>We also have a positive business momentum in our Life area. We are clearly the largest Life insurer in the Nordics. We have increasing premiums and we're doing very well in our Finnish unit-linked business. We still see very strong sales in Sweden, our endowment products Placera. And also we have success in the Swedish ITP where we have the highest market share of the transfer of capital within this area. Our investment process and investments results are strong. So, we are gradually building the buffers again in the Life business, which also means it has been possible for us to take out a good result this quarter from our Life business.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency programs, keeps to be very important to us. We are executing the right-sizing initiatives and we have reduced the number of employees by 3%. We set the target of 2%, exactly down 3% &#x2013; 1,000 people. But it is important to stress that during the same period we have actually employed 1,200 people. So we keep this efficiency program going where we take out people from the value chain at the back end of the business and employ new people on the customer areas to grow the business. And you can see that the cost/income ratio as I already mentioned is now down to 48.</p>
          <p>So we are constant &#x2013; consistently delivering on our growth strategy. We have a strong resilience. We have delivered on our growth initiatives, and as you can see since 2006 our quarterly income is growing fast to a level, which is above our long-term targets.</p>
          <p>And this means that the journey towards great Nordea continues along the strategy. We are saying that it's clear that the overall risks levels in the markets have come down. Financial markets have stabilized and the risks levels are lower. It's also clear that we have a position of strength and therefore we will proceed on a prudent growth path. We will still stay carefully balance between risk and opportunities because there's still uncertainty exactly how the strength of the economic recovery is.</p>
          <p>Please note, I say, economic recovery, so it's clear that we have seen the burden. It is also clear that the recovery is gradually coming on, but it is not clear exactly how strong it is and exactly how it's going to play out. So we still see that there are some risks out there.</p>
          <p>This means that our outlook statement is more or less unchanged. We expect the risk-adjusted profit to be higher this year than last year. Cost growth for 2009 will be approximately at the same level for the year as we have seen. And loan loss provisions, which this year so far has been at 55 basis points, we expect them to be broadly in line for the full year, still highlighting that of course risks that they could be somewhat higher.</p>
          <p>And this means that our key messages today are these three ones. Results remain at a very high level. Operating profit is up 2%. We're over delivering on our long-term targets. We've strong business development and increasing the number of customers and market shares.</p>
          <p>We continue to execute our efficiency programs and the constant delivery on our growth strategy and we continue the journey towards great Nordea with this careful balance between risk and opportunities, I mentioned.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. I would like Fredrik and Carl-Johan Granvik, to come on the stage, so we can answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I am Christian Hall from Swedbank. I just wanted to ask you a question regarding how you view the 2010 growth efforts. You have &#x2013; the local currency cost growth this year is 7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How would you see that figure next year, would it be roughly the same number or are you looking at more of &#x2013; more offensive view or maybe slightly lower numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've not given any outlook for 2010 and we are of course working on our plan for 2010. But maybe I'm indicating something by saying, we continue on the journey to what's great. We still have a number of initiatives and you remember that we last winter said, now we will for a period go to middle of the road approach where we take down some of the initiatives and focus very much on risk. We still do that. But of course, some of these initiatives can of course be reinitiated again. And I think we have a lot of opportunities in that area for doing things better. We've come a long way, but a lot of things can be improved and we have a lot of good opportunities to grow. So we are working on those plans and we'll come back to the outlook for '10 when we meet next time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yes, should I go ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. You mentioned that you were pretty comfortable that you would reach the external to discuss the net stable funding ratio. And I was just wondering if you could perhaps clarify a bit what external level has actually been &#x2013; what level has actually been discussed externally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe if can take that question. It's too early to actually discuss because there's still fairly informal discussions and it actually varies both in terms of definition and levels between the different FSAs, and other regulatory authorities. So the way we have measured it &#x2013; and I think Christian previously mentioned that we have presented it here, is an absolute number and we have set a target on the absolute number. We have &#x2013; just from various discussions we have concluded that we are well in line with the coming regulations in different jurisdictions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I can say that talking to regulators in Europe and globally at the IMF meeting only two weeks ago, its clear that the target which sets a positive balance, meaning that long-term funding is higher than long-term liabilities, of course is something that would stand up very well in this regulation, that's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Without going then into the actual levels, what's your feeling when it comes to Nordea's position relative to other Nordic banks, is it the sense, this is true for most of the Nordics or do you stand out also in the Nordic perspective even?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of liquidity management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of stable funding ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, it's clear that we have a very conservative approach. You can see this actually from the liquidity buffer. The definitions between the banks are very different in many different areas. And we have in comparable terms always applied. I should dare to say the most conservative approach. So, I think we compare very well towards our peers in this respect, actually in all of these matters.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not comment on possible acquisitions. We never do that. So, I cannot comment on this one either.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, also not on maybe other possibilities in the Baltic region?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can say that, we've been saying very clearly that we're opening &#x2013; we are open for discussing and looking into acquisition possibilities. We have this year made two acquisitions, not big ones, but reasonable ones in Denmark with Roskilde Bank, Fionia Bank and we will have happy to look at other possibilities. So, that's our general stance. But I will not comment individual banks or individual possibilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And then I think we have the man in gray here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rickard Henze from ABG, aka, the man in gray. Can you comment on the trading income, you continued to slap the analyst fingers here, even though its somewhat boosted by a very strong life insurance quarter. Looking forward, should we expect the trading income to stay at this level or is it due to the un-normal markets we are seeing out there still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very difficult to say, because we can say for sure that we are pursuing the strategy of rolling out the service to still more corporate customers. The activity level is very high and we have increasing number of transaction and increasing number of customers. And I showed you the league tables activity is still very high. But of course, the other part of it is the margin in this area and as some of the international banks gradually recover from their problems, they start to compete even more again. So, some of the margins are gradually coming down, which you also can see in our results. So what will actually happen to the margin is very uncertain, because this is also one of the areas where the international regulation requires much more capital going forward. And therefore, I will question how strong the competition and margins will actually be because it will take more capital to run this operation. So we cannot say about the total number, but I can say that our activity on this area will remain high and we will have more customers and more transactions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I think we had, yes the man in black.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Magnus Andersson at ABG. Just following up on the regulatory discussion we had before. You highlighted yourself that you're well above your Tier 1 ratio target of 9%. I was just wondering, do you perceive yourself as being over capitalized at this stage or is it rather that you think this is the buffer you will need ahead of potential future regulation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, I can start answering that question. I don't think it's fair to say, it's very actually difficult to define what is over capitalized or relevant capitalization. As you aware of, there are so many discussions ongoing for the time being relating to dynamic provisioning and various buffers, et cetera. So I think we are of the absolute belief that having a strong capital base at this point of time is actually good, both to cater for potential future regulation and which are uncertain, of course to have a strong position in general and also to have a strong platform for enabling future growth. So we think we have adequate capital position at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can add in referring into the meeting with global and European regulators and politicians, I would say that, it's clear that we stand out with the strongest quality of capital and one of the highest ratios. At the same time our assets are conservatively put together in the balance sheet. So I think we stand out as a bank, which is clearly one of the strongest and I have not yet heard any &#x2013; or seen any regulation, which will not make this ratio to be sufficient.</p>
          <p>But I think the margin, to the level is going to be much smaller as it is today where we have the 4%. I mean the 4% capital level will easily become six, seven or 8%. At the same time more risk will apply to some of the assets, which means the risk weighted assets may come up. So all-in-all, these 10% and the 8% or the 4% gets much closer. So, I think, we're not that far away from the level, which is needed. If we want to be such a strong bank as we are with an AA rating, very strong funding base, and all these things, then we need a capital base. But there might be some room still in our capital base. But that we will not know until the end of next year when this &#x2013; all this regulation comes together, and we can actually calculate what the effect will be. But I think we are well ahead in this matrice on capital.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we'll have two more questions before we split the crowd up. We can start with the man in the coat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jan Wolter at Deutsche Bank. Two questions, if I may. First on the strategic intent at Nordea, would you say that Nordea lacks any significant assets or product lines in the Nordic or Baltic area that you would like to enhance or complement? Does Nordea lack that in any way if we disregard, I mean, minor or smaller acquisitions like the one you've done in Denmark? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have any product lines, we did a few years ago, had a very weak position on the equity markets and the corporate finance area. But that has been built. We're not there yet, but we're very happy with the development and I showed you the league tables, which is some indication we've progressed to be number one there. It is not all that bad. So, we're developing that. So, today, I think, our offering for the corporate sector as such is fully fledged. We can improve, there are things we want to improve in this offering, more the quality than actually the amount we can do. We think we can improve our cash management.  There are a number of other areas.</p>
          <p>On the household sector, I think, we have everything. There it's a small question about having all the right people out there to service the customers, that's the way we orchestrate these 360-degree meetings. The way we get in new customers and things we can improve with the product line is full and of a high standard in our opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, my interpretation of that answer would be that the board and the senior management of Nordea does not lack any significant asset &#x2013; banking asset in the Nordic area the way you present it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, now I commented product lines. We don't think we lack any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But a wider definition would be product lines within another bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. But because I am saying we want to do much more business with our customers, we want to attract new customers, we want to improve the way we interact with our customers still more. We had great success in actually growing the customer base and doing more business for our customers. We will continue that journey. So, I think, we have a great potential in doing that going forward. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the short &#x2013; next question was, do you see factors internally for volume growth going forward in this environment without giving any prediction, but in your world do you see any factors supporting volume growth in the group going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, as the macro economic development is stabilizing, I'm sure we're going to see the erosion on the corporate side, because the corporates have taken down their working capital. And they do new investments and that is gradually changing now. So I think there will be volume growth there. I still think the need for this risk management &#x2013; balance sheet management products, which I mentioned, is growing and high, and the household sector is characterized more or less of the same thing. So I think there is a potential for volume growth. Of course, it depends on the shape of the recovery. And if we have a clear upturn in the economy next year, I am sure we will see volume growth as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I think we have the last question from the man in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My name is Martinez Shergoz. I'm from a daily newspaper, La Fina Morning. I want to ask, you look quite healthy in the Baltic States if you are compared with other banks. So what is your strategy for next year in the Baltics because you have free hands to be more active in this district?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our strategy in the Baltics now is to work very close with our customers to work our way through this crisis, and we have very good experience for doing that. The more we interact, the early we interact with customers having problems, the better we can solve those problems. That goes for household customers where we have a number of ways we try to help the customer through this &#x2013; their situation, and it also go for the corporate customers. So all these customers have been identified, we are working with them and that takes all our resources and it's absolutely the most important thing we can do. That's actually creating increased satisfaction among customers, and it's the strongest platform for resuming growth when we see the economy turning and when we see that the problems among customers go down. So it's a very simple equation. All our resources are spent right now &#x2013; are used right now for interaction with customers and that is the best way to do it.</p>

          <p>So thank you very much. Then analysts are invited to stay here and ask questions to Fredrik and Carl-Johan, whereas Christian will move over in that direction and answer questions from journalists. Thank you very much.</p>
