        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Dominion's fourth quarter earnings conference call. We now have Mr. Tom Farrell, Dominion's Chief Executive Officer, and other members of management in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of management's prepared remarks, we will open the floor for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before introducing Tom Farrell, I will turn the call over to Laura Kottkamp, Director of Investor Relations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Lindsay. Good morning and welcome to Dominion's fourth quarter earnings conference call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings release, pages from our fourth quarter 2007 earnings release kit or pages from our 2008 earnings guidance kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed, discrete questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules. While we encourage you to call with questions in the time permitted after our prepared remarks, we ask that you use this time to address questions of a strategic nature or those related to 2008 guidance. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit our website, register for email alerts and view our fourth quarter 2007 earnings documents, as well as our 2008 guidance kit. Our website address is www.dom.com/investors.</p>
          <p>Now for the usual cautionary language. The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, estimates, and expectations. Also on this call, we will discuss some measures about our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include operating earnings before interest and tax, commonly referred to as EBIT, and operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings guidance kit.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to our Chairman, President, and CEO, Tom Farrell. Tom?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. Today I am going to highlight the key strategic actions and operational performance from 2007 that will positively affect our performance in 2008 and beyond, address the status of our intended Peoples, Hope divestiture, and review expected regulatory developments in 2008.</p>
          <p>Our call will then deviate from past practice. Tom Chewning will recap our 2007 results, provide our 2008 guidance and discuss our marketing process for Peoples and Hope. We will also have each of the business unit CEOs discuss the drivers influencing their 2008 earnings prospects in contributing to our overall growth. On this topic you will hear from Jay Johnson, Head of Dominion Virginia Power; Paul Koonce, Head of Dominion Energy; and Mark McGettrick, Head of Dominion Generation. Scott Hetzer, our Treasurer, will then discuss our expected financing activities in the coming year. Tom Chewning will then conclude our prepared remarks with comments about 2009 and our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>2007 contained a number of milestones that we believe will have a positive impact on Dominion in the immediate and continued future. With the sale of nearly $14 billion of our non-Appalachian E&amp;P assets, we divested approximately 40% of our earnings stream and returned to a more regulated energy infrastructure company, one that is much less sensitive to the volatility of commodity prices and one that has more stable earnings.</p>
          <p>In light of this changed profile and our outlook for future growth, we used the proceeds for debt repayment and stock repurchases. We realigned our remaining business segments. We significantly increased our dividend and we completed a two-for-one stock split. Additionally, we saw the Virginia Legislature establish new regulation for utilities to address the growing need for power in the state and set new parameters and to ensure a fair rate of return on base rates, as well as certain critical construction projects that will help meet the growing energy needs in our state.</p>
          <p>Last year, Dominion began in earnest to help make Virginia less reliant on imported power and more energy independent. We've already received approval for two of our three Ladysmith peaking units, and they are expected to be in service in the second half of this year. Approval for the third peaker is pending at the State Corporation Commission; we had no interveners in that proceeding. We also submitted an application for a coal and biomass plant in the heart of Virginia's coal country in Wise County. In November, we received an early site permit for our North Anna nuclear plant and submitted our combined operating license, actions that give us optionality to build an additional unit at that site. Just yesterday, the NRC accepted the application as complete. In December, we agreed to purchase a power station development project for a combined cycle gas-fired plant that will generate almost 600 megawatts in the central part of the state. We also filed with the State Corporation Commission for three new electric transmission lines and are awaiting approval this year. Overall, we are on track to develop the additional Virginia infrastructure we laid out to the investment community last September.</p>
          <p>Beyond Virginia's borders, throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, we similarly outlined plans to ensure an adequate future response to rising gas and electric demand. We concluded successful open seasons for our Dominion Hub I, Hub II and Hub III projects, which allow us to bring increased gas supplies from west to east. And we announced plans for an eight-cavern salt storage project in Pennsylvania to increase our gas storage capacity by up to 50 billion cubic feet, an increase in storage capacity of 10 to 15% with an increase in deliverability of nearly 100%.</p>
          <p>Perhaps most critical to meeting customers' and investors' expectations is consistent focus on operational excellence and safety. Strong performance also provides us an opportunity to earn up to a 100-basis-point ROE premium on our Virginia rate base. At Dominion Virginia Power, for example, our average speed in answering customers' calls improved nearly 30% last year. We met a new record peak demand of 19,688 megawatts in August, an increase of over 300 megawatts from the peak set in 2006 and a record demand we did not expect to see until 2009. At Dominion East Ohio, we installed over 130,000 automated meters, bringing our total to over 10% of customers served. In Appalachia, we drilled 365 new wells, an increase of more than 20% over 2006, a year in which we had been the most active driller in West Virginia.</p>
          <p>Our generating facilities met growing demand in Virginia and across our merchant fleet with increased reliability and output. Our fossil merchant coal fleet achieved an equivalent availability of 87.4%, its best annual performance since the acquisition of Dominion New England with Brayton Point setting a station record of 90%. Our Surry nuclear units were on line for a record 286 consecutive days. And our nuclear merchant fleet produced its highest megawatt hour output ever, 21 million led by Kewaunee and Millstone 2. Both Kewaunee and Brayton Point produced more megawatt hours in 2007 than at any time in their entire history of operation.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Dominion plans to achieve the goal of 12% of energy sales from renewable energy sources by 2022, as well as the interim goals of 4% beginning in 2010 and 7% beginning in 2016 established in Virginia law. Achieving these targets will allow us to receive an ROE premium of 50 basis points across our entire rate base. We also plan to meet North Carolina's mandatory goal of 12.5% from renewable resources and energy efficiency by 2021.</p>
          <p>This year with our partner Shell WindEnergy, we expect to put in service the second phase of a 264-megawatt wind farm in West Virginia located adjacent to our Mt. Storm Power Station. Just last week, we announced Fowler Ridge, a wind energy development project in Indiana, where we will be a 50% equity partner of 650 megawatts with BP Alternative Energy. The first phase is expected to be operational by the end of this year. I have recounted many of the cornerstones of an impressive year for us but there were events, which did not happen as we had planned. Foremost was the dissolution of our sales agreement with Equitable for our LDCs [local distribution companies], Peoples and Hope. While we expected a favorable resolution throughout the process, we believed, as did Equitable, that the delay in closing exceeded what we deemed reasonable. For this reason, we are re-marketing the LDCs, which Tom Chewning will discuss in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Turning to 2008, we expect rulings on several key regulatory proceedings and the outcome of the electric capacity market auctions in New England and PJM. February 5 we'll begin the evidentiary hearing for our Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. In December, we filled a revised cost estimate for the plant estimating $200 million of additional capital bringing the total estimate to 1.8 billion. We expect the commission to rule on our filing and establish an ROE including a construction premium for the project in April. As you are aware, the ruling on this project's ROE does not determine the ROE for our base rate case in 2009. We do believe, however, that it sets an important precedent for what criteria are considered.</p>
          <p>This past August, Dominion East Ohio filed its first rate case in over 14 years. We applied for a base rate increase of $73 million. We expect the staff report in late February or early March. Based on orders issued in other proceedings, we are optimistic we will have a rate environment in place this year that recognizes our existing rate base and enables us to make future investments with bare steel pipe, service lines and automated meters with fair returns.</p>
          <p>Just recently, our pipeline unit proactively entered into a settlement with the Independent Oil &amp; Gas Association for new gathering and processing rates effective January 1, 2009 through year-end 2011. The settlement is net neutral to our earnings forecast. This agreement is in keeping with our past practice of settling rate issues before current rates expire, thereby providing certainty to both Dominion and its customers.</p>
          <p>Two of our proposed new transmission lines, Carson to Suffolk in Hampton Roads and Meadow Brook to Loudoun in Northern Virginia are scheduled to have evidentiary hearings February 5 and February 25, respectively, with the approval process expected to continue through the fall of this year. If approved in a timely manner, these lines should be in service in 2011.</p>
          <p>This year we also learned about the next round of capacity auction pricing in PJM and New England. The most important thing we can do to prepare for the auctions is to operate optimally in order to ensure our plants will be available when they have been promised. PJM implemented its reliability pricing model beginning this past June and the final transition year auction was held just last week for the 2010, '11 deliver year. Results will be published on Friday.</p>
          <p>New England's first forward capacity market auction is scheduled to start this coming Monday to procure capacity for the 2010, '11 commitment year and will end no later than next Friday, February 8. The second FCM auction, which will procure capacity for the 2011, '12 commitment year, is scheduled to start on December 1. There has been a large response to the upcoming auction in New England, including the introduction of over 3,000 megawatts of demand side management proposals. While we are highly skeptical the demand side efforts will produce a nearly 10% reduction in New England's peak electric usage in two years, we believe that as a result of these promises prices will clear lower than many may expect in the 2010, '11 capacity auction. Since last fall, our 6% or more annual operating earnings growth plan has assumed that the capacity price will clear at the floor of $4.50 a kW-month.</p>
          <p>I am pleased with where we have come since this time last year. We have a full agenda to accomplish but I am confident that we will continue to perform at the levels required to meet our commitments to our customers and financial guidance to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Chewning.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. Tom mentioned that 2007 is marked with many positive milestones. From a CFO perspective, that seems an understatement. The overall change in our business mix resulted in a forecasted 2008 operating earnings at the upper end of the pro forma we developed in October of 2006 before we announced our E&amp;P divestiture process. Now that we have completed our business and management realignment we will provide quarterly and annual earnings guidance in greater detail. We have formatted our guidance to illustrate how operating segments expect to grow their profit margins and how treasury expects to finance their growth. We believe this approach promotes simplicity and enhances granularity.</p>
          <p>2008 will be the starting point for a number of uplifts. We'll have our first full year with the fuel pass-through in Virginia. We will have a lower debt level on which to pay interest expenses going forward. And we will realize higher capacity and energy prices in New England than we did in 2007. As a result, we are able to provide operating earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.15 per share for the full year of 2008, nearly 20% growth over our 2007 operating earnings. We are also providing operating earnings guidance of 89 to $0.94 per share for the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Before we get too far into 2008 guidance, let me recap briefly our results for last year. For the fourth quarter and the entire year of 2007, the company delivered solid returns led by strong merchant energy margins and strong regulated electric sales, interest expense savings resulting from our debt retirements, and share accretion due to our common stock repurchases. We have recorded operating earnings of $0.52 for the quarter and $2.56 per share for the year. GAAP earnings for the quarter were also $0.52 while GAAP earnings for the year were $3.88 per share, mainly attributable to the net gains from the sale of our non-Appalachia E&amp;P businesses. You can refer to schedules two and three of our earnings release kit for a reconciliation of these earnings. You will notice on schedule one of our earnings release kit that we've broken out both our non-Appalachia E&amp;P and the Peoples and Hope LDC earnings in our Corporate segment. As you recall, Peoples and Hope are classified as assets held for sale, not as discontinued operations.</p>
          <p>Following the termination of the sales agreement with Equitable, we will continue to report earnings in the Corporate segment until the conclusion of a new sales transaction. We still plan to use the incoming proceeds for debt reduction. The rating agencies are aware of the delay in the receipt of these proceeds. Depending on how long the new sales process takes, we may choose to replace bank bridge financing with a capital markets issue that would be callable at the time of the sale. It is our plan to conduct an auction process in March and we anticipate the announcement of a winning bidder and negotiated contract in April.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to our CEOs, I refer you to the 2008 earnings guidance kit on our website. As we detail each of our businesses' drivers, we will refer you to the appropriate page of the kit. As it relates to our operating segments, I remind you that our operating earnings guidance measures will be stated in terms of EBIT or in some cases EBITDA. At the conclusion of the CEOs' discussion, Scott Hetzer will discuss the plans to finance our growth going forward.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Jay Johnson, CEO of the Dominion Virginia Power. Jay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. Dominion Virginia Power, which includes regulated electric transmission and distribution, as well as our unregulated retail activities, is expected to contribute approximately 21% to Dominion's 2008 operating segment earnings. As shown on page 8 in the earnings guidance kit, its forecasted 2008 contribution to EBIT is roughly flat compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>In our electric utility distribution and transmission businesses, we expect weather normalized sales to add 10 to $15 million. However, in 2007 favorable utility weather benefited us by about $11 million. Our forecast incorporates the usual assumption of a return to normal weather so the 11 million is an offset to our sales growth. ED&amp;A in our utility business is expected to increase approximately 16 million year-over-year. This is a result of our growing investment in infrastructure to serve the demand in our robust Virginia service territory. Despite the slowdown in the housing market, we still hooked up just shy of 49,000 new homes and businesses in 2007.</p>
          <p>Our 2008 distribution plan includes targeted investments in customer service and reliability. These investments should enable us to capture performance incentives above base rate ROEs established in the new regulation. Also included in our distribution plan for 2008 is funding for recently approved demand side management and conservation pilots, which support the Governor's comprehensive Virginia Energy Plan.</p>
          <p>In the electric transmission, we are awaiting the outcome of the FERC rate case filed this past fall. Under that filing, our transmission rates would be projected on a formula basis with a fixed ROE. The formula rate will be designed to recover the expected cost of service for each calendar year and will be trued up based on actual cost. This enables us to minimize regulatory lag. We expect the FERC to take further action on this filing by the 1st of April. A favorable outcome will facilitate our plans to modernize our infrastructure in order to meet the growing energy needs. Several companies, including Xcel Energy have recently gotten forward-looking formula rates approved.</p>
          <p>Dominion Retail, our unregulated low-capital, low-risk business has contributed over 140 million to EBIT over each of the last two years. We expect a slight downturn in EBIT due to lower electric customer margins assumed in our 2008 plan versus what was achieved in 2007. Over the 11 years that we have been growing this business we have leveraged the Dominion brand to build a base of 1.6 million customers. We have also strategically identified markets that have unbundled generation or that have consciously developed competitive market designs. The 150,000 customers we are now serving in Massachusetts and Connecticut are evidence of this strategy.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we plan to use these competitive advantages to continue to grow our customer base. Along with our core markets of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, we are targeting further expansion into the Northeast markets of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Maryland. Overall, I would characterize 2008 as a foundational year for future growth in our regulated businesses as the price gap period ends.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it over to Paul Koonce. Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay, and good morning. Dominion Energy, which includes gas transmission, Dominion East Ohio, exploration and production, and producer services, is expected to contribute approximately 23% to Dominion's overall 2008 operating segment earnings. Collectively, these businesses are expected to produce EBIT growth of 16% in 2008 as shown on page 9 of the earnings guidance kit. Separately, our gas transmission unit forecasts EBIT growth of 7%. This growth is a result of a full year's revenue related to our Northeast storage and Cove Point ASU projects and, starting in November, the Cove Point expansion projects. Also in gas transmission, we forecast another record year of gathering, processing and extraction volumes and revenues. These revenues are approximately 80% hedged giving us confidence in our growth.</p>
          <p>We are also very pleased with the progress we are making in our Dominion East Ohio rate case. With the midyear implementation of new rates, we expect Dominion East Ohio's 2008 EBIT to grow 10% over 2007.</p>
          <p>And finally, our E&amp;P team is forecasting production growth of 16%. This will be achieved through a combination of development drilling plus an added emphasis on optimizing existing well deliverability. Adding to the production boost is an increase in average realized price of $1.63 per Mcf. These figures are available on pages 14 and 15 of the guidance kit.</p>
          <p>I am pleased with our year-over-year earnings growth forecast and I will turn the call over to Mark McGettrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Dominion Generation includes the company's regulated and unregulated generating plants and is expected to contribute 56% of the total operating segment earnings in 2008. As I review guidance for my segment, I will be referring to page 10 in the earnings guidance kit, and on that page you will see that Dominion Generation's forecasted EBIT is expected to grow over 30% to approximately $2 billion in 2008. Much of this projected growth is coming from the regulated utility generation that serves our Virginia and North Carolina franchise service territories. In 2008 we expect this business to grow its EBIT contribution by 260 to $300 million, which represents more than 40% growth over 2007. The primary driver for utility growth in 2008 is a benefit of $394 million resulting from a full year recovery of fuel expenses in Virginia. Additional benefits are projected to come from sales growth and fewer planned outage days in 2008 compared to 2007. Partially offsetting these positive items are a return to normal weather, increases in non-outage O&amp;M and depreciation expenses, as well as other items which include an expected reduction in margins for 2008 and going forward, for FTRs, ancillary service revenues and wholesale contract revenues relative to 2007 levels.</p>
          <p>We also expect continued strong growth at our merchant generation business, which is expected to produce EBIT in the range $1.1 billion in 2008, which is more than 20% growth over 2007. Now, that we are disclosing our merchant EBIT contribution, we believe that investors can appreciate more just how large, profitable and growing our merchant fleet is. For 2008 we expect 160 to $185 billion worth of growth in EBITDA from our NEPOOL assets driven by high energy prices and increased capacity revenues as detailed on pages 19 and 21 in the earnings guidance kit. This growth overcomes an additional planned refueling outage at Millstone and in an extended outage for recovery at our Salem Harbor station.</p>
          <p>Our non-contracted plants in PJM, which include our Fairless Works and State Line facilities, are expected to increase their EBITDA contribution in 2008 by 80 to $90 million. The primary driver to this increase is the buyout of the long-term PPA at State Line, which was effective October 31 of 2007.</p>
          <p>2008 EBITDA from the contracted plants, which include our Kincaid, Kewaunee, Elwood and Morgantown facilities, is expected to decline 40 to $50 million, driven mainly by a planned refueling outage at our Kewaunee nuclear plant and the buyout at State Line, which removed that station from the contracted category going forward. In addition to providing our merchant EBITDA profitability by region and contract status, various schedules have been added or expanded in the guidance kit with additional disclosure on merchant statistics. We believe this additional information provides you with the clarity investors need to fully appreciate the value of our merchant assets.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn the call over to Scott Hetzer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Before I focus on our financial plans to support the business units' growth you just heard about, let me make a few quick remarks regarding 2007.</p>
          <p>As Tom Chewning has already mentioned, the recapitalization of our balance sheet as a result of our E&amp;P divestiture was a significant part of our transformational year. Of the proceeds we received from the sale, we used 6.3 billion to buy back stock and 3.3 billion to buy back and/or retire debt. On our November 1 earnings call, we talked about the potential use of another 300 million to either buyback stock or reduce debt further. Given the delay in reducing debt levels with proceeds from the sale of Peoples and Hope, we have applied the 300 million to reduce our commercial paper borrowings. We are also very pleased with our reduced risk profile going forward, and we are pleased to see S&amp;P acknowledge this when they upgraded our rating two notches from mid BBB to A minus.</p>
          <p>Now turning to 2008. The capital necessary to execute our business plan this year is expected to be 3.7 billion and you will see a breakdown between maintenance and growth capital on page 23 of our earnings guidance kit. Our operating cash flow more than covers our maintenance capital and dividend, but when you add in growth capital we will have negative free cash flow. You've heard us say many times that we plan to fund any negative free cash flow with a combination of debt and equity. When we are determining the balance between debt and equity, our decisions are driven by our targeted credit metrics, which include the typical adjustments made by credit analysts. In our three-year plan, our targets continue to be funds from operations, coverage of interest of greater than or equal to 3.6 times, funds from operations as a percentage of debt in the low 20% range, and debt-to-total capital in the low 50% range.</p>
          <p>In order to support these targets, we have plans to issue equity of 200 to 250 million this year and approximately $800 million in each of the following two years. All the equity issued in 2008 will be through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase programs. We have not included any equity from the potential conversion of our convertible bond issue since it does not result in any additional cash. The equity we plan to issue in '09 and '10 will be through a combination of these programs and a series of small public market equity issuances timed in accordance with our needs for growth capital and are expected to follow regulatory approvals for specific projects where applicable.</p>
          <p>Of course, we will also be tapping the debt markets as well this year. Our scheduled debt maturities total $1.5 billion. As Tom Chewning noted, one part of our plan to reduce debt has been delayed and that is the application of proceeds from the LDC divestitures to paying down debt. We still plan to apply proceeds from the ultimate sale to reduce debt, but we will simply carry higher short-term debt balances in the interim.</p>
          <p>Currently, we have borrowed $1 billion under one of our credit facilities to bridge us to the sale. You can assume that incremental interest expense from this additional borrowing will be offset from earnings from these assets held for sale. Additionally, we have plenty of capacity to issue incremental hybrid securities. While the rating agencies are generally comfortable giving equity credit for these securities as long as they don't exceed 15% of total capitalization, we currently have 800 million outstanding or 3% of our total capital. While we have no plans to come anywhere close to the 15% threshold, we would be interested in tapping this market for another 500 million to $1 billion over this three-year plan if the hybrid markets return to more normal pricing levels.</p>
          <p>That concludes treasury's update. Tom?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Scott. Today we have provided you in our guidance kit, a great deal of clarity about our 2008 business drivers. This information should enable you to better evaluate the profitability of our businesses from an understanding of the relative contribution of the business lines within our operating segments.</p>
          <p>Also we have enough confidence in our earnings drivers to introduce an initial 2009 operating earnings forecast range of $3.25 to $3.40 per share. This growth in earnings combined with an anticipated 11% increase in our dividend rate for 2009 should result in a total return to shareholders that reflects the value of our new business profile. Drivers expected to positively affect our outlook, compared to 2008 include income from allowed return on equity for generation construction projects in Virginia, higher contributions from our gas transmission and storage businesses highlighted by a full year of expanded Cove Point facility and one fewer planned refueling outage at Millstone. The benefits of these drivers will be partially offset by lower royalty interest natural gas production and increased interest expenses and dilution from new equity issued to support our earnings growth. Keep in mind that beginning in 2009 we will be entitled to recover cash coverage of financing cost and the allowed return on equity of qualified construction projects in Virginia.</p>
          <p>On page 45 of our guidance kit, we have added an exhibit that illustrates how an investment in a project such as the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center would translate to additional earnings and cash flow. That concludes our prepared remarks. Lindsay, we are ready for questions.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. First of all, thanks for all the great detail. This is a tremendous amount of stuff to wade through. Tom, I wanted to just kind of pick your brain a little bit, the thought process by going ahead and re-looking to sell the LDCs kind of given the pretty dramatic change in company profile of Dominion today versus what it was when you guys first made that decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, this is Tom Farrell. The reason why we decided to sell the LDCs in the first place has not changed. And that is that they were not going to add to our return on invested &#x2013; increase our return on invested capital, improve it or at least keep it even. We didn't see any prospect of that changing over the long term. They are very good assets and we expect to get good competition for them in the auction, but the original basis for selling them has not changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You made comments also looking out as far as the NEPOOL capacity auction here next week. What is your thought process as far as risk to the market of a demand response guy not delivering on commitments? And how do you guys strategize as far as committing your assets, given what seems to be a pretty reasonable concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Mark answer that in detail, but we think it is highly unlikely that the promises being made will be delivered. And that's going to lead to probably much higher energy prices than people are expecting in New England in 2010 and '11 but I will give the details to you, Mark, on how we're planning on handling all that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Dan, the capacity auction based on the public information that's out there, they are projecting peaks of 32,000 to 33,000 megawatts in this auction period. And the demand side resources that have been put forth are in excess of 3,000 right now, most of which don't exist today and have to be put in place for the next two years. So that is going to set a floor we believe that's going to be fairly low, and it's going to inhibit new generation from being built in the Northeast, which we think gives us considerably more value for the assets that we have. The challenge for us is going to be how do we decide to hedge 2010 and beyond. And we're currently looking at our options on that because we really believe that if the demand side doesn't show up, the first place you're going to see it is in a much higher energy price until the market can correct with additional capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we take from that that it's &#x2013; you're probably going to lay off on the '10, '11 hedges for awhile then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we want to see the final results from the auction but as you can see from some of the disclosure we have, we're not significantly hedged right now in '10. And I think we'll be more cautious than usual in the Northeast pending the results of the auction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess while I have you, can you just talk a little bit about the coal hedging strategy both in New England and Virginia, and what you're seeing from a pricing and availability perspective today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with Virginia. We've always averaged in Virginia. We've met with our regulators and gone over that strategy with them. It hasn't changed significantly over the years. We try to go fairly long on contract, particularly at fairly isolated locations like our Mt. Storm facility. We are seeing increases in our coal prices for Virginia as more coal continues to go overseas from Central App, which is the main area we buy for Virginia.</p>
          <p>But we have done some pretty significant things in Virginia to help hedge as well. We have built an import facility at our Chesapeake Energy Center where we can now take foreign coal there as well as domestic coal. We have rail access. So we have good balance there, and again we average in.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Northeast, we have essentially locked most of our coal in for the next two years in the Northeast. We are buying international coal and we are also buying Central App coal. One good thing for us there is we are putting on two scrubbers that will be operational here at the end of this quarter, early next quarter at Brayton, which gives us additional flexibility. We've also locked in long-term transportation contracts well beyond this period. And we also have throughput contracts through the terminal in Virginia, which gives us international and domestic capability there. So I think on the Brayton Point side, based on international pricing which has run up significantly lately, we are probably going to sit tight for a while. But that's why we went fairly long the next two years to prepare for a potential uptick like that.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question, Mr. Eggers. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question in terms of your assumptions on year 2009. What have you assumed if anything in terms of timing of new rates in Virginia? Is that more a 2010 event, or is there a partial year impact one way or another in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, we expect any rate adjustments to come into play late in 2009, be mostly a 2010 event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is really nothing in this guidance for that shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have made assumptions about where we expect the rate review to come out, which is we don't expect any significant change in our revenue requirements in Virginia in '09 or going into 2010. You need to recall that the new regulatory regime does call for a base rate review, which we believe will be &#x2013; receive very fair and equitable treatment as we have always had in Virginia. And at the same time, it's a forward-looking &#x2013; really not a test year, you look forward into 2010, so that you reduce the regulatory lags, so all the costs that we were anticipating into 2010 will be taken to account. Capital expenditures will be taken into account, and then you have the riders that will be coming into play at the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center and the other aspects that we are &#x2013; have been talking about earlier this morning. The transmission lines, the peakers and North Anna will probably be in play by that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow-up to that, have you &#x2013; I mean, if you &#x2013; if they were to end up pushing you towards an ROE similar to the staff recommendation in the Virginia City case, would you still be talking about numbers in the range you have published today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, I don't think it's useful to speculate on something like that. The staff has taken its position. We've taken our position and we'll see how that comes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I have just one final thing. Do you have a sense of what the Dominion Virginia Power full jurisdictional earnings, including generation would have been in 2007, or some kind of sense of earned ROE in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for your question, sir. Our next question comes from Daniele Seitz with Dahlman Rose. Ma'am, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Actually it's more of a general question. Your &#x2013; the coal plants that you are planning, could you remind us of the timing of when you are supposed to be starting construction, and also what you see cost per kilowatts for the plant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniele, the &#x2013; we've already had the public hearing on the plant. Last year the plant was found to be in the public interest by the State Corporation Commission. That was actually in 2006, I guess. And the evidentiary hearing begins next Wednesday in Virginia; it should take three or four days. We expect a decision from the State Corporation Commission in April &#x2013; by April, and we are prepared to commence construction immediately. It's a 585-megawatt plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and at this time, roughly your cost per kilowatt for the plant is roughly how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about $3,000 a kW. Our revised filing with the regulators estimate the cost of this plant to be about $1.8 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Similarly, if you are looking at your nuclear plants and the timing, when do you sense that you will be able to put a finger on the potential cost of that plant? Is it &#x2013; it's obviously too early because of the uncertainty regarding the timing, but could you let us know when this could happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniele, we've been working with GE extensively on this and we would certainly hope that sometime in 2007 we would have significantly more cost information, so we could move ahead. But that's an ongoing process and one that we are working very hard with GE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you sense that given the <mark type="inaudible" />, and also because of the sense that you may get the COL in &#x2013; filed, et cetera, that over the next 12 months or so you will have your EBIT funds over that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's certainly our goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to follow-up on the financing. So I kind of went through the calculations on page 23, and I guess I was coming up with a cash flow deficit of about 1.3 billion that would potentially need to be financed in the debt market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you maybe talk about &#x2013; with that, I guess you have, coupled with 1.5 billion of maturities. I know some of the maturities are pollution control. I am just curious like &#x2013; how you are planning on attacking this in the debt markets, maybe a mix of taxable or tax exempt, short-term, long-term financing? It's quite a large number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, first off, we've talked about 200 to 250 of equity for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I am saying that if you subtract the equity out, you get to the number that you are talking about which is about 1.3 billion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two quick questions, could you update us on has there been any further developments legislatively vis-&#xE0;-vis the Virginia restructuring law? And two, strategically going forward with your acreage in Appalachia, we are seeing a lot of the companies that we cover are ramping up their efforts targeting shales and so forth. Are you still going to kind of lay low on that or do you see yourselves accelerating your efforts there going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam, I will answer the first question. Paul Koonce will talk to you about the Marcellus shale. There is one &#x2013; you're probably, I assume, you are wondering about the bill that was proposed by Senator Reynolds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which would basically undo everything that was done last year. The committee that oversees all electric utility bills, it's a combination of House of Delegates members and Senate members, actually met earlier this week and voted unanimously to recommend against that bill being accepted. It will be going to a Senate Committee probably next week, it could be week after because that's &#x2013; and that would be the last opportunity. So, it has been aired in front of the panel that was appointed by the legislature to be expert on these issues and they voted unanimously to recommend against the bill being adopted. Now with that, I will turn it over to Paul Koonce to talk about Appalachia.</p>

          <p>Sam, good morning. Just a couple comments on unconventional programs in general. We've got about 1.6 million conventional acres. Now, we have been since late 2006 and all of 2007 looking at that acreage position to see what subset of that might be suitable for Marcellus development. We think the acreage position that we have embedded within the 1.6 million is about 200 to 800,000 potential acres. We have drilled about 12 Marcellus shale wells throughout 2007. We're part of a 22 company consortium to look at those wells, stratigraphic testing, to see which ones are suitable for commercial production. So, in that vein, we're very much in lockstep with all of our peers in the basin and pursuing that opportunity.</p>
          <p>On coal bed methane, over the last, I'd say, 18 months we've acquired about 300,000 coal bed methane acres and we've drilled about 22 horizontal coal bed methane wells either ourselves or with others. And throughout 2008, we will continue to examine that as well as Marcellus shale for future development in 2009 and beyond. But again, on the coal bed methane side, at least as I analyze it, we're in lockstep with others in the basin in that unconventional program as well.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a quick question regarding the quarter's results. I'm looking at page 15 of the earnings release kit. And my first question relates to the 17% year-over-year increase in operations and maintenance expense, which in the fourth quarter was attenuated significantly. You had a decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter. My general question is, what is your expectation regarding the rate of increase in O&amp;M expense in the years ahead, particularly in light of the inflationary pressures we've seen in the sector in recent years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, this is Jay. Regarding the growth in O&amp;M, I mean, you would not expect &#x2013; we don't expect anything other than normal inflationary pressures. The presentation of O&amp;M in those schedules can be misleading because of how certain elements are classified. In our supplemental disclosure in the guidance kit, we are actually taking &#x2013; kind of directing you towards a margin orientation. I know there was an anomaly in the comparative results that you are looking at that actually is going to be self-correcting as we report first quarter 2008 and beyond and those are similar to the, I guess, the anomalies we've discussed on past quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, this is the hedging or &#x2013; ?</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">

          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, other energy-related commodity purchases declined by 75%, what does that reflect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, again, regarding these line items, these are detailed accounting type questions that are going to be covered in the 10-K when we file that but when we talk to you later this afternoon, we would be happy to try to investigate the answer for that, but we are not prepared to answer that right now, I am sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unless McGettrick is, but he might be -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, are you talking about page 20?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am looking at page 15, operating results year-over-year, other industry-related commodity purchases have declined by 75%, saving you guys something like 750 million bucks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Hugh, this is Tom. One part that I want to just, I will go through maybe what's going on there. But again, you have with these individual line items, as Joe said, you can have distortions just in a way with the accounting requires you to categorize things. But one big item there was in 2006. It was the way that we accounted for the buy-sell arrangement in the Gulf of Mexico, which really caused a big, a big swing in the other energy-related commodity purchases. And the other thing is we have been accounting for the coal trading contracts through that line item. And that has declined significantly this year versus last year. And all of this has offsets in the revenue line. So it doesn't have a bottom line impact, and that's why really, particularly with the guidance, we're really pushing people to, rather than focusing on the individual line items where you have these kind of weird distortions, focus on bottom line margin, EBIT, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just one quickie about the forecast. What is your expectation of Dominion Virginia Power's regulated equity going into the 2009 rate case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you mean the actual amount?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a 50:50 basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I know, but I was just wondering if you have either the rate-based estimate or the equity estimate for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not off top of our heads, but we can get it for you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right; thank you. I will call back then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for your question, sir. Our next question comes from Rand Wrighton with Barrow, Hanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is for Tom Farrell. Tom, there have been a number of conflicting reports, I guess, regarding your view of a potential MLP on pipeline and storage assets. Can you update us now in 2008 how you are looking at that going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We have been watching carefully the MLP market and the political atmosphere in Washington around tax-advantaged structures like this. There is a lot of noise around it in Washington last year. It seems to have settled down. We are interested in watching what happens in this election cycle because tax-advantaged structures sometimes don't survive in Washington. This one seems to be doing pretty well, though, at least so far. We recognize the financial benefits that MLPs can bring. So we are taking a very interested wait-and-see attitude. We do have a team internally looking at MLP structures, but I wouldn't anticipate anything in the near term on that.</p>

          <p>Okay; thank you for your question, sir. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Catapult Capital. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, everyone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Steve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a little bit of a detail question on the merchant and particularly the NEPOOL assets. If you look at the &#x2013; just the difference in the price of hedging '08 versus '07, it would look like your NEPOOL assets should be up close to 300 million between a mid-60s price and a mid-70s price, but they are up 160 to 185. Is that just the volume difference you mentioned, and could you just reiterate again some of the outage data that Mark maybe went through <mark type="inaudible" /> in the call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Steve. A large piece of it is the outage information. We have an additional outage at Millstone that we didn't have previously, in the previous year, so that is a huge driver for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So '08 is a double outage year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>'08 is a double outage year; that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>'09 will go back to a single outage year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also, Steve, are &#x2013; have a couple significant outages at Brayton Point. We have scrubber tie-ins, one and two, which we are going to take this spring. So I think that the vast majority of what you are referencing is those two items.</p>
        </plist>
