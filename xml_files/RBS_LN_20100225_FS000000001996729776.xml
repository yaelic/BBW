        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us at the RBS Annual Results for 2009. We're now one year into a five-year turnaround plan, and I think we've come an awful long way in that short time. The Board is very pleased indeed with the progress that Stephen Hester and his new leadership team are making. And perhaps at this juncture I can actually show they exist in human form and ask the new executive team to stand up and show themselves. So there they are. That's the new team.</p>
          <p>In twelve months both the Broad and the management team have been completely restructured. We've secured the capital base at the company and set out the strategy and performance targets that need to be met. And today's results represent real progress towards our goals. In the coming year we intend to be increasingly seeing as &#x2013; to increasingly show our core strengths as a business in which to invest.</p>
          <p>We completely understand that the public capital support we have makes us unusually accountable to the public and their political representatives and we respect that in all of our dealings. But it's in all of our shareholders' and customers' interest that RBS is run soundly and commercially. Arguably no business issue has attracted greater public attention in the last year than the subject of bankers' pay. We understand the anger and the reason for it.</p>
          <p>In recognition of this I think RBS has led the way on reforming our remuneration structures. We secured virtually 100%, 99.96% shareholder approval for our new bonus deferral scheme in our general meeting in December and we're also going to put a new long-term incentive scheme to a shareholder vote at our AGM in April.</p>
          <p>Uniquely for this year as a part of the accession arrangements to the asset protection scheme we also require the consent of UKFI, our controlling shareholder to the 2009 bonus settlements and I'm pleased to confirm that as of yesterday we received that consent.</p>
          <p>The compensation ratio is probably the most meaningful disclosure we can give on staff costs. The settlement means that our compensation ratio at 27% for our GBM business is competitive against our peer group whilst also recognizing some of our particular circumstances.</p>
          <p>I understand that there is some interest in whether this ratio is flattered by the impact of deferrals between '08 and '09 and I can confirm, it's in the release anyway, that the net of this impact &#x2013; net impact of this on the ratio would be to take it to 28%. So it's pretty much during the limits.</p>
          <p>The Board's decision here has taken into account all the relevant factors: the overall performance of the Group, the particular performance and strong recovery in the Core GBM business, the market impact of policy support from many governments and central banks including, of course, the capital to support RBS and the overall risk position of the bank.</p>
          <p>The cost of the bank payroll tax is expected to be 208 million in 2009 with a further 160 million deferred over subsequent years. And the Board believes that this settlement represents the minimum necessary to retain and motivate the staff who are critical to RBS' recovery.</p>
          <p>We're now going to focus all of our attention on the remaining four years of the turnaround plan. We are both determined and confident that it will succeed. And I'll now ask Stephen Hester to take you through the presentation and show you how. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philip, and good morning, everyone. Conventionally, I will go through a few of the things about our performance today and our strategy looking forward and then ask Bruce who makes his debut physically in front of you, as opposed to on the telephone to take you through in some more detail the figures that we have published today. As a number of you have remarked, you have a nice weighty tome of additional disclosure which we hope will be helpful and points away to our determination to be transparent and investor friendly.</p>
          <p>So if you like starting with a recap of what we think we're saying today, where we think we are. We keep coming back to the three goals we have, serving customers well, restoring the bank to standalone strength and rebuilding durable shareholder value. And an important thing today I will talk about it more in a few minutes is that we are reaffirming the strategic plan and the targets we published last autumn. I know there was some debate about whether we'll be able to do that post-EU. I'll talk more about that in a few minutes, but we are reaffirming those targets.</p>
          <p>And we believe that during 2009 that we have either met or in the vast majority of cases exceeded every target that we set out for this stage of the plan. The management change decisively happened in the first half of the year and I believe is working well. The riskiest period is behind us, though with lots more to do. And we see 2010 as the last foundation year. We are likely to be in overall loss as a Group in 2010 before moving into Group profit in 2011. There are likely to be precious few, really splashy indicators of our success in 2010 as we lay these foundations, but they are being laid and I believe successfully so.</p>
          <p>And our continuing businesses, the reason we're here, the reason we are worth supporting, the reason we believe that the shares will get passed the government's hurdle rate, we can get the government off our share register and rebuild value is in our continuing businesses. They all are market leaders in their markets. Their markets are all customer driven, large, enduring. We believe that we can get 15% plus ROEs out of them even with more equity held and that they will gel as a group as well as individually.</p>
          <p>And the journey to that being a story of RBS, of course, involves risk reduction, involves peeling away the things that nearly brought us down. That journey is going well. We are something like 70% of the way through already the balance sheet reduction we have to make overall. The funding profile has done very, very well. We'll talk more about this during the presentation. We obviously have tail risk protection in APS, and we believe and there are some areas you'll see there, our tone is improving today that impairments are likely to now have peaked.</p>
          <p>So not dwelling really on all the stuff that we think we deserve pats on the back for last week &#x2013; last year. But I think in really summarizing it we were able from a starting point of a 24 billion loss, of a 10p share price, chaos in our markets and with the bank, we were able to get our arms around the problems. We were able to make sure that the essential source of value our customer franchises and the people who operate them remained intact. We set out I believe a clear strategy and roadmap to recovery. We have the tools to do the job. Some of them we've given ourselves, some of them have been given to us through a very substantial external support. And we are delivering so far ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>So you will see increasingly the way we present our business is trying to help you unpeel the complexity that still will sit with RBS for a little while and allow you increasingly to focus on the investment case which we believe will become successively clearer. And the investment case, of course, is ultimately all about our Core businesses and where we can take them. And I think that we can see that in 2009 we have some reasonably good things to say about the Core businesses but much work left to do.</p>
          <p>I agree that it's entirely, if you like illustrative on this point, but on an illustrative basis our Core businesses would have had a return on equity of 13%, operating earnings per share of 4.9p. And what you will also see is that we are beginning to see the upturn in our Retail and Commercial businesses. And if you think about our business mix, in steady state one-third of our Group will be investment banking and two-thirds Retail and Commercial. Now, the story of 2009, of course, is about investment banking for us and everywhere else. But the story for the future years as investment banking earnings come off will be what momentum can we generate in our Retail and Commercial and at what point does that take over and drive the whole Group forward. And so, in that sense, the beginnings of the turn in Retail and Commercial that we saw in the fourth quarter are important indicators for the future. You can see that in net interest margin and you can begin to see that in impairments. The cost program is also doing its job.</p>
          <p>On the rest, away from our Core businesses, as I mentioned on the previous slide, the impairment charges appear to have peaked. We think that they will come down slowly. But nevertheless, they appear to have peaked, absent another severe double dip.</p>
          <p>We are making great progress on the loan to deposit ratio both because loans are coming down, but also because deposits are coming up. And in fact, in our Core business, it is already at 104%. So if you believe we can get rid of Non-Core, you can see how we get to 100%, actually not far distant from here in Core.</p>
          <p>I talked about the balance sheet progress. The Core Tier 1 ratio post the APS and the B share issuance is 11%. That's important because we want that to be able to absorb, firstly, another year of loss. Secondly, the extra regulatory charges are coming down the pike in the coming years, that plus, future years' retained earnings and leave us in the position where we are adequately capitalized for the future and we believe that to be the case.</p>
          <p>So a couple of slides really on Core and I think the essence of the year was for all our Core businesses, it was a foundation year in terms of our turnaround plan, but of course in performance terms, it was a banner year for our investment bank GBM. But throughout our business the customer franchises were sustained and intact. The key thing about GBM and I'll mention it more on the next slide is, of course, all investment banks captured buoyant markets. We were probably in middle of the pack in terms of our capturing, but we had a hell of a lot more distractions as GBM was literally halved in its capital intensity and despite that captured that, which I think gave the light to many people who were not clear about the strengths that we had in that area. I mentioned our Retail and Commercial very important for the future, hit trough last year. Signs are beginning to be positive at the turn, and throughout the Group cost cutting programs are going to plan.</p>
          <p>I won't dwell on this slide at all. You can read it afterwards. It simply provides evidence partly for the customer franchises being intact, in some instances, for them growing, despite all the things that could have gone the other way last year and I think it also highlights for you the strength of our natural deposit franchises, an asset many banks don't have which will be increasingly important to us in the new world of different bank capitalization and funding.</p>
          <p>GBM, perhaps an interesting slide for some people, on top left here, we've gone back to 2007 on the basis that was the last record year for the industry, showing you the GBM results as then reported. And then showed you pro forma Core GBM, in other words, the business lines that we are now operating stripped of the ones we have closed down and what that would have been in 2007 and then, where that went to 2009.</p>
          <p>So you can see that our profits of 5.7 billion in GBM like-for-like compared with 1.5 billion in 2007 or 3.2 billion if you include the businesses that we subsequently closed down, you can see the balance sheet is halved in that period from 900 to 400 billion. The number of people has come down substantially as well. That's a really important restructuring and of course, you could understand why we might be pleased with the result, not complacent but pleased with the results.</p>
          <p>The top right simply shows you where they have been accomplished. And in the bottom left of this slide the balance which, of course, is not in balance in profit terms. GBM drove our profit last year, but the essential balance of our Group which we believe is appropriate looking forward.</p>
          <p>Now, we have a long said that last year was an unusual year for investment banking, the first quarter in particular. I think you can see in the last three quarters what we regard as a more normal run rate for our investment bank. Our expectations for 2010 would be more consistent with that. Although it's fair to say that January has started above the more normal run rate trend line but we always hope that Januarys do that.</p>
          <p>And really to say no more in respect of our other businesses, our Retail and Commercial businesses then last year was a foundation year. They were on their back mostly as a result of the economy, of course, an important exceptions, GTS, a terrific business that I think did very well to have the flat year relative to prior year, our Wealth businesses as well, but in general, suffering from the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we are seeing the signs &#x2013; the first signs of recovery both helped by the economy and by our own efforts. You can see that in fourth quarter revenues started to come up. You can see for now two quarters in a row net interest margin has started to recover driven by asset margins and still quite heavy headwind on the liability side and we see in Core impairments flattering, in Non-Core they have peaked as we said earlier. So there is not going to be a dramatic renaissance in 2010. But we do think these businesses will improve in 2010, and then that slope of improvement can accelerate ones economies and in particular, interest rates normalize and we can get some relief on the liability margin.</p>
          <p>So that's what I wanted to say about Core, about driving the Core forward. We think this increasingly we can see what those franchisees can do. We can have some more confidence in the projections we've made for them. The managements are operating their plan well. We have the unusual benefit as many banks do of the investment bank, a performance which we're very grateful for but we're beginning to see good things in the rest which will drive us forward.</p>
          <p>A couple of minutes now on the industry and then on strategic plan. I won't take you through these words, you can read them. But obviously, one of the crucial strategic issues facing our industry is changing regulation, changing capital liquidity environments and all things that go with it. Generally, we are supportive of the initiatives that are ongoing. But clearly, the devil lies in the detail, in particular the calibration exercise for this year and timetable over which Basel changes will be brought in which could make a very big difference to banks one way or another and clearly will cause inevitable uncertainty for all of us over the next year as these things ricochet around the international authorities. But we're preparing ourselves for them. We're not opposing them. We're just seeking that the implementation be appropriate with an appropriate period of adjustment.</p>
          <p>And just simply to, if you like, highlight really the two important bites that this thing comes in. The first important bite is really the trading book changes which come in at the beginning of 2011. There is still substantial detail to work through to be absolutely sure of the impact. At the moment, in very rough terms, we think it might cost us 60 billion of risk-weighted assets. Roughly half of that is continuing in Core and half of it is in Non-Core which obviously will go away subsequently.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the post-2012 changes which mostly are about deductions from Core Tier 1 and changing the nature of capital are far too early to give numbers on. They are speculative in terms of both the time of implementation and what will actually be implemented. But you will see in 300 or so pages that you've got a disclosure of each of the items on this list as to what those items are now. You can use your own skills to judge how those items will change over the coming years before they have to be introduced, some will go up, some will go down and what makes you think they will be introduced at some &#x2013; we will all be on a bit of a voyage of understanding as we go through this.</p>
          <p>The vision for RBS, you've seen it before. I won't again go over it. But we are clear that our Core businesses represent a coherent whole, something that can be a strong competitor in every one of its markets that makes sense in balance together, both geography by funding giver and taker, by type of business that the universal banking model is one that can work for us. And we feel good about that as a competitive platform will be at one which we have a lot of work to do upon.</p>
          <p>I mentioned our targets. As you recall, we put out some comprehensive targets unusually last summer. We put them out for the Group as a whole and we put them out for each of our divisions. We've kept all of those and in your papers are the divisional detail which I don't replicate here. There was a setback, as you know, in the fourth quarter of this last year with the forced divestitures from the EU where a lots of people worried about the earnings dilution that might hit us as a result of that and with the Basel changes coming into greater view the extra equity that banks would have to catch, again I know many of you worried about that as an impact on our terms.</p>
          <p>So, I'm pleased to say to you today that we are reaffirming the targets unchanged. In other words, we believe that we can make up for those headwinds of divestitures and regulatory change and still produce the returns that we thought we could last summer.</p>
          <p>In the divisional detail there is one minor change to the cost income ratio in our GTS business as a result of the GMS disposal. But in essence, our position is unchanged. Now, of course, if there are any targets, we might not hit them. There may be lots of things could go wrong. But for the time being, we think this is the right thing to aim for and this &#x2013; and that we have a reasonable chance of getting there. You will also see that the progress made on this chart in 2009 on many of the measures.</p>
          <p>So, now, let's just turn having really concentrated on risk &#x2013; sorry on Core business and strategy to, if you like, risk or the rest. And what I am going to seek to persuade you, not today, I am going to give you the concept today, but I hope you will start to believe it over time is that increasingly we can see the wind down of Non-Core, the remainder of the risk profile as an NAV adjuster as opposed to drive a value, something that is catered for in our existing capital structure together with the retained earnings during the period. And as and when you start believing that the risk indeed is down to that level, it makes the investment case much easy to deal with. I am not saying we're there now, but I am saying we're well along the path to getting there.</p>
          <p>And so, again, endless detail in your packs. But put very simply, as I said, we are 70% of the way through the balance sheet reduction we need to do. The liquidity improvement has been tremendous and the main effort now is to increase the government bond components of our liquidity as opposed to the total liquidity. The funding profile has improved substantially. The counterparty credit risk exposures you've seen coming down. And importantly, in the bottom right here, the REILs, leading indicator impairments we believe, flattening for the first time in quite a few quarters. If that trend continues that would supportive of our impairments having peaked belief. But of course, one quarter does not create certainty as we all know.</p>
          <p>And really not a whole lot to say about the new disposals. We're very pleased to make a fast start with the most volatile of the December trading business where you've seen a little over half of that business go at a reasonable premium to JPMorgan. We hope to get merchant acquiring and the U.K. SME done by the end of this year and insurance as we always said because we think we can improve the results substantially. Because it doesn't use balance sheet or capital at present, it makes a whole lot of sense to save that disposal or IPO as it's more likely to be until the outer years and that's our current plan and we have the other constraints or parts which you're aware of.</p>
          <p>So just turning into the final stages of my remarks, outlook. And again, really coming back to trying to need a start on helping you to unpeel the investment case I'll be more on the next slide. We do see our Core businesses as increasingly the things to focus on as the uncertainties elsewhere recede. All our businesses should do better regardless of economic climate as we work on them and as our management actions over next two or three years bite. And that's why we've so aggressively started in terms management actions, cost efficiency, investments and so on. And in steady state the two-thirds of our Group that would be Retail and Commercial is very important in thinking of earnings drivers over the next four years. Nevertheless, even with more capital, even with less favorable markets we are holding GBM to account, to produce 15% plus ROE going forward.</p>
          <p>In 2010, it's early days and there is uncertainty in the world economy, so we can't get too carried away. But our current view would be Core profits will reduce because we think that GBM earnings will normalize faster than the recovery in Retail and Commercial will offset. That may turnout to be right or wrong, but that's how we see it today but we'll nevertheless be healthy.</p>
          <p>Non-Core impairments and write-downs we believe will be lower than last year but still high. And so, I expect 2010 to be the last year of Group loss and we'll see how that goes as the year runs through. We do expect a gently falling Group impairment charge and a gently rising NIM if current trends can be sustained. And of course, we expect to make further progress in the rundown of Non-Core according to the schedule that we put out.</p>
          <p>Now, of course, there are economic uncertainties which feed into the credit outlook and of course, there are regulatory and governmental uncertainties and there is execution risk to our plan. All of these reduce over time and there will clearly be a transparency as we go through that.</p>
          <p>I think as a sort of postscript to Philip's point in his opening on bonuses, the bonuses that were paid in this Group for 2009 were the Board's recommendation. They were not an imposition and they were not reduced by the outside world. Of course, we reduced them in, in the sense that we wanted them to be restrained and we wanted them to be responsible but they were consistent with the commercial running of RBS for its shareholders and we believe that that is a model that we must follow going forward.</p>
          <p>And then finally, again starting to help you with the building blocks of the investment case. The business case for RBS I think is clear, market leading businesses in large, enduring customer driven markets. The Retail and Commercial businesses to drive the earnings recovery from here but GBM being very important to us, a Group that is well capitalized with tail risks insured, a turnaround story but with execution risk and another year of pretty hard slog and low visibility before things get funnier thereafter.</p>
          <p>But as we think about the investment case, and again not in anyway trying to rush our fences here, as we hit the planned targets in the coming quarters and years, as the external uncertainty, some of which are political and economic, particularly this year and regulatory start reducing, we think that the RBS investment case will clarify and we think that there are really, if you like, three building blocks that have to be concentrated on. The out year earnings per share driver where we've given you our view of what we think we can accomplish in ROE, cost, income and so on terms. A cross check to the risk. If we turn out to be right that the current capitalization structure encompasses the losses from Non-Core wind down and if the multiple from that is reasonable then in a sense that's already in the book as opposed to in the EPS and of course, there will be for some period of time valuation complexities around how to think of getting out of APS contingent capital and particularly the B shares which will take some time to resolve. But nevertheless, I think that this onion we will be peeling in front of your eyes and hopefully we won't be crying as that process goes through.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd very much like to hand over to Bruce. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to walk through the consolidated financial highlights and then break that down into an analysis of Core and our Non-Core results. I'll then comment on our key funding and capital considerations along with progress report on how we're managing risk.</p>
          <p>Comparing full year '09 to '08 results, revenues increased by 43% while expenses were up by only 7%. This drove an improvement in PBIL from 0.5 billion in '08 to 7.7 billion in '09. However, impairment losses were up by 6.5 billion in '09 reducing the operating loss improvement to 700 million. Our attributable loss in '09 was a smaller 3.6 billion reflecting gains from liability management exercise and curtailment of benefits in our pension plans. Last year's significant attributable loss of 24 billion reflects a 16 billion goodwill and intangible write-off.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, income was up 6% sequentially and we had a pre-tax profit reflecting the pension curtailment. All in all signs solid progress. At the bottom of the schedule take note of the progress in terms of funded asset and RWA reduction.</p>
          <p>Core Tier 1 ended the year at a robust 11% reflecting the benefit of B share issuance to HMT and the APS RWA relief. Our TNAV is now slightly over 51p. The decline in Q4 reflects the B share issuance at 50p and an increase in the pension deficit.</p>
          <p>A big driver of our improving performance over the second half has been rebounding NIM. During Q2 NIM reached the later of 1.7% but that's increased in Q3 to 1.75% and in Q4 to 1.83%. This increase has been powered by improvement in asset margins in our Retail and Commercial businesses. We've been able to book new loans at higher margins in these businesses which is more than offset pressure on deposit margins.</p>
          <p>Of course, one other drag on the NIM has been our efforts to strengthen our liquidity and our funding position. We now have 170 billion of liquidity portfolio with 20 billion in FSA eligible government securities and the percentage of self funding is greater that's great a year-end maturity now stands at 50%. That said, we should be able to continue to absorb that and post stable to improving NIM in 2010. And as rates rise in 2011 and beyond that should boost NIM further alleviating deposit spread compression.</p>
          <p>Another driver of our improved operating performance in 2009 was the positive operating leverage I referred to on our first slide. Our cost to income ratio has improved to 59% as our cost reduction plan delivered 1.3 billion of benefits in 2009. The overall uptick in expenses reflects growth tide to higher revenues as well as foreign exchange. We do plan to bring expenses down on absolute basis in 2010 as we continue to implement our cost reduction initiatives and we run down Non-Core.</p>
          <p>So let's focus now on our Core performance. Core operating profit was up 89% to 8.3 billion as GBM drove higher revenues and positive operating leverage was 23%. While impairments were up by 2.2 billion, they have leveled off and stabilized. The illustrative ROE for our Core activities was 13% for the year. Q4 results adjusting for selected one-time items were broadly stable with Q3.</p>
          <p>So, scanning through the Core divisions on the next couple of slides let me offer the brief following observations. U.K. Retail PBIL was up 10% versus '08. We've made excellent progress in attracting new customers, improving our service model while lowering costs and gaining mortgage market share. Unfortunately, we suffered a 600 million plus increase in impairments largely on the personal loan portfolio reflecting weak economic conditions. The good news is that the PBIL momentum will continue into 2010 and impairments will level off driving better profitability.</p>
          <p>U.K. Corporate showed stable PBIL versus '08. Loan volumes were up as customers delevered and NIM dropped in the first half, but rebounded in the second as asset margins have expanded. Expenses were tightly managed, declining by 7% year-over-year. Again, similar to U.K. Retail, impairments were up over 600 million, reflecting the weak economic environment. But as with Retail we expect U.K. Corporate to perform better in 2010 with modest growth in PBIL combined with lower impairments.</p>
          <p>Wealth operating profit was up 21% in 2009 given 5% income growth and tight expense management. That said, the low rate environment and competition for deposits has continued to challenge the business.</p>
          <p>GBM was already covered Stephen, suffice it to say, they had an outstanding year in refocusing the business model and taking advantage of market conditions. The first half of the year was clearly above trend line, but the business was able to generate 2 billion in income per quarter in the second half which is back to trend levels. I will add that this year so far we are pleased with the performance of the businesses to-date.</p>
          <p>Continuing on, with GTS, operating profit was essentially flat with '08. Compression on deposits margins continues, but balances have resumed growth in Q4. Outlook is stable for this business.</p>
          <p>Ulster had a tough year. Impairments were up by over 500 million, reflecting the weak economy in Ireland. The business has taken steps to strengthen PBIL through pricing and expense reduction initiatives, but 2010 will be another tough year on the credit side.</p>
          <p>The U.S. businesses at Citizens suffered mildly from lower interest rates and higher credit cost resulting in a small loss in 2009. We do expect actions taken to bolster the NIM as well as the improving economy to return Citizens to profitability in 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Insurance had a rough year as net claims were up by over 600 million including a 448 million additional charge for personal injury claims resulting in a steep drop in operating profit. Significant of the revamp &#x2013; significant revamping of the business is occurring on the pricing, expense, underwriting and claims processing dimensions which we believe will result in a bounce back year in 2010.</p>
          <p>Closing out the analysis of Core, a snapshot of impairments shows that most divisions have stabilized except Ulster at relatively higher levels. We would expect to see some improvement over the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>So let me move on to Non-Core. Year-over-year, not a pretty picture. Non-Core lost a little less money before impairments about 1 billion less, but impairments jumped by over 4 billion resulting in a loss of 14.6 billion. One bright spot though is that both impairment losses and operating loss have narrowed for the second consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-Core's Q4 operating loss annualizes to about 10 billion. While that's still significant, the trend is in the right direction. TPAs were down meaningfully in 2009 and RWAs were sharply in Q4. We continue to look for economic ways to accelerate the rundown of assets including exposures.</p>
          <p>The next slide on impairments gives more detail on losses by standing division and by asset type. GBM and UKC drove the biggest losses which were centered around property and manufacturing assets. We expect impairments here to remain at a relatively high level in 2010 given the nature of these legacy exposures.</p>
          <p>Total assets decline from 343 billion to 221 billion over the course of 2009. Of the reduction 53 billion was in derivatives and 65 billion in third party assets of which disposals and run-off accounted for 47 billion. This is 15 billion ahead of Non-Core's 2009 TPA reduction target.</p>
          <p>So, let's move on to the Group balance sheet and we'll cover funding and capital. Our total balance sheet has decreased by almost 700 billion since the peak and about half of that is on the funded balance sheet and the other half derivatives. As you know, we bolstered our capital ratios through B share and APS in Q4. As a result, our leverage TCE loan to deposit Core Tier 1 ratios are certainly much improved versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>As we run down our Non-Core assets we facilitate our ability to achieve better loan to deposit measures which we expect to continue over the planning horizon. This gives us comfort with respect to rollover risk on wholesale funding in light of the winding down of government support programs. We simply won't need as much wholesale funding as our Non-Core assets run off.</p>
          <p>We still have work to do, however, to enhance the quality of our liquidity portfolio and to continue to lengthen the maturities of our wholesale funds. This will continue on a steady but gradual basis over the planning horizon. And the cost is included in our NIM guidance given earlier. The new liquidity and funding guidelines by Basel and the FSA are directionally in line with our plans.</p>
          <p>On the capital front, we gained 5.1 percentage points of Core Tier 1 during 2009. The biggest positives were B share issuance of 4.4%, net APS RWA relief 1.6% and the liability management exercise in the first half again 1.6%. These moves more than offset the attributable loss and other impacts.</p>
          <p>Let me continue on to briefly cover the progress that we're making on managing risk. But first off I'd like to say we've developed a much more effective risk management paradigm in the short time I've been here under the leadership of Nathan Bostock working with our line managers and their risk teams. Having said that, we still have significant legacy issues to work our way through.</p>
          <p>The headlines here are that RWAs are down in Q4, credit metrics improving and we're very focused on cutting some of our tall tree exposures.</p>
          <p>Now, first on RWAs, we suffered from pro-cyclicality over Q1 to Q3, but this was less of a factor in Q4. We focused on restructuring and hedging of exposures to monolines and CDPCs where feasible and this combined with tightening spreads on underlying assets is showing benefits. In addition, customer and our own deleveraging are also having an impact. And of course, APS will provide about 130 billion of relief based on the current composition of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we expect several negative impacts that will have to be absorbed. The first is the impact of migrating ABN assets to RBS Basel II which including the roll-off of historic capital relief trades should increase RWAs at mid-year by about 15 billion. This estimate reflects mitigation actions we plan to take, plus the fact that we've already absorbed 8 million higher RWAs in Q4.</p>
          <p>Next is the new Basel proposals on market risk and securitization treatment to be implemented in 2011. We would expect the impact after mitigation to be a further 60 billion. Now, mostly additional capital required to support this higher RWAs in our Core segment will be allocated to GBM, who will be tasked with maintaining targeted return on equities.</p>
          <p>I've covered impairments already at some length, but I think it's worth nothing, however, that REILs were flat in Q4 relative to Q3 after previously showing significant increases. In addition, the case referrals into our workout group GRG has declined sharply over the past two quarters. So while the trend is definitely better, we still have a lot of inventory to pass through the pipe. Rest assured, we bolstered our resources in this area and we have highly skilled personnel all over these assets.</p>
          <p>We've made good progress reducing our legacy credit risk concentration in areas such as country risk, sectors and single names. We've implemented new frameworks, policies and limits in each of these areas. It would be fair to say, however, that the process of derisking will take time. This is a multi-year program and there's still much more to do.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude by offering a few key takeaways. Certainly, the strength of our Core franchise was demonstrated in 2009, operating profit up 89%. GBM had an outsized performance in terms of contribution in 2009 but we're starting to see signs that the Retail and Commercial business is gaining momentum as we head into 2010.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter NIM strengthened after downward pressure earlier in the year. And I'd say our outlook is clearly stable to positive. The Group impairments have shown signs of having peaked. Our capital position remains robust at 11% Core Tier 1 ratio. We've reduced a lot of balance sheet risk. There's certainly still plenty there, but we're hard at work on it. Total assets have been decreased by 696 billion in 2009. And lastly, as I said again, I think the rebounding performance in Retail and Commercial and the smaller losses in Non-Core bode well for 2010.</p>
          <p>And with that, I think we're ready to take some questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. It's Ian Gordon from Exane BNP Paribas. There quick ones if I may. Firstly, could I ask you to add some color on your comments around NIM in terms of the underlying 2011 rate rise assumptions you have by country, timing and approximate quantum? Secondly, on capital, I noticed that you referenced your remarks around your strong base to your Core capital measures. Can you just update us firstly whether your views on the necessity of preserving your Non-Core capital have moved on since November? And additionally, under what circumstances might you seek release from the contingent capital subscription or more specifically, the cost thereof?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, just to help me with the, you have the more modest 2010 dilution arithmetic, can you advise firstly whether any share-based compensation will be issued with new shares or whether you'll be buying shares in the market to satisfy it? And secondly, apologies if I have missed it, but do we yet know what proportion of holders of the US$1 billion and GBP200 million convertible preference shares have exercised their conversion right? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think your first question was on the NIM. I think you want the 2010 op, you said 2011, but you meant 2010. I think if you look at the fourth quarter we posted 183. There is a few unusual items in that that I'd say in Non-Core such as some restructuring income is probably closer to 180. And if you look at 170, up to 175, up to 180, we're seeing about a 5 &#x2013; there has been about a 5 basis point improvement over the last two quarters. That is being led by a dynamic in the market where we're able to reprice rollover facilities in new loans attractively. How long that continues is a question, but I think currently it seems like we have momentum in that space.</p>
          <p>On the liability side, it's still intensely competitive for deposits and we have some of the swaps falling off that is still showing some compression on the liability side. So I think broadly speaking we would expect to see, as Stephen described, a gentle continued improvement in NIM. Potentially, the things that could take us off that are changes in the competitive situation that change our ability to get the margins we're getting on the asset side would be on thing. And then, particular changes in the shape of the yield curve or the level of interest rates would also have an impact to that.</p>
          <p>Second question was on I think the amount of capital and how we're thinking about capital. I think, in general, &#x2013; and Steve, you may want to weigh in on this as well. But we have I think a very robust capital ratio recognizing that we're still in a loss making situation for the next few quarters in any event. And then, we also have the regulatory uncertainty around some of these Basel capital proposals. So I think having more capital, a war chest, if you will, is a very good thing to deal with some of these things going forward. And as Steven indicated, as Non-Core runs down, I think we'll see what kind of capital management flexibility we have, but that probably won't be evident until some of the Basel proposals clarify later in the year. You want to add anything to that, Steven?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the only point on APS and continued GAAP, so this is really what we said is that it is not economic for us to get rid of those things until really the end of 2012, but somewhere in the 2012, 2013 is our ambition by the end of 2013 to be out of both.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last one on dilution. Clearly we're very sensitive to the increase in share count that's taken place till now, and so as we think about how we're funding the employee bonuses and these &#x2013; conversions of these preferred securities, we're going to be very mindful of that. And I'd say, we're not going to give explicit guidance today as to what the amount is, but I think in general, it won't be very material.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Toeman from HSBC. In slide 41, you've kindly given us the net stable funding ratio, which I'm assuming is, how it will be calculated under <mark type="inaudible" /> and commensurate with that there's a wholesale funding proportion, 50% more than one year, 50% presumably less than one year. And I wondered, if &#x2013; because you are reasonably close to the 100% net funding ratio, are you actually telling us that the mix of wholesale funding is now going to be, as you showed here as 50% short-term, 50% long-term, and that you're happy with that particular mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we would expect to see that improve &#x2013; that wholesale funding, and part of it relates to what we said kind of on these slides about the run down of Non-Core. So if you looked at wholesale funding being 50/50, a lot of that in wholesale funding is oriented against the Non-Core asset portfolio. As Non-Core runs down let's say in 2010, the funding that will run off is going to be the wholesale funding that's less than a year. And just by dint of that as overall wholesale funding goes down, it's running off from the less than one year bucket, the percentage that's greater than a year is going to go up. So we don't have a real hard target on that. When we see opportunities in the market to lengthen, when i.e. when market conditions are favorable, we'll continue to do that, and chip away at that, but I don't expect significant real headwinds on the lengthening on the wholesale funding side. Where we will still have some water to carry is improving the asset quality and the liquidity portfolio taking our FSA eligible government bond portfolio from 20 to 50 over the next four years, and so there is a cost associated with that, and the give up of the interest we're making on the collateral that we'll be replacing with those government bonds. But we've already got that baked in. We've did a lot of that in 2009, so I don't think that's an incremental impact to the NIM.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Manus Costello from Autonomous. I had a couple of questions on U.K. Retail please, firstly there's been recent data showing a slight tightening in competition in the U.K. mortgage market. I wonder, if that's something you've felt over the last few months, and if you could give us some color on that. And secondly, in the fourth quarter, you saw a drop down in non-interest income in U.K. Retail as a result of the lower overdraft fees, have we got the full impact of that in the fourth quarter, and should we roll that forward as a quarterly run rate for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to hand the mike to Brian. Do you want to take it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; so on mortgages, yes, it is becoming a little more competitive, but we've done very well and continue to grow market share. And I think, we can continue to do that. There's a couple of reasons for that. One is that mortgage competition at the moment is highly dependent on the availability of deposits to fund those mortgages. We've been doing very well on deposits and that gives us a fair amount of leeway to continue to grow our mortgage book. The second thing from a structural point of view that I think is very exciting about RBS is that our share of mortgages historically is very low relative to our share of current accounts. And so, simply by regaining what I would consider to be our natural share, which is a function of simply fixing our sales processes in the branches, ramping up marketing, and so forth, we can take advantage of the strong brands and strong relationships we have to grow that business. We've more than met our government targets, and I think, we'll continue to do that. So &#x2013; and at very healthy margins, I might add, so mortgages is looking like a great growth opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>On the fee side, we didn't see the full impact of the fee reductions that we made in the fourth quarter, although that certainly did flow through. So there will be a continued run rate effect of the overdraft fees in non-interest income in 2010. We clearly have taken a divot on fee income from the reduction in PPI, insurance, revenues, as well as the overdraft related fees. Some of that we are beginning to address through pricing on personal loans and some of that we still have a gap that we need to fill on the overdraft side, and we are thinking that through, and it'd be interesting to see how that plays out in the industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Full year fee impact is what about 200 million, Brian?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The fee changes we made in September were about 270 million on a full year basis, so some of that still needs to flow through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Simon's passed me the mike friends, so maybe I'll go ahead, it's Tom Rayner from Barclays Capital. And could I just maybe clarify what I think you're saying on the Group margin guidance, that's obviously a gentle sort of increase this year. Is this really saying that the asset re-pricing &#x2013; positive asset re-pricing trends you're seeing all-in is going to outweigh the stiff competition you're still seeing on deposits, plus all of the issues of term structure on wholesale and new liquidity, also I mean, when you whop it all together, is that the answer that it's a sort of gentle upward trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, that's what you've seen in the last two quarters, and we would see that continuing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And within that the U.K., we just heard on the mortgage side, could you give us a feel for how the sort of mix of the sort of product pricing is changing because SVR, I think, you said in the release is becoming &#x2013; more people are now having to go into SVR, it's obviously much more attractive from the bank's point of view, can you give us any figures on where the percentage is today, and where you think that might go in terms of the mix of the mortgage book? And also the deposits, so I think, savings margins were stabilized in Q4, could you comment on that as well please, whether that's sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to take that again, Brian or &#x2013; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first one, we certainly have seen a shift to SVR which is helping our margin, and will help our revenue growth in the year ahead as well because the margins are healthier on SVR. And I think, as long as rates stay low where they are, that's probably likely to continue. It could turn around if rates start to spike up obviously, but for the time being that's going to be a good contributor. I would say &#x2013; I've forget off the top of my head the exact proportion that's in variable rate, but I would say in aggregate it's probably around the 30 to 40% range, and heading up. And we'll see that continue to flow through. So that will underpin good revenue growth for us this year on the mortgages side. And sorry, the second question -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Savings margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Savings margins &#x2013; while we've continued to see huge competition on the deposit side. Some of the pricing that was going on in the savings side in 2009, I think, reflected probably borderline panic at some of the banks about <mark type="inaudible" /> to sustain their deposit to loan ratios at reasonable levels. That seems to be settling a little bit, although it still remains very tough. But I think what the industry has done is increasingly managed the overall NIM and the relationship between deposit pricing and mortgage pricing reasonably effectively, and so I think the indications that Bruce gave are a pretty good summary of how we think we'll continue to manage that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for that. There was a quick second question then, if that's okay. Just on slide 14, Steven, your comments on the thrust of regulatory change, and calibration being a key issue, and it sounds as if they don't make some changes on some of the proposals, you think economic growth could suffer. I mean, is your view that there's going to be a pragmatic sort of solution in the end, which means that some of the more severe proposals actually get watered down in order to help the industry as a whole to get back on its feet? I'm now trying to get a better sense of what you really mean by that slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, in order to be responsible we are prepared for a worst outcome, and obviously, we &#x2013; so we're trying to do our sums as if these things come in reasonably quickly after 2012 with only &#x2013; with modest lags. However, I do think that there'll be quite a lot of sentiment volatility this year in particular, as different sort of hawks and doves pronounce during the sort of argument process around <mark type="inaudible" />, what seems to me the case is that by and large regulators and central banks feel quite hawkish about tightening up on the banking system and the politicians think that's a great idea, until they understand the consequence of the costs and availability of credit, and then they think it's a lousy idea. And so there will be a sort of a push and pull as you go through there. My view is that the most likely is simply to have a fairly generous implementation period &#x2013; I don't know, five years, even longer, as things are brought in, and that would be incredibly helpful for us who want to defer tax assets, it's the most obvious example, where if we have five years to bring that, then it's a complete non-issue for us. If it comes in straightaway, it will be an issue for a year or two. So I think, deferral or staged implementation is the most likely compromise, but if you think about it, RBS used to run stupidly, but nevertheless used to run Core Tier 1 of 4%, we're targeting above eight, and when you include the capital changes, that's probably another four or five basis points, from the start to finish. And so RBS would have tripled the amount of capital it holds behind this business, if you multiply that by the world's banking system, you have a safer banking system and more expensive credit. You won't notice that when interest rates are low, but you sure as hell will notice it when they come up, and I think that will be a really big policy issue that people have to grapple with. As I say at the moment it feels to me they'll grapple with it by pushing the problem out, rather than by backing off the actual proposals, but we'll see.</p>

          <p>Now what I said I'd do, and what we have done is we haven't done a full revamp of our strategic plan and updated all the targets. All we did was we said, okay, since August there are a series of threats from the regulators that are becoming clearer and there is a series of earnings dilution from disposals that we haven't factored in, and so we have only updated the plan for those two things. And those two things are obviously negative. We believe we can offset them by positive operational income, but we have not attempted to in essence reflect in each of the divisional target where they could be upgraded. I plan to do that more like on an annual rather than a semi-annual rhythm, and so I think, you're right to point out that there are some of the 2011 targets that are ripe for upgrade, which we'll more firmly do on a once a year rhythm.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Arturo de Frias from Evolution. Three questions also please. First of all, on U.K. Corporate impairments, you are mentioning that you think that impairments might have peaked, but in U.K. Corporate have already started to fall quite noticeably, and I would like your comment on that, because I mean obviously H1 impairments were high, but the market hasn't strengthened much in the second half, so I wonder why impairments are falling in H2 in U.K. Corporate.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the branches that you expect to sell by the end of this year. You have mentioned that you have I think 146 million operating loss in those branches. That compares with overall retail ROE of 4% and overall corporate ROE of 10. So I wonder why the branches you want to sell are performing so weakly versus the Group in general. And if that would make it difficult, maybe you don't want to discuss on price or anything like that, but it might be difficult to sell at book value with these numbers?</p>
          <p>And finally, one &#x2013; a bit more philosophical question on the targets for retail, the 100% loan to deposit, I mean, obviously 150 was bad, 170 was bad, but why going to 100%. I mean, banking is a leverage business. I think, it's reasonably healthy to do a bit more lending than deposit gathering. Why do you want to go to 100%, it's not <mark type="inaudible" /> for the retail network? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'd take two of those questions, and ask Chris to take one specifically on deposits. On the disposal, the branch and SME disposal, if you broke down our U.K. Corporate business between SME and all corporate, the SME bit would also be losing money last year, because that's where the impairments were, and where the margin improvements has been slower. And so what you'll &#x2013; what I believe is over time, the particular mix of our &#x2013; the profitability of the thing we're disposing should not be that much different than the profitability of the &#x2013; if you like, the host businesses. And we do believe that that business is capable of greater than 15% ROE once it gets past the impairment peak and once the costs are taken out that we're taking out of the business generally. But that's not to say, we'll get a good or bad price for it, but just to help you. It has not been an adversely selective business from our point of view. On the loan to deposit target, I mean, you once said, and I can understand coming from Spain, why you might take the view that also Ireland and the U.K. took, which is it's fine to use lots of wholesale funding to finance retail businesses. I'm not sure it's helped the three economies to take that view. But we are not tied religiously to these targets. There, we're going to always operate with a pragmatic view, and of course, if the marketplace recommends that it was sensible to take a different view, we would.</p>
          <p>However, as we pointed out already the loan to deposit ratio of our Core businesses is 104%, so we're already in the zone. And that's because we enjoy very powerful deposit franchises which are great assets of this Group, and will be a greater asset when the trends normalize and we can actually make some money out of them, as well. And I believe that over the long term, the gold standard for banks has been zip code, as Bruce would say, zip code, a 100% loan to deposit, which leaves all of your non-loan things to be financed with wholesale funding. Obviously, we have a significant investment bank that will largely be funding through wholesale funding, or even &#x2013; although even some of that in terms of structured equity to equity linked deposits has a retail character, and so I continue to believe that if we are to establish ourselves in the of undoubted 67:41) capital strength category in the gold standard of banks, that's the zip code we must be in. Chris?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. Just on the impairment side, first half we took some extra latent provisions, <mark type="inaudible" /> obviously have to take in the second half, so we actually financed some loans and we identified them earlier, so we took them as latent provisions, and it was about 350 million-ish, something like that in the first half, and the other thing you've seen is as the year has gone on you've seen a decreasing level of businesses becoming impaired, so the identifications of those amounts are becoming smaller month by month and that's continued into 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Jonathan Pierce from Credit Suisse. I've got couple of questions. The first is on the liquidity portfolio again, from what you've said in the presentation this morning, it sounds like there's about  40 billion pounds of &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; government bonds in there, which are not FSA eligible, and the other disclosure on the debt securities portfolio suggest most of that is AAA government bonds, can you confirm where those bonds are held, and is this the portfolio you are going to start selling to move into FSA eligible bonds, and will that create a loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The actual math is about 35 billion in &#x2013; on top of the FSA eligible 20. A good chunk of that is the investment we received for the B shares, which we put into T-bills because we received that money right around Christmas time. So we have short-term U.K. gilts for 25 billion-ish in the number. And then there's another 10 billion which is basically governments held either in Citizens or in ABN AMRO, which is very high quality paper, but since it's not in the PLC, we can't count that in terms of our liquidity buffer that FSA is requiring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with the &#x2013; and the general increase in the cash balance that's in that portfolio, is that just a simple function of loans on the balance sheet falling particularly to financial institutions, and you've just been parking it with the Central Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, in general, we're much more liquid. GBM's balance sheet was more liquid, the Group balance sheet is more liquid. As loans have kind of paid off, we've had additional liquidity, and I think, that's a good thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second questions is, on slide 40, which shows some of the material &#x2013; the wholesale funding portfolio, can I just confirm that doesn't include SLS funding. Whether you're willing to give us an update of &#x2013; I know, you can't disclose this to the exact amount, but the amount of SLS funding, give or take, that you have relative to maybe CGS, and on the more detailed net stable funding ratio table, which I think is on page 144 of the release, where about in that is the SLS funding sit, I'm not entirely clear, whether it falls entirely into wholesale lending greater than one year or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the SLS funding overall is down appreciably from where it was a year ago. <mark type="inaudible" />. Yes. Go ahead. Do you want to take it?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Steve Hayne from Morgan Stanley. I just had a question around the investment bank. It seemed like a lot of the fourth quarter reporters from the U.S. had significant reductions in their investment bank, and <mark type="inaudible" /> and another major banker recent report, it seem to indicate that the fourth quarter wasn't so bad from a European angle or at least the print that you've delivered. So I was wondering if you can give a bit more flavor on what went actually quite well in the fourth quarter in the investment bank, and a second unrelated question is what sort of cost income we should expect in that for 2010, given what you've just delivered, as you say 27, 28%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, do you want to have a crack at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fourth quarter had some positive and negatives in it from the point of view of the investment bank client flows, particularly in the flow businesses where we're weak across the market, and were weak for us in general. But our equities business did well, and particularly in the structured deposits area where we made some good revenues there. So, it was really a &#x2013; from a customer flow perspective quarter weak in line with the market. But in terms of the revenue delivery, we had a strong equity quarter, and we had a strong DCM delivery quarter as well from our client franchises. But the pure trading and flow businesses were in line with the market, and we were experiencing relatively weak demand from the institutional flow side. Looking forward, I mean, it is &#x2013; clearly, when you've got one huge quarter and in the first quarter of 2009, when &#x2013; that is not going to repeat, you're more likely to see the cost income ratio of the ensuing three quarters to be repeating through to 2010 and beyond. That's probably all I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, in terms of &#x2013; I think, your subset of that was comp to revenues, and I'm not making prediction for 2010, but I think the more natural place for comp to revenues for us is mid-30s.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin from Citi. I've got a couple of questions on the impairments trends of what we saw in the fourth quarter, and how we might thing about run rates of 2010. Just on the &#x2013; going back to the question you had on the corporate side, I noticed you have a negative charge against house building and construction. And I wonder whether what we're seeing now is perhaps some writing back of any of the losses that might have been taken in previous quarters, thus &#x2013; and to what extent therefore the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter reflected movements in the commercial real estate prices. And secondly, on &#x2013; just the on Ulster Bank; there's quite a big jump in the fourth quarter, to what extent was there an element of kitchen sinking in there, whether we really are on a much deteriorating trend which we might expect to continue through 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's George Kresand from Execution. I just had two questions, the first being if I look at your 11 billion of preference share, I was wondering if there is anything you might do to covert that into tangible comment to improve the capital structure further, because you've done a brilliant job so far of improving the capital structure, and if that may not help you to get out of the APS earlier than your guidance? That's question number one. And question number two is in the U.K. we're seeing record levels of corporate debt issuance, and we're seeing banks lending balances in commercial contract, and I'm wondering if this intermediation trend will finally take off in Europe, and if this would help you produce more robust revenues in GBM this year, because this has been very much a lagging trend in Europe relative to the U.S.? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first one, clearly we have a window here to study a liability management exercise, and we certainly are considering our alternatives there, I would say it's not an easy equation with all the changing regulation around capital quantity and capital quality. We're certainly looking through that and considering what course of action we should take. I would anticipate that some time maybe mid-March, we'd have formed a view, and then we'll certainly let you know what we're going to do at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on your second point on deleveraging. I mean, of course the capital markets had probably their record ever year from a bond standpoint last year, so I think, probably that gets worse this year not better. And as you know, the actual new issuance isn't the highest margin activity out there, it's the subsequent trading that's facilitated. So I don't think, we would point to any great secular trend, but it is the case of course, that as a universal bank, we are able to service our customers when they go to the capital markets, if they're not taking loans from us, and that's a benefit of the business structure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Mike Trippitt at Oriel. Two quick questions, one on the Non-Core, you talked a lot about impairments, but I just want to ask you about the income line, which sort of came in two halves, positive income in both the third and fourth quarters. And is that &#x2013; are there any blips in there or should we now think of that as being a sort of positive income albeit obviously on a declining asset base going forward? And just secondly on GBM, you've given sort of clues on '10 and sort of size of the business in the future, but I just wondered in terms of either buy assets or risk assets, are you there or thereabout in terms of sort of balance sheet size that you'd like this business to be, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we deal with the second -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, second one first, on GBM, I would say for now the GBM balance sheet is in the rough territory that we think it should be. The risk weighted assets will inflate substantially with <mark type="inaudible" /> changes, albeit we don't expect to take more risk in GBM than we're currently taking, but that would be apparent when you work through the regulatory changes, but that's sort of how we feel about GBM. Now, of course, it will be important to see how regulatory changes impact all of our industry, but that bit in particular, and there are individual business lines that can be particularly impacted such as the mortgage business from the <mark type="inaudible" /> (79;17) changes, and so I think at the moment all one can do in essence is have a holding view pending the working through of some of those things. On the Non-core, I don't know, whether you want &#x2013; Nathan, do you want to take it -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take it, but Nathan, if you want to add anything. But in Non-Core, we've had some volatility around the trading activity line, so we have the special asset unit there, and we're working down those exposures. The fact is those positions, as the markets have improved, the losses there have reduced, and we've also been taking active steps to restructure and hedge that exposure. So I think you're starting to see the fruits of that in the second half of the year. And we're also &#x2013; I think, have a much cleaner allocation of interest income and so the interest income levels that you're now seeing in the fourth quarter we would expect to sustain in 2010. Is there anything you'd want to add? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just sneak in a little follow-up, because I mean, the net interest income was pretty well double the run rate Q4 over the previous quarter. So you're sort of saying that is a sort of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is an updraft from our kind of allocation models internally as part of that, but then as I mentioned earlier, when I said the 183, it was probably closer to 180, there was also some restructuring interest that we received that boosted that number to some degree.</p>

I've just got one questions, and just two small points of clarification, firstly, clearly the U.S. business has been very challenging over the last couple of years, and it feels like with NPLs plateauing the margin has clearly gone up, and signaling a sharp increase looks like for 2010, so I was just wondering if you'd give us more color on the U.S. business, and the just on points of clarification. I'm trying to read between the lines on your margin guidance. It feels like you're telling us that the five basis point increase we've seen in the last couple of quarters is what we should think of as a reasonable trajectory going into 2010, so I'd just appreciate if you could comment on that, and also very appreciative of the comments around the Group still being in loss in 2010, I'm just wondering if you could clarify is that at the operating level or at the statutory level?

So while I think they &#x2013; the conditions drove a small loss in 2009, the things that you're pointing out in terms of improving pipeline on NPLs and impairments that's going to be positive and the NIM, some of the actions we've taken on the NIM also will be positive.

I think, we said gentle, you've seen five basis points kind of normalized for the last two quarters, and unless &#x2013; until we see some competitive dynamic change or something in the yield environment or interest rate environment change that kind of feels okay, something zero to five. But there's a lot of things that kind of move through the NIM and that can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. So anyway, that's what I'd say on that. And on the losses...</p>

          <p>I think, we should invite our audience here to identify, who's been really accurate in forecasting bank profitability or losses in recent years. It's not a &#x2013; it's not a fantastic track record. Okay. Now Robert, you had a question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Robert Law of Nomura. Could I have two questions on the balance sheet please; firstly on the capital position, you've emphasized the strength of the capital position, but I think you regard it in your statement as appropriate or adequate, which isn't particularly strong phraseology. And I think from the presentation, I've got the impression that you view the capital as supporting the run off in the Non-Core assets. Could I invite you to just comment a bit more on this, I mean, what would it take for you to feel that you actually now have more than an appropriate level of capital position, and do we from this take a view that you expect the run off of the Core or the Non-Core assets to absorb the capital that's now backing them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, the best way Robert to answer that is that as we said our target when Non-Core is no longer an issue, and when the new regulatory rules are in place is 8% plus, that's what we've reaffirmed for 2013. Now of course, you can put square brackets around that if you want, because it does depend on what the new regulatory rules are and so on and so forth. And so &#x2013; for now, I think, we are thinking that the 11% that we currently have can go down to a steady state eight plus after absorbing Non-Core losses and increased regulatory requirements. But you could easily imagine for example if the regulatory requirements came in very abruptly and in a severe way, you could imagine us dipping below that level, particularly in something like the DTAs or if the new regulatory requirements came in a much slower and milder way, you could imagine us having a significant substantial, very substantial capital cushion above that, which we would then need to decide, if we like what to do with. So I do think, we and all banks are in a particularly difficult position to comment on these two things, but at the moment, that's probably the best that we can say in terms of our thought about capital.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate it. It's difficult given the uncertainties around, but you don't regard your capital position as adequate, I think, was the phrase you used?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't say adequate, I did say, I thought we had a strong capital position. I think, I might have even used the word war chest, but I think, it's appropriate to have that in light of the regulatory changes, and the forecast for the Non-Core run down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, <mark type="inaudible" /> comments initially, but anyway. Fine, if I move on to the second question which was on the funding structure, I mean, in the slide 40, you're hopefully referring to the run off of the Non-Core assets and the maturing wholesale funding that you've got, can I ask you to just comment on what your funding requirements do you think will be, despite that situation in the wholesale markets, and do you think the market is responsive enough to allow this kind of run off to proceed at this point, and I want to ask, what's the &#x2013; what is the total amount of government backed funding that you have at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just as a data point we issued 20 billion of unguaranteed wholesale funding last year, and I think that type of number is a number that we feel comfortable we can get done this year, without commenting specifically on what those plans are, and again, some of that will relate to the path of the Non-Core run down. In terms of the government guaranteed funding, I'm not sure we've disclosed that, Richard, what was that? I mean, what's that?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for sitting through all of that. I just in sort of bringing it together wanted to be clear where we are. We are very pleased with the progress that RBS has made last year. We think that we have hit and beaten the targets for that stage of the journey, and we think that that makes the rest of the journey more credible. And if you like that positive sentiment is echoed in some of the &#x2013; like minor body language around NIM and impairments for next year and the other targets that we have reaffirmed for the outer years.</p>
          <p>But we do have to be very, very clear that while the worst year may be behind us, there is plenty of heavy lifting to go and there are plenty of uncertainties in the world economy. We do expect 2010 to be a tough slog. We are not particularly trying to change consensus for 2010 with this meeting, although hopefully it will narrow, so we are still cautious &#x2013; cautiously positive, turning to more positive in the outer years, and this is a big ship to turnaround and we think we are doing it. The people are doing a fantastic job at that, but it still is a big turnaround.</p>
