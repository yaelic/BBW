          <p>Good morning and thank you for waiting. We would like to welcome everyone to AMBEV's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results Conference Call. Today with us we have Mr. Jo&#xE3;o Castro Neves, CEO for AMBEV, and Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer.</p>
          <p>We would like to inform you that this event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode during the company's presentation. After AMBEV's remarks are completed there will be a question-and-answer session. At that time, further instructions will be given. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of AMBEV's management and on information currently available to the company. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events and, therefore, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future result of AMBEV and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>I would also like to remind everyone that, as usual, the percentage changes that will be discussed during today's call are both organic and normalized in nature. And unless otherwise stated, percentage changes refer to comparisons with Q4 and full year 2011 results. Normalized figures refer to performance measures before special items which are either income or expenses that do not occur regularly as part of AMBEV's normal activities. As normalized figures are non-GAAP measures, the company discloses that consolidated profit, EPS, EBIT and EBITDA on a fully reported basis in the earnings release.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Nelson Jamel, CFO and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Jamel, you may begin your conference call, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thanks for attending our 2012 fourth quarter and full year earnings call. I'll start with a brief overview of our performance and then Jo&#xE3;o will comment on our results by division. And to wrap things up, I'll return to discuss our financial figures before we move to Q&amp;A. So let's begin.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter performance gave us a strong finish for the year. Net revenues grew 13.7% in the quarter. EBITDA was up 15.7% organically and our normalized EBITDA margin was 54.4%, an organic expansion of 90 basis points. For the year, we delivered net revenue growth of 12.4%, EBITDA growth of 13.6%, as well as 50 basis points of margin expansion, giving us 48.6% for the year.</p>
          <p>Before we go into the highlights of our divisional performance, Brazil net revenues increased 14.3% in the fourth quarter, while volumes rebounding and growing 3.5%. EBITDA grew 15.8% with EBITDA margin expanding 70 basis points to 58.4%. For the year, net revenues grew 12.7% while EBITDA performance was 14.3% better. And EBITDA margins expanded 80 basis points to 52.6%.</p>
          <p>Latin America South delivered 20.6% of net revenue growth in the quarter, 28% of EBITDA growth and 310 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion, which reached 53.5%. All this in the quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:02) the lack of volume decline of 3.2%. In the year, net revenue grew 19.9%, EBITDA 21.6%, and EBITDA margin was 46.8%, an expansion of 6 basis points.</p>
          <p>Canada delivered 0.9% EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter despite the 2.4% of volume decline, which was mostly industry driven. Net revenue per hectoliter meanwhile boasts an improvement of 1.7% and EBITDA margin expands 50 basis points to 44%. For the full year, despite the slight volume decline of 0.5% EBITDA actually increased 0.7%, thanks to 1.5% net revenue growth, while we delivered a margin EBITDA of 41.5%.</p>
          <p>In HILA-ex, had a transformational year by delivering organic volume growth of 3.1% and BRL 117.7 million of EBITDA in the quarter, with an EBITDA margin of 24.8%. It did total BRL 204.9 million in 2012 and EBITDA margin jumped to 50.3%, both of which are substantial improvements versus our historic performance. Our normalized profit in the fourth quarter exceeded BRL 3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it to Jo&#xE3;o. Jo&#xE3;o?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nelson, and good afternoon, everyone. I am extremely pleased with how we ended the year. To deliver double-digit EBITDA growth with margin expansion and operational average in the type of environment we face in Brazil, in Latin America South is quite an accomplishment. Moreover, albeit for different reasons, 2012 was a truly remarkable year for Brazil soft drinks and our HILA-ex business. We take pride in these results, especially because of the ability of our people to execute the plan in the fourth quarter, which really paved the way for another year of strong results despite the uncertainties and threats surrounding us. So I would like to congratulate and thank our team for the fourth quarter and full-year results I'm about to share with you.</p>
          <p>Let's first take a closer look at our actual performance starting with Beer Brazil. After very little volume growth in Q3, Beer Brazil volumes bounced back and grew 2.9% for the quarter, while net revenues per hectoliter increased a solid 10.9%, giving us top-line growth of roughly 14% for the quarter. Volumes benefited from industry being up an estimated 4.7% though market share year-over-year continued to be under short-term pressure, given our third quarter pricing activity.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, however, the good news is that we actually started recovering market share by the end of the year, which helped us reach an average of 68.5% for the full year. For the year, both the industry and our volumes performed better than 2011, growing 3.2% and 2.5% respectively, and as we highlighted during the course of the year, our focus on innovation, premium brands, north and northeast and returnables had a lot to do with this improved performance.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, COGS per hectoliter increased 11.9% in the fourth quarter 2012. This was mostly caused by greater barley and aluminum cost, as well as higher depreciation of our industrial assets and a negative packaging mix due to greater one-way volume growth. Also, as mentioned in our press release, the different mix also impacted our full-year performance for COGS in Brazil, which has rose 6.6%, slightly ahead of inflation.</p>
          <p>In terms of expenses, SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization, in the quarter were up 7% primarily due to a decline in admin expenses, tied for the most part to lower accruals for variable compensation as compared to last year but also thanks to distribution cost, which continues to grow at the slower pace. All in all, the end product was a 16.6% EBITDA growth with 130 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter and 13.9% EBITDA growth with 80 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion for 2012.</p>
          <p>Moving along to Brazil Soft Drinks and Non-Alcohol Non-Carbonated business, in the fourth quarter volumes grew ahead of beer at 5.1% thanks mostly to an estimated industry growth of 3% and market share gains of 20 basis points, averaging 18.1% for the quarter and for the year. As was the case in Beer, our price increase in the third quarter contributed to solid net revenue per hectoliter growth of 9.7% for Brazil division in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Consistency in our commercial strategy has continued to pay off with our efforts around Guaran&#xE1; Antarctica, Pepsi, the 1 liter returnable glass bottle and the 237 milliliter PET bottle, all still working very well and very strong for us.</p>
          <p>On the COGS side, Brazil Soft Drinks unit COGS per hectoliter grew below inflation for the quarter and for the year, 5.5% and 5.1% respectively. In both instance, our favorable currency hedges were decisive in offsetting the commodity headwinds we faced in terms of sugar and PET resin cost. SG&amp;A, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased much less than previous quarters, up only 4.9% in the fourth quarter, also benefiting from lower admin expenses.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, Brazil Soft Drinks EBITDA improved 11.1% in the quarter, leading to 16.4% growth for the full year. And though EBITDA margins contracted 200 basis points in the fourth quarter, for the year they still managed to expand 80 basis points to an unprecedented 49.4% margin.</p>
          <p>Turning to HILA-ex, Jamel has already highlighted how we finished 2012 on a high note by delivering substantial improvements on our reported figures. Our integration efforts in Dominican Republic continue to move along as planned and, in addition, I would just like to give some color on our organic volume performance which has kept improving considerably, most notably in countries such as Guatemala, where accelerated volume growth has driven our market share to nearly 30% in the fourth quarter 2012. There is still much to be done, be we think we are once again on the right path.</p>
          <p>In Latin American South, the overall dynamic over the fourth quarter in terms of top-line performance remain unchanged since the second quarter in that volumes continued to suffer from a slowdown in economic activity in Argentina, while our net revenues per hectoliter continued to deliver strong results. Volumes declined 3.2% in the region, but net revenue per hectoliter grew 24.5% in the quarter, giving us 20.6% of top-line growth. For the year, volumes were down 0.8% but net revenue rose 19.9%.</p>
          <p>Equally important, our brands continue to be in good shape with market share gains in most of the region, Argentina included. Despite the short-term hardship in Argentina, we continue to be very active in the marketplace by adding capacity, by having even stronger communication and, therefore, supporting our mainstream and premium brands, and also through innovation. For example, in the fourth quarter, we launched Quilmes Night and Stella Artois Noire, while in CSD, the top performer was H2Oh! Limonetto.</p>
          <p>Full year COGS and SG&amp;A for the region grew 15.6% and 21.4%, respectively, mainly impacted by inflationary pressures in Argentina. We ended up delivering in Latin American South a 28% growth in EBITDA in the quarter, with EBITDA margin up 310 basis points to 53.5%, whereas for the year we delivered double-digit growth of 21.6%, as per our guidance, as well as 60 basis points of margin expansion to arrive at 46.8%.</p>
          <p>As for Canada, in the fourth quarter, Labatt's volume declined by 2.1%, largely driven by a weaker industry. By our estimates, the Canadian beer industry declined by 1.9% versus the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the impact of the hockey lockout. Our market share averaged 4.5% in the quarter and 40.6% for the year. Bud Light delivered another quarter of strong results, gaining market share both in the quarter and full year 2012. Net revenues per hectoliter increased by 1.7% as promotional activities declined and benefit from earlier price increases were realized. This performance topped off an overall better year in terms of pricing, with net revenues per hectoliter up 2% for the year.</p>
          <p>As for costs and expenses in the quarter, COGS per hectoliter increased by 3.3% due to higher commodity costs and continued shift in product and packaging mix. But SG&amp;A decreased by 2.2% mostly due to the timing of marketing investments behind our key programming in previous quarters, as there was a lower team sponsorship cost as a result of the shorter hockey season.</p>
          <p>The net result was an increase in EBITDA of 0.9% in the quarter and 0.7% for the year. In retrospect, we're encouraged by the significant progress made on some key fronts. First, Budweiser association with hockey and its position as the most preferred brand among young adults. Second, the growth of our Light segment brands in every quarter, led by Bud Light. Third, the contribution of our innovations to market share helped performance, especially Michelob Ultra, Bud Light Lime Mojito. And, fourth, the achievement of a better equilibrium between price and market share.</p>
          <p>I would like now to comment on our expectations for 2013. As we mentioned in our press release, 2013 should be another year in which we have to deal with macroeconomic environment that has been rather difficult to predict in the year where we will face yet again higher taxes in Brazil. Though our results of the past two years should be evidence that we have managed to perform well when up against similarly challenging environments, it's equally true that 2013 should not be any easier than 2012. We see no reason for pessimism, however, quite the contrary. We continue to focus on delivering a combination of volume and net revenue per hectoliter growth at the right mix in terms of channel, regional and packaging, as well as applying our usual cost management discipline.</p>
          <p>We believe the beer industry in Brazil can grow around the same levels of 2012, since the overall environment is not materially different from what we saw during last year. Taxes started to rise again, this time a part of it in April and a part of it in October. But on the other hand, we're expecting increasing minimum wage and low unemployment levels to translate once more into support of disposable income growth.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the Brazilian federal government remains in pursuit of accelerated growth rates, and we believe domestic consumption should benefit as a result. January was actually a very strong month for the industry, but since industry performance in January was positively impacted by inventory building to be ready for the earlier Carnival, it's too early to treat any short-term reading as a valid proxy for the remaining of the year.</p>
          <p>Our view for 2013 is that when one looks at fundamental drivers of industry growth, pricing, disposable income and weather, one should find good reason for the beer industry to grow around the same levels of 2012. That said, we do expect the beginning of the year to be especially challenging for the industry because of the earlier Carnival and slightly poorer weather, mainly rain.</p>
          <p>As for our commercial strategy, the top priorities remain essentially the same, with some improvements based on what we learned during 2012. One additional reason why the execution of the sales and marketing initiatives will be key is the World Cup, which is right around the corner, not to mention the Confederations Cup, which happens this year. 2013 will be the year to test and/or accelerate with scalability many of the initiatives we have in place for the actual games, but also things we believe can leave a legacy for our business.</p>
          <p>During 2012, we began to share with you some of the concepts we have been testing, such as the micro events as well as some of the platforms that have been investing behind. For instance, Brahma's sponsorship of local soccer teams. There are many more things in store. The focused execution of our sales and marketing plan will also be decisive for net revenues per hectoliter performance, which we expect to be high-single digits for the year. The carryover of our 2012 pricing should be helpful, but we also expect greater premium volume growth and higher direct distribution which also contributed towards this level of performance.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, however, we will face perhaps the greatest headwind when comparing 2013 to 2012. As you know, a relevant portion of our cost is linked to U.S. dollar, and our hedging policy mandates than on average we remain hedged 12 months ahead. Therefore, even though our commodity hedges should generate a gain year-over-year, this will be far from enough to offset the headwind resulting from the devaluation of the Brazilian real. Also, with the changes to the federal tax for soft drinks in 2012, we will face additional headwinds in that business unit.</p>
          <p>Net-net we expect COGS per hectoliter in Brazil to grow high single to low double digits for the year based on our current product mix, with COGS per hectoliter for soft drinks growing high teens. And we firmly believe that Brazil's medium and long-term prospects remain unparalleled as the country's beer market offers growth and profitability opportunities for which we are well-positioned. Of course, we much continue to execute, but the opportunities are there. And in order to fully capture the growth that lies ahead, we have announced that we intended to invest around BRL 3 billion in CapEx for Brazil, most of which will be supply chain related, which is our highest ever.</p>
          <p>First, late last year, we have already announced our plans to build greenfield breweries in the States of Minas Gerais and Paran&#xE1;. Second, our continuing efforts behind a 300 milliliter returnable glass bottle, Budweiser and the 1 liter returnable glass bottle for Guaran&#xE1; Antarctica requiring further capacity to support the type of growth we're striving for on the commercial side. And third, we believe it's important to have the majority of our 2014 capacity requirements in place by the end of this year, as we will not have the ability to add a lot of capacity in any material way during 2014, given the World Cup.</p>
          <p>Nelson, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jo&#xE3;o. Let me now walk you through the main items between the normalized EBIT of a little over than BRL 5 billion and profits of around BRL 3.7 billion for the quarter, as set forth on page 5 of our press release.</p>
          <p>Our net finance results were a negative BRL 240 million. This results primarily from the BRL 65 million non-cash accretion expense in connection with the put option associated with four investments in the Cervecer&#xED;a Nacional Dominicana. Lower interest rates income due to lower interest rates versus the same periods in the previous year and higher expense related to derivative instruments.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended up being 20.4%, which was mostly due to high interest on non-capital, goodwill amortizations and a lot of tax adjustments as compared to the fourth quarter 2011, all of which were important to offset the greater taxable basis because of our higher EBIT performance in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, we finished the year with a net cash position of approximately BRL 6.2 billion. Since then on January 21 we paid out roughly BRL 3 billion in dividends and interest on capital and an additional payment of about BRL 2.1 billion is due to be paid on March 28 as we announced yesterday morning.</p>
          <p>Going forward we will continue to pursue the appropriate balance of reinvesting in our go-forward business. These organic through the BRL 3 billion of CapEx in Brazil mentioned by you all or through solid M&amp;A while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity and returning excess cash to shareholders over time.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to open up for Q&amp;A. So, Mike, can you remind folks of the procedure to get to the Q&amp;A, please?</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question we have comes from Lore Serra of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for the call. I guess I wanted to just start out, Jo&#xE3;o, if you could give us a little bit of your perspective on the market right now in terms of how well your pricing actions last year in September/October have been absorbed in the market? How much you see competitors sort of following the pricing?</p>
          <p>And then how you think about this year? You mentioned a number of the comments in the call, but we will see an environment this year with less increase in minimum wages, and I think embedded in your guidance is the view that you can do sort of at the consumer level, low double-digit pricing in order to meet that guidance. So how you're thinking about that, what you're seeing and how we should think about that for this year. That would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, Lore. Thanks for the question. Actually, we feel very positive about the current pricing environment. We mentioned high single for the net sales per hectoliter and double digit for total top line. Okay? So that's a little bit of the difference.</p>
          <p>But the pricing momentum is very positive and I think there are two reasons to feel that way. First is the fourth quarter volumes, given all the pricing that we had in the third quarter, which so for the full impact in the fourth quarter, and the quarter being a very good one on the volume and on the combination. We're always looking for the right balance of price and volume. I think we had a good one, a better one in 2012 and a very good one in the fourth quarter before we started 2013 excited given that we accomplished what we wanted for the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And second, I think given that the market is becoming more and more formal, we are seeing maybe for that reason also a much greater followship. Followship is above average. So the combination of a strong volume in the fourth quarter, the combination of pricing is sticking. Some consumer resilience if you want, and then pricing followship above average. And therefore, now three months, three consecutive months of either neutral or positive share gains, which are putting us strongly into our desired range of 67% to 69%, but actually being above 68%, I think the whole combination of pricing and share. We have started &#x2013; we ended 2012 on certainly a good foot, which therefore, puts us in a good one for the beginning of 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. And I know that you gave a lot of information in terms of your cost outlook. I guess it was a bit higher than expected in terms of the COGS pressure. Is there any concern that you have in terms of differential kind of trends versus the market as you head into 2013? I suppose I would have guessed that the commodity part of it would have helped you more, and I just wonder what that means as you think about the market dynamics for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So I actually think from a competitive marketing environment I see overall positive. Number one, ending up the year with, let's say, with the pain moving up, with more formality, which is true for beer and true big time for soft drinks. And then, on top of that, everyone feeling the same pain not just from tax, even more from taxes, and the same one from the hedges, I see no reason, because we are very close to the average.</p>
          <p>Jamel mentioned the numbers and can get into the details of the average, but the average are even slightly better than what you see for people that are buying spot. So I see people either mimicking our policy or buying spot. So the ones that are buying spot are even buying more expensive than our average hedge rate. So I see the pressure to be equal or greater for both taxes or COGS when compared to us, competition versus us.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just to add one point, Lore. I think in terms of our COGS guidance, as you mentioned and asked, I think it's important to emphasize that, of course, we have the biggest hit is coming from the current devaluation as part of our hedging policy, as Jo&#xE3;o mentioned, and that's again partially offset by commodities, which we were able to hedge at most favorable prices. And I think it's also important to distinguish what you're going to see the beer from soft drinks, let's say, beer being 80% of our business in Brazil. We feel more comfortable about the overall evolution of our results.</p>
          <p>As we said, we are guiding for high-single digit net revenue. We think total Brazil could be between high-single and low-double digit, but beer should be more towards high-single. So we should have a sort of a, as Jo&#xE3;o mentioned, double-digit top-line growth in beer with gross margins before <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:27) for the same quarter.</p>
          <p>When you go to soft drinks there because not all of the currency impact but also some changes in terms of tax credits we have on raw materials, they recognize more of a pressure and that's why we try to emphasize that only, let's say, 20% of our business there'll be more of a gross margin pressure, but it's not the case for beer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, Mike. Good afternoon or good day, everybody. And congratulations on the quarter, guys. Yeah, I guess with respect to the offsets, right, if I'm doing the math correctly, it seems to me that if you get a high-single digit price increase in Brazil and that if Felipe's representation on the ABI call is correct, that 60% of your COGS in Brazil are dollar-linked, then you should have no difficulty maintaining margins. Am I missing something? Or is there greater brand investments or other things that could adversely impact the outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, it is &#x2013; the guidance we give regarding currency, we had last year so the BRL 1.6, the 65% rate in our COGS, and for this year it's going to be around BRL 1.93 is already locked into actual or roughly 40% of our COGS to be more precise has this currency valuation impact which accounts for at the EBITDA margin level for Brazil as a whole that could take away roughly 180 bps of our margin, that alone.</p>

          <p>But that would be a 14% drag on 40% of COGS for a 65% gross margin business when you blend it, it's a little bit more than that now, if I'm not mistaken, just off the top of my head. It seems to me that high-single digit pricing will more than compensate for this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for sure for soft drinks. We think we're going to have more of a pressure, like I just said in the previous question to Lore, because there we could have high-teens, so that would be one of pressure. But definitely for beer, we are going to have much less of a pressure in terms of gross margin. And if we think in absolute terms, if you think of double-digit top-line growth, we could also think of double-digit gross margin growth for beer, if you will. The basic math beyond &#x2013; on the calculation we are providing or the guidance we are providing, sorry. But for soft drinks, again, that'd be more of a pressure for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the soft drinks, that's primarily due to the juice component, right, that there was a favorable treatment for some juice-based beverages, and that disappears, even if you used it as like lemon and Pepsi with lemon and that sort of thing, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact, the lemon and the Guaran&#xE1; raw materials, they have an impact on the net revenue because they have a higher excise as this benefit of having natural flavors has gone up with <mark type="ph" /> 50% discount (29:51). It will really affect the COGS, the combination of currency as well, but also tax credit on some concentrates and incentives that we had in raw materials that was shortened by one-third. So that's going to drive us from the high-single to the impact of high-teens growth in COGS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you. Then one last question, that is when you look at the informal or the Tuba&#xED;na section of the marketplace, how much of your market share do you think you've taken from the Tuba&#xED;nas? And what kind of an opportunity do they represent for you going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bob. This is Jo&#xE3;o. Thanks for the question. I think if we look at the last 12 months to 18 months, since we launched the 1 liter returnable and since the Tuba&#xED;nas have been more under pressure from the tax reform, I think the combination of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:55) on them for the last 18 months and the changes in the tax regulation that Jamel just mentioned, combination of the juice law and the Manaus tax incentive will put even additional pressure on them.</p>
          <p>We probably already took between 50 basis points to 100 basis points, if you want, and I think there is two, three times of that looking out two, three years ahead. So I think there's much to be done as an opportunity for our flavor brands and the cola brands we have, both Guaran&#xE1;, Sukita and Pepsi to even take more space.</p>
          <p>If we think about it, I think we mentioned our main competitor had launched returnable glass bottles about eight years ago. We gave them a lot of space for many years. We decided to stop that. About a year-and-a-half ago we started with very good results, and I think the future is bright in terms of being able to capture more share coming ahead. So your question is right on the target.</p>

          <p>The next question I have comes from Alan Alanis of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. Congratulations, everyone. I have a couple of questions. The first one has to do with working capital. Before putting the question, I think it's a congratulations for Jamel and his team. I think it's the sixth consecutive year that you have working capital improvement as a percentage of sales, and I'm seeing it as a record level of 24%. So the first question has to do &#x2013; do you think that, Jamel, that that kind of improvement can continue in 2013? And then I have a question for Jo&#xE3;o on a different topic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Alan, and thanks. Indeed, when we think of our working capital, this is something we have been focusing on for three or four years now and, of course, the low-hanging fruits are not there anymore but have been in consistently improving our performance while managing our accounts receivables, inventory lab, but mainly our payables. And I think there are still opportunities there to be captured.</p>
          <p>We always like to think about like &#x2013; when I think of  ZBB, for instance, we have best practices for more than 10 years now and year after year, and 2012 was no different, was an important contributor to our results as well. We are always learning and doing better, so we think we can still do much better in terms of our working capital management. And that's, of course, our business to keep up and make a stronger free cash flow. So we think and are confident that we can do even better in 2013 as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. That's very useful. And then a quick question for Jo&#xE3;o. I think it's similar to the questions that have been asked, but from a different angle and putting more emphasis on the operating expenses of the beer business, Jo&#xE3;o. You mentioned all this innovation about the Brahma sponsorships or the investments in the market on top of the innovation, the Brahma sponsorships, the mini events and, obviously, the move that you're doing towards premiumization.</p>
          <p>I think a lot of the questions that we as analysts are asking have to do with or will be answered in one way or the other with the level of operating expenses that you can maintain in 2013. So I guess the way to frame the question is how much more investment or how much are you going to put the accelerator on all of these events and all of this more continued innovation in 2013 in order to grow operating expenses at a pace that's sort of similar to the past?</p>
          <p>Or are you going to say, look, this is a great opportunity, the World Cup is next year, I'm going to spend a little bit more on the market in anticipation of that? And I think that'll give us a lot of the answer in terms of what we should expect in terms of margins and EBITDA growth on the beer business in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, Alan. Very good question. I think, first, taking from your first question for Jamel. So you're right, I also have to congratulate him and his team for what they did. But every time we do that, it just give us good ideas to stretch the target even further again. So that's one point.</p>
          <p>And I think second, he's committed in his team and our team and my team, we're all committed to do the best zero-based budget planning execution ever. So we are committed of having the best ever for the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>Why? Well, number one, because it's always good to practice what we believe in. And, second, because I think the opportunities on the non-fixed packages, let's put it this way, especially the commercial sector are very big. Every time, and you have to remember the discipline of looking risk return. So if we find the mini event to be a positive project, it will mean it will be a positive project almost for sure in 12 months. So most of the time the things that we are from a P&amp;L standpoint are investing on, it will give us a return between one and one-and-a-half years.</p>
          <p>So we find positive NPV projects, as we do believe the micro events are, the association between Brahma and soccer is, we will put the accelerator big time on. If we think they are not coming with the return that we expect, we have shown that we can answer headwinds or tailwinds very quickly. I mean, we had 2010 very good volume years and we adjusted very quickly and played on the aggressive, on the offense side, very quickly.</p>
          <p>And 2011 and 2012 were slower years, more pricing years than volume years, and we quickly adjust the ZBB or the commercial investments to be adequate to that while, of course, protecting our share and at the same time reaching our EBITDA targets. So I think being positively pressured by the combination of having to achieve the EBITDA and the share objectives give us the right framework to look at the projects on a manner that they will be positive return once.</p>
          <p>I actually feel one of the best year ever in terms of the commercial initiatives that we have for 2013 and 2014. I think you mentioned an important point. Right now, I think one difference when you look at 2013 for other years is that now we are almost looking on a two year. Because World Cup is now around the corner, so a lot of things we do now will have an impact in 2014. And we want to have the best World Cup ever in Brazil and before we are, we'll be planning during the, let's say, the Confederations Cup is a great pilot that I think will also affect sales on a positive manner. But more than that, we'll be able to test everything that we want for the game, which is the World Cup.</p>
          <p>And I think a way to tie all this is the CapEx. Because we are not investing the highest amount ever in company's history if we do not believe in a strong 2014. So I think the combination of 2013 and 2014 for many things we will look at our investments, both from an operating expense but mainly from a CapEx standpoint, looking at the combination of both years.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Thank you very much. My question is related to your statement in your release. You said that this first quarter 2013 should be challenging, mainly due to an earlier Carnival and slightly poorer weather, right? I understand the reason you mentioned that and the way they came back in the first quarter, but I would just like to understand the size of these impacts. I mean, are we talking about flat volumes in the first quarter, decreasing volumes, or just a small growth?</p>
          <p>And also, EBITDA related to the selling or the sell-out of the beer. Because as far as we can tell the industry had a strong production level in January, right? So if you could elaborate a bit more on that, I would appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. For sure. I mean, let's first elaborate a little bit more on that. We had some, let's say, reports on Monday which affected the way people are looking at things. We'll not answer precisely in terms of what is the exact number for the quarter, for the obvious reason.</p>
          <p>But what we can say, first is that January was a very strong month for the industry. However, since January was positively impacted by the inventory building, we should be ready for February, which is the earlier Carnival. We cannot treat January figures as a proxy for the remainder of the year. So it was actually the opposite from what was in the Brazilian press.</p>
          <p>But having said that, we expect the beginning of the year to be challenging because of the earlier Carnival and a lot of the rain in two very important regions, mostly the southeast of Brazil. So anytime the Carnival is so soon, so when it's earlier, this will have an impact on the first quarter. It's early to say how much, but that's why we said among all the quarters, in Brazil we expect this one to be the most difficult one.</p>
          <p>But again, that doesn't change our view for the year, given that the fundamental drivers of the industry: pricing, disposable income and weather. And on top of that, Confederations Cup, which is something that never happened in the country before, for which we've been preparing for the past couple years. We believe this will change a little bit the potential perspective. So, therefore, no material changes in our view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. My first question was asked, but I wanted to also ask you about the reclassification of Peru and Ecuador into LAS. You could've done this when you exited the active management of Venezuela. You could've done it, I suppose, when you took over CND last year. And I was just curious as to why now? And should we be reading anything into your future strategy in Central America, which is, I guess, the remainder of HILA-ex as a result of this change right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jose. Thanks for the question. You almost answered for me, but I'll detail a little bit. Basically, given that the acquisition was done in May, it would be very awkward to do the change during the year. You never know when an acquisition is going to be finalized. We had thought about these changes actually for a couple of years many times.</p>
          <p>When I moved to Latin American South, then we thought again when &#x2013; not because I moved back, but because when there were changes in the zone presence on the view of leaders of the region, we thought about it. We didn't think it was the right timing back then. But now that we have already one major business and, therefore, a business unit that has the potential of BRL 200 million or BRL 300 million, BRL 400 million, we think it's enough to take away. And there are some synergies by putting Peru and Ecuador close to Chile and Bolivia. So the synergies were there, but now we are doing a couple of things that is the right timing to move.</p>
          <p>And what you mentioned is very important. We have had always high hopes for Central America and the Caribbean. Now the hopes have transformed into something real, which is Dominican Republic, with also now very good results already in Guatemala, as I mentioned in the speech, having reached 30% in the fourth quarter. So we feel very excited. And we see, to be quite honest, many more opportunities in the region. So by having a full business unit focused on the region we think it's the right thing for our Ambev business to be focusing in that manner. And we're already seeing the benefits of having organized this now for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just follow up on your comment there, given that your market share is increasing quite a bit in Guatemala, are we any closer to potentially executing, I guess, the acquisition you've always hoped to achieve there? It certainly seems like we're getting closer to the point of something happening there, although I appreciate it if you can't comment on that. No problem. But any color you can give us there would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So say we don't comment on any speculation on inorganic growth, but what we can tell you is that we are very focused on very strong organic growth in Guatemala but also in the region. We see a lot of opportunities, even exports to different islands. So really a lot to do. Very, very excited with the region and what we can do either organic or inorganic, but we cannot comment on anything that is not organic.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And very good results and congratulations to you guys. I guess I wanted to start off first on this challenging first quarter reference in the press release. I heard your answer just now and I was just &#x2013; I mean I was just wondering, the first quarter of last year had a couple of things, as well, You increased your SG&amp;A with the Carnival in the northeast there in Salvador. And it seems also that your hedge will be still favorable in this first quarter. Am I missing something? Or I mean it seems to me that those two things would make it so that it perhaps would offset some of this rain and the inventory buildup or if you could comment a little bit more on that, that would be great about the first quarter?</p>
          <p>I guess the second question I had really relates to the soft drink. It's interesting how the industry grew slower in Brazil than beer. And I was hoping you could kind of give us some color about that differential? And specifically, on soft drink, is it only &#x2013; are you only seeing share gains from the informal B brands or not?</p>
          <p>And the third and final thing, obviously, we think that there's probably going to be a conclusion to the acquisition of Modelo in the coming months. And if you could give us any color of what that might mean or any comment, what that might mean for you guys vis-&#xE0;-vis brand launches or geographical reconfigurations within the structure of your company that would be great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well both Jamel and I will take some of the questions. Let me start with the last one. I think Modelo there's very little to comment. Of course, it's more for ABI and whenever they are able to close the deal. Of course, we as operators and knowing and having run many of the Latin American countries, the Corona brand's a very good one.</p>
          <p>We have taken already, in Uruguay and in Peru, we already operate the brand in those two countries and we're happy with the results. But it's always different when the relationship changes I mean we will be probably more proactive. There are many other countries in Latin America that we run and that we see the good potential for the brand. I think that's the main change that I can see that if and when the deal is closed. But so, before anything besides that is more for ABI.</p>
          <p>In terms of soft drinks, I think the industry in 2012 was very close to be quite honest. What was different was our own volume because of the share gain we have. If I'm not mistaken, the main competitor had very similar shares, okay? So I guess the consequence if they have similar shares and we gain a lot, I mean we're probably taking more from everybody else. Okay, more from my conclusion, which was a little bit the answer on the previous question and, therefore, a lot more to do.</p>
          <p>I think what's also interesting is I mean, of course, there are the pushbacks or the already highlighted threats, especially from the COGS impacts changes in soft drinks. But having said that, I mean, the last quarter was very strong and the tax changes were already in place. And we continue to believe also in the new use. I mean not just the one returnable bottle, which is great for share and volume, but also the <mark type="ph" /> PT 237 (48:40) that we continue to grow like 20%, 30%, 40%. So very, very strong single serve opportunity.</p>
          <p>We are also very excited with what we've been able to do so far with Fusion, our own energy drinks brand. But also we have mentioned that we have signed an agreement with Monster. So we believe that the combination of Monster and Fusion will be a very strong competitor in that segment which we see it's growing. And we see foreseeable growth from what we see in Brazil but from seeing what happened in other markets. And we have also signed an agreement and we will start serving soon <mark type="ph" /> Venice Clear (49:22) water products as we have in other countries and we think that's also an opportunity going forward.</p>
          <p>So great, solid business. Great new news <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:29) brand is stronger than ever. And the number one consumer brand in Facebook so in social media, above 10 million, we just celebrated that in the last quarter. So it's great to have one of our brands as the number one distilled brand in the country. And the new news of Fusion, Monster and water. And now I think for the remainder of your questions, Jamel will take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, Alex, in the guidance we gave for Q1, of course, it was about volume only. So we talk about the early Carnival, more rain. That's all volume and that's only guidance we're going to give. I mean, of course, the points you raised they are all valid in the sense that SG&amp;A did increased last year because of the Carnival activities we took over, but the days &#x2013; so that's not going to create any problem for us in terms of comparison. So we did it last year and we are doing it this year as well. So that's pretty much comparable.</p>
          <p>And then regarding COGS, indeed we're going to have more favorable COGS or more favorable hedges in terms of dollar in our COGS in Q1. But the commodity gain is in terms of the hedges, they are also strong and also for the balance of the year. So there'll be less of a negative from currency, but less of a positive from our commodity. So we don't have major differences among quarters in terms of how our COGS are to look. And that's how far we can go in terms of guidance at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful, thanks. Just to clarify, the BRL 1.93 on the hedge, does that kick in in the first quarter? Or is it safe to assume that given your activity, your period of nine months to 14 months that perhaps that starts to kick in more in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there would be a ramp-up so we're going to be, of course, below BRL 1.93 in Q1 and by year end, for instance, in Q4 we are going to be above BRL 1.93. So that will be the average is BRL 1.93 and it's growing in line with what we saw in the sports mix last year, as part of our hedging policy.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, everyone. My question's on product and brand mix. This morning, InBev spoke a lot about in Brazil in beer focusing on domestic and international premium brands. And I was hoping you could talk a bit more about that, with respect to skewing maybe more out of mainstream and into premium? And how directionally that's working for you? And as we think about margins and how that helps the bottom line, just curious, if volume growth maybe isn't that dynamic, is more of the upside coming more on the value end of the equation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Lauren, this is Jo&#xE3;o. We mentioned a couple of quarters ago, maybe a year ago that we thought we could double the size or the weight of the premium brands within the total portfolio. Distributors many years ago was five, then it declined to four with all the growth from mainstream in 2009 and 2010. So we went from four already to six within a year or a year-and-a-half. So we are pleased with the rapid growth. And we entered the fourth quarter even higher. Therefore, we think we are &#x2013; we've been on our way up doubling from four to eight within three years to four years. So that's the first good news.</p>
          <p>With both international and domestic growing in the &#x2013; trading up from consumer, it's very broad from the volume equation, but also it's been very positive from the total macro perspective, with greater macro for most part, and, therefore, already having a positive impact both in net turnover per hectoliter and also macro. But even greater, which I think is more important, as the day on the total macro. So great combination of pricing and volume and developing stronger brands along the way, giving a positive upside, current and perspective upside on total macro for the next couple of years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But should I interpret that as we'd see the lift from mix becoming more substantial over time rather than just driving pricing, absolute price increases in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Lauren, it's Nelson here. That's exactly the point when we guide, for instance, for our high single digit growth for top line. Part of this is pure pricing, what we normally do to manage inflation, but the upside normally comes from either direct distribution increase, but strongly now from premium brands growth as well. So that's ending on top of our inflation of our net revenue.</p>
          <p>I think it's important you add on what Jo&#xE3;o just mentioned. We are going so well with Budweiser, for instance, that we are going to open up for a new brewery to produce Budweiser in Brazil. That's part of the BRL 3 billion CapEx that we announced. So we move it from in the beginning of year or in the end of 2011 for a more southeast and south sort of distribution. Now, at this stage, 2013, we are already opening up for the entire <mark type="ph" /> curve (55:10), of course, focusing on the main series. That's why we are going to be building our capacity by having Budweiser in another brewery as of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could ask just one other question. I know you can't be specific on M&amp;A, but obviously ABI going after Modelo and you having done CND, opportunities maybe in other markets outside of Brazil for you. Is there anything worth talking about or looking at at this point that as we think about consolidation in other parts of Latin America you'd be able and willing to engage in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I think we said in the other question, there are no comments on inorganic, but we've been I think the same acquisition shows that we continue to be very active south of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:56). I still think there's a lot of things to be done, but no specific comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. In the outlook statement, when you're talking about expecting a record year of capital expenditures, you have a little hedge in terms of subject to the level of federal excise taxes. Is there any particular reason for putting that in? Is there anything going on, on the excise tax side that would indicated any new issues there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no new news. It's something that we have always said and we continue to say so. I mean what I think we look for in 2013 is a stability. And we believe this stability will be in place and given that the stability and given that we look at 2013 as a very strong year we would rather say that what we think, what's out there is what's going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's good news. And the other line that I'd like a little clarification on, when you're talking about Brazil COGS for the quarter you noted that you had a higher than expected results of higher than anticipated mix of more expensive one-way volumes. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Why it was higher than expected, what the various drivers were there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean specifically for the &#x2013; the comment regarding fourth quarter, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the point here is what we have done in the past four years was really strengthening a lot, not just our returnable glass bottle business but also trying to enhance also the consumer experience at the bar. We see, I mean <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:03), micro events, those are all ways for you to have even a better consumer experience. They are for the people who go out of their place and meet their friends, it's the usual occasion in Brazil, for that to happen.</p>
          <p>I think in especially the past four years, that's not true for 2009 and 2010. I think 2009 and 2010, we did a good combination of RGB in one way and then in 2011 and 2012 we focused much, much more on the RGB. I think a fine-tuning, a little bit of a fine-tuning on that was also to go back to the end.</p>
          <p>So we intend to grow very strong, even stronger behind the RGB and the consumption occasion at the bar. Also introducing more RGBs in the off-trade through the pit stop and also now with the convenience pit stops but giving some room for the off trade also to grow &#x2013; sorry, for the one way also to grow. That's why I mean. By just putting &#x2013; you remember that we were able to postpone the taxes from the fourth quarter to April and then also moving from four years to six years.</p>
          <p>We mentioned that we were going to put some of that money that was postponed back in the market place and we saw that we saw more opportunities off the one way to go and we let it happen. And by that we learned how to better execute the one way a little bit better and therefore we see also opportunities in the one way going forward. And also remember that in occasions, such as World Cup and Confederations Cup, many times it's desirable and sometimes it's the law for you to sell one way presentations rather than glass presentations. So for that, we are also making sure that we have the right footprint also for the one ways going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. And just a follow-up on that, how pleased are you with the rollout of the 300 at this point? Are there any metrics around that, that you can discuss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean we are seeing the &#x2013; everything that we wanted to happen in 2012 happened. Well first, in terms of total volume, if you want. So I mean we got to 2 million hectoliters. We got to the coverage where we want it to be. The coverage was &#x2013; we're looking more towards off-trade than the on-trade.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we have already also approved new lines and new plans in new parts of the country. So I don't want to give too much information because they are sensitive and confidential. But very pleased and it actually is one of those things that it helps you in volume, pricing, and share. And you don't find many of these all the time. So when you find them, you better execute them well and rapidly.</p>
